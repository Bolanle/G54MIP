&lt;p&gt;IBM has issued layoff notices to more than 400 workers, according to the Alliance@IBM/CWA Local 1701 , an employee organization that has been the principal source of layoff information at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alliance's online job cuts board was abuzz today with news from employees, all anonymous, who had received layoff notices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alliance gets some of the paperwork involved in the layoffs and can typically pinpoint the number of job cuts. The layoff count is expected to grow beyond 400, said Lee Conrad, national coordinator of the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM never comments on its job actions other than to say, as it did today, that it is a result of a remixing of "our skills and structure to meet the changing needs of our clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conrad blames the cuts on a shift to offshore work. IBM has been reducing its U.S. workforce -- according to latest available numbers the company now employs 105,000 U.S. workers, versus 115,000 a year ago. It has been increasing its percentage of overseas employees .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company employs about 400,000 globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees may be eventually be eligible for help under the Trade Act of 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a notice published last month in the Federal Register, the U.S. Department Labor said that IBM global services employees who were laid off in an earlier job action are eligible for assistance under the act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That help kicks in based on a number of trade-connected issues, including "a shift by the workers' firm to a foreign country in the production of articles or supply of services like or directly competitive with those produced/supplied by the workers' firm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Thibodeau covers SaaS and enterprise applications, outsourcing, government IT policies, data centers and IT workforce issues for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new browser ballot screen, which is supposed to randomly scramble the positions of the top five browsers, instead gives Google's Chrome the best chance of landing in the preferred first spot, an IBM software architect said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was a rookie mistake," said Rob Meir, who works for IBM and has a degree in astrophysics from Harvard University. "I was definitely surprised to see an error of this type [in the ballot]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The browser ballot, which began to show today in the Windows Update queues of European users, was mandated by an agreement Microsoft reached last year with European Union antitrust regulators, nearly two years after Norwegian browser maker Opera filed a formal complaint. The ballot appears on Windows PCs where Internet Explorer (IE) is set as the default browser, and lets users download and install rivals, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the deal Microsoft struck with antirust officials last December, the ballot screen is to scramble the order of the top five browsers, a change from an earlier Microsoft idea that browser order would be alphabetical by maker. Several rivals blasted that plan because Apple 's Safari, which has a very small share of the Windows browser market, would get the favored first position at the far left. "These five web browsers will be displayed in random order each time the Choice Screen is presented," stated the agreements that Microsoft and the European Commission signed ( download Word document )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weir said that the randomizing process in the ballot was flawed. "They fell into a well-known trap," he said in an interview today. "This doesn't randomly shuffle the positions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft failed to use an established random shuffle algorithm -- think of it as the shuffling of a virtual card deck, said Weir -- and instead made what he called a "rookie" mistake of sorting an array with a custom-defined comparison function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[This] is more in the nature of a 'naive algorithm,' like the bubble sort, that inexperienced programmers inevitably will fall upon when solving a given problem," Weir explained in a long entry to this personal blog on Saturday. "I bet if we gave this same problem to 100 freshmen computer science majors, at least one of them would make the same mistake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What surprised Weir was that the mistake wasn't caught. "For an error like this to happen, all it takes is one person to make a rookie mistake. But for it not to be caught..., that shows it's a process problem. So you can't blame this on just one person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether the ballot order was actually random, Weir replicated tests first done by the Slovakian technology site DSL.sk , which was first reported in the U.S. by TechCrunch . Weir took the randomizing JavaScript code from the ballot Microsoft posted on browserchoice.eu , added some test driver code and ran it 10,000 times in Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like DSL.sk, Weir found that Chrome was more likely than any other of the top five browsers to show up in the first three spots on the ballot, that IE had the least chance of any to grab one of the first four positions, and that 50% of the time IE appeared in the fifth spot at the far right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefox, meanwhile has a smaller chance of getting the first spot than does Opera, a browser that has about one-tenth the browser usage share of Mozilla's application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fix is relatively simple, said Weir, who spelled out his recommendation in the blog post. By using the Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm, Microsoft would actually randomize browser position in the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today declined to answer questions, saying that it had not yet tested or examined Weir's findings. For the record, a spokeswoman said, "In accordance with our agreement with the EC and the ballot vendors, the ballot screen results are based on a code that randomly generates the results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission did not reply to questions about the randomization of the ballot and whether officials there would investigate Weir's claims or require Microsoft to revamp the ballot. By the terms of the agreement, Microsoft promised to make changes to the ballot when asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This flaw means that you're not going to get random results," concluded Weir. "I am astonished that the bug got as far as it did. This should have been caught far earlier, by Microsoft, before this ballot screen was ever made public."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weir has posted the HTML file used for his tests ; users can run the test by entering an iteration count. He cautioned, however, that different browsers would generate different results. To most accurately mimic the actual ballot, his HTML file should be run with IE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;With 170,000 customers, including every member of the Fortune 100, you might think VMware's toughest task is stocking enough paper to print up new customer contracts. But the industry's biggest x86 virtualization vendor is facing a strong challenge from Microsoft, which is enticing IT executives with Hyper-V, an alternative that may not be quite as sophisticated as VMware but is less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware says Microsoft 'shenanigans' led to new VMworld restrictions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2010 will be a crucial year for both VMware and Microsoft in the virtualization race. Here is a list of five things VMware and its CEO -- former Microsoft executive Paul Maritz -- have to do to stay ahead of their biggest rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Cut prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there's one major complaint customers and analysts have about VMware, it's that prices are too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you going to spend five times the cost [of Microsoft]?" asks Burton Group analyst Chris Wolf. "Is it five times the features? Most folks, looking at their wallet, would say 'I don't think it is.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware has several different pricing schemes and the price each customer pays depends heavily on which version of the software they use and how many servers and workloads they have virtualized. According to a vSphere pricing document, "VMware vSphere Advanced" costs $2,245 for every processor, allowing up to 12 cores and 256GB of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware's management software, known as vCenter Server, costs $1,500 for three hosts, or $5,000 for unlimited hosts. Numerous add-ons sold by VMware can raise a customer's bill significantly. VMware offers a free version of its hypervisor, but with limited functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offers Hyper-V, including advanced features such as live migration, as a free download. Customers planning big virtualization deployments are likely to buy management tools as well, and Microsoft's Virtual Machine Manager costs $869 per physical server.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware has argued that its software can be less expensive than Microsoft's on a per-workload basis, because VMware achieves higher levels of virtual machine density on each physical server. VMware also offers a small business version of its hypervisor that starts at just $166 per CPU, says Bogomil Balkansky, VMware's vice president of product marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we've been doing over time is really stretching the range of capabilities that we offer and providing different price points," he says. "So far we think we do meet the needs of the different market segments we're trying to serve. We don't have any plans right now to adjust pricing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few, if any observers would claim that Microsoft's virtualization technology is better than VMware's today, but Microsoft has closed the gap significantly and for many customers that may be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the opinion of one customer who switched from VMware to Microsoft. Roger Johnson, technical lead for the enterprise systems group at Crutchfield, a consumer electronics retailer in Charlottesville, Va., says "cost was the biggest deciding factor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson says VMware's technology is sound, but he thinks VMware's insistence on charging significantly higher prices than the competition reflects an "egotistical mentality." Crutchfield was running VMware in 2008 but completely converted its virtualization deployment to Hyper-V, and is now running 225 Hyper-V virtual machines on 11 servers. The total Hyper-V investment came out to $10,000, but would have cost at least three times that much with VMware, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson is a former Microsoft employee, so he may not be the most unbiased observer. But even VMware customer Scott Lowe, CIO of Westminster College in Missouri, thinks it's time for VMware to lower the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an educational institution, Westminster College gets a discount "but it's still pretty expensive to license," Lowe says. "I think VMware is going to have to address the cost of their solution sooner rather than later to stay competitive with Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Improve security&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more data centers become virtualized, hackers are sure to take a closer look at hypervisors and try to identify vulnerabilities. Hypervisors have not yet become a central point of attack but in a recent interview Forrester Research analyst James Staten says he expects them to become a big target in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we've seen with other technologies, the point where they're almost ubiquitous in the market is when hackers go after them," Staten says. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware has stripped its hypervisor down to a 32MB software package with 200,000 lines of code, presenting a relatively small attack surface to hackers. The company also announced a program two years ago to open its hypervisor to security vendors with a set of APIs making it easier to protect virtual machines, but VMware has not moved fast enough on this front in the eyes of some observers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some vendors say the APIs present performance problems making them difficult to use, as Network World reported in December.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not using the VMware APIs today due to performance," says Richard Park, senior product manager at SourceFire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMsafe has been adopted by vendors including Altor Networks, Reflex, IBM ISS and Trend Micro, so the SourceFire concerns are not universal. There are security problems beyond VMsafe, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vSphere, VMware released what it calls vShield Zones that let customers create zones in which security policies are enforced even when virtual machines move from one server to another. But this software doesn't integrate with VMware's Distributed Resource Scheduler, a load balancing product, Wolf notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VMware's load-balancing framework does not respect security zones created with vShield Zones, and its capacity management tool (CapacityIQ) does not account for zoning," Wolf writes in a recent report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The left hand has to know what the right hand is doing," Wolf says in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Win the desktop war&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desktop virtualization is in the plans of many big companies, opening up big revenue opportunities for VMware and its competitors. Citrix, a tight partner of Microsoft, is making a strong push into this market with XenDesktop, which aims to deliver high-definition desktops to nearly any type of device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware should have a built-in advantage in pursuing desktop customers, because many of them are already using VMware's hypervisor. But many companies that use VMware's server technology have opted for Citrix on the desktop. In fact, many Citrix virtual desktop customers are using VMware ESX servers to host the desktops.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of VMware's latest moves on the desktop front was to upgrade VMware View with the PC-over-IP protocol (PCoIP), a server-centric system designed to provide great-looking desktops even to users suffering from low bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Citrix delivers desktops in high definition with its HDX technology, and VMware is struggling to convince customers that its own PCoIP is a better alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowe of Westminster College is planning a VMware View desktop deployment but is concerned about VMware's ability to deliver multimedia, including Flash applications. "They need to make sure the desktop experience closely mimics a physical desktop experience," Lowe says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balkansky says PCoIP is "a big step forward" but stops short of saying that it does the job as well as Citrix. In desktop virtualization, he says, "there is always this tendency to try to boil things down to a single feature and a single silver bullet, and the truth is that there is no single bullet or single feature that is make-or-break."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware still has work to do to integrate PCoIP with WAN accelerators like Riverbed's appliance, Wolf says, and give users more options for connecting to desktops. For example, some government users want the ability to connect to a desktop with just a Web browser, without having to install software on a local machine, but have run into roadblocks with VMware on that front, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Simplify management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network director John Turner of Brandeis University in Massachusetts loves virtualization -- but he's puzzled by some of its quirks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, users on virtual machines experienced a major slowdown, and at first Turner's network team couldn't figure out what was going on. It turned out all of the Windows systems running in VMware virtual machines were set to receive updates at the same time, but VMware's management tools didn't provide notice that this was going to occur or that it might cause strain on storage and other systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, he says, is that VMware makes it very easy to deploy virtual machines in large quantities -- an issue often referred to as "VM sprawl" -- but it's not easy to diagnose potential performance problems before they occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a performance or tuning perspective, as folks grow their VMware installations they're running into issues," Turner says. It's not that VMware doesn't provide diagnostics tools, it's just that they're only good if you're an expert in using them, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Either VMware needs to prevent you from growing to the point of that kind of installation, or they need to provide very simple diagnostic tools to help you understand what's going on," Turner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Virtualization management is really crucial," says Laura DiDio, lead analyst with Information Technology Intelligence. "Simplifying things with respect to management and interoperability is going to be important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft and Citrix grow significantly in popularity, VMware may also be forced to manage multiple hypervisors. So far, VMware has insisted Microsoft and Citrix aren't used by enough customers to justify the expense of adapting VMware's management tools to multi-hypervisor environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's System Center Virtual Machine Manager is capable of managing virtual machines created both with Microsoft's Hyper-V platform and VMware's ESX hypervisor, and Citrix provides management capabilities for both Citrix XenServer and Hyper-V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say many data center pros are installing multiple hypervisors, rather than VMware only. If this trend continues, the willingness of Microsoft and Citrix to manage multiple types of virtualization platforms may give them a leg up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware has built up a long list of partners to enhance its own technology, but so has Microsoft, Wolf says. Switching workloads from Citrix to Hyper-V is also easier than switching workloads from VMware to a competing platform, he says. That's because VMware is the only vendor using the Virtual Machine Disk Format, rather than Microsoft's Virtual Hard Disk format, according to Wolf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the big picture, Microsoft is going after VMware with a -- dare I say it -- more open platform," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Balkansky, the disk format and multi-hypervisor management issues are low on the list of customer concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balkansky says he recently spent a week meeting with customers and "those questions didn't come up a single time in a week of customer visits. &#8230; What does come up is, as customers deepen and extend the virtualization footprint, there is a need to manage that extensive virtual footprint in a more scalable, automated and disciplined fashion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Don't overhype the cloud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly every IT vendor is hopping on the "cloud computing" bandwagon, attaching the word cloud to any product that might remotely be related to cloud computing. VMware has made some not-so-subtle shifts in this direction, calling its main virtualization platform a "cloud operating system." And while VMware used to refer to itself as "the global leader in virtualization solutions from the desktop to the data center," the company now calls itself "the global leader in virtualization solutions from the desktop through the datacenter and to the cloud." The expansive title appears in the first sentence of every press release VMware issues these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware's marketing also focuses heavily on its "vCloud" program, which seeks to build a lineup of partners that offer cloud computing services based on the VMware hypervisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pushing public cloud services -- that is, on-demand computing services delivered to customers from remote data centers -- VMware risks losing sight of its core goal of helping customers build out their internal data centers, Wolf says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've spent a lot of time harping on the public cloud, but the typical organization today is building out a private cloud and looking at IT automation internally, as opposed to putting corporate assets on the Internet," Wolf says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiDio adds that "I don't think there will be this stampede to the cloud. However, there are a lot of organizations looking at implementing private clouds. Clearly, cloud computing and virtualization go hand in hand. Anything VMware can do to help train customers and send out an explicit message helps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balkansky says VMware is trying to help customers build internal cloud networks that connect seamlessly to public clouds, but says VMware is still making the private data center its main focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We haven't taken our eye off the ball by any means," Balkansky says. "First and foremost, our goal is to help customers build a private cloud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about data center in Network World's Data Center section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering on Monday a second beta release of its Windows Server AppFabric technology, which features services intended to improve speed, scale and management of Web, composite and enterprise applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beta is available at Microsoft's Web site. Windows Server AppFabric makes it easier to build and manage Web and composite applications running on the Windows IIS (Internet Information Services) Web server, according to Microsoft. The technology has benefitted early users by providing increased performance, simplified development and management, and improved availability and reliability for "demanding" applications, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Last week, InfoWorld's Paul Krill reported on Microsoft's priorities for application development technologies. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AppFabric combines the former Dublin and Velocity technologies for hosting and caching with the Windows Azure AppFabric Service Bus and AppFabric Access Control, which had been known as .Net Services. AppFabric also is featured as part of the Windows Azure cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Server AppFabric features distributed in-memory caching and replication, working with ASP.Net applications. It also offers pre-built applications and can be used with Visual Studio tools and the .Net Framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general release of AppFabric is expected by the third quarter of this year. Windows Server AppFabric was announced at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft offers second beta of Windows Server AppFabric," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

In a recent podcast, Michael Elliot, CEO of Atrium Research &amp; Consulting LLC
discussed optimizing data management processes: 

"Users can sometimes underestimate the importance of workflow analysis in the
lab environment when evaluating new informatics technologies. Combine this with
the wide variety of software tools used by scientists and lack of standard
naming conventions across departments, there are a number of resultant
integration challenges, not the least of which is the level of change management
required. A process for change management is essential for achieving a
successful project outcome."

&lt;p&gt;A war of words is heating up between Google, Microsoft and a host of smaller sites over alleged anticompetitive behavior by Google in the online search market.  A variety of news outlets and blogs are reporting on allegations that Microsoft may be engaging in a proxy war against Google, using smaller companies to fight its battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Allegations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent blog post, Google discussed Microsoft's ties to two European Websites that have filed antitrust complaints against Google with the European Commission. Although the search giant did not come out and accuse Microsoft of having a hand in the complaints, the implication that Microsoft was somehow involved was broadly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Goldman, an Associate Professor of Law at Santa Clara University School of Law, has also written about an alleged Microsoft antitrust campaign against Google. Goldman pointed to the fact that two small U.S.-based companies -- MyTriggers and TradeComet -- hired the legal firm Cadwalader Wickersham  Taft LLP to represent their antitrust concerns against Google. Microsoft, Goldman said, is a longtime client of Cadwalader for antitrust issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look At Them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google may have been unwilling to accuse Microsoft of any behind-the-scenes shenanigans last week, but on Monday Google's allegations were a little more direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's become clear that our competitors are scouring court dockets around the world looking for complaints against Google into which they can inject themselves," a Google spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't Look At Us . . . Mostly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blog post on Friday, Dave Heiner, Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel, called Google out on its finger-pointing.  Heiner sticks to the issues, arguing that Microsoft is concerned about "Google practices that tend to lock in business partners and content (like Google Books) and exclude competitors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Heiner never really denies Microsoft's ties over current antitrust complaints against Google.  Instead, Heiner says some "concerned companies" have turned to Microsoft for advice in apparent antitrust issues against Google.  Microsoft's advice to these companies is to talk to the relevant competition law authorities when "antitrust concerns appear to be substantial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth pointing out, however, that Microsoft flatly denied to the Journal that it had orchestrated any antitrust complaints against Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vertical Search Is (Sometimes) Spam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the Internet search companies involved in the current antitrust complaints against Google -- Foundem and Ejustice.fr -- are both known as vertical search companies.  Vertical search basically means these sites are focused on content for a specific subject or category; Foundem is a price comparison shopping Website and Ejustice helps users find links to legal information in France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sites say they have been harmed financially, because of low and penalizing Google search rankings.  Google hasn't commented specifically on these cases, but the company did tell The New York Times it "penalizes some, but not all, vertical search engines because they are essentially spam."  Google's reasoning for penalizing some vertical search engines, according to the Times, is that the purpose of these sites is to collect "content and links from other sites to generate traffic and ad revenue." Funny thing is, that sounds a lot like what Google does too, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do you say? Is Microsoft orchestrating a campaign against Google, or does the search giant need more oversight from antitrust regulators?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect with Ian on Twitter (@ianpaul) or on Google Buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/190401&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will install a plug-in for its Outlook 2010 e-mail application for Xing, a large professional networking site dominant in Germany, the companies said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plug-in will allow Outlook users to see messages, status updates and other information via Outlook without the need to use a Web browser. It effectively makes Outlook a front end for interacting with Xing, as a person's colleagues can be directly contacted through the application. Microsoft contends that helps users save time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xing plug-in is part of Microsoft's Outlook Social Connector, which is a set of features that allow for close integration with social-networking sites. Microsoft already has an agreement with LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the plug-in, users can see photographs of people they have contacts with. Outlook also synchronizes contacts from each social network with its own address book and users' mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xing says it has about 8 million [m] users in 200 countries. Users can create a free account, and Xing also runs paid services such as job advertisements, recruiting and other kinds of advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xing plug-in will be available when Microsoft releases Outlook 2010, expected in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * To pay 100 pct of first year's revenue on 2-year contract&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Part of bid to expand network of external resellers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, March 1 (Reuters) - NetSuite Inc (N.N), which makes
Web-based business accounting programs, is offering software
resellers commissions to promote its products over those ofbigger rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NetSuite, majority-owned by Oracle Corp ORCL.O Chief
Executive Larry Ellison, said it will give software resellers
in North America commissions equal to 100 percent of the first
year's revenue on new contracts when they sell two-year
subscriptions to its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Resellers will receive 10 percent of annual revenue in
subsequent years, NetSuite Chief Executive Zach Nelson said in
an interview on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company currently pays resellers an annual commission
of 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We wanted to do something much more aggressive," Nelson
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move is part of NetSuite's drive to compete against
Microsoft, which offers a rival line of accounting software for
small-to-mid sized companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NetSuite employs 130 sales reps and works with about 200
outside resellers. Nelson estimated that Microsoft has 1,000 to
2,000 companies reselling its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of NetSuite's products are hosted at the software
maker's data center and delivered to customer's via the
Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has traditionally sold accounting programs that
are installed on computers inside the customer's own data
center, though it has started selling web-based software in
recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nelson said that he will recruit resellers from companies
that currently sell Microsoft programs.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, long in the doghouse with frustrated investors, is winning attention from some of the savviest hedge funds thanks to high-tech drugs and vaccines that it got when it paid $68 billion for Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Wyeth's lucrative biotech products could offset much of the long-expected plunge in sales of Pfizer's (PFE.N) $12 billion-a-year Lipitor cholesterol pill, which faces generic competition late next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may take years for these potential new hits to reach the market, early test results could give the stock a boost over the next 18 months, analysts and investors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considered cheap, high yielding and unloved on Wall Street for most of the last decade, shares of the world's largest drugmaker have gone nowhere. Trading at almost $50 a share in 2000, the stock sits at $17.55 today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Wyeth acquisition, which closed in October, has grabbed the attention of hedge fund stars including John Paulson, Christopher Shumway, David Einhorn and Michael Karsch. They were among 11 of the 30 largest equity-oriented hedge funds buying shares of Pfizer in the fourth quarter, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis of recent securities filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including several funds that bought stakes earlier, 14 out of 30 funds in the group owned the stock at the end of the quarter, making Pfizer one of the most popular companies with the smart money set. The total $1.8 billion worth of shares owned places the company as the 13th biggest bet in the group's combined equity portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investments represent a big bet on Pfizer Chief Executive Jeffrey Kindler, the company's former general counsel. A Washington lawyer who worked for McDonald's and General Electric, Kindler has not had much good news since taking over the top job in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also a bet on the future of the Pfizer-Wyeth drug pipeline, investors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're not going to really grow earnings much over the next couple of years because of patent expirations," including on Wyeth's blockbuster Effexor treatment for depression, said Russell Croft, portfolio manager of Baltimore-based asset manager Croft-Leominster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Croft, a longtime holder of Pfizer who is adding to his stake, said the drugmaker is a standout in terms of value, but it requires patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're looking for good results from late-stage trials of new drugs and for earnings growth to kick in in 2013 and 2014," Croft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRIALS AND TESTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's experimental drugs include treatments for Alzheimer's disease, cancer, pain and diabetes. Six vaccines and 27 biotech drugs -- complex injectable proteins that target other proteins linked to diseases -- are being tested. That's up from one vaccine and 16 biologics before the Wyeth merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of the drugs are years away from bringing in revenue to boost the bottom line, results from a half dozen trials and tests due in 2010 and 2011 could get the stock moving, according to a report by analysts at Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just last week, the Food and Drug Administration approved Pfizer's Prevnar 13 vaccine for use on infants. Results from advanced Phase III trials on adults may come later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Pfizer needs to clear numerous other hurdles to reverse its fortunes, following years of declining sales and earnings, and a decade-long failure to produce big drugs despite industry-topping research budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares trade at 8.1 times Pfizer's expected 2010 per-share earnings, a 20 percent discount to the American Stock Exchange ARCA Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of large drugmakers -- illustrating worries that the drugmaker is not up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Pfizer's dividend, with an annual yield of 4 percent, is placating many investors as they envision a return of the double-digit annual earnings growth that ended after Pfizer used up huge cost savings from earlier acquisitions of U.S. rivals Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's concerted push into China and other emerging markets with its branded and generic drugs is also luring investors, according to Bill Smead, portfolio manager of the Smead Value Fund. With growing prosperity, many patients are already paying out of pocket for the Pfizer name rather than risk taking less-costly alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Smead said most large drugmakers are undervalued and he has even greater enthusiasm for Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) and Merck  Co (MRK.N) -- which many analysts think now has the industry's best drug pipeline thanks to its recent purchase of Schering-Plough Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of OakBrook Investments, said Pfizer shares are attractive, but cautioned that they are far from a sure thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still a lot of risk, including potential health care legislation that has held back the whole pharmaceutical sector," Jankovskis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical industry had cut a deal with the Obama administration to limit its pain in the overhaul. But with reform legislation in a state of limbo, no one can be sure the deal will hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another problem could arise if Pfizer's returns from its emerging market spending binge badly trail its margins in the lucrative U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company has to invest wisely, and it's difficult to sort that out from the outside," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a bet that the smart money seems willing to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson.

&lt;p&gt;Stunning Fall from Grace for Former High-Level U.S. Government Official; Law
Enforcement Probes of Chevron in Two Countries
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Chevron`s curt announcement last week that former general counsel Charles James
is set to retire is due largely to his mishandling of the oil giant`s "legal and
public relations disaster" over a potential $27 billion environmental liability
in Ecuador, representatives of the Amazon Defense Coalition (ADC) said today. 

The departure of James, known as a hard-right ideologue who worked in the
Department of Justice under John Ashcroft, follows the surprise retirement of
CEO David O`Reilly last year. Both James and O`Reilly were running the Ecuador
legal case when it ballooned into a major public relations disaster and a
potential $27 billion liability that threatens to eat up one-fifth of Chevron`s
market value. 

During his tenure, James ran into numerous problems with law enforcement
authorities. In 2007, Chevron was forced to pay a $30 million fine to the U.S.
Department of Justice because of a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act in Iraq. The company also was rebuked by the U.S. Department of the Interior
for failing to cooperate with a corruption probe involving Chevron employees.
Separately, two Chevron lawyers working closely with James on the Ecuador case
were indicted for lying about the results of a purported environmental clean-up.


James also is being investigated by Ecuador`s national prosecutor after he and
other Chevron lawyers engineered a "sting" operation against an Ecuadorian judge
to undermine and delay the environmental trial. The man who conducted the sting
had ties to Chevron and was caught on tape offering a bribe. 

James, 56, is taking an adjunct faculty position at the law school of Arizona
State University. In an interview, he said he planned to focus on charitable
work and tinkering with his motorcycles; Chevron`s press release on the
departure was only three paragraphs compared to nine when he was hired amid
great fanfare in 2004. 

Representatives of the ADC, which is suing Chevron in Ecuador for the deliberate
dumping of billions of gallons of toxic waste onto their ancestral lands in the
rainforest, called the departure of James a "stunning fall from grace." 

"Charles James masterminded a legal and public relations strategy for Chevron in
Ecuador to hide contamination that is destroying lives, decimating indigenous
culture, and devastating the company`s reputation globally," said Pablo Fajardo,
the lead lawyer in the case for the plaintiffs in Ecuador and the winner of the
Goldman Environmental Prize, considered the "Nobel" of the environment. 

"James created a culture of permissiveness and excessive risk-taking that
permeates Chevron`s legal department to this day," he added. 

The plaintiffs filed the class action lawsuit in U.S. federal court in 1993,
alleging that Texaco deliberately discharged more than 18 billion gallons of
"production water" into the rainforest to cut costs when it operated a large oil
concession from 1964 to 1990. Chevron purchased Texaco in 2001 for $31 billion. 

Texaco and then Chevron had argued in the U.S. court that the case should be
tried in Ecuador, submitting 14 sworn affidavits praising the fairness and
competency of that country`s courts. Chevron also stipulated that it would
submit to jurisdiction and abide by any judgment in Ecuador. 

As a result of Chevron`s representations, the case was transferred to Ecuador
where a trial began in 2003 that produced evidence that quickly pointed to the
oil giant`s culpability. 

Given the troubling evidence, James abdicated on Chevron`s earlier promises to
the U.S. court and hired six public relations firms and numerous lobbyists to
discredit Ecuador`s judicial system. Chevron also lobbied the U.S. government to
cancel Ecuador`s trade preferences as punishment for letting its own citizens
sue Chevron in their courts, despite Chevron`s earlier promise that it wanted
the trial in Ecuador. 

Chevron`s lobbying failed to cancel the trade preferences, but not before 26
congressmen signed a letter protesting the strategy. Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-CA)
accused the oil giant of "extortion." 

In addition to losing control of the Ecuador trial, James has entangled Chevron
in a series of embarrassing situations that have angered institutional
shareholders. Among his questionable calls:

* Chevron in 2004 launched what turned out to be a fruitless three-year
litigation odyssey to force Ecuador`s government to pay for the Ecuador
clean-up. In a stunning rebuke, a New York federal judge rejected Chevron`s bid.
An appeals court affirmed the decision and the U.S. Supreme Court denied
Chevron`s petition for review. 
* In 2008, after refusing multiple opportunities to settle the case, Chevron was
hit with a damages assessment in Ecuador`s court for $27.3 billion. The company
had to stave off virtual shareholder revolts over the liability at the last two
annual meetings. 
* In July 2009, James suffered another setback when Chevron voluntarily withdrew
a claim before a U.S. federal court that its legal release - secured by fraud,
according to the plaintiffs - absolved of it all clean-up responsibility.
Chevron apparently was worried it would lose in a U.S. court where it could not
claim it was the victim of bias. 
* In Ecuador, James oversaw a bungled legal strategy where the company`s local
counsel produced soil samples that demonstrated the existence of high levels of
contamination at former Texaco sites - essentially proving the claims of the
communities, according to a court-appointed independent Special Master. 
* James` strategy also caused severe damage to Chevron`s brand. Despite hiring
large public relations firms such as Hill &amp; Knowlton and Edelman Worldwide,
Chevron was embarrassed repeatedly last year with unflattering reports on the
Ecuador issue on 60 Minutes and in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times,
Washington Post, Politico and in various oil industry trade publications.

"Charles James is a formidable adversary but he led Chevron down a path of
unnecessary confrontation," said Steven Donziger, a U.S. legal advisor to the
plaintiffs. "His ideological blinders distorted his judgment and played into the
hands of the rainforest communities. No amount of Chevron spin can cover up the
humanitarian catastrophe in Ecuador due to the company`s failure to take
responsibility for its actions." 

Fajardo added: "It appeared to me that James grossly underestimated the
determination of thousands of Ecuadorians and as a result Chevron shareholders
face legal risks that no other oil major in the world has on its books." 

"These risks, and the human suffering in Ecuador`s rainforest, will define the
legacy of James," Fajardo added.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) board has rejected demands from shareholders that the firm investigate recent compensation awards, recoup excessive compensation and reform pay practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's dominant bank, criticized for paying billions of dollars in bonuses soon after the taxpayer bailout of the banking industry, reported the board's decision in a regulatory filing on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman reported the shareholder demands last year and said at the time that its board was considering them. The firm did not name the shareholders who made the demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman reported a record profit in 2009 and was on pace to pay more than $20 billion in compensation heading into the fourth quarter. But facing public ire, it capped compensation expenses at $16.2 billion for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm also paid its top 30 executives all-stock bonuses rather than cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Goldman outperformed its biggest rivals in 2009, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein received a stock bonus valued at $8.9 million, roughly half of what JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) chief Jamie Dimon received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp made its most vehement and public attack on Google Inc on Friday, calling its Internet rival's actions potentially anti-competitive, and urging victims to file complaints to regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broadside comes days after a Microsoft-owned business, along with two other small online companies, complained to European Union regulators about Google's operations there. Microsoft is also fighting a plan by Google to digitize millions of books, currently under scrutiny by the Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our concerns relate only to Google practices that tend to lock in business partners and content -- like Google Books -- and exclude competitors, thereby undermining competition more broadly," wrote Dave Heiner, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, in a blog published on the company's website on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately the competition law agencies will have to decide whether or not Google's practices should be seen as illegal," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google declined to comment on Microsoft's blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past two decades, Microsoft has been among the prime targets of competition regulators in the United States and Europe, over the way it handled its near monopoly of computer operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker now seems keen to direct regulatory scrutiny onto Google, by far the world's biggest Internet search company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As Google's power has grown in recent years, we've increasingly heard complaints from a range of firms -- large and small -- about a wide variety of Google business practices," wrote Heiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of the complaints just reflect aggressive business stances taken by Google. Some reflect the secrecy with which Google operates in many areas. Some appear to raise serious antitrust issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heiner said Google's way of working with advertisers and publishers makes it hard for Microsoft's competing Bing search engine to win search volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested firms who feel they have been hurt by Google should complain to "competition law agencies". The European Commission has not at this stage opened a formal inquiry into Google after it received complaints this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's attack is certain to heat up relations between the two companies, which now compete on a broad spectrum of technology products, from software applications and mobile phone systems to Internet search and e-mail programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

shows, music and games to consumers through kiosks in retail and other
out-of-home environments. Poole and Gerrity join MOD Systems` existing board
members Michael Towers and CEO Anthony Bay, along with board observers from NCR
Corporation (NYSE:NCR) and Toshiba Corporation. NCR and Toshiba are MOD Systems`
largest investors. 

"Building out our board is an important part of our strategy of bringing on
impressive senior talent across the organization at a time of great momentum and
anticipated growth," said Chairman and CEO Anthony Bay. "Both Will and Dan have
unmatched experience in our target industries, and in organizational development
and leadership. Both have built organizations from development stage to global
success, and their skills, styles and guidance are welcome additions to our
board. We`re fortunate to have them join us." 

Will Poole has a 25-year history of running large product development and
marketing organizations, and now is an independent social-technologist,
primarily focused on applying technology to education. He is currently
co-chairman of NComputing, which shipped its second millionth virtual desktop in
2009, deployed largely in schools in emerging markets. Previously, Poole served
as corporate vice president of the Unlimited Potential Group at Microsoft,
co-leading efforts to bring social and economic opportunity to the "next
billion." As senior vice president, Windows Client at Microsoft, Poole delivered
30 percent of corporate revenues and shipped multiple versions of Windows. He
also created New Media Platforms for Windows and led other internet and digital
media groups. Poole joined Microsoft in 1996 with the acquisition of eShop, an
internet e-commerce pioneer that he co-founded in 1991. Poole serves on the
boards of Pengala, the University of Washington`s I-LABS, and the Voices
Education Project. He received a degree in Computer Science from Brown
University and is co-chair of the Boldly Brown campaign for the Pacific
Northwest. 

"I have respected Anthony Bay's vision and leadership for a long time and am
pleased to be working with him again," said Poole. "He`s done a remarkable job
focusing MOD on a cleverly-blended technology and business strategy around
digital entertainment sales at retail. I`m impressed with the company`s focus,
partnerships, market opportunity and team, and I look forward to contributing to
their global success." 

Dan Gerrity is a seasoned technology executive with experience that spans
entrepreneurial genesis through IPO and emerging growth companies. He is
currently vice president of business development for Intellectual Ventures, a

technology expertise necessary for scale, impressive entertainment industry
relationships, and a thoughtful growth strategy. I`m pleased to serve the
company at this foundational juncture." 

With the new board appointments and expanded management team, Kyleen Cane
stepped down from the company`s board. Cane was a valued board member for 18
months, helping MOD Systems navigate through a critical transitional period.
"Kyleen has been a tremendous asset to the company, contributing an
extraordinary legal mind and business acumen, along with a great sense of
humor-all imperative qualities over this past year," said Bay. "We are fortunate
to have had Kyleen`s support in moving MOD to a position of strength and growth.
She will always be a great friend to the company and we wish her the very best."

&lt;p&gt;SEVEN to Directly Resell Windows Live Hotmail Services to Wireless Operators,
Enabling Faster Time to Market for Push Mobile Email Services
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In a move to further strengthen its offerings for mobile operators, SEVEN&#174;, the
global leader in push-enabled mobile email and messaging solutions for mass
market devices, today announces that it has joined the Microsoft Windows Live
Hotmail for Mobile Services Reseller Program. Under the terms of the SEVEN and
Microsoft Corp. global agreement, SEVEN is now able to directly resell Windows
Live Hotmail services to operators across the globe spanning more than 50
countries, including China, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Singapore, Thailand,
the United Kingdom and the United States. 

By being part of Microsoft`s reseller program, SEVEN gains direct access to
Microsoft resources, enabling SEVEN to streamline the process for wireless
operators worldwide by allowing operators to deal directly with SEVEN to deploy
Windows Live Hotmail services for their mobile subscribers. In addition,
operators benefit from a higher quality of service, better integration with
Microsoft Live Hotmail, and proactive management of changes on both sides.
Mobile subscribers will benefit from an improved experience on the device that
mirrors the Windows Live Hotmail experience on the desktop. 

"Everyday hundreds of millions of users rely on Microsoft`s suite of programs
and online services," said Ross Bott, President and CEO of SEVEN. "By becoming a
reseller for Windows Live Hotmail, we are enabling our customers worldwide to
tap into an established market with an already loyal customer base. This is
especially important for the hundreds of operators that are looking at avenues
to streamline the process between themselves and ISPs, all the while providing
the highest quality of push mobile email services to their customers." 

"As the world continues to become more mobile, it is important that we expand
the reach to our Windows Live customers with high-quality and convenient access
to their e-mail services in an un-tethered environment," said Andy Chu, Director
Windows Live for Mobile Services at Microsoft. "Working with SEVEN allows us to
deliver our e-mail services in a mobile environment through hundreds of mobile
operators and on hundreds of devices. We believe that this real-time,
all-the-time access will continue to drive customer loyalty and adoption." 

SEVEN`s inclusion in the Microsoft reseller program follows a long-term
relationship between the two companies. SEVEN was the first mobile messaging
vendor to deploy a Mobile Email client using the new MSP 3.0 protocol developed
by Microsoft, which enabled SEVEN to provide a full push email and contact
experience for Windows Live customers, including integration with the Microsoft
notification framework. Push mobile, including push email and instant messaging
services, is becoming increasingly important as operators look at ways to
increase user adoption and retention. 

Already, SEVEN has successfully certified hundreds of devices from a variety of
manufacturers with Windows Live Hotmail , including HTC, LG, Motorola, Nokia,
Samsung, and more.

&lt;p&gt;Industry`s Only Hosted Exchange Optimization Solution Increases Speed and
Reliability for Mobile Broadband Users, According to Mobile Monitoring Tests
GULF BREEZE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
AppRiver, LLC, a leading provider of e-mail messaging and Web security
solutions, today reported results of a performance evaluation using the mobile
performance monitoring testing solutions from Compuware Gomez. The Gomez data
showed a clear link between the AppRiver-Akamai relationship and AppRiver`s
unrivaled ability to provide businesses with fast, reliable hosted Microsoft
Exchange. In particular, the results demonstrated that AppRiver`s Akamai-enabled
hosted Exchange service can improve mobile e-mail performance by up to 50
percent. 

Interfering factors like Internet congestion and cell network issues can
negatively affect e-mail performance, impacting the demands of today`s
increasingly mobile workforce. AppRiver is the first Microsoft Exchange hosting
provider to embed the Akamai global distribution platform into its secure
service. As a result, AppRiver customers receive faster connectivity and more
reliable performance from both wireline and wireless business e-mail at no
additional cost. 

"After facing serious reliability issues with our previous Exchange hosting
provider, we switched in 2007 to AppRiver`s Exchange service and immediately saw
a remarkable difference," said Brett Corporon, systems architect at the Colorado
State Supreme Court. "With AppRiver, we have experienced no e-mail downtime. Our
staff attorneys can easily send and receive secure e-mail messages containing
confidential case information using their PCs or mobile devices." 

"AppRiver`s relationship with Akamai is an excellent example of how network
optimization can create a differentiated and improved IT service - in this case
hosted Exchange," said Peter Christy, principal analyst, Internet Research
Group. "By optimizing the connection from e-mail user to server, Akamai enables
AppRiver to deliver consistently fast, reliable service to customers. These
optimizations are completely transparent to the hosted e-mail user and
significantly improve the user`s experience, especially on longer connection
paths." 

Gomez`s mobile monitoring solution was used to test performance levels of
communication to AppRiver-enhanced mobile devices with, and without, Akamai
acceleration over U.S.-based mobile broadband networks. The series of tests
simulated users with identical login credentials, signing into their Exchange
accounts, and running through a typical Exchange transaction. Response times
were tracked at three designated U.S. mobile testing nodes (Boston, Chicago, and
Seattle) within each major U.S. cell carrier`s network. 

Key findings include: 

Speed and Reliability

* The amount of time it takes users to connect and sync with Exchange was
reduced by half when using the Akamai-enabled AppRiver Secure Hosted Exchange
solution. 
* Connection speeds degrade the further away a user is from the origin server,
leaving a network to lose up to 25 percent of data packets that transverse its
links, causing mobile devices to hang or lose connectivity. Since AppRiver is
not at the mercy of the Internet and its many bottlenecks, AppRiver customers
enjoy one-of-a-kind, optimized hosted Exchange. 
* AppRiver Exchange customers received clear, consistent e-mail delivery over a
variety of wireless networks, regardless of their location or what was happening
on the Internet.

The AppRiver-Akamai offering contributes to several strategic objectives for any
enterprise, including:

* Mobile worker support. Mobile device users receive secure, on-the-go access to
information, including e-mail, calendars and tasks. The AppRiver hosted Exchange
offering dramatically improves worker productivity by allowing for seamless
e-mail access, with no performance problems, regardless of how, or where, an
end-user checks their messages. 
* Secure e-mail delivery. AppRiver and Akamai privatize the connection between
the user and the Exchange server(s) in order to create a high-speed virtual
private network for AppRiver customers. The private network acts as a "secure
perimeter," which eliminates public entry points to cloud infrastructures.
AppRiver Exchange also provides the award-winning SecureTide Spam and Virus
Protection, keeping users safe from spam, viruses and other malicious threats.

"By implementing Akamai's IP Application Accelerator service, AppRiver securely
provides fast and reliable hosted e-mail for both wireline and mobile users,"
said Willie Tejada, vice president of application and site acceleration, Akamai.
"Akamai improves the overall global experience for mobile device users by
optimizing the Internet and minimizing the impact introduced by oversubscribed
wireless networks."

&lt;p&gt;The already heated online search war cranked up a notch in recent days as Google officials openly blamed Microsoft for triggering the European Commission's antitrust probe into its activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say that if true, Microsoft's decision to seek an EC antitrust investigation into Google activities would mark the latest move in its continuing effort to knock the high-riding search vendor down a peg or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EC announced late last month that it had launched an antitrust investigation of Google based on complaints from three firms, two with connections to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year or so, Microsoft has been spending a lot of money and development resources to capture some of Google's 60% share of the search market. But while the release of Microsoft's Bing search engine last summer did garner a lot of attention, Google still maintains the dominant position it has held in the search market for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Microsoft appears to be taking a different route -- creating a legal storm that would distract Google officials and keep them from focusing on the future of the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Against Google's level of control," any effort to compete directly in the search business "could take [Microsoft] a lot of years and a massive investment," said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group. "This approach [using legal means to distract Google] potentially shortens their time and the investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The disparity in market share is simply too large for them to close the gap unless Google makes a massive sustained mistake or is hit by a successful antitrust action," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whit Andrews, an analyst at Gartner Inc., said it's no surprise that the Microsoft-Google battle would enter a new realm, in this case the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that search is the most important crossroads in the history of information," Andrews said. "I expect the striving conflict among the most powerful companies and countries in the world to intensify."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a conference call with journalists last week, Julia Holtz, Google's top antitrust lawyer, blamed Microsoft for sparking the probe. "Microsoft is our competitor, and that explains many actions," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that the three companies whose complaints triggered the investigation included Ciao, a German company acquired by Microsoft in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ciao [was] a long-time AdSense partner of Google's, with whom we always had a good relationship," Holtz said in a blog post. "However, after Microsoft acquired Ciao in 2008, we started receiving complaints about our standard terms and conditions. They initially took their case to the German competition authority, but it now has been transferred to Brussels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also noted that a second complainent, Foundem, a U.K. price comparison site, is a member of of a trade group called iComp , which is largely funded by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French legal search engine ejustice.fr was the third company whose complaint against Google is under investigation by the EC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft responded to Holtz' charge by contending that Google responded to the EC investigation by pointing fingers rather than answering the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Heiner, vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft, added in a blog post that "Google hasn't been shy about raising antitrust concerns about Microsoft in the last few years. Ultimately what's important is not who is complaining, but whether or not the challenged practices are anticompetitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enderle noted that in the past, Microsoft frequently complained that rivals like Oracle Corp., Sun Microsoystems Inc. and Google were behind antitrust probes that targeted its actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuart Williams, an analyst with Technology Business Research, said users shouldn't assume that Microsoft's apparent legal challenge to Google indicates that it's decided that Bing is not up to the challenge of taking on the search giant. It simply means that Microsoft is using all the tools in its arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both vendors have strong search technologies; the cases are not indications that either is throwing in the towel," said Williams. "Large corporations can fight in the market as well as in the courtroom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts do note that no matter who prompted the antitrust investigation, Google should prepare itself for the legal challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you think about it, the validity of the charge should be based on the validity and substance of the evidence, not on whether a large competitor brought it to the enforcement agency's attention," said Enderle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is a natural progression. Google's should have been to anticipate that the fight they helped start with Microsoft would likely come back to haunt them. It's like firing a nuclear bomb with the belief that the other side won't turn around and use it against you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antitrust action appears to be the latest battele in an escalating battle between Google and Microsoft on several fronts, from enterprise applications to operating systems and now especially to the burgeoning search market .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nancy Gohring and Paul Meller of the IDG News Service, contributed to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp Chief Executive Jim Dolan blasted Walt Disney Co's "bullying" threat to pull ABC from its cable systems over a contract dispute, calling the move senseless and one that invites questions from U.S. regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his first public remarks about the intensifying fight, Dolan said, "Fundamental to this issue right now is our subscribers, our customers, should not have to pay for something others are getting for free."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolan said discussions between the two sides only began in earnest several weeks ago, disputing Disney's statement that little progress has been made during some two years of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea that they are going to pull their signal .... I don't think that that's good business. I think that it invites scrutiny from the governmental side and, to be honest, I don't really understand it because we're negotiating," Dolan said on Tuesday at a Morgan Stanley conference in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would have thought they would have taken a more diplomatic stance," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolan's comments come in response Disney's announcement that ABC has begun running on-air messages to Cablevision subscribers warning them they may no longer have access to the network from Sunday, March 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cablevision on Monday said ABC was threatening to remove the network unless Cablevision and its customers pay $40 million in new fees for programing that it offers for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the matter on Tuesday said the $40 million was an overstatement by Cablevision, and that negotiations between the two companies were ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC's shows include "Lost," "Grey's Anatomy" and "Desperate Housewives" as well as news programs like "Good Morning America."

&lt;p&gt;A new security advisory from Microsoft warns about a risk involving any version of Internet Explorer on Windows 2000 and Windows XP that can allow a malicious Web site to infiltrate your PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability, detailed in an advisory put out yesterday, allows a specially crafted site to essentially reach through Internet Explorer using VBScript to access "inherently unsafe" Windows Help files, according to a Microsoft Security Research  Defense post. An attack would display a dialog box that pushed you to hit F1, which is required to complete the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to US-Cert, an attack could come from a Web page, an HTML e-mail or an e-mail attachment, as long as Internet Explorer was used to display the file (IE's engine is often used to render HTML for other applications, even if you don't see the usual IE program window). Windows Server 2003 is affected as well, but the default IE configuration mitigates the threat. Windows Vista, Server 2008 and Windows 7 are not affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you happen across a site that displays a message box that won't go away that exhorts you to hit F1, log off or use the Windows Task manager to close IE. Also, if you're comfortable working on the Windows command line, the MSRC post offers a command that can "lock down the legacy Windows Help system" to prevent it from loading and guard against this threat (all typed on one line):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to reverse the change:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post also lists more standard workarounds, such as changing IE intranet security zone settings, that can also help protect against potential attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/190585&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's chief financial officer confirmed today that the company will offer a free upgrade to the upcoming Office 2010 suite starting this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a presentation at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media  Telecom Conference, Microsoft CFO Peter Klein said that the Office 2010 Technology Guarantee program would kick off before the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, details of the free Office 2010 upgrade program leaked to the Web when a Microsoft technology specialist posted information to the firm's partner community site. The site said that Microsoft would launch the Office 2010 upgrade deal on March 5 and run the program through Sept. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the leaked information, customers who purchase an eligible copy of Office 2007 during that period will be allowed to download a corresponding edition of Office 2010 for free when the new suite launches in June. Users who want a DVD installation disc will have to pay a small shipping-and-handling fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers of Office Home and Student 2007 will receive a free copy of Office Home and Student 2010, while buyers of Office Standard 2007 will be eligible for a free copy of Office Home and Business 2010, a new addition to the Office lineup. Purchases of either Office Small Business 2007 or Office Professional 2007 will be eligible for a free copy of Office Professional 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Klein did not specify a launch date for the offer, it will come this month, and likely earlier rather than latter, since he told Wall Street analysts today that Microsoft would defer $300 million to $350 million from the quarter that ends March 31 to cover the costs of the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klein cited the increased integration of SharePoint and Exchange with the suite as a reason why enterprises should upgrade to Office 2010, and pointed to the integration with the impending free Office Web applications as a boon for consumers. "[An] Office [launch] is always a big deal for our company," Klein said. "There's something for everybody in [Office 2010]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free upgrade programs are nothing new for Microsoft. Last summer, Microsoft used the Windows 7 Upgrade Option to maintain sales of Vista, giving customers who bought a copy of the soon-to-be-replaced Vista between June 26 and Oct. 22 free copies of Windows 7 when it launched. The company also offered similar deals prior to releasing Office 2007 and Office 2008 for Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 is set to ship in June, and will be the first of its suite line to forego less-expensive upgrade editions. Some analysts have argued that Microsoft dumped upgrades to prevent business customers from using a loophole to avoid paying Microsoft's pricey software maintenance fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2007 Home and Student currently sells for $104 at Amazon.com, $45 less than the planned $149 list price for Office Home and Student 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said it had restarted distribution of a security update that had crippled some Windows PCs last month with reboot problems and Blue Screen of Death error screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update, dubbed MS10-015, originally shipped on Feb. 9, but was pulled from Windows Updates' automatic update two days later after complaints flooded Microsoft 's support forum from users whose machines refused to restart after they had installed the patch. The affected PCs shuddered to a stop at the blue screen which indicates a serious software error and crash in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a week, Microsoft announced that only PCs infected with the "Alureon" rootkit were incapacitated by MS10-015. It denied that there was any flaw in the security update itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today Microsoft resumed the distribution of MS10-015 to Windows customers through Automatic Update," Jerry Bryant, a senior manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), said in an e-mail. "The bulletin includes added detection logic for consumer and enterprise customers that searches for indications of the Alureon rootkit. If detection logic included in Automatic Update discovers abnormal conditions in certain operating system file configurations, the update will fail and customers will be presented with an error message that offers alternative support options. If this occurs, Microsoft customer support will work with impacted customers to resolve each issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft provided more information about the error messages , and what users seeing them should do, on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who have already installed MS10-015 without problems do not have to reinstall it, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also issued a scanning tool users can run to determine whether their PCs are infected with the rootkit before they attempt to download and install MS10-015. The tool doesn't scrub Alureon from a compromised computer, but only determines whether the system is compatible with the patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not yet delivered a promised detect-and-destroy tool that will clean infected PCs. Two weeks ago, the company said the tool would be ready in "a few weeks." It used the same timeframe today. " We anticipate that tools for both consumers and enterprise customers will be available in a few weeks," said Bryant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Microsoft has used its Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), a free program updated each Patch Tuesday, to seek out and destroy rootkits. The next scheduled refresh of the MSRT is March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS10-015 targeted a pair of 17-year-old kernel bugs in all 32-bit versions of Windows. The vulnerability went public in late January when a Google engineer published attack code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has caught heat over the fact that it took nearly two decades to fix the flaw. At the RSA Conference in San Francisco today, Brian Snow, former technical director of the National Security Agency's Information Assurance Directorate, blasted Microsoft for its sluggish pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying that fixing vulnerabilities can be a competitive advantage for companies, Snow cited MS10-015. "Seventeen years and not yet addressed? Give me a break," said Snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert McMillan of the IDG News Service contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt; * Teva and Actavis still in the running - sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, changes sourcing, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is set to
present a nearly $4 billion offer for German generic-drug maker
Ratiopharm GmbH this week, competing against rival bids from Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) and Actavis, sources
familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer had previously cooled on Ratiopharm, but was asked to
rejoin the auction and make a presentation to Ratiopharm's board
and management, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer was expected to "be competitive" with a rival offer
from Iceland's Actavis, the source said. Pfizer could still walk
away without submitting a binding offer, the source cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The auction could linger several more weeks, with a decision
unlikely before the end of the month, a second source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several sources told Reuters in February that Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) and Iceland's Actavis
would be bidding for Ratiopharm. One source said at the time that
the offer from Actavis was the highest, at close to 3 billion
euros ($4.1 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would make the deal the biggest generics takeover since
Teva's $7.5 billion purchase of U.S. rival Barr, announced in July
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heir Ludwig Merckle put Ratiopharm on the block as part of
concessions made to creditors by his father Adolf Merckle, who
committed suicide in January 2009 after ceding control of his
business empire to lenders during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer declined to comment, while Ratiopharm was not
immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jessica Hall, Ritsuko Ando in New York and Deena

little progress has been made during some two years of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea that they are going to pull their signal .... I
don't think that that's good business. I think that it invites
scrutiny from the governmental side and, to be honest, I don't

that ABC has begun running on-air messages to Cablevision
subscribers warning them they may no longer have access to the
network from Sunday, March 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cablevision on Monday said ABC was threatening to remove
the network unless Cablevision and its customers pay $40
million in new fees for programming that it offers for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with the matter on Tuesday said the $40
million was an overstatement by Cablevision, and that
negotiations between the two companies were ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC's shows include "Lost," "Grey's Anatomy" and "Desperate

&lt;p&gt;Hooked up to a small webcam and digital projector, the Mobile Surface computer demonstrated by Microsoft Research scientists at yesterday's in-house TechFest can create touch interfaces on any nearby flat surface -- or even in thin air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A YouTube video filmed by TechFlash (see below), a Seattle-based online news site, shows a researcher playing electronic drums by tapping his fingers in the air on top of a mobile Surface computer's projection of drum icons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researcher moved forward to another screen by sweeping his hand slowly in the air from left to right, and expanded another by pushing his palm forward in the air until he touches the projected screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prototype the Mobile Surface device combines the features of Microsoft's Surface touchscreen computer along with the gesture-based interface of its coming Project Natal game control system for the Xbox 360.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile Surface is also reminiscent of the 'Minority Report' interface demoed by startup PrimeSense at CES earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Microsoft's multi-touch Surface computer, the Mobile Surface device can also scan and recognize cards and objects. The performance of the Mobile Surface device seemed fast during the demo, though it was likely running a much slower processor than the full Surface tabletop computer's  target="new" href="http://www.microsoft.com/SURFACE/Default.aspx?page=product#section=Hardware "2.13 GHz Core 2 Duo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural user interfaces, aka NUIs, have long been an area of interest for Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and of the Microsoft Research organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, its researchers showed off an advanced finger-based touchscreen a month before the iPhone hit the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example Microsoft Research last year showed off a 'nanotouch' interface that let users control very small devices by touching the back of the device, thus not covering up the screen.

&lt;p&gt;A lobbying group composed of Microsoft rivals today called on antitrust regulators worldwide to pressure the company into offering a browser ballot screen to their citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS) urged officials outside the European Union (EU) to push for a ballot similar to what Microsoft began serving yesterday to European customers via Windows Update. "Consumers deserve the same unbiased browser choice on all the world's more than 1 billion personal computers," the ECIS said in a statement Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The browser ballot was mandated by an agreement Microsoft reached last year with EU regulators, two years after Norwegian browser maker Opera Software filed a formal complaint . The ballot appears on Windows PCs where Internet Explorer (IE) is set as the default browser, and lets users download and install rivals, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The European initiative will help spur competition, but leaves most of the world's computers with operating systems that are tied to Internet Explorer," said Thomas Vinje, ECIS's lead counsel. "We call on competition authorities around the world to look closely at what has happened in Europe and to act on behalf of their consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the ECIS include Opera, Adobe, Red Hat, and long-time Microsoft rivals Oracle and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera made the same suggestion last year after it reviewed Microsoft's initial offer to provide a ballot. "We would like to see this happen outside of Europe as well. We think everyone should be offered a choice of browsers," said Hakon Wium Lie, Opera's chief technology officer, in a July 2009 interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinje said he couldn't remember where today's request by the ECIS originated, but said he doubted it was Opera. "I'm pretty sure it was independent of Opera," he said. "IBM and Red Hat are not just going to meekly follow in the footsteps of a Norwegian browser company. It's a strongly-held view by all our members."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is not obligated to take the ballot concept beyond the boundaries of the EU, of course, but Vinje said the ECIS' request was more than a publicity stunt. "We think this has a realistic chance," he said. "It seems to me that when people realize they're not getting the same choice as others in Europe, some of those people might not be happy, and they'll go to consumer groups or other competition agencies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECIS has not reached out to antitrust regulators in countries outside the EU, Vinje said. "Not at the moment, but we're not excluding that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft dismissed the ECIS' call. "The issues in the Internet Explorer case have already been the subject of extensive legal action in several other countries around the world, including the United States, which have each developed their own legal solutions which are different than the browser choice screen pursued by the European Commission after years of litigation," said Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz. He also noted that PC makers and users worldwide can install the browser of their choice on Windows PCs without a ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ballot has come under fire for reasons other than its geographical limits. Yesterday, an IBM software architect criticized the ballot's shuffling , saying that his tests showed Google 's Chrome is the most likely to get the preferred spots. According to the deal Microsoft struck with EU officials, the ballot screen is to scramble the order of the top five browsers, a change from an earlier Microsoft idea that browser order would be alphabetical by maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Mozilla, which makes Firefox, and Opera rivals blasted that plan because Apple 's Safari, which has a very small share of the Windows browser market, would get the favored first position at the far left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not yet responded to claims that the ballot randomization is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The doyenne of celebrity interviewers, Barbara Walters, says she is quitting her Oscars television special because these days film stars are everywhere and celebrities have become famous for "doing nothing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 80-year-old TV journalist and talk show host, who years ago was criticized for pioneering celebrity stories alongside harder news, is hosting her final Oscars special after 29 years for the March 7 Academy Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday's edition of "The Barbara Walters Special" will feature the veteran journalist interviewing Oscar nominees Sandra Bullock and Mo'Nique, as well as a roundup of the 93 interviews she conducted for the program over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlights include a 1987 interview with Bette Davis two years before the screen heroine's death; Oprah Winfrey telling Walters she felt she was born for greatness, and last year's show when Hugh Jackman gave her a lap dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After you have done a lap dance with Hugh Jackman it is time to leave," she said laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More seriously, Walters told Reuters it was becoming ever harder to be original in the special because coverage of movie stars had also increased. She said classic stars like Bette Davis are rare in today's world saturated by celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt like I had been there, done that, that I had interviewed the greatest stars and that wasn't so special anymore," she said. "Now there are so many entertainment programs and the stars are on almost everything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since her first Oscars special in 1981, Walters said it has become more difficult to find new questions for a star "when they have already done 20 programs," and people become famous after appearing in just one or two movies or on reality TV and don't have much to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not movie stars that are celebrities any more. Now, it's also everybody who has a reality show. You are a celebrity overnight, you are a celebrity for doing nothing, you are a celebrity for shopping," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Too often the celebrity is a celebrity because he or she just came out of rehab, otherwise they are not interesting. I didn't want to do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters, who became the first female U.S. network news anchor more than 30 years ago, said while stars and celebrities have changed, she accepted it was just part of the times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it was better in the past, it is just the way it is now," she said, adding later she did not feel responsible for any increased focus on celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wish I had that kind of power," she joked. "What I did do was meet and get to know the stars as they really were, in depth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(editing by Bob Tourtellotte)&lt;/p&gt;

television special because these days film stars are everywhere
and celebrities have become famous for "doing nothing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The 80-year-old TV journalist and talk show host, who years
ago was criticized for pioneering celebrity stories alongside
harder news, is hosting her final Oscars special after 29 years
for the March 7 Academy Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sunday's edition of "The Barbara Walters Special" will
feature the veteran journalist interviewing Oscar nominees
Sandra Bullock and Mo'Nique, as well as a roundup of the 93
interviews she conducted for the program over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highlights include a 1987 interview with Bette Davis two
years before the screen heroine's death; Oprah Winfrey telling
Walters she felt she was born for greatness, and last year's
show when Hugh Jackman gave her a lap dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After you have done a lap dance with Hugh Jackman it is
time to leave," she said laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More seriously, Walters told Reuters it was becoming ever
harder to be original in the special because coverage of movie
stars had also increased. She said classic stars like Bette
Davis are rare in today's world saturated by celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I felt like I had been there, done that, that I had
interviewed the greatest stars and that wasn't so special
anymore," she said. "Now there are so many entertainment
programs and the stars are on almost everything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since her first Oscars special in 1981, Walters said it has
become more difficult to find new questions for a star "when
they have already done 20 programs," and people become famous
after appearing in just one or two movies or on reality TV and
don't have much to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's not movie stars that are celebrities any more. Now,
it's also everybody who has a reality show. You are a celebrity
overnight, you are a celebrity for doing nothing, you are a
celebrity for shopping," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Too often the celebrity is a celebrity because he or she
just came out of rehab, otherwise they are not interesting. I
didn't want to do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walters, who became the first female U.S. network news
anchor more than 30 years ago, said while stars and celebrities
have changed, she accepted it was just part of the times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think it was better in the past, it is just the
way it is now," she said, adding later she did not feel
responsible for any increased focus on celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I wish I had that kind of power," she joked. "What I did
do was meet and get to know the stars as they really were, in
depth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (editing by Bob Tourtellotte)

&lt;p&gt;How will we ever get a leg up on hackers who are infecting computers worldwide? Microsoft's security chief laid out several suggestions Tuesday, including a possible Internet usage tax to pay for the inspection and quarantine of machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today most hacked PCs run Microsoft's Windows operating system, and the company has invested millions in trying to fight the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently used the U.S. court system to shut down the Waledac botnet, introducing a new tactic in the battle against hackers. Speaking at the RSA security conference in San Francisco, Microsoft Corporate Vice President for Trustworthy Computing Scott Charney said that the technology industry needs to think about more "social solutions." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means fighting the bad guys at several levels, he said. "Just like we do defense in depth in IT, we have to do defense in depth in [hacking] response." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I actually think the health care model ... might be an interesting way to think about the problem," Charney said. With medical diseases, there are education programs, but there are also social programs to inspect people and quarantine the sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model could work to fight computer viruses too, he said. When a computer user allows malware to run on his computer, "you're not just accepting it for yourself, you're contaminating everyone around you," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that Internet service providers might somehow step up in the fight against malware is not new. The problem, however, is cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer calls already eat into service provider profits. Adding quarantine and malware-fixing costs to that would be prohibitive, said Danny McPherson, chief research officer with Arbor Networks, via instant message. "They have no incentive to do anything today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So who would foot the bill? "Maybe markets will make it work," Charney said. But an Internet usage tax might be the way to go. "You could say it's a public safety issue and do it with general taxation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, there are 3.8 million infected botnet computers worldwide, 1 million of which are in the U.S. They are used to steal sensitive information and send spam, and were a launching point for 190,000 distributed denial-of-service attacks in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is set to
join the bidding for German generic-drug maker Ratiopharm GmbH,
offering as much as 3 billion euros, Bloomberg reported on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The report, citing two people with knowledge of the talks,
said Pfizer could present its bid to Ratiopharm's management as
early as this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several sources told Reuters in February that Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) and Iceland's Actavis
would be bidding for Ratiopharm. One source said at the time
that the offer from Actavis was the highest, at close to 3
billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal appears set to become the biggest generics
takeover since Teva's $7.5 billion purchase of U.S. rival Barr,
announced in July 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer declined to comment, while Ratiopharm was not
immediately available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;After shrinking its U.S. workforce by as many as 10,000 employees last year, IBM this week may be on its way to cutting another 2,000 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM isn't commenting on its latest round of cuts and information about it comes from the Alliance@IBM/CWA Local 1701, which gathers its data directly from IBM employees. The Alliance, which has blamed offshoring for many of the layoffs , has been trying to win bargaining rights for employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is clearly offshoring things where they can," said one IBM employee who received his notice yesterday and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he didn't want to jeopardize his severance. A 10-year veteran and UNIX administrator, this employee said his customer support team once had 15 U.S.-based workers. That staff was reduced over time to just three workers in the U.S., with other members of the customer support team now in Brazil, Argentina and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employee said he was not given a good reason for his layoff. "Higher ups made a decision that a certain percentage had to be cut - it was not performance-based at all," he said. Although the employee said he's uncertain about the job market, "my sense is that it is not horrendous [but] I'll have to assume that I'll have to take a cut in pay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of last October, IBM employed 105,000 workers in the U.S., compared to 115,000 in 2008. In 2007, IBM had 121,000 U.S. employees. It employs about 400,000 globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM doesn't discuss its jobs actions other than to explain that they are in response to shifting customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's workforce is scattered around the country and it continues to hire in U.S. locations. Michigan State University, for instance, has posted a notice about an IBM recruitment fair March 8 for IBM's Michigan Delivery Center. It says the company has nearly 60 "upcoming openings" for application support specialists. A university official deferred questions to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM jobs are high paying and the company is a major employer in number communities, such as Burlington, Vt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a review last year of a bond issue for Burlington, Moody's Investors Service looked at major employers and hiring trends to assess the economic health of the community. It wrote that IBM was Burlington's single largest employer, with 5,400 workers at that point, or 5% of the area's workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM recently announced job reductions, with the Burlington area reportedly experiencing between 300 and 500 IBM related job losses," Moody's wrote. "These recent cuts bring the total number of workers that IBM has laid off since 2001 to about 3,000, or 15% of manufacturing employment. Additional workforce reductions at IBM present considerable downside risk"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear whether the Burlington workforce was affected directly by the latest round of cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Thibodeau covers SaaS and enterprise applications, outsourcing, government IT policies, data centers and IT workforce issues for Computerworld .

2 More Bank Failures, Tally Hits 22

The failure of Carson River Community Bank is expected to cost the deposit
insurance fund about $7.9 million and Rainier Pacific Bank is likely to cost
about $95.2 million. 

Reno, Nevada-based Heritage Bank of Nevada will assume all of the deposits and
about $38 million of assets of Carson River. Heritage Bank entered into a
loss-share transaction with the FDIC on $28.5 million of Carson River`s assets. 

Umpqua Bank of Roseburg, Oregon will assume all of the deposits and about $670.1
million of Rainier Pacific Bank's assets. The FDIC and Umpqua Bank agreed to a
loss-share agreement on $578.1 million of Rainier Pacific's assets. 

Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to cause hundreds
more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC anticipates bank failures to
cost about $100 billion over the next three years. 

The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include SunTrust Banks (NYSE: STI),
PNC Financial (NYSE: PNC), BB Corporation (NYSE: BBT) and Regions Financial

We expect loan losses on the commercial real estate portfolio to remain high for
banks that hold large amounts of high-risk loans.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems chief executive Jim Dolan on Tuesday blasted Walt Disney's "bullying" threat to pull ABC from its cable systems over a contract dispute, calling the move senseless and one that invites questions from U.S. regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his first public remarks about the intensifying fight, Dolan said, "Fundamental to this issue right now is our subscribers, our customers, should not have to pay for something others are getting for free."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolan's comments come in response Disney's announcement that ABC has begun running on-air messages to Cablevision subscribers warning them they may no longer have access to the network from Sunday, March 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC's shows include "Lost," "Grey's Anatomy" and "Desperate Housewives" as well as news programs like "Good Morning America." ABC is also carrying the Academy Awards on Sunday, one of the most highly rated TV programs of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolan said discussions between the two sides only began in earnest several weeks ago, disputing Disney's statement that little progress has been made during some two years of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea that they are going to pull their signal .... I don't think that that's good business. I think that it invites scrutiny from the governmental side and, to be honest, I don't really understand it because we're negotiating," Dolan said at a conference in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would have thought they would have taken a more diplomatic stance," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney-Cablevision dispute follows several other high-profile contract battles between broadcasters and cable providers. Both sides are showing far more concern about fees -- partly due to the bad economy -- and a willingness to take extreme measures to make the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the issue is a disagreement over how much a broadcast network should be paid by a cable distributor to deliver free-to-air programs to their subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox and Time Warner Cable, which had similarly disagreed over how much the cable service provider should pay for the right to carry the network, reached a deal on January 1 to avoid a blackout after months of negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paul Thomasch; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

broadcast network should be paid by a cable distributor to
deliver free-to-air programs to their subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox, owned by News Corp (NWSA.O), and Time Warner Cable Inc
(TWC.N), which had similarly disagreed over how much the cable
service provider should pay for the right to carry the network,
reached a deal on Jan. 1 to avoid a blackout after months of
negotiations. [ID:nSGE60001O]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Paul Thomasch; Editing by Richard Chang)

Commenting on the announcement, Chuck Viane, President, Distribution, Walt

A pre-ordering offer also is featured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time ever, we are giving developers the opportunity to pre-order Visual Studio 2010. The Microsoft Store and select online resellers will pre-sell Visual Studio 2010 Professional with MSDN Essentials from March 9 until the product launch," Somasegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSDN Essentials offers access to Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise, and SQL Server Datacenter R2 for development and test use.

forecast a relatively small increase in operating expenses for
its next fiscal year, as it tries to keep a lid on costs while
waiting for a rebound in technology spending from its core
business customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company cut more than $3
billion from its original spending plan last fiscal year, as it
slashed more than 5,000 jobs in the downturn, and said on
Tuesday it is still focused on reining in spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is now targeting $27 billion to $27.5 billion in
operating expenses for fiscal 2011, which starts in July, Chief
Financial Officer Peter Klein told a Morgan Stanley investor
conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That signals expected cost growth of about 2.5 percent to
4.4 percent over its forecast for the current fiscal year of
$26.2 billion to $26.5 billion. It is below the $28 billion or
so expected by Morgan Stanley analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were down 1.3 percent to $28.64 in early
afternoon trading on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Klein did not forecast revenue or profit. Microsoft has not
issued any specific forecasts for either since 2008, because of
the uncertain economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did say that Windows 7, the company's best-selling
operating system launched in October, had now sold 90 million
copies. By the end of last year, it had sold 60 million
copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Windows unit is one of the company's chief profit
engines, reporting $6.9 billion in sales and $5.4 billion in
profit last quarter, almost twice as much as profit as the same
quarter the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Klein reiterated Microsoft's broad view that the recovery
in business tech spending would occur in fiscal 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There will be an enterprise refresh cycle," said Klein.
"It's not precisely certain when that will happen and how fast
it will happen, but we expect it to happen this calendar year
and go into next calendar year, and that will be a really good
catalyst for growth for our PC business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Klein took up the role of CFO last November, succeeding
Chris Liddell, who left to join General Motors [GM.UL].

&lt;p&gt;IBM is planning to release a new class of x86 servers that treat memory, processors and solid-state disk as interchangeable components, saying a more flexible server is needed to satisfy the requirements of virtualized data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT hardware sales poised for small recovery after disastrous 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's new eX5 server line, based on Intel's upcoming Nehalem-EX chips, is an early example of what Gartner calls "fabric-based" computing, which allows customers to scale up memory and other resources without necessarily having to buy a new server. IBM says its goal is to move beyond today's industry-standard servers to offer something more scalable and tuned to fit demanding workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, "if a user needs more memory and only more memory, the user has to buy a whole new server," says Tom Bradicich, IBM fellow and vice president of systems technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three decades, x86 servers have been based on a desktop PC architecture that locks memory and processors together, and that model is becoming outdated and contributing to sprawl and the underutilization of individual servers, Bradicich says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fundamentally, we don't think it's a good strategy to allow the base architecture of the desktop PC masquerade as an enterprise server," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's eX5 servers will come in blade and rackmount configurations, with the first ones being released later in March. IBM is taking the Intel architecture and adding a chip of IBM's own design that reduces latency between memory and processors. IBM claims the new servers will improve database performance by a factor of 30 over current systems, while greatly improving performance-per-watt and virtual server density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff said IBM's use of memory will be interesting to customers with virtualization deployments."Memory is a big deal with virtualization, because one of the things we're seeing with virtual servers is you tend to run out of memory before you run out of CPU," Haff says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is making its announcement ahead of Intel's Nehalem-EX unveiling, expected for later in March. But IBM won't be the only vendor addressing memory needs of virtualized data centers, Haff says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco's Unified Computing System has "Extended Memory" technology, and other server vendors can be expected to unveil new memory capabilities based on the latest Intel processors, Haff says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM says eX5 is part of its plan to overtake HP in the x86 market. Haff said IBM seems to be adapting its mainframe and Power strategy to the x86 space by tailoring products to fit specific workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new servers will include a blade system, a two-socket rack-mount server and a four-socket rack-mount server.The servers will allow customers to add up to 32 DIMMs of memory, and several terabytes of flash storage to improve I/O throughput, Bradicich says. Customers can also add processors in quantities of either two or four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gartner has predicted that fabric-based servers will end up costing significantly more than today's standard x86 machines, but IBM contends that the approach will also allow enterprises to purchase fewer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is our first manifestation of taking the PC out of the PC server and making true enterprise capabilities," Bradicich says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about data center in Network World's Data Center section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt; * Fundraising hit by preference for liquid assets -sources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Second fund looking to secure deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Greg Roumeliotis, European Infrastructure Correspondent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMSTERDAM, March 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N)
has cut the $7.5 billion fundraising target for its second
infrastructure fund by more than half after failing to secure
enough commitments, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank has been seeking money for the fund,
dubbed Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners II, for two years
and is working towards final close having reached the time limit
allowed under its private placement rules, sources said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global infrastructure fundraising dropped by more than half
in 2009 from 2008 as investors moved into more liquid assets. At
the same time, increased competition for investors' money has
exerted pressure on fees. [ID:nN24139111]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman has had to try to explain to its limited partners
where the deals will be coming from," said a source at a Dutch
pension fund, speaking on condition of anonymity because details
of the fundraising are private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A second source added that, in order to placate concerns,
the fund had suggested that a management fee would only start
accruing after the fund has clinched a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The number of infrastructure deals completed by unlisted
infrastructure funds like this one dropped in 2009 to the lowest
level since 2005 as fewer, more expensive assets came to the
market, and debt financing became harder to secure.
[ID:nLDE60Q2E9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second fund has a mandate to invest in transport
infrastructure, such as toll roads, airports and ports, as well
as regulated assets in the gas, water and power sectors in North
America and Europe. It is aimed at large institutional investors
such as insurance companies and pension funds with commitments
in the 10s of millions of dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has been actively scouring Europe for deals, making
attempts to acquire the power grids of E.ON (EONGn.DE) and
Vattenfall [VATN.UL] that went up for sale in Germany as well as
Veolia's (VIE.PA) British water unit.[ID:nLDE60C0CH]
[ID:nL649509]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's first $6.5 billion infrastructure fund closed in
2006 and owns stakes in Associated British Ports, US port
operator Carrix, Texan utility TXU -- now Energy Future Holdings
[TXEFHE.UL] -- and Mexican toll roads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Infrastructure has emerged as a distinct asset class in
recent years, with banks such as JPMorgan (JPM.N), Citi (C.N),
Macquarie (MQG.AX) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and buyout firms
such as KKR and Blackstone (BX.N) sponsoring funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Andrew Callus)

&lt;p&gt;CardinalCommerce Corporation Praises Authentication Programs of Visa, MasterCard
and JCB

MENTOR, Ohio, March 2, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CardinalCommerce, the worldwide
leading enabler of payment brands, thanks Visa, MasterCard and JCB for its
efforts in developing and respectively introducing to market the Verified by
Visa, MasterCard(R) SecureCode(TM) and J/Secure(TM) authenticated payment
programs.

Year after year, the Internet has become a more popular venue for convenient
shopping. During this time, the threat of online fraud, identity theft, and the
corresponding losses which affect consumers, retailers and banks, has kept pace.

Visa, MasterCard, and JCB have taken the lead, made the investment, and put
their reputations at stake to help make electronic commerce safer for all of us.
These three organizations initiated programs architected to eliminate Internet
fraud, the 3-D Secure(TM) protocol(1), commonly known as Verified by Visa,
MasterCard(R) SecureCode(TM) and J/Secure(TM).

Imagine the daunting task of creating authentication systems that service
hundreds of millions of consumers, millions of merchants, and tens of thousands
of banks, around the globe; that's just what Visa, MasterCard, and JCB have
accomplished with their respective programs. The initiatives were designed to
ease the constituents into adopting authentication, while maintaining the
ability to evolve as better authentication technology is continually released
into market.

Visa, MasterCard, and JCB have built the foundation and infrastructure for
online and mobile authentication. The 3-D Secure-based protocols contemplate
authentication as being technology-neutral, rather than dependent on singular
end-user interface technology-centric solutions, such as usernames/passwords,
dynamic numbers, or biometrics.

There are several very clever and insightful aspects to the programs that no
other systems have heretofore put into practice.

First, the programs allow uneven adoption by the constituents; consumers,
retailers, and banks. Each participant can adopt the protocols in a gradual and
orderly fashion. The protocols do not require mass adoption by any party for
them to work.

There are also incentives for each group to adopt the protocols. Merchants are
incented to participate because authenticated transactions are designed to be
less expensive and shift the risk of loss due to fraud to the issuing banks,
irrespective of cardholder or bank adoption.(2)

Consumers benefit from authentication because their cards are protected. When a
consumer registers for the respective programs with his or her
usernames/passwords, the added credentials thwart fraudsters because, on sites
employing the protocols, that card won't be authorized independently of the
credentials.

Banks can also protect themselves and their cardholders by participating in the
authentication programs. Banks that activate the service for all cards add a
layer of security universally, even if these cards aren't presently used online.
The cardholders' banks are responsible for the implementation of each protocol
which provides flexibility and time with regard to adoption. Since banks control
their own implementations, they will choose varying levels of security, similar
to online banking.

Second, the protocols are extensible and can continue to be expanded to
accommodate new and better technologies. An important aspect of security in the
protocols is that a private secured session is arranged between the consumer and
their issuing bank. The protocols cause the banks to report a positive,
negative, or qualified result to the merchant prior to accepting the sale. The
risk merchants or their processing agents take when collecting or storing
cardholder credentials is eliminated by the nature of the programs which pass
these reporting results instead of passing sensitive credential data.

Usernames/passwords are a good start because the concept is familiar to
consumers and it is inexpensive; however, authentication needs to continually
improve. With intended foresight, the protocols are designed to evolve to
support individual bank authentication systems and technology. The protocols can
support the complexity of individual bank systems and their specific preference
toward authentication technology or user interface.   The notion that the
industry rely on a singular authentication technology can be put to rest since
the protocols allow authentication to be enabled with existing technology and
can accommodate new technologies as they emerge.

Third, the protocols add multiple levels of security as banks add their own
respective authentication systems and technologies. This individuality or
customization by banks adds a security factor. It reduces the impact of stolen
cards because the bank-specific authentication technology is not transferable to
other banks' cards.    This is especially effective at combating large data
breaches that have historically targeted merchants and their respective
transaction processors.   Potential thieves would be heavily burdened to sort
the cards by authentication methodology, match credentials based on that method,
and so on. These complexities serve as a significant deterrent.

New payment brands or methods are expanding on the Internet: PayPal(TM), Amazon
Payments(TM), Google(TM) Checkout, eBillMe(TM), Bill Me Later(R) and others all
use and rely on authentication. They, too, should be lauded. These brands
understand that making remote commerce safe is important to everyone.

CardinalCommerce would like to thank Visa, MasterCard and JCB for making the
investment, and each putting their weight behind programs that makes sense today
and for the future.

(1) The name 3-D Secure represents the three domains involved: the Acquirer
(merchant), the Issuer (cardholder's bank), and the interoperability between the
participants. Each association's branded programs incorporate various data
elements and requirements customizing the 3-D Secure protocol for their
respective brands.

(2)  The incentives for merchant participation vary by payment brand.

&lt;p&gt;March 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut Kimberly-Clark Corp
(KMB.N) to "sell" on Tuesday, saying the current market
consensus does not take into account cost inflation and that
the company faces pressures from a more assertive Procter 
Gamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Kimberly-Clark, best known for Kleenex tissues and Huggies
diapers, competes with Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N), whose paper
products brands include Bounty, Charmin and Puffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In tissue, PG has stepped-up promotional activity
aggressively and taken share from Kimberly's brands," analyst
Andrew Sawyer said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PG's new product -- Pampers Dry Max -- that is slated to
hit shelves in March is expected to give more competition to
Kimberly's Huggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will also see challenges from pulp price
inflation, analyst Sawyer said, adding that the earthquake in
Chile could dampen production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The result of the higher pulp prices is that KMB faces
$350 million in total commodity inflation in 2010 and another
$400-450 million in 2011," Sawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see 5 percent downside to 2011 consensus EPS estimates
that seem to reflect only limited commodity inflation," he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  In January, the company posted a lower-than-expected
quarterly profit and gave a disappointing 2010 forecast as
consumers' preference for cheaper items pressured margins on
its paper goods. [ID:nN22152024]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Sawyer said he expects the stock to remain
range-bound at $60 over the next 12-month, and cut his price
target on the company's stock by $3 to match that valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kimberly-Clark shares were down 2 percent at $59.36 Tuesday
morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Passlogix Suite Extends FIM Benefits to SSO Provisioning &amp; Deployment
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Passlogix&#174;, Inc., today announced the integration of v-GO Single Sign-On  (v-GO
SSO) and related components of its v-GO Access Accelerator Suite with Microsoft
Forefront Identity Manager (FIM) 2010, the recently released successor to
Identity Lifecycle Manager 2007. The integration will enable organizations that
deploy both FIM and v-GO SSO to automate provisioning and deprovisioning of SSO
access to all Windows, Web and mainframe applications, reducing administrator
overhead as well as simplifying the end user experience. 

Extending the benefits that FIM offers for managing identities, application
credentials and identity-based access policies across heterogeneous
environments, the v-GO integration provides a simple means of adding new levels
of password-based application access control for all users as well as
significant improvements for privileged users who share account IDs. It also
leverages Microsoft Active Directory, which is used by more than 80% of
Passlogix`s installed base for v-GO data storage and administration. 

The integration makes it possible to:

* Automatically update v-GO SSO with application credentials that are added,
modified or deleted by FIM in target applications. 
* Eliminate physical or email distribution of application credentials to end
users as well as the need for end users to manually enroll those credentials in
v-GO SSO. This automated provisioning of v-GO SSO increases application security
and streamlines SSO deployments by eliminating the need for users to type in or
even know their passwords. 
* Automatically terminate user account access to all applications when an end
user is deprovisioned by FIM by deleting all of the application credentials in
v-GO SSO, even for accounts such as cloud-based applications that may not be
directly deprovisioned by FIM. This universal access termination facilitates
compliance with regulatory mandates such as PCI DSS and Sarbanes Oxley. 
* Strengthen controls over privileged accounts, firecall ids and other shared
accounts managed by v-GO Shared Accounts Manager by automatically routing
requests for checkout of these credentials to FIM for approval. FIM will
automatically send an Outlook email to the appropriate managers for review, and
v-GO Shared Accounts Manager will either approve or deny the checkout request
based on the response from FIM. 
* Easily correlate application IDs with user identities to expedite FIM
deployments, since v-GO SSO already knows which application IDs belong to which
users and how often they use them. This eliminates the need for lengthy manual
compilation of this information and identifies low-use or dead accounts that can
be eliminated.

"The integration of v-GO and FIM not only streamlines enterprise single sign-on
deployments but also brings all application credentials under the FIM umbrella,"
said John Chirapurath, senior director of the Identity and Security Business
Group at Microsoft. "This advances our goal of consolidating identities and
credentials across the enterprise in a single location for easy management and
control, which helps companies, realize what we call Business Ready Security." 

"Many organizations that adopt FIM will also need SSO capabilities to reduce the
security gaps, help desk costs, user frustration and compliance challenges
associated with the proliferation of application passwords," said Stephane
Fymat, VP of Strategy and Product Management for Passlogix. "The out-of-the-box
connectivity we`re offering between v-GO and FIM will accelerate the SSO
provisioning process and help FIM provide end-to-end identity management for
every user." 

The integration extends Passlogix`s support for Microsoft`s standard enterprise
infrastructure products including Active Directory, Active Directory Application
Mode (ADAM), Internet Information Services (IIS) and the Cryptographic
Application Programming Interface (CAPI). Passlogix has been a Microsoft
Certified partner for more than four years, currently at the Gold Certified
level. 

v-GO Single Sign-On, the industry`s #1 enterprise single sign-on product,
simplifies password management by automating username and password entry for
each account, enabling users to access their applications with a single Windows
logon rather than creating, remembering, inputting and updating passwords for
every application. v-GO Shared Accounts Manager, recently selected as one of the
top identity and access management solutions by SC Magazine, centralizes the
control and usage tracking of all privileged accounts, firecall ids and other
shared accounts. 

Other components of the v-GO Access Accelerator Suite enable strong
authentication to applications, desktops and networks; automate user sign-on and
sign-off of computer kiosks; and automate resets of Windows logon passwords.
Hundreds of organizations worldwide have adopted v-GO to improve business
productivity, strengthen enterprise security and regulatory compliance
readiness, and streamline identity management deployments. 

Passlogix is located in the Microsoft Partner Pavilion at the RSA Conference
2010 running March 1-5 in San Francisco.

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Qatar Petroleum und Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) haben heute bekannt
gegeben, dass im Dezember 2009 die Phase 2 des Erdgasprojekts Al Khaleej (AKG-2)
den Betrieb mit einer Gaskapazit&#228;t von 35,4 Millionen Kubikmeter pro Tag
aufgenommen hat. 

Die neuen Anlagen sind auf die Deckung des wachsenden Bedarfs der lokalen
Industrie ausgerichtet. Zusammen mit Phase 1 von Al Khaleej (AKG-1), deren
Gasf&#246;rderung 2005 begonnen wurde, verf&#252;gt AKG &#252;ber eine Gesamtkapazit&#228;t von etwa
1,6 Milliarden Kubikmetern pro Tag und ist damit die gr&#246;&#223;te einheimische
Erdgasversorgungsquelle in Katar. 

Das Projekt AKG-2 beinhaltet die Errichtung von Gasaufbereitungs-,
Fl&#252;ssigkeitsr&#252;ckgewinnungs- und Fraktionierungsanlagen an Land sowie von zwei
zus&#228;tzlichen Offshore-Bohrinseln. ExxonMobil setzte dazu hochmoderne
Technologien ein, darunter die unternehmenseigene Bohrtechnologie Fast Drill
sowie eigene Bohrabschlusstechnologien. Dadurch erreichte das Unternehmen eine
Reduzierung der Bohrzeit und eine Optimierung der Kosten bei den neuen Bohrungen
im Nord-Feld. Die Anlagen an Land sind in die Anlagen der Ras Laffan Liquefied
Natural Gas Company Limited (3) in der Industriestadt Ras Laffan integriert. Der
erste F&#246;rdertag war im Dezember 2009. 

Seine Exzellenz Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, stellvertretender
Premierminister, Energie- und Wirtschaftsminister, Chairman und Gesch&#228;ftsf&#252;hrer
von Qatar Petroleum, sagte: &#8222;F&#252;r uns ist das AKG-Projekt eines der strategischen
Entwicklungsprojekte im Nord-Feld, da es verschiedene Kraftwerke,und
Entsalzungsanlagen, die Petrochemie sowie weitere energieintensive Industrien in
Katar mit Erdgas versorgt. Dieses Projekt ist ein weiteres Beispiel f&#252;r unsere
langfristige Beziehung zu ExxonMobil, die auf gegenseitigem Nutzen beruht." 

&#8222;In Zusammenarbeit haben Qatar Petroleum und ExxonMobil Erfolg bei der
Kommerzialisierung des weltweit gr&#246;&#223;ten Erdgasfeldes", sagte Neil Duffin,
Pr&#228;sident der ExxonMobil Development Company. &#8222;Dies ist eine weitere gro&#223;e
Leistung, mit der die optimale Ausbeutung der Kohlenwasserstoffvorr&#228;te Katars
sichergestellt wird, um den zunehmenden Bedarf vor Ort zu decken und zur
Weiterentwicklung des Industriestandortes in Katar beizutragen. Dieses Projekt
unterst&#252;tzt das rasante Wirtschaftswachstum des Landes."

vice president of business development, Emulex. "Emulex and IBM are committed to
delivering 10Gb/s Ethernet solutions and share a common vision for network
convergence focused on helping IT managers protect their investments, lower
operating costs, increase flexibility and improve operations." 

The Emulex OneConnect UCNA is the only single-chip server adapter with full
hardware protocol offload support for TCP/IP, iSCSI and FCoE, enabling IT
administrators to converge their physical networks, while maintaining their
application, server, storage and security administration domains. This allows
companies to reduce their costs for adapters, switch ports, cabling, power and
cooling without disrupting their current management structure or network
segmentation configurations. 

In addition, both the Emulex Integrated Virtual Fabric Adapters and standard
Virtual Fabric Adapters utilize Emulex`s OneCommand Manager for secure,
virtualized, automated and centralized enterprise management for deployment,
dynamic provisioning, asset management, virtual I/O services, connectivity

&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Gemalto, the world leader in digital security, today announced that its Protiva
Strong Authentication Server is now fully integrated with Microsoft Forefront
Identity Manager 2010. Thanks to this combined solution, organizations can
provision, deploy and manage smart card-based one-time password devices linked
to Gemalto strong authentication server, while using the same Microsoft
interface to which they are already accustomed. 

Gemalto will be demonstrating the combined solution at the RSA Conference 2010
in the Microsoft Partner Pavilion, booth #1527, and at Gemalto booth #1923. 

"Gemalto is always working to strengthen trust in online identities by
integrating our two-factor authentication solutions with Microsoft`s identity
and access solutions," said Fran&#231;ois Lasnier, VP and GM security business unit
North America for Gemalto. "Gemalto Strong Authentication Server together with
Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager gives organizations a convenient way to add
another layer of security to their information systems with smart card-based one
time password (OTP) devices. OTP can provide a fast track to strong
authentication for enterprises, and then makes it easy for organizations to add
PKI-based authentication later, if they choose." 

The integrated solution allows security managers that work with Microsoft
identity solutions to implement and manage OTP devices without learning a new
interface. They use the Forefront Identity Manager (FIM) portal interface for
all of the administrative functions for managing OTP devices, while the Gemalto
strong authentication server (SAS) works in the background for authentication.
Managers can create or update a Gemalto SAS OTP device record, link the record
to the user, and activate the device easily. They can then manage or change
access privileges or remove devices using the same Microsoft FIM interface. 

"We have worked closely with Gemalto so that organizations using Microsoft
solutions to manage network identities have a streamlined way to implement smart
card technology to enhance their network security and privacy," said John
Chirapurath, senior director in the Identity and Security Business Group at
Microsoft. "It gives our customers the ability to implement strong
authentication devices without having to change the way they work day to day.
That is what we call Business Ready Security." 

Microsoft employees worldwide use Gemalto .NET smart card technology embedded in
their corporate badge to enable secure, two-factor authentication for access to
Microsoft`s own information systems. Gemalto is also Microsoft Gold Certified
Partner, having demonstrated expertise with Microsoft technologies and a proven
ability to meet customers` needs. 

RSA Conference 2010 takes place March 1st through 5th at the Moscone Center in
San Francisco. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;Four-part Series Provides Insight into Data-Driven Initiatives
CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Mariner and Microsoftinviteschool district and Department of Education leaders
to participate in a series of Web sessions that began January 19th and continue
with the second session on March 23rd. The series, entitled "Managing for
Performance: From the School to the State House," highlights education analytics
that improve student achievement and are the backbone of data-driven initiatives
in K-12 organizations across the country. The third and fourth sessions will
take place April 20th and May 18th. An archive of past sessions is available for
on-demand reference. 

During the series, the speakers, including innovative K-12 leaders from several
school districts and a state DOE, share the experiences and knowledge that they
have gained in their data-driven and performance management initiatives with

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft released a set of drivers that allow production versions of Red Hat to run on Hyper-V. The drivers, otherwise known as integration components, have some limitations, but they come with the full assurance that both Microsoft and Red Hat will support such an implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically the drivers support RHEL 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4. These drivers also support SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2 x86 and x64, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 x86 and x64, but that's old news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With much fanfare, Microsoft first submitted said drivers to the Linux kernel way back in July (its first, and so far only, contribution to Linux, for obvious reason). Those drivers were already tested to work with Red Hat and, of course, SUSE. And in October, Red Hat and Microsoft announced that they were joining each other's virtualization partnership programs, and validated that their products worked on each other's virtual machines. So what took Microsoft so long to release these Red Hat drivers to the public?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's one of the questions I put to Microsoft's Vijay Tewari, principal program manager with the Windows Virtualization Team. In short, the delay was caused by one issue: the two companies hadn't worked out a deal on who would support the Red Hat operating system if it was running as a Hyper-V guest. The support issue was solved a couple of weeks ago (and I'm getting to the details on that in a minute) and hence the drivers were made public. (Download them here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limited to one virtual processor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let's note the limitations. Red Hat virtual machines running on Hyper-V are limited to a single virtual processor, which limits the size of the Linux workload. But Tewari says that this limitation isn't specific to just Red Hat. SUSE is also limited to one VP. The number of VPs varies for different versions of Windows Server, too. WS 2008 R2 VMs have access to four VPs, WS3003 gets 3. Tewari says that Microsoft is working on increasing the number of VPs for Linux servers on Hyper-V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limited Mouse support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the components themselves don't provide mouse support, although Citrix makes an add-on, Project Satori, that fixes this issue. The mouse works if you are physically accessing the server. But, without the add-in, isn't available if you RDP into the machine and launch the console of the guest operating system via your remote connection, says Tewari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V Linux driver code has forked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drivers began life as the same ones submitted to the Linux Kernel in July, 2009, but, as those originals have been modified with patches and changes from the Linux community, the code bases between this download and the Linux kernel have forked. Microsoft says that over the next few months, it will integrate them back into a single code base. But, says Tewari, the fork was inevitable because the Hyper-V drivers were submitted to the latest stable version of the kernel at the time, 2.6.32 (version 2.6.33 became available late last month). Not all the commercial distributions are using that release. These drivers support Red Hat based on 2.6.18 and 2.6.27, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the work of reuniting the code again, Microsoft promises to include some enhancements, such as a fix for the mouse issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Red Hat will support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red Hat has promised that the Hyper-V drivers will eventually become a native part of its distribution. That will in all likelihood occur whenever Red Hat upgrades its commercial product to kernel 2.6.32 or later. Indeed, this is the reason why Microsoft swallowed crow and submitted its drivers to the kernel in the first place, under the GPL no less. This even though it continues to toy with the threat that Linux violates its patents. (Last week, Microsoft made two announcements that harked back to its threats: One with Amazon and another with Panasonic ... but I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then this frienimies/odd couple needed to work out who was going to support what. In October, Red Hat certified that its operating system would work with Hyper-V, but Tewari says, that didn't mean that Red Hat was saying Hyper-V guests would be supported. A couple of weeks ago Red Hat agreed that the Hype-V drivers would be treated under the same policy that other third-party drivers not directly included in the distro were treated. Red Hat will now support its operating system, even if its running on Hyper-V, unless its support folks say the issue is caused by the driver. In that case, Microsoft will provide support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this whole situation still sounds less than ideal, Tewari asks users to stand by for a little while. He's got some upcoming news he says you'll like, "We understand the kind of support we offer for Linux with the ICs is not at the same level that we support Windows, but we are fully committed to make sure that our customers get that same support over time.&#160;&#160;You should be seeing an announcement from us in the next two to four weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit Network World's Microsoft Subnet web site for more news, blogs, podcasts.Follow All Microsoft Subnet bloggers on Twitter&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about data center in Network World's Data Center section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

Sachs' plans were. Sachs could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sachs, who had been considered for senior posts at
Treasury, was regarded as one of the architects of Treasury
policies over the past 14 months aimed at stabilizing the
economy during the financial crisis that was still raging when
the Obama administration came to office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geithner acknowledged Sachs' role in calming the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Lee has displayed great judgment and skill in helping the
President navigate the greatest financial crisis since the
Great Depression," Geithner said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sachs, 46, was the administration's original choice to
become under secretary for domestic finance, a key post that
would have put him in charge of crafting policy to ensure the
government had finances to handle its day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he withdrew from consideration for that job in favor of
being an adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sachs has a Wall Street background, having been a partner
at private-equity firm Mariner Investment Group Inc. He was a
Treasury assistant secretary during the former Clinton
administration and came back into government service after
President Barack Obama's 2008 election win when Democrats were
recruiting people to deal with the financial crisis.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Results of a trial of Pfizer's Prevnar 7 vaccine against a major cause of pneumonia and meningitis showed on Wednesday that it can prevent three out of four cases of re-infection in HIV-infected adults in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British researchers who tested the shot in Malawi found it stopped 74 percent of recurrent cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in patients infected with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest the vaccine may benefit other high-risk adult patient groups, the researchers said, although the cost -- at around $40 per dose -- may pose problems in poor countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first trial to use a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in an adult group and find clinical benefits," said Neil French of the London school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since it works in patients with HIV infection ... it is likely to work in other adult groups, including the elderly and other at-risk groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevnar is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) designed to protect against infection with streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, which can invade the blood stream and brain and cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), in turn leading to the serious and often fatal illnesses of septicaemia and meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In HIV-infected patients, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, the risk of developing IPD increases is between 30 and 100 times higher, the scientists said in their study in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar shots known as pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPVs) are currently used to protect adults in Britain and the United States, but have had limited success in HIV-infected adults and are not recommended for use in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer won approval last week for its updated version of the shot, Prevnar 13, which protects against 13 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, as opposed to the seven tackled by the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original Prevnar was introduced in 2000 and has annual sales of around $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline has a rival vaccine called Synflorix that acts against 10 strains, and Merck sells Pneumovax 23, which fights 23 strains and is the only vaccine of its type approved in the United States for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists tested the Prevnar 7 vaccine on almost 500 predominantly HIV-infected adults in Blantyre, Malawi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside their main finding, they also found the vaccine prevented disease even in HIV-infected people whose immune systems were very weak and who were starting to develop AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French described this effect as "remarkable," and said it was probably due to the vaccine's conjugate technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polysaccharide vaccines consist of long chains of sugar molecules isolated from the infectious agent -- in this case, the pneumococcal bacteria. But to boost the shot's effect and make a conjugate vaccine, the sugar molecules can be bound to a "carrier" protein which magnifies the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gives hope for the possible use of conjugate technology in other vaccines targeting important HIV-associated bacterial infections," French wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Company corrects to say it expects 300 million PCs to be
sold this year, not that it expects to sell 300 million copies
of Windows 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * COO says customers conservative, recovery gradual&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Expects 300 million PC sales this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Cautious about investing in China
 (Adds comments on Google, China; shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Georgina Prodhan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) is still
seeing a lot of interest in its Windows 7 computer software
launched last year and a new budget cycle will help a gradual
recovery in business spending, its chief operating officer
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have a lot of interest in the Windows 7 refresh," Kevin
Turner told an audience at the London School of Economics on
Wednesday. "There's lots of momentum around that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turner said Microsoft expects 300 million PCs to be sold
this year. That should be a boost to Windows 7, the new version
of the software that runs more than nine in 10 of the world's
PCs, but he said the picture was mixed globally, with varying
rates of economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has sold 90 million copies of Windows 7 so far
since its October 2009 launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One absolute I can tell you is that at least in 2010 most
people are on new budget cycles, which is helpful, but ...
they're still being conservative," he said. "I think it's going
to be more a gradual thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were up 0.4 percent in New York at 1520
GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strong sales of Windows 7 helped Microsoft post a
bigger-than-expected 60 percent jump in quarterly profit in
January, and it said it expected business technology spending
to recover this year. But the world's biggest software company
made no specific profit or revenue forecasts, citing economic
volatility. [ID:nN27150165]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BACK TO BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his speech, Turner said it was "time to get back to
business" after what Microsoft has repeatedly called an
economic reset, rather than just a recession from which the
world economy would simply recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Microsoft's own spending would not return to
previous levels in many areas after cost cuts, but Microsoft
was at the same time increasing research and development
spending to a record $9.5 billion this year, more than any
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was keen to invest in fast-growing, emerging
economies, Turner said, but would continue to be cautious about
China because of widespread piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Until we can work with China to respect intellectual
property -- I think the last numbers I got were about 98
percent usage share and about 10 percent paid share -- I think
it's a real barrier from a software standpoint," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly, there's work to be done by the Chinese government
to improve IPR (intellectual property rights), or else that
nation won't achieve its potential, in our view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked about rival Google (GOOG.O), whose activities
Microsoft has urged competitors to complain about to
competition regulators, Turner said: "Every competitor we have
makes us a better company." [ID:NN26216782]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not comment specifically on complaints to the
European Commission about Google's practices -- some of which
Google has said came from companies related to Microsoft.

&lt;p&gt; * Results suggest other adult, high-risk groups may benefit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Kate Kelland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - Results of a trial of Pfizer's
(PFE.N) Prevnar 7 vaccine against a major cause of pneumonia and
meningitis showed on Wednesday that it can prevent three out of
four cases of re-infection in HIV-infected adults in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British researchers who tested the shot in Malawi found it
stopped 74 percent of recurrent cases of invasive pneumococcal
disease (IPD) in patients infected with HIV, the human
immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results suggest the vaccine may benefit other high-risk
adult patient groups, the researchers said, although the cost --
at around $40 per dose -- may pose problems in poor countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the first trial to use a conjugate pneumococcal
vaccine in an adult group and find clinical benefits," said Neil
French of the London school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,
who led the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since it works in patients with HIV infection ... it is
likely to work in other adult groups, including the elderly and
other at-risk groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prevnar is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) designed
to protect against infection with streptococcus pneumoniae
bacteria, which can invade the blood stream and brain and cause
invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), in turn leading to the
serious and often fatal illnesses of septicaemia and meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In HIV-infected patients, particularly in sub-Saharan
Africa, the risk of developing IPD increases is between 30 and
100 times higher, the scientists said in their study in the New
England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similar shots known as pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines
(PPVs) are currently used to protect adults in Britain and the
United States, but have had limited success in HIV-infected
adults and are not recommended for use in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer won approval last week for its updated version of the
shot, Prevnar 13, which protects against 13 strains of
streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, as opposed to the seven
tackled by the original. [ID:nN24147368]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The original Prevnar was introduced in 2000 and has annual
sales of around $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) has a rival vaccine called Synflorix
that acts against 10 strains, and Merck (MRK.N) sells Pneumovax
23, which fights 23 strains and is the only vaccine of its type
approved in the United States for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists tested the Prevnar 7 vaccine on almost 500
predominantly HIV-infected adults in Blantyre, Malawi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alongside their main finding, they also found the vaccine
prevented disease even in HIV-infected people whose immune
systems were very weak and who were starting to develop AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; French described this effect as "remarkable", and said it
was probably due to the vaccine's conjugate technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Polysaccharide vaccines consist of long chains of sugar
molecules isolated from the infectious agent -- in this case,
the pneumococcal bacteria. But to boost the shot's effect and
make a conjugate vaccine, the sugar molecules can be bound to a
"carrier" protein which magnifies the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This gives hope for the possible use of conjugate
technology in other vaccines targeting important HIV-associated
bacterial infections," French wrote in the study.

Details on Latest AIG Sale

In order to attain funds for repaying the government`s bailout, on Monday,
American International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG) announced the sale of its Asian
life-insurance unit, American International Assurance (AIA) to the U.K.`s
Prudential Plc (NYSE: PUK) for about $35.5 billion. This comprises about $25
billion in cash, $8.5 billion in face value of equity and equity-linked
securities and $2.0 billion in face value of preferred stock of Prudential.
Subject to other terms of the deal, the transaction expected to close by the end
of 2010. 

AIG is expected to utilize the $25 billion cash to redeem the $16 billion stake
in AIA from the Federal Reserve and to repay the $9 billion credit facility. The
remaining $10.5 billion in securities are expected to be cashed in depending
upon the market conditions but will be primarily used for further debt repayment
of Federal Reserve. 

AIG is desperately seeking the asset sales approach to get rid of the government
bailout loan of about $180 billion, taken during the height of financial crisis
in 2008. Currently, the U.S. government enjoys about 80% stake in AIG. On the
other hand, Prudential is considering a right offering to raise $20 billion to
fund the AIA deal. This offering will be supported by Credit Suisse Group (NYSE:
CS), London`s HSBC Holdings, a wing of HSBC Holdings Plc (NYSE: HBC) and
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM).

BP Deals for U.S. Shale Gas

UK super major BP Plc. (NYSE: BP) intends to make a deal with privately held
Lewis Energy Group for the expansion of its U.S. shale-gas operations, as per
news published in upstreamonline.com. The transaction value of this deal is
expected to be worth $150 million to $200 million. 

BP will acquire a 50% stake in 80,000 acres of the Eagle Ford Shale play in the
southeastern part of Texas held by Lewis Energy. BP will shell out $4,000 to
$4,500 per acre. 

Major energy companies are showing significant interest towards the Eagle Ford
Shale play, which is currently treated as a rapidly developing oil and gas
field. While ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) holds properties in this play,
Chesapeake Energy Corp. (NYSE: CHK) is looking to expand its position as well. 

With an uptrend in the economic conditions, many large integrated energy
companies have been keen to acquire smaller independent U.S. producers or their
properties. BP's move is the latest in a series of deals that have brought major
oil companies into U.S. shale gas. The ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) &#8722; XTO Energy
(NYSE: XTO) deal is a recent prominent example.

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan analyst says company could seek a buyer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * NYSE told Terex does not comment on unusual activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares up 6 percent
 (Adds JPMorgan analyst note)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, March 3 (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. heavy equipment
maker Terex Corp (TEX.N) rose more than 6 percent on Wednesday
after fellow industrial Joy Global Inc JOYG.O topped Wall
Street's profit forecast and a JPMorgan analyst suggested Terex
could seek a buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After selling its mining equipment business last month to
Bucyrus International Inc BUCY.O for $1.3 billion, Terex
could look to sell some or all of its remaining earth-moving
equipment and crane businesses, JPMorgan analyst Ann Duignan
wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(Terex) could seek a strategic buyer for its remaining
businesses; the question is whether there is one such buyer,"
Duignan wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She suggested that Asian equipment manufacturers including
China's Sany Heavy Industry (600031.SS), South Korea's Doosan
(000150.KS) or Japan's Komatsu Ltd (6301.T) could be interested
in slices of Terex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, it is not clear who would be willing to acquire
the entire entity," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Stock Exchange said in a statement that it
contacted the maker of earth-moving equipment and cranes to ask
about the surge, but the company said its policy was not to
comment on unusual share movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terex shares rose to $21.71, the highest since late
January, before trading up $1.25 at $21.23 on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mining equipment maker Joy Global earlier on Wednesday
posted first-quarter profit that topped Wall Street's
expectations, sending its shares up almost 7 percent to $55.
[ID:nSGE6220GK]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some on Wall Street had criticized Terex's decision to exit
the mining equipment business, which had been its steadiest
performer through the brutal economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Terex Chief Executive Ron DeFeo defended the move,
saying in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission it was "the first step in our strategy to transform
Terex from what has historically been predominantly a
construction and mining equipment company to a manufacturer of
more diverse niche machinery and industrial products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past year, Terex shares have run up about 158
percent in value, almost double the 84 percent rise of the Dow
Jones U.S. Industrial Goods  Services Index .DJUSIG.

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Mar 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Brainloop (http://www.brainloop.com/), the leading supplier of Document
Compliance Management solutions for highly secure document sharing,
announced that it now supports Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management(TM).
Brainloop has supported a similar solution with Microsoft's Rights
Management Services for a number of years, managing access rights for
users of Microsoft Office documents.

    Brainloop provides a hosted (SaaS) service for collaboration on
confidential documents for such applications as biotech licensing,
project collaboration, secure communication, M due diligence and other
applications that need to support document security compliance. Typical
users are companies conducting high-profile transactions or engaged in
highly sensitive collaboration scenarios calling for the strictest
encryption, access control and auditability standards.

    The integration of Brainloop's data room service with Adobe LiveCycle RM
and Microsoft RMS allows IT administrators or document authors to set
secure, persistent document access policies and privileges, while
maintaining an audit trail of all document access and changes to meet
corporate and regulatory compliance objectives. Access rights are applied
to documents saved in the data room and protect the documents even after
they have been downloaded to the users' local computers.

    Using rights management, customized document restrictions such as control
over editing, printing, and forwarding can be centrally defined on the
server, and remain in place after download. The user receives a personal,
encrypted copy of the document. This personalized copy cannot be opened
by other users at any time. The document owner can specify an expiration
date, after which time users can no longer open their personal copies of
the document.

    "We're proud to be the only vendor in document compliance management to
be fully integrated with both Adobe LiveCycle and with Microsoft RMS,
allowing our customers to apply rights management to more types of
documents than they previously could do, and within a fully documented
collaboration environment," says Brainloop CEO Peter Weger. "With this
kind of integration, Brainloop does the heavy lifting so it's very easy
for document owners to apply and enforce security policy to documents
delivered from the data room to the user."

    ABOUT BRAINLOOP

    Brainloop, with offices in Boston and Munich, is the leading supplier of
software solutions for high-security management of confidential
documents. Brainloop Secure Dataroom is a virtual document safe that
enables safe filing, editing and distribution of highly confidential

&lt;p&gt;Program Introduces Middle School Students to the Wonders of Math and Science

* Dr. Bernard Harris, first African American to walk in space, to speak to 1,400
middle school students. 
* The Dream Tour provides out-of-this-world experience and encourages students
to reach for the stars. 
* Sponsored by ExxonMobil, national tour highlights Science, Technology,

ANCHORAGE, Alaska--(Business Wire)--
Former U.S. Astronaut Dr. Bernard Harris gave students and teachers in Anchorage
a first-hand experience with the wonders of science, technology, engineering and
mathematics when "The Dream Tour, presented by ExxonMobil" made its second stop
of 2010 on March 3 at West Anchorage High School speaking to 1,400 students from
Begich, Central, Clark and Romig Middle Schools. 

The tour is designed to encourage today`s middle school students to realize
their potential and strive to acquire strong math and science skills. The
program included an interactive and inspirational program by Dr. Harris, a
demonstration on space and engaging dialogue about achieving goals. 

"It is critical that American students are prepared with the problem-solving
skills and tools to tackle challenges they may face in the future. Providing
them with a strong foundation in math and science education is imperative, and
with The Dream Tour, I hope to inspire students to pursue studies and careers in
these fields," said Dr. Harris. 

From humble beginnings in San Antonio to making history as the first African
American to walk in space, Dr. Harris is a living example of achieving high
aspirations. His story provides a powerful backdrop to bring his message to
students in cities across America. Since 2008, Dr. Harris has encouraged almost
35,000 middle school students in more than 20 cities nationwide. This year, The
Dream Tour will visit Anchorage, Baton Rouge, Billings, Cleveland, Denver,
Nashville, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco as Dr. Harris
continues to motivate and inspire students to pursue math and science. 

"ExxonMobil is focused on the need to attract more of America`s students to
higher level math and science courses in secondary school. The classes they
choose today can make or break their options for the future, and `The Dream
Tour, presented by ExxonMobil,` is one way to expose them to the possibilities,"
said Gerald McElvy, President, ExxonMobil Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Microsoft is still seeing a lot of interest in its Windows 7 computer software launched last year and a new budget cycle will help a gradual recovery in business spending, its chief operating officer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of interest in the Windows 7 refresh," Kevin Turner told an audience at the London School of Economics on Wednesday. "There's lots of momentum around that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turner said Microsoft would sell 300 million copies this year of Windows 7, the new version of the software that runs more than nine in 10 of the world's PCs, but said the picture was mixed globally, with varying rates of economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has sold 90 million copies of Windows 7 so far since its October 2009 launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One absolute I can tell you is that at least in 2010 most people are on new budget cycles, which is helpful, but ... they're still being conservative," he said. "I think it's going to be more a gradual thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 0.4 percent in New York at 1520 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong sales of Windows 7 helped Microsoft post a bigger-than-expected 60 percent jump in quarterly profit in January, and it said it expected business technology spending to recover this year. But the world's biggest software company made no specific profit or revenue forecasts, citing economic volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BACK TO BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his speech, Turner said it was "time to get back to business" after what Microsoft has repeatedly called an economic reset, rather than just a recession from which the world economy would simply recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft's own spending would not return to previous levels in many areas after cost cuts, but Microsoft was at the same time increasing research and development spending to a record $9.5 billion this year, more than any company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was keen to invest in fast-growing, emerging economies, Turner said, but would continue to be cautious about China because of widespread piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until we can work with China to respect intellectual property -- I think the last numbers I got were about 98 percent usage share and about 10 percent paid share -- I think it's a real barrier from a software standpoint," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, there's work to be done by the Chinese government to improve IPR (intellectual property rights), or else that nation won't achieve its potential, in our view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about rival Google, whose activities Microsoft has urged competitors to complain about to competition regulators, Turner said: "Every competitor we have makes us a better company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not comment specifically on complaints to the European Commission about Google's practices -- some of which Google has said came from companies related to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A closely watched experimental Alzheimer's drug from Medivation Inc (MDVN.O) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) failed to meet the main goals of a late-stage clinical trial, sending Medivation shares down 67 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clinical failure of the drug Dimebon is a blow to efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease, the memory-robbing degenerative condition that afflicts 26 million people globally. Current drugs, such as Pfizer's Aricept, have a minimal effect in improving symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimebon also did not meet its secondary efficacy goals in the 598-patient Phase 3 trial, known as Connection, whose results were released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results were unexpected and we are disappointed, especially for all these patients with Alzheimer's and their caregivers," Medivation Chief Executive Officer David Hung said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results dealt a severe setback to Medivation and were a big disappointment for Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker. Pfizer has made a big push to develop drugs for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theories exist on how Alzheimer's disease develops, but the definitive cause remains elusive. It continues to be a hot area of research for drugmakers such as Pfizer and Eli Lilly (LLY.N) that can take high-risk, high-reward gambles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most other Alzheimer's drugs in late-stage research development focus on a protein known as amyloid, Dimebon had seemed to work in Alzheimer's patients by preventing damage to mitochondria, tiny units of cells that supply energy, Medivation previously said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all felt it was very promising," said Maria Carrillo, director of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association, which provides grants for early-stage research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were very interested in that mechanism of action and hopeful that that could lead to other avenues of research, and we think that perhaps it still can," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, whose shares fell 1.4 percent, said it was evaluating the data to determine next steps for the development of Dimebon, which was found to be well tolerated in a separate late-stage study designed to look at safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A smaller earlier trial had generated excitement about Dimebon, also known as latrepirdine, because it strongly suggested the medicine can improve memory and functioning among patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consensus analyst forecasts for Dimebon had been that it would reach $600 million in sales by 2014, according to Thomson Reuters, with many on Wall Street predicting it could be an eventual blockbuster should it have worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the drug has generated controversy because it had only been tested in Russia and because there is uncertainty about how Dimebon works in Alzheimer's patients. The drug was first sold in Russia as an antihistamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 15 percent of Medivation's shares outstanding were held as short interest as of February 12, representing bearish bets against the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the financial losers on Wednesday was Medivation CEO Hung, who held about 4 percent of the company's outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main goals of the Connection trial, which enrolled patients with mild to moderate forms of Alzheimer's, were improvement in cognition and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients either got 20 milligrams of Dimebon, five milligrams or a placebo.

&lt;p&gt; * Phase 3 study did not meet main or secondary goals * Results on Dimebon drug were highly anticipated * Medivation shares plunge 67.2 percent * Pfizer shares fall 1.4 percent  (Adds Medivation CEO comments, advocacy group comments) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - A closely watched experimental Alzheimer's drug from Medivation Inc (MDVN.O) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) failed to meet the main goals of a late-stage clinical trial, sending Medivation shares down 67 percent.

Theories exist on how Alzheimer's disease develops, but the definitive cause remains elusive. It continues to be a hot area of research for drugmakers such as Pfizer and Eli Lilly (LLY.N) that can take high-risk, high-reward gambles. While most other Alzheimer's drugs in late-stage research development focus on a protein known as amyloid, Dimebon had seemed to work in Alzheimer's patients by preventing damage to mitochondria, tiny units of cells that supply energy, Medivation previously said. We all felt it was very promising, said Maria Carrillo, director of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association, which provides grants for early-stage research. We were very interested in that mechanism of action and hopeful that that could lead to other avenues of research, and we think that perhaps it still can, she said. Pfizer, whose shares fell 1.4 percent, said it was evaluating the data to determine next steps for the development of Dimebon, which was found to be well tolerated in a separate late-stage study designed to look at safety.

The drug was first sold in Russia as an antihistamine. About 15 percent of Medivation's shares outstanding were held as short interest as of Feb. 12, representing bearish bets against the company. Among the financial losers on Wednesday was Medivation CEO Hung, who held about 4 percent of the company's outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters. The main goals of the Connection trial, which enrolled patients with mild to moderate forms of Alzheimer's, were improvement in cognition and function. Patients either got 20 milligrams of Dimebon, five milligrams or a placebo. Each group took the pills three times a day for six months. No statistically significant improvements were seen for the 20-milligram group for either main goal. Hung said the companies were surprised at how well some of the patients did on the placebo, which may have contributed to the study failing to meet its goals. He said it was too early to speculate whether the companies would end development of Dimebon, for which several other late-stage studies have been ongoing. Given these data we have to re-evaluate the whole program, and we are doing that, Hung said. Medivation also has been developing Dimebon for Huntington's disease, a hereditary disease that causes loss of brain cells and mental deterioration, but the results of Connection significantly decrease the chances the drug will work in Huntington's, said JPMorgan analyst Geoff Meacham.

&lt;p&gt;HANNOVER, Germany &amp; PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS) (Euronext Paris: #13065, DSY.PA) (Paris:DSY), a world
leader in 3D and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions, and IBM (NYSE:
IBM) announced today that MEYER WERFT, one of the world`s leading cruise ship
builders, has selected the Dassault Syst&#232;mes V6 PLM platform for collaborative
product development. IBM Global Business Services (GBS) will provide
transformation consulting, implementation and integration services to improve
time, quality and cost in the yard`s engineering and manufacturing processes. 

MEYER WERFT is one of the leading cruise ships builders with customers from all
over the world. Since its foundation in 1795, six generations of the Meyer
family have established the company`s excellent reputation as a builder of
special-purpose ships such as car and passenger ferries, gas tankers, and luxury
cruise vessels. Building cruise ships requires the management of more than 10
million different parts in design and production logistics. This puts
exceptionally high requirements on the features and performance of a PLM system,
as compared to other industries. 

MEYER WERFT has been looking for a next-generation Product Lifecycle Management
solution that would support growing efficiency in design and production, and
boost its ability to innovate and manage the increasing complexity of luxury
cruise ships. 

Already a leading user of Dassault Syst&#232;mes` CATIA shipbuilding solution, MEYER
WERFT conducted an extensive benchmark, beginning in 2009, and selected Dassault
Systemes V6 platform and IBM GBS expertise for consulting, implementation and
integration of the new PLM platform. IBM will be partner for definition and
design of process of all development projects of MEYER WERFT. 

"In order to stay the most innovative and efficient shipyard in the world, PLM
is a key enabler for us allowing us to manage the increasing complexity of our
ships in more effective ways " said Lambert Kruse, Managing Director, MEYER
WERFT. "Our decision for the V6 solution was based on several key factors,
including its powerful combination of 3D and PLM infrastructure, as well as
IBM`s and DS`s commitment to partnership and openness." 

IBM Global Business Services is MEYER WERFT`s Partner to leverage the business
potential of V6 PLM in the MEYER WERFT process and IT landscape. Therefore IBM
GBS will be responsible for the project management as well as the organizational
change management. Furthermore IBM consultants will design a sustainable
architecture for an efficient integration of V6 PLM with the existing
application and process environment based on long term experiences in the
service oriented architecture (SOA) together with MEYER WERFT. With V6, MEYER
WERFT will be able to provide to a broad internal audience an intuitive online
access to the comprehensive 3D definition and product data of their ships in
design and production. 

"We are happy to continue our successful long term relationship with MEYER
WERFT. 

Consulting services play a crucial role in today`s challenging PLM programs."
said Martin Jetter, General Manager IBM Germany. "IBM is positioned excellently
to support MEYER WERFT in this business critical transformation project with
long term customer insight and strong process and technology capabilities in the
PLM space." 

"We are very happy to be MEYER WERFT`s partner for their next-generation PLM
implementation. We both believe that long term partnership creates mutual
values" said Bernard Charl&#232;s, President and CEO, Dassault Syst&#232;mes. &#171;MEYER WERFT
builds magnificent and highly complex ships, involving uniquely skilled and
knowledgeable people from design to construction and delivery, in a wide variety
of disciplines. With V6 PLM, we provide a new level of ease of use, and wider
discipline coverage, making it possible to collaborate with 3D Lifelike
experiences, and therefore improve quality of understanding and communication
for all actors involved".

that its sulfur conversion unit briefly tripped offline at its
562,500 barrel-per-day refinery in Baytown, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I can tell you there was no impact to production," said
Kevin Allexon, a spokesman for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neely Nelson, the refinery spokeswoman, said the unit was
immediately brought back on line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A second incident at the plant, reported on the community
information line, involved odor coming from near the refinery's
tank farm. It was not immediately evident if the source was
Baytown or another facility, she said.

&lt;p&gt; * COO says customers conservative, recovery will be gradual&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * expects to sell 300 million copies of Windows 7 this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * cautious about investing in China&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds comments on Google, China; shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Georgina Prodhan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) is still
seeing a lot of interest in its Windows 7 computer software
launched last year and a new budget cycle will help a gradual
recovery in business spending, its chief operating officer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have a lot of interest in the Windows 7 refresh," Kevin
Turner told an audience at the London School of Economics on
Wednesday. "There's lots of momentum around that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turner said Microsoft would sell 300 million copies this
year of Windows 7, the new version of the software that runs
more than nine in 10 of the world's PCs, but said the picture
was mixed globally, with varying rates of economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has sold 90 million copies of Windows 7 so far
since its October 2009 launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One absolute I can tell you is that at least in 2010 most
people are on new budget cycles, which is helpful, but ...
they're still being conservative," he said. "I think it's going
to be more a gradual thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were up 0.4 percent in New York at 1520
GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strong sales of Windows 7 helped Microsoft post a
bigger-than-expected 60 percent jump in quarterly profit in
January, and it said it expected business technology spending to
recover this year. But the world's biggest software company made
no specific profit or revenue forecasts, citing economic
volatility. [ID:nN27150165]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BACK TO BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his speech, Turner said it was "time to get back to
business" after what Microsoft has repeatedly called an economic
reset, rather than just a recession from which the world economy
would simply recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Microsoft's own spending would not return to
previous levels in many areas after cost cuts, but Microsoft was
at the same time increasing research and development spending to
a record $9.5 billion this year, more than any company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was keen to invest in fast-growing, emerging
economies, Turner said, but would continue to be cautious about
China because of widespread piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Until we can work with China to respect intellectual
property -- I think the last numbers I got were about 98 percent
usage share and about 10 percent paid share -- I think it's a
real barrier from a software standpoint," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly, there's work to be done by the Chinese government
to improve IPR (intellectual property rights), or else that
nation won't achieve its potential, in our view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked about rival Google (GOOG.O), whose activities
Microsoft has urged competitors to complain about to competition
regulators, Turner said: "Every competitor we have makes us a
better company." [ID:NN26216782]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not comment specifically on complaints to the
European Commission about Google's practices -- some of which
Google has said came from companies related to Microsoft.

&lt;p&gt;Be First in the United States to See Movies Like Never Before, Exclusively at
AMC Pleasure Island 24
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
AMC Theatres&#174; (AMC), a leading theatrical exhibition and entertainment company,

superior fashion when the AMC Enhanced Theatre Experience (ETXTM) makes its U.S.

Disney World&#174; Resort. 

ETX includes a 20-percent larger screen, 3D technology, digital projection and
an upgraded sound system. Specifically, the digital projection system produces
images comprised of 2 million pixels, which delivers a higher resolution than
HD. This eye-popping image is then showcased on a wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling
screen that immerses guests in the image. 

The ETX auditorium also boasts 12 audio channels fueled by 50,000 watts of
power, which is a major upgrade and three times the power of typical auditoriums
with six audio channels. As a result of this improved sight and sound
experience, guests will not simply watch a movie. They will live it in ETX. 

"We are proud to launch our new ETX concept for the first time in the United
States at AMC Pleasure Island 24," said John McDonald, executive vice president,
U.S. operations. "We truly believe this premier location at Downtown Disney
deserves the absolute best entertainment experience AMC can offer, and ETX is
the cornerstone of that experience." 

The high-tech, state-of-the-art ETX auditorium will feature Walt Disney Studios
Motion Pictures` "ALICE IN WONDERLAND" in 3D when the movie opens across the
United States on March 5. 

"With the upgraded screen and sound system, in addition to the premium viewing
experience digital cinema offers, we believe our guests at AMC Pleasure Island
24 will walk away with a new perception of how movies should be delivered," said
McDonald. 

Movies shown in the ETX auditorium will cost $2 more, while 3D titles such as
"ALICE IN WONDERLAND" will cost $4 more to see it in ETX. For more information

&lt;p&gt;  CAMBRIDGE, MA, Mar 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
WebLayers today announced that Aetna, one of the nation's leading
diversified health care benefits companies, has selected WebLayers
software to help the company gain greater visibility into its information
technology (I.T.) infrastructure and development processes.

    Part of Aetna's I.T. strategy is to enable the company to proactively
respond to potential shifts in the health care industry including
government regulations and globalization. To achieve these goals and
improve the customer experience, Aetna is more closely linking I.T. with
its business goals through a services oriented architecture (SOA) based
on IBM technology and WebLayers' automated, distributed governance
software.

    "Aetna is constantly working to further adapt its flexible and responsive
I.T. infrastructure in order to more quickly respond to changing market
trends," said Michael Mathias, vice president &amp; Chief Technology Officer,
Aetna. "Through the use of our services oriented architecture (SOA),
which is supported by IBM technology and complemented by WebLayers'
automated, distributed governance software, we can more successfully
compete in the dynamic health care marketplace."

    As a central point for governing the company's mainframe, Java and web
services, WebLayers' automated, governance software ensures that
potential policy violations in the software development life cycle are
proactively identified and addressed before they have a negative impact
on the business. From a broad industry perspective, policy violations in
software code can result in erroneous data, system failures and an
overall decrease in productivity and customer satisfaction. 

    "Playing a critical role in Aetna's I.T. strategy not only demonstrates
the insurer's commitment to WebLayers, it also underscores the value of
our long-standing business partner relationship with IBM," said Jeff
Papows, president and CEO, WebLayers. 

    Additionally, WebLayers is helping Aetna prevent the duplication of
development efforts, the creation of unauthorized web services and to
facilitate the appropriate cataloging and reuse of approved web services.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is set to make a near $4 billion offer for German generic drug maker Ratiopharm GmbH this week, competing with bids from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Actavis, several sources familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, had previously cooled on Ratiopharm, however it was asked to rejoin the auction and present its bid to Ratiopharm's board and management, two sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer was expected to "be competitive" with a rival offer from Iceland's Actavis, one source said, adding Pfizer could still walk away without submitting a binding offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction could linger several more weeks, with a decision unlikely before the end of the month, a second source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several sources told Reuters in February that Teva and Iceland's Actavis would be bidding for Ratiopharm. One source said at the time that the offer from Actavis was the highest, at close to 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would make the deal the biggest generics takeover since Teva's $7.5 billion purchase of U.S. rival Barr, announced in July 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial heir Ludwig Merckle put Ratiopharm on the block as part of concessions made to creditors by his father Adolf Merckle, who committed suicide in January 2009 after ceding control of his business empire to lenders during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Ratiopharm declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Pfizer were down 0.85 percent and Teva shares were up 0.61 percent at 1157 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is joining drug majors such as Sanofi-Aventis and Novartis who have coupled their traditional research-based drugs businesses with generics arms to turn the loss of patent exclusivity -- at least in part -- to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs representing annual sales of $95 billion are facing generic competition in the years 2009 to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugmaker has struck a string of collaboration deals and acquisitions to bolster its range of generics, particularly injectable drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alliance with India's Strides Arcolab Ltd in January marked the latest step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tie-up with Ratiopharm could help Pfizer reduce costs at its generic pills business, analysts at Credit Suisse said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer derives more than $10 billion in sales from off-patent drugs at its so-called "established products" unit -- to a large part from its own medicines that have lost exclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Hall and Ritsuko Ando in New York, Deena Beasley in Los Angeles, Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Phil Berlowitz and Sharon Lindores)&lt;/p&gt;

In CONNECTION Study, Dimebon Does Not Meet Primary and Secondary Efficacy
Endpoints

Separate Phase 3 Safety Study Demonstrates Dimebon`s Tolerability When Used
Alone orin Combination with Approved Alzheimer`s Disease Medicines

Medivation to Hold Investor Call at 8:30 a.m. EST
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Medivation, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDVN)todayannounced
results from two Phase 3 trials of the investigational drug dimebon
(latrepirdine*) in patients with Alzheimer`s disease (AD). In the CONNECTION
trial, dimebon did not meet its co-primary or secondary efficacy endpoints
compared to placebo. Co-primary endpoints were measures of cognition and global
function. 

"The results from the CONNECTION study are unexpected, and we are disappointed
for the Alzheimer`s community," said Dr. David Hung, president and chief
executive officer of Medivation. "We are working with our colleagues at Pfizer
to better understand the CONNECTION data and we plan to present these data at an
upcoming medical meeting." 

Dimebon was well tolerated in both the CONNECTION study and in a separate Phase
3 safety and tolerability study, which confirmed dimebon`s tolerability when
dosed alone or in combination with approved Alzheimer`s disease medicines. 

"We are evaluating the CONNECTION data with Medivation. After that review,
Pfizer will be in a position to determine appropriate next steps regarding the
dimebon program," said Dr. Briggs W. Morrison, senior vice president, clinical
development, Primary Care Business Unit at Pfizer. "We recognize the significant
medical need, and we are committed to advancing treatment options for
Alzheimer`s disease." 

About the CONNECTION Study

CONNECTION is a Phase 3, multi-national, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety
and efficacy trial involving 598 patients with mild-to-moderate AD at 63 sites
in North America, Europe, and South America. Patients had a mean age of 74.4
years and a mean score of 17.7 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) upon
entry into the study. More than 40 percent of the patients enrolled were in the
United States. In the study, patients were randomized to one of three treatment
groups, receiving dimebon 20 mg three times a day (TID), dimebon 5 mg TID, or
placebo TID for six months. The 5 mg arm was included in the study to help
define the effective dose range for dimebon treatment. 

No statistically significant improvements for the 20 mg TID group relative to
placebo were achieved on the co-primary endpoints. One primary endpoint
evaluated the effect of dimebon on cognition, as measured by the Alzheimer's
Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), and showed that
dimebon-treated patients achieved a 0.1 point difference from patients receiving
placebo (p=0.86). Neither group was significantly changed from baseline. The
other primary endpoint evaluated the effect of dimebon on independently-rated
global function over the course of the six-month trial, as measured by the
Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input
(CIBIC-plus; p=0.81). According to the CIBIC-plus scale, 64.9 percent of the
patients treated with dimebon 20 mg TID showed improvement or no change at Week
26 compared to 65.4 percent of placebo-treated patients. Results for the dimebon
5 mg dose were similar to the dimebon 20 mg and placebo, although they were
numerically lower. 

The 20 mg TID dimebon-treated patients also showed no statistically significant
differences compared to placebo on the secondary efficacy endpoints. After six
months of treatment, patients treated with dimebon showed a 0.4 point difference
from patients taking placebo on activities of daily living (p=0.61), as measured
by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Scale
(ADCS-ADL). Neither group was significantly changed from baseline. The
dimebon-treated group showed a 1.6 point improvement on behavior compared to
placebo (p=0.17), as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Compared
to baseline, each group was improved, but this change was only significant for
the dimebon group. On the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), another measure
of cognition, both groups improved significantly over baseline (dimebon 0.7;
placebo 1.2). The difference favoring placebo was not significant (p=0.10).
Results for the dimebon 5 mg dose were similar to dimebon 20 mg and placebo,
although they were numerically lower. Dimebon, 20 mg orally three-times daily,
was well tolerated in the study. The number of patients with at least one
adverse event was similar in the dimebon 20 mg and placebo groups (72.0% vs.
74.2%, respectively). The most frequently reported adverse events (&gt;5%) in
patients in the 20 mg dimebon group occurring more commonly than in the placebo
group included somnolence (11.0% vs. 10.1%), dry mouth (8.5% vs. 6.6%), headache
(9.5% vs. 5.6%), dizziness (7.5% vs. 5.1%), constipation (5.5% vs. 3.5%), cough
(7.5% vs. 3.5%) and depression (6.0% vs. 3.5%). Similar rates of adverse events
were observed for the 5 mg TID group. No clinically significant findings were
noted in assessment of vital signs, clinical laboratories or on
electrocardiography (ECG). 

About the Phase 3 Safety and Tolerability Study

In a separate multi-center, placebo-controlled Phase 3 safety and tolerability
study, dimebon was well tolerated when given alone or in combination with a
variety of other AD medicines, including cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine,
or both. Previous studies have confirmed the tolerability of dimebon alone. The
Phase 3 safety and tolerability study enrolled 742 patients with
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer`s disease in the United States and Canada. In this
study, patients were randomized to either dimebon 20 mg three-times daily or
placebo and were treated for a period of either three or six months.
Approximately 85 percent of patients were taking one or more currently approved
Alzheimer`s disease medicines while participating in this study. 

Dimebon was well tolerated in the study. The most frequently reported adverse
events (&gt;5%) in the dimebon group occurring more commonly than in the placebo
group were somnolence (5.1% vs. 1.9%) and fatigue (5.1% vs. 2.4%). No clinically
significant findings were noted in assessment of vital signs, clinical
laboratories or on electrocardiography (ECG). 

About Dimebon

Dimebon (latrepirdine*) is an investigational oral medication being tested as a
potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease and Huntington disease. Dimebon is
being studied in four other ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
Phase 3 studies, which currently are enrolling. The CONCERT trial is a 12-month
study testing dimebon in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer`s disease who
are taking donepezil, a commonly prescribed Alzheimer`s disease medication. The
CONTACT and CONSTELLATION trials are six-month trials testing dimebon in
patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer`s disease taking currently approved
AD medications. In CONTACT, subjects must also be taking donepezil, while in
CONSTELLATION they must also be taking memantine, another commonly prescribed
Alzheimer`s disease medication. Dimebon is also being tested in the HORIZON
trial, a six-month study evaluating dimebon in patients with Huntington disease.

Phase 3 safety and tolerability study enrolled 742 patients with
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer`s disease in the United States and Canada. In this
study, patients were randomized to either dimebon 20 mg three-times daily or
placebo and were treated for a period of either three or six months.
Approximately 85 percent of patients were taking one or more currently approved
Alzheimer`s disease medicines while participating in this study. 

Dimebon was well tolerated in the study. The most frequently reported adverse
events (&gt;5%) in the dimebon group occurring more commonly than in the placebo
group were somnolence (5.1% vs. 1.9%) and fatigue (5.1% vs. 2.4%). No clinically
significant findings were noted in assessment of vital signs, clinical
laboratories or on electrocardiography (ECG). 

About Dimebon

Dimebon (latrepirdine*) is an investigational oral medication being tested as a
potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease and Huntington disease. Dimebon is
being studied in four other ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
Phase 3 studies, which currently are enrolling. The CONCERT trial is a 12-month
study testing dimebon in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer`s disease who
are taking donepezil, a commonly prescribed Alzheimer`s disease medication. The
CONTACT and CONSTELLATION trials are six-month trials testing dimebon in
patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer`s disease taking currently approved
AD medications. In CONTACT, subjects must also be taking donepezil, while in
CONSTELLATION they must also be taking memantine, another commonly prescribed
Alzheimer`s disease medication. Dimebon is also being tested in the HORIZON
trial, a six-month study evaluating dimebon in patients with Huntington disease.

About Alzheimer`s Disease

Alzheimer`s disease is a progressive degenerative brain disorder that gradually
destroys a person's memory and ability to learn, reason, make judgments,
communicate and carry out daily activities. As the disease progresses, patients
may experience changes in personality and behavior, such as delusions,
hallucinations, anxiety and agitation.

&lt;p&gt;HORSHAM, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Quality Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:QSII) and leading provider of healthcare
information systems and connectivity solutions, today announced it has been
recognized as a winner of the Microsoft Healthcare Users Group (MS-HUG) 2010
Innovation Awards in the category of Interoperability/HIE. The award was
presented jointly to NextGen Healthcare and Doylestown Hospital, a
comprehensive, community-focused, multi-facility organization serving patients
and families in suburban Philadelphia, for its use of NextGen Health Information
Exchange-formerly NextGen Community Health Solution (CHS)-to launch the
Doylestown Clinical Network (DCN). The companies were honored yesterday at an
awards ceremony held at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems
Society (HIMSS) Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition in Atlanta. 

Doylestown Hospital utilizes NextGen Health Information Exchange to facilitate
secure data exchange among DCN participants, which includes more than 400
independent physicians practicing in 42 specialties at more than 100 practices.
This data exchange has enabled Doylestown Hospital to realize greater overall
patient care efficiency and quality. Specific benefits include:

* Efficient, error-free communication. NextGen Health Information Exchange
provides a secure central repository for patient data exchange, eliminating
potential errors from re-keyed information. DCN participants access clinical
data via either an automatic method-data is automatically imported into
patients` electronic charts-or a manual method that allows them to review data
categories individually before importing them into charts. 
* Medication management. Doylestown Hospital earned a five-star safety rating in
part because NextGen Health Information Exchange provides patient medication
profiles and a complete medication database updated quarterly, with formulary
compliance checking for accurate electronic prescription generation. 
* Diagnostic speed and accuracy. DCN providers view active problem
profiles-categorized as "resolved" or "unresolved"-for each patient, documented
by physicians across the care continuum. Date of onset and resolution for each
problem is listed. Providers also see all current and historical diagnostic
studies, reports and images (e.g., x-ray, ECG).

In addition, DCN physicians have realized time savings per patient encounter
simply from the ability to access current medication lists, freeing valuable
time for more thorough discussion and exam. Shared documentation of histories,
physicals, and progress notes via pre-built, problem-based templates decreases
documentation time while also aiding accuracy. 

"Being recognized for our use of NextGen technology is a tremendous honor," said
Richard Lang, vice president and CIO for Doylestown Hospital. "The
interconnected technologies can streamline workflow and empower physicians to
create comprehensive, longitudinal patient charts for more timely and accurate
decisions at the point of care. The end result is the ultimate goal - more
efficient, better quality patient care." 

"While few health information exchanges have achieved true success, the
Doylestown Clinical Network is demonstrating positive results including time
savings and an increase in the quality of patient care," said Steve Aylward,
general manager, U.S. Health and Life Sciences, Microsoft. "NextGen Health
Information Exchange, utilized by DCN, is a great example of how technology
built on Microsoft`s .NET platform can provide interoperability without
requiring practices to have similar initial IT configurations." 

"NextGen Health Information Exchange is a proven platform for facilitating
connectivity across communities nationwide," said Scott Decker, president of
NextGen Healthcare. "We applaud Doylestown Hospital for sharing in this MS-HUG
recognition with us and for demonstrating how our technology really pushes the
envelope to enhance content driven-clinical workflow." 

Now in their 13th year of rewarding excellence in healthcare technology, the
Microsoft HUG 2010 Innovation Awards showcase organizations that promote
breakthroughs by enhancing the quality of patient care, reducing costs,
streamlining clinical and business processes, driving interoperability,
improving productivity and workflow, and enabling informed decisions. Award
contestants are evaluated on how they provide significant business benefits to
healthcare organizations and improve patient care.

This news release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the federal securities laws. Statements regarding future events, developments,
the Company's future performance, as well as management's expectations, beliefs,
intentions, plans, estimates or projections relating to the future (including,
without limitation, statements concerning revenue and net income), are
forward-looking statements within the meaning of these laws and involve a number
of risks and uncertainties. Management believes that these forward-looking
statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions and forecasts,
however, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements that speak only
as of the date hereof. Moreover, these forward-looking statements are subject to
a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outlined below. As a
result, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated by the
forward-looking statements. Among the important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking
statements are: volume and timing of systems sales and installations; length of
sales cycles and installation process; the possibility that the products will
not achieve market acceptance; seasonal patterns of sales and customer buying
behavior; the development by competitors of new or superior technologies; the
timing, cost and success or failure of new product and service introductions,
development and product upgrade releases; undetected errors or bugs in software;
product liability; changing economic, political or regulatory influences in the
health-care industry; changes in product-pricing policies; availability of
third-party products and components; competitive pressures including product
offerings, pricing and promotional activities; the Company's ability or
inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; possible regulation of the
Company's software by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; uncertainties
concerning threatened, pending and new litigation against the Company including
related professional services fees; uncertainties concerning the amount and
timing of professional fees incurred by the Company generally; changes of
accounting estimates and assumptions used to prepare the prior periods'
financial statements; general economic conditions; and the risk factors detailed
from time to time in Quality Systems' periodic reports and registration
statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A significant
portion of the Company's quarterly sales of software product licenses and
computer hardware is concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter,
generally with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final ten business
days of that month. Due to these and other factors, the Company's revenues and
operating results are very difficult to forecast. A major portion of the
Company's costs and expenses, such as personnel and facilities, are of a fixed
nature and, accordingly, a shortfall or decline in quarterly and/or annual
revenues typically results in lower profitability or losses. As a result,
comparison of the Company's period-to-period financial performance is not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future
performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

&lt;p&gt;Breakthrough Application Enables Non-Developers to Automate Everyday Business
Processes with Microsoft SharePoint
RESTON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Bamboo Solutions, the leading provider of technologies that enhance Microsoft
SharePoint, announced today the availability of Workflow Conductor, a new
application suite designed to enable business process automation. Workflow
Conductor augments Bamboo`s extensive portfolio of add-ons and companion tools
for Microsoft SharePoint.  With Workflow Conductor, Bamboo is challenging
traditional barriers to broader adoption of business process automation,
including ease of use, cost of ownership, and integration with existing IT
infrastructure.  

Workflow Conductor is optimized for business users such as program managers,
project managers, and other information workers across the enterprise.  Workflow
Conductor features an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface that enables
automation of everyday business processes without coding or IT intervention.

"Bamboo is an interesting new player in the workflow space," comments David
Mann, author of Workflow in the 2007 Microsoft Office System.  "Competition can
only bring good things to this part of the SharePoint ecosystem.  I am following
the development of Workflow Conductor closely.  Assuming Bamboo leverages their
existing portfolio of SharePoint Web Parts, they have an opportunity to
challenge some of the traditional leaders in this space."

Bamboo seeks to make business process automation through SharePoint easier and
more affordable for the small to medium enterprise, where cost of ownership has
been a barrier to adoption. Priced at only $4,500 per server, including annual
support, Workflow Conductor provides an innovative feature set at a fraction of
the cost of other workflow solutions.

Workflow Conductor is built on Microsoft`s Windows Workflow Foundation, ensuring
long term compatibility with key Microsoft technologies, including SharePoint,
Microsoft Office, and the .NET platform. Workflow Conductor will leverage
Microsoft`s ongoing investments in Windows Workflow Foundation to provide new
features and capabilities in future versions.

"Our vision for Workflow Conductor includes interoperability with both local
systems and hosted instances of SharePoint, including SharePoint Online, and
cloud-based environments built on platforms like Microsoft Azure," says Mike
Tanner, CEO of Bamboo Solutions. "Workflow Conductor will leverage our existing
portfolio of products and our upcoming line of Cloud PartsTM, to automate 
business processes that extend beyond the firewall."

Workflow Conductor is available now for download, trial, and purchase on the
Bamboo Web site (www.bamboosolutions.com). An optional premium support package
is also available.

&lt;p&gt;  ST. PAUL, MN, Mar 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Shavlik Technologies, LLC, the market leader in simplifying and
automating critical IT operations, today announced the Shavlik
SCUPdates(TM) catalog which delivers update information from multiple
vendors -- like Adobe or Apple -- to Microsoft's System Center
Configuration Manager (SCCM). More and more organizations today are
leveraging the power of SCCM to assess, deploy and update Windows
systems. By using the Shavlik SCUPdates catalog, SCCM users now have a
single workflow for deploying updates for both Microsoft and
non-Microsoft applications.

    "We need to get better on patching non-Microsoft applications. But every
3rd party patch is a custom one-off that takes our staff 2-3 days to
setup plus it requires a separate push of the update and separate reboot.
We don't have the kind of bandwidth needed to become more aggressive,"
said the IT operations manager at a global electronics distributor
managing more than 10,000 systems with SCCM. "Because SCUPdates merges
patching 3rd party applications within the SCCM workflow, we get a single
patch process, single reboot, and single way to report status. We get a
'one and done' approach without adding people or time to the process."

    Shavlik SCUPdates provides a single, trusted source for updates from
multiple vendors, products, and product versions. Without it, customers
would have to research and write their own SCUP catalogs for every patch
required by each non-Microsoft application and version, a process which
is both time-consuming and expensive.

    "Without Shavlik SCUPdates, SCCM can only patch current Microsoft
operating systems and applications," said Mark Shavlik, CEO, Shavlik
Technologies. "With Shavlik SCUPdates, we provide the updates for a host
of popular applications. Rather than spend hours and hours to research
and create their own detection logic for these applications,
administrators can leverage Shavlik's patch data and get coverage for
multiple vendors, multiple products from a single, trusted source.
Researching and creating this data is at the core of what we do every day
and it's a key part of our drive to simplify complex network security and
management." 

    Shavlik SCUPdates leverages the firepower of the Shavlik data team along
with the detection logic of the company's award-winning Shavlik NetChk
Protect technology to generate the data needed to accurately patch
non-Microsoft software applications that are among the most attacked
applications. That list includes Adobe Reader(R), Adobe Flash(R), Sun
Java(R), Firefox(R), Apple iTunes(R) and others. The four most attacked
applications of 2009 were non-Microsoft applications.

&lt;p&gt;  ST. PAUL, MN, Mar 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Shavlik Technologies, LLC, the market leader in simplifying and
automating critical IT operations, today announced the Shavlik
SCUPdates(TM) catalog which delivers update information from multiple
vendors -- like Adobe or Apple -- to Microsoft's System Center
Configuration Manager (SCCM). More and more organizations today are
leveraging the power of SCCM to assess, deploy and update Windows
systems. By using the Shavlik SCUPdates catalog, SCCM users now have a
single workflow for deploying updates for both Microsoft and
non-Microsoft applications.

    "We need to get better on patching non-Microsoft applications. But every
3rd party patch is a custom one-off that takes our staff 2-3 days to
setup plus it requires a separate push of the update and separate reboot.
We don't have the kind of bandwidth needed to become more aggressive,"
said the IT operations manager at a global electronics distributor
managing more than 10,000 systems with SCCM. "Because SCUPdates merges
patching 3rd party applications within the SCCM workflow, we get a single
patch process, single reboot, and single way to report status. We get a
'one and done' approach without adding people or time to the process."

    Shavlik SCUPdates provides a single, trusted source for updates from
multiple vendors, products, and product versions. Without it, customers
would have to research and write their own SCUP catalogs for every patch
required by each non-Microsoft application and version, a process which
is both time-consuming and expensive.

    "Without Shavlik SCUPdates, SCCM can only patch current Microsoft
operating systems and applications," said Mark Shavlik, CEO, Shavlik
Technologies. "With Shavlik SCUPdates, we provide the updates for a host
of popular applications. Rather than spend hours and hours to research
and create their own detection logic for these applications,
administrators can leverage Shavlik's patch data and get coverage for
multiple vendors, multiple products from a single, trusted source.
Researching and creating this data is at the core of what we do every day
and it's a key part of our drive to simplify complex network security and
management." 

    Shavlik SCUPdates leverages the firepower of the Shavlik data team along
with the detection logic of the company's award-winning Shavlik NetChk
Protect technology to generate the data needed to accurately patch
non-Microsoft software applications that are among the most attacked
applications. That list includes Adobe Reader(R), Adobe Flash(R), Sun
Java(R), Firefox(R), Apple iTunes(R) and others. The four most attacked
applications of 2009 were non-Microsoft applications.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - IBM sees strong market potential for "smart grids" power distribution systems in China as the country seeks ways to use energy more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology giants including Google Inc, Cisco and Microsoft are investing heavily in smart grids, intelligent power-distribution systems designed to be more responsive and interactive than today's traditional power grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of countries, China, the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter, is investing the most. Beijing plans to invest $7.3 billion in smart grid projects in 2010, more than the United States, according to Zpryme, a market research firm in Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is far behind the United States and Japan in terms of its smart grid development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is pursuing smart grids as aggressively or more aggressively than any other country in the world right now," Brad Gammons, vice-president of IBM's Global Energy  Utilities Industry, told Reuters in an embargoed interview last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're very focused and have a very strong commitment to move in that direction," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM -- which counts State Grid Corp. of China, the nation's leading power grid operator, as one of its customers -- unveiled its Energy  Utilities Solutions Lab in Beijing this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart grids include computerized monitoring of the electricity flowing though a power grid and allow utilities to manage electricity usage automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's products span the range of smart grid systems, including the automation of power stations and electricity distribution networks with the use of digital sensors and communication networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's smart grid could take five to 10 years to fully develop, said Wendy Wang, an analyst with Yuanta Securities, adding the nation is still trailing the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China offers huge growth opportunities for investors in smart grids given increased spending in the sector," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors will benefit from the transformation of the country's grid infrastructure and we will see opportunities from the building of the ultra high-voltage grid down to the development of meters and software."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM expects the China revenues of its energy and utilities division to grow by $400 million from now until 2014 as Beijing banks on "smart grids" to make the country more energy-efficient, Gammons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the company gave no detailed breakdown, a report from Macquarie Equities Research puts IBM's China revenue at $2.6 billion in 2008. IBM saw total revenue of $95.76 billion for all of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're looking at $400 million in incremental revenue over our base revenue in China over the next four years," he said. "We're making investments in China based on the grid opportunities we see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is eyeing partnerships with local companies as it seeks to expand its business in China, Gammons added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Don Durfee and Valerie Lee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today announced it will ship two security updates on Tuesday to patch eight vulnerabilities in Windows and Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its monthly advance notification , Microsoft spelled out next week's two-update Patch Tuesday, a far cry from February's massive roll-out of 13 security bulletins that fixed 26 flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downturn was not unexpected. "This is indicative of the on and off cycle that Microsoft uses," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "Last month was more OS related, this month they're patching some applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March traditionally is a slow patch month for Microsoft, Storms noted, just as February has historically been big. In March 2009, for example, Microsoft issued three bulletins, while in March 2008, it delivered four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both bulletins will be pegged as "important," Microsoft's second-highest severity rating in its four-step scoring system. The vulnerabilities in those two updates, however, allow attackers to insert malicious code onto unpatched PCs, a fact that at first glance may seem contrary to Microsoft's less-than-critical ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When Microsoft rates something 'important' but also says the vulnerability allows for remote code execution, that usuallly means there's some default state that would mitigate attacks for all users," said Storms. That state, he continued, could be a default setting that protects users, or the fact that the vulnerability is contained in a component that's not loaded by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first bulletin will address one or more vulnerabilities in Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 , and affects the most recent service packs for XP and Vista, SP3 and SP2, respectively. Both 32- and 64-bit editions of all three operating systems harbor the bugs, according to the terse description in Microsoft's notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second will quash one or more bugs in Excel 2002, Excel 2003 and Excel 2007 on Windows; Excel 2004 and Excel 2008 on the Mac; and other Excel- and file-conversion-related pieces of the Office suites. Storms pointed out that the patch will even repair the version of Excel in Office 2007 SP2. "It's the latest and greatest that's being patched," said Storms, adding that clues in the notice point toward a file format problem, most likely one in the file converter tool bundled with Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's going on?" Storms asked rhetorically. "The newer file format in 2007 is supposed to be safer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both updates deal with bugs that can be exploited only if users are tricked into opening a malicious file, Jerry Bryant, a senior manager with the Microsoft Security Research Center (MSRC), said in an entry on the center's blog today . "There are no network-based attack vectors," Bryant promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither of the bulletins match up with the outstanding security advisories that Microsoft has issued but not yet patched, including one harking back to November 2009 . At the time, Microsoft acknowledged that a bug in SMB (Server Message Block), a Microsoft-made network file and print-sharing protocol, could be used by attackers to cripple Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newer advisories, such as one last month about a bug in Internet Explorer and another issued on Monday about a flaw in VBScript, are also not on the patch list for next week, said Storms. The VBScript bug, which can be exploited via Internet Explorer, prompted Microsoft to issue an unusual warning: Don't press the F1 key .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of a patch yet for the SMB bug led Storms to speculate that Microsoft has run into problems creating and testing a fix, or has found more bugs during its investigation. "Maybe they found other issues that they wanted to clean up at the same time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also missing this month is an update from Adobe, which has taken to releasing its quarterly patches for Reader and Acrobat on Microsoft's Patch Tuesday. The next scheduled Adobe updates are to land April 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSRC's Bryant reminded users that several editions of Windows are nearing forced support retirement , including Vista RTM (April 13), Windows XP SP2 (July 13) and Windows 2000 (July 13), and urged people still running those to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release the two updates at approximately 1 p.m. ET on March 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt; * Second late-stage trial favourable for apixaban vs Lovenox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Result a boost after earlier trial failed to meet goals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * New drug vies for place in oral anticoagulant market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Kate Kelland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N) and Bristol-Myers
Squibb's (BMY.N) anti-clotting pill apixaban proved better than
standard treatment Lovenox in a late-stage knee surgery trial,
boosting prospects for the drug after earlier disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results of a second late stage trial, published in The
Lancet, also found the experimental drug did not increase the
risk of bleeding -- a danger with all anticoagulants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apixaban is one of a number of new oral anticoagulants
hoping to unseat Sanofi-Aventis's (SASY.PA) Lovenox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will compete with Boehringer Ingelheim's Pradaxa and
another drug called Xarelto from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ.N), both of which are already approved for
post-surgery use in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Rud Lassen of Horsholm Hospital and the University
of Copenhagen, who led the trial, described the results as
favourable for apixaban and said they put the new drug "in the
same ballpark as Xarelto and Pradaxa".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His team found 2.5 mg of apixaban twice a day starting the
morning after total knee replacement was "a convenient and more
effective" oral alternative to 40 mg a day of Lovenox, or
enoxaparin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results showed 15 percent of patients in the study taking
apixaban suffered either a clot, bleeding or death, compared
with 24 percent of those taking Lovenox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HUGE OPPORTUNITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A previous Phase III trial compared 2.5 mg of apixaban twice
daily with 30 mg a day of Lovenox, but failed to show apixaban
was at least as good as the Sanofi product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drug industry analysts believe oral anticoagulants that can
be used instead of warfarin represent a huge opportunity for
drugmakers -- particularly if they can also be shown to be
effective in helping to prevent strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some predict the market could eventually be worth more than
$10 billion a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer said late last year they
planned to seek regulatory approval for apixaban in Europe in
the first half of 2010. [ID:nN04168269].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doctors say older existing anticoagulants like Lovenox and
warfarin, which was first developed as rat poison, can be
problematic, inconvenient and costly to administer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lovenox has to be given as an injection and patients on
warfarin need regular blood tests and must avoid certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lassen said apixaban should now join Xarelto and Pradaxa as
a group of drugs that could release patients from warfarin and
the need for regular monitoring by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jawed Fareed from Loyola University Medical Centre in the
United States and Russell Hull of Calgary University in Canada,
who were not involved in the trial, said the data brought
doctors "potentially a step closer to the unmet need of oral
antithrombotic therapy without need for monitoring".

&lt;p&gt;The phones would be targeted at heavy users of social network sites, according to the person who asked not to be identified as the devices have not yet been announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phones are being developed by Microsoft under the code name Project Pink, the person said.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has sold 90 million copies of Windows 7 to date, making it the fastest-selling operating system in history, according to Peter Klein, Microsoft's chief financial officer. Klein made the comments earlier this week while speaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference.   While most of what Klein had to say dealt with the Microsoft's financial expectations, the company's top number cruncher did discuss a few interesting things about Microsoft's product outlook for the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XP Switch Finally Happening &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows XP may finally be heading into retirement as more and more users switch over to Windows 7. Business users were particularly hesitant to give up XP, but that trend appears to be changing, Microsoft says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're now having conversations with the majority of our enterprise customers who are making plans to deploy Windows 7," Klein said. Business users were reluctant to make the switch to Vista because of compatibility issues with hardware, proprietary software, and Vista's perceived focus on security concerns over user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pipeline Is Fresh and Full&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klein also spent some time talking about all the new Windows products slated for release this year such as Windows Phones 7, Natal for Xbox 360, and Microsoft Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's probably the richest pipeline of product delivery we've had in my eight years at Microsoft, and possibly in the history of the company," Klein said. For years, Microsoft has lagged behind competitors such as Apple and Google to deliver new and innovative products, particularly for mobile devices. Recently, however, Microsoft appears to be experiencing a resurgence of sorts as it refreshes most of its product line-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xbox, Bing, and the Cloud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other interesting quotes from Klein's speech include the fact that Xbox LIVE now has more than 23 million members worldwide. This is despite competition from free alternatives like Sony's PlayStation Network, which exceeded 20 million members early last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing, Microsoft's new search engine, continues to grow in popularity, and its numbers should increase thanks to recent regulatory approval of the Microsoft-Yahoo deal where Bing search technology will handle all search queries on Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond continues to move into the cloud in a big way as part of its oft-discussed three screens strategy. Klein said Microsoft wants to "have the most complete and consistent set of customer and user experiences across all devices and across all delivery models" to "deliver a common set of user experiences across PCs and phones and TVs all connected by the cloud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to read Klein's speech, you can download it from Microsoft (DOC), as well as an accompanying PowerPoint presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect with Ian on Twitter (@ianpaul) or on Google Buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/190797&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) as the Bull of
the Day and Western Union (NYSE: WU) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on Pozen (Nasdaq: POZN), AstraZeneca (NYSE:
AZN) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) is one of the largest software companies in the
world. The company's operating systems are installed on nearly all computers
anywhere in the world. Therefore, the recovery in the PC market is encouraging. 

The huge core business, management's acquisition strategy and cost reduction
initiatives are driving strong cash flows and earnings growth. While we
recognize that competition continues to increase and the company's dominant
position in the PC market could erode, we note that attach rates of the new OS
are increasing. 

We believe that Microsoft is poised to benefit from new product cycles in both
the enterprise PC and server markets. Hence, we are upgrading MSFT shares to
Outperform. 

Bear of the Day: 

The Western Union Company's (NYSE: WU) fourth quarter earnings narrowed compared
to the prior-year quarter as a result of lower transaction volumes due to
ongoing market challenges and the dilutive effects of recent acquisitions. 

However, we believe that the company's strong brand name, network expertise and
financial strength will position it well for long term profitability. Moreover,
the company is experiencing gradual recovery of transaction, revenue and pricing
trends. 

Then again, given the slow pace of economic recovery, we would have to wait for
some time to see any significant improvement. Our current target price is $15
per share. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Bullish on Pozen

Pozen (Nasdaq: POZN) remains one of our top picks in the small-to-mid cap
biotechnology industry. We view the company as financially sound, exiting 2009
with over $46 million in cash on hand and another potential $20 million coming
in April 2010 from AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN) for the U.S. approval of Vimovo. 

The company is also well diversified, with one product on the market in
Treximet, one product nearing FDA approval in Vimovo, and one product in phase
III trials in PA-325. All three products offer significant catalysts in the
near-term. 

Sales of Treximet in the fourth quarter 2009 totaled $22.7 million at
GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK). This resulted in a royalty payment from Glaxo to
Pozen of approximately $1.1 million. Treximet sales have been tracking below our
expectations since the launch almost two years ago. 

Sales in 2008 were hampered by the lack of approved marketing material. Sales in
2009 were hampered by significant sampling and widespread misconception that the
product had poor reimbursement or offered no real advantages over generic
sumatriptan. The truth is that over 90% of managed care plans list Treximet on
their formulary, with over 50% in tier-2 status.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Prudential Plc (NYSE: PUK), American International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG),

&amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Rating Concerns for Prudential Plc

Following the announcement by Prudential Plc (NYSE: PUK) to purchase Asian
life-insurance unit American International Assurance (AIA) from American
International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG), Fitch Ratings has become cautious with
regard to execution risks that the deal may bring along. 

The value of the deal, estimated at approximately $35 billion, is greater than
the company`s market value, which is $23 billion at present. 

Prudential Plc, which anticipates completing the deal by third quarter of 2010,
expects to pay $25 billion in cash, $8.5 billion in face value of equity and
equity-linked securities and $2 billion in face value of its preferred stock.
Prudential Plc is considering a rights offering to raise $20 billion to fund the
AIA deal. Credit Suisse Group (NYSE: CS), HSBC Holdings Plc (NYSE: HBC) and
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) are advising Prudential Plc on the deal. 

Fitch is concerned that the new debt funding in connection with the deal would
exert downward pressure on the company`s interest coverage ratio, which might
cause a ratings downgrade. Currently, the company has been conferred with an
"AA-" long-term issuer default rating by Fitch, which is considered to be the
fourth highest investment grade. 

Prudential Plc operates in 13 Asian markets where it has more than 11 million
life customers. Asia, which accounted for 44% of Prudential Plc's profits in
2009, is also seen as the engine of the group's future growth. The deal will
transform Prudential Plc into the ranks of the world's largest insurers and make
it an Asian powerhouse. Asia would account for three-quarters of the merged
company's value of new business.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (NYSE: DO),
Petrobras (NYSE: PBR), ProLogis (NYSE: PLD) and Portland General Electric (NYSE:
POR). 

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from
the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

BofA Consolidates 2 Units

Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) said on Tuesday that it is combining the
Global Card Services and Deposits under Susan Faulkner. Previously, Ric
Struthers had led Global Card Services. But as part of management changes begun
in mid-January by Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, Struthers has decided to leave
BofA. 

Susan Faulkner will run the combined business and report to Joe Price, the
former chief financial officer who took over the consumer bank in mid-January.
Faulkner`s new designation will be Deposits and Card Product Executive and she
will have offices in Charlotte and Wilmington. The latter is where the card
business will continue to be based. 

Faulkner has been with BofA for 25 years. Since 2007, she has served as BofA
Customer Segments, Deposits and Payments executive. Prior to this, Faulkner was
Global Consumer &amp; Small Business Sales, Service &amp; Marketing executive. 

BofA`s credit-card business has been one of the worst performing divisions
during the recession. BofA`s fourth quarter 2009 loss came in at 60 cents per
share, a nickel worse than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 55 cents.
This compares unfavorably with the loss of 48 cents in the prior-year quarter. 

Diamond Wins Major Contracts

Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (NYSE: DO), a major contract driller, has
received notifications of award for three term drilling contracts from Petrobras
(NYSE: PBR) in Brazil. Excluding bonus and extensions, these contracts have a
combined capacity to generate total revenue of approximately $1.4 billion and
represent at least 11 years of contract drilling backlog. 

The contracts are for three floating drilling rigs: ultra-deepwater
semisubmersible Ocean Valor, deepwater semisubmersible Ocean Baroness and
deepwater drillship Ocean Clipper. 

Ocean Valor and Ocean Baroness each received a three-year commitment that could
generate approximately $493 million and $307 million of revenue, respectively.
However, Ocean Clipper received a five-year commitment with a $557 million
revenue generation capacity. 

While Diamond has been suffering from a severe contraction in utilization rate
for jackups and high specification floaters, the new contracts will surely boost
the company`s struggling bottom line. 

ProLogis` New Solar Project

ProLogis (NYSE: PLD), a leading global provider of distribution facilities,
recently announced a new rooftop solar project in Portland. On completion, the
project spanning 90,000 square feet of roof space and generating about 2.4
megawatts (MW) of energy would be the largest rooftop solar system in the
Pacific Northwest region. 

In order to develop the project, ProLogis signed a deal with Portland General
Electric (NYSE: POR), a vertically integrated electric utility company that
serves approximately 818,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in
Oregon. The new solar project is the second such rooftop project between
ProLogis and Portland, generating a total of 3.5 MW of solar energy to power
approximately 388 households annually. 

Currently, ProLogis has various global solar projects spanning 8.1 million
square feet of roof space generating approximately 13.5 MW of energy. The
installations are spread across 27 buildings throughout France, Germany, Japan,
Spain and the U.S. ProLogis has more than 450 million square feet of roof space
worldwide available for solar installations.

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman Sachs, Banca IMI are joint bookrunners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Prysmian shares close up 1.54 percent
 (Adds CEO buying shares paragraph 3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MILAN, March 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
started the sale of its 16.8 percent stake in cable maker
Prysmian SpA (PRY.MI) on Thursday, nearing the end of a pullout
that began in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. bank is selling its holding to selected investors,
it said in a statement, but gave no details. The stake is worth
about 396 million euros ($542 million), according to Reuters
calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prysmian Chief Executive Valerio Battista has placed an
order to buy 1.5 million shares, Prysmian said in a statement.
[ID:nBIA04222] About 30 million shares are being sold,

Banca IMI are joint bookrunners, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A financial source close to the deal said the stake would
be sold at Thursday's share price or at a very slight discount.
The shares closed up 1.54 percent at 13.20 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs had sold a 14.3 percent stake in Prysmian in
November. South Korea's Taihan Electric Wire Co Ltd (001440.KS)
sold its 9.9 percent holding last month, crushing speculation
that it could buy more shares. [ID:nLDE6130QK]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial sources had indicated that Italy's Malacalza
family was interested in Goldman Sachs' stake. However, the
family dropped efforts to buy it last month, a source close to
the issue said.

&lt;p&gt;Companies Collaborate to Build Performance Management Solution Using Microsoft
Business Intelligence Technology
CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
OrthoCarolina and Mariner are highlighted in a case study recently issued by
Microsoft that spotlights the benefits of a Microsoft-based business
intelligence practice management solution. Mariner, an industry-leading business
intelligence and performance management solutions provider, helped design and
implement a complete Microsoft Business Intelligence Solution for OrthoCarolina.
One of the nation`s largest specialty practices, OrthoCarolina was formed when
two local orthopedic practices merged. OrthoCarolina and Mariner collaborated to
develop dashboards and analytical tools that enable the combined medical
practice to operate more effectively. The business intelligence solution
empowers doctors to improve clinical outcomes, boost operational efficiency, and
increase patient satisfaction. 

OrthoCarolina chose this solution because it enables users to access analytics
and performance information using Microsoft software tools they already know and
like. The solution supports merging complex processes and sensitive data
required for two the practices to become one and provides the clinicians,
administrators and managers ready access to key performance indicators and other
decision support data. 

Having selected the Microsoft platform, OrthoCarolina engaged business
intelligence leader, Mariner, to work with them to design the practice
management system. 

"Microsoft and Mariner were more cost-effective by a factor of 10 or more," says
Steve Hendrick, OrthoCarolina`s Chief Information Officer. 

"Working alongside OrthoCarolina, gave our Healthcare Practice team a unique
opportunity to help one of the largest orthopedic practices in the country
improve efficiency, and patient care and satisfaction," comments Joseph Guy,
Mariner`s COO and Co-Founder. 

A Mariner White Paper, "Healthcare Performance Management Strategies for Highly
Efficient Practices spotlights OrthoCarolina`s Business Intelligence solution.
It is available by emailing healthcareinfo@mariner-usa.com.

OrthoCarolina has 12 offices and 800 employees across the Charlotte region with
medical teams totaling over 120 physician and physician extenders serving
approximately 550,000 patients annually.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Microsoft is still seeing a lot of interest in its Windows 7 computer software launched last year and a new budget cycle will help a gradual recovery in business spending, its chief operating officer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of interest in the Windows 7 refresh," Kevin Turner told an audience at the London School of Economics on Wednesday. "There's lots of momentum around that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turner said Microsoft expects 300 million PCs to be sold this year. That should be a boost to Windows 7, the new version of the software that runs more than nine in 10 of the world's PCs, but he said the picture was mixed globally, with varying rates of economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has sold 90 million copies of Windows 7 so far since its October 2009 launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One absolute I can tell you is that at least in 2010 most people are on new budget cycles, which is helpful, but ... they're still being conservative," he said. "I think it's going to be more a gradual thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 0.4 percent in New York at 10:20 a.m. EST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong sales of Windows 7 helped Microsoft post a bigger-than-expected 60 percent jump in quarterly profit in January, and it said it expected business technology spending to recover this year. But the world's biggest software company made no specific profit or revenue forecasts, citing economic volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BACK TO BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his speech, Turner said it was "time to get back to business" after what Microsoft has repeatedly called an economic reset, rather than just a recession from which the world economy would simply recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft's own spending would not return to previous levels in many areas after cost cuts, but Microsoft was at the same time increasing research and development spending to a record $9.5 billion this year, more than any company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was keen to invest in fast-growing, emerging economies, Turner said, but would continue to be cautious about China because of widespread piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until we can work with China to respect intellectual property -- I think the last numbers I got were about 98 percent usage share and about 10 percent paid share -- I think it's a real barrier from a software standpoint," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, there's work to be done by the Chinese government to improve IPR (intellectual property rights), or else that nation won't achieve its potential, in our view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about rival Google, whose activities Microsoft has urged competitors to complain about to competition regulators, Turner said: "Every competitor we have makes us a better company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not comment specifically on complaints to the European Commission about Google's practices -- some of which Google has said came from companies related to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/abb56a/ibm_acquires_intel) has
announced the addition of the "IBM Acquires Intelliden in a near Perfect Fit for
Network Change Automation" report to their offering. 

IBM Acquires Intelliden in a near Perfect Fit for Network Change Automation

IBM's February, 2010 acquisition of Intelliden for network change automation is
a smart, well-calculated move that supports IBM's capabilities for service and
infrastructure provisioning, as well as its broader strategies for Integrated
Service Management. 

The acquisition should resonate most strongly with Communications Service
Providers (CSPs) and MSPs, where IBM with Tivoli OMNIbus and Tivoli Netcool
Performance Manager, and Intelliden with its R-Series platform, have long
established strengths. But the announcement will also positively impact IBM's
strategy in enterprise and government accounts, especially those requiring
automation across large, complex network infrastructures. It may also interest
Network Equipment Manufacturers seeking a reliable and scalable alternative to
internally developed software and a patchwork quilt of partnerships.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to spend $9.5 billion on research and development this year, which a senior executive said Thursday is more than any competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure is $3 billion more than the next closest technology company, said Kevin Turner, Microsoft's chief operating officer, who gave a keynote speech on Thursday at the Cebit trade show. Much of Microsoft's investments center around "cloud" services, or online computing provided to users from hosted data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Especially in light of the tough difficult macroeconomic times that we're coming out of, we chose to really lean in and double down on our innovation," Turner said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turner contended that Microsoft has more cloud services than any other company, ranging from its consumer e-mail service to hosted enterprise products such as its Dynamics CRM (customer relationship management) system to its Azure cloud operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to change and reinvent our company around leading in the cloud," Turner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Turner said Microsoft will still have a significant on-premise software business. Microsoft has come under increasing pressure from companies such as Google that sell office productivity suites that are entirely online rather than installed on PCs. Microsoft has argued that there will always be a need for client software, which can deliver more features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turner defended the company's forthcoming Windows Phone 7 Series operating system, which will be available on phones later this year. Microsoft faces heavy competition from vendors such as Apple, Nokia and other manufacturers using Google's Android operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turner said the mobile OS is a complete overhaul from previous ones and is tightly integrated with other Microsoft products such as its X-box gaming and Zune music products. Windows Phone 7 Series is "not a 'me too' product," Turner said.&lt;/p&gt;

 (Recasts; adds CEO, analyst comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Juhi Arora&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, March 4 (Reuters) - British recruitment firm
Robert Walters Plc (RWA.L) reported a 92.8 percent decline in
full-year pretax profit, hurt by lower net fee income from its
permanent-staffing business, but said it was comfortable with
the 2010 market view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which has operations in Europe, Asia Pacific,
the United States and South Africa, said net fee income for the
first two months of 2010 were ahead of year-ago levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The UK remains extremely uncertain and Continental Europe
looks flat. But we are not a UK company really. Our fastest
growth opportunities tend to be outside of the UK, like China
and Japan," Chief Executive Robert Walters told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which saw an operating profit in 2009 in the
Asia Pacific region alone, said it was actively assessing
opportunities in China and also venturing into the Latin
American recruitment market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For 2010, analysts on average expect the company to post
earnings of 5.7 million pounds ($8.57 million), on revenue of
295.8 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CEO Walters said he was confident that the company could
grow at a reasonable rate organically, and not through
acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KBC Peel Hunt analyst Henry Carver said, "With a strong
market presence maintained in spite of a very tough 2009, we
believe the company is in an excellent position for
international growth into the next cycle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the year ended Dec. 31, 2009, Robert Walters posted a
pretax profit of 1.3 million pounds, compared with 18.2 million
pounds a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue fell 11 percent to 300.4 million pounds and net fee
income was down 25 percent to 104.4 million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Walters maintained its dividend of 3.35 pence and
had net cash of 17.3 million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were down 1 pence at 210 pence at
1423 GMT on Thursday on the London Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;In the years to come, Microsoft's data centers may not be huge buildings tightly packed with server racks, but rather rows of small, stand-alone IT units spread across acres and acres of cool, cheap land.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the DatacenterDynamics conference in New York on Wednesday, Microsoft data center general manager Kevin Timmons outlined some prototype work his unit is doing to design its next generation of data centers, in collaboration with Microsoft Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His vision is radically different from most of what the company already has in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is field-testing something Timmons calls IT PACs, or IT preassembled components, which are small, self-contained units that are assembled off-site and can be linked together to build out an entire data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, he said, is facing the same challenges as most data center operators. It needs the ability to ramp up capacity in short order, but would like to avoid the massive up-front costs and long lead times required to build out traditional data centers. Given this set of conditions, Microsoft's goal for building its next set of data centers is "ultra-modularity," Timmons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of paying US$400 million or more up front to build a data center, Microsoft would prefer to purchase some land, build a sub-station and then populate the acreage with modular units of servers as demand grows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to view our data centers as more of a traditional manufacturing supply chain, instead of monolithic builds," he said. "It won't all be built on-site in one shot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By going with this approach, Microsoft can cut the time it takes to ramp up new server capability in half, as well as reduce the costs of building out new data centers, Timmons predicted. "You don't have to commit to a $400 million data center and hope that demand shows up," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years Microsoft has been moving toward more modular designs, moving from purchasing individual servers to racks of servers to, most recently, entire containers filled with servers. Microsoft built out its past two data centers, located outside of Chicago and Dublin, using, in part, containers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new design takes this modularity concept even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IT PACs are "not really containers in a traditional sense," Timmons said. "They are really integrated air-handling and IT units."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The units themselves could hold anywhere from one to 10,000 servers. The idea is that when the software giant requires more resources, it can have one of these IT PACs shipped to location and "plugged into the spine," which supplies the power and network connectivity to the data center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has built two proof-of-concept models so far. Its next data center, which the company will announce in a few months, will use some form of these IT PACs, Timmons said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The units will be assembled entirely from commercially available components. A single person should be able to build a unit within four working days. The servers will be stacked in rows, sandwiched between air intake and output vents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cooling, ambient air can be sucked in one side, run through the servers and exhausted out the other, with some of the air recirculated to even the overall temperature of the unit. No mechanical cooling units will be used. Networking and power buses will run over the tops of the servers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The construction materials rely heavily on steel and aluminium, both easily recyclable. The water requirements can be met by a single hose with residential levels of water pressure, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development team considered different sizes of containers, Timmons said, keeping an eye toward making the units easily shippable. They settled on a size that could contain 1,200 to 2,100 servers and draw between 400 and 600 kilowatts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The units can be placed inside a large building, or when equipped with outer protective panels, reside out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the chief requirements of IT PACs, he admitted, is that they reside in an area where the ambient temperature is mild enough that it can provide sufficient cooling. Because of their highly portable nature, this should not be a problem, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we're doing our job right in site election, square footage will be cheap for me. I want to find a place with lots of room to expand. I don't want to worry about a watts-per-square-foot problem. I'd like to worry about having enough acreage," he said. "We're doing a good job in site selection when we don't have to squeeze in 500 watts per square foot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to their minimal use of mechanical cooling, Timmons estimated that the PUE ratio for its IT PACs would be 1.26 to 1.35, depending on the outside conditions. PUE, or power usage effectiveness, compares overall power supplied to the data center against the amount that actually reaches IT equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical data center PUE is around 2.1, according to industry estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the IT PACs are ultimately pushed into production, Timmons said he hasn't fully decided if Microsoft will build them itself or contract them out. It would probably be a mix of the two, he predicted. "I know how much it costs to build one of these now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Mediaweek) - Disney Channel is developing a "Tron" animated series to follow the upcoming theatrical release of "Tron: Legacy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news was part of Disney's "upfront" presentation to media buyers and clients, which included a preview of the "Tron" series. Geared toward kids age 6-14, the plan is to precede "Tron" with another project, a 10-part "Tron" micro-series premiering in fall 2011 on Disney XD, its cable channel targeted at young boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Marsh, entertainment president and chief creative officer of Disney Channels Worldwide, also offered a glimpse of "Legacy," which is at such an early juncture in the development process that only stills were available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tron is another example of how we can take advantage of the intellectual property that the studio unit pays tens, if not hundreds, of millions to develop and market," Marsh said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Tron" projects represent a CGI-refresh of Disney's 1982 theatrical, with "Legacy" expected to be released in December.&lt;/p&gt;

He praised the effort but noted selling such a package was a difficult challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"EBS faced a tough road," Voce added. "Even with the lower cost of the EBS package, the opportunity to use cloud-based services for e-mail and collaboration holds a lot of promise for that targeted segment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will offer technical support for current EBS users for five years. The company also has several incentive plans for existing customers to migrate to standalone Microsoft products as replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer told an audience at the University of Washington that the company is focusing its technical strategy on cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Los Angeles Times' critic may have panned the film, but that didn't stop Disney from paying top dollar to turn the newspaper's front page into a special advertisement on Friday for the new movie, "Alice in Wonderland."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ad, believed to be the first of its kind among America's leading big-city dailies, dismayed some readers and was lamented by media scholars as the latest troubling sign of difficult times at the newspaper and for journalism generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad features a full-color photo of actor Johnny Depp in gaudy makeup, wig and costume as the film's Mad Hatter character, superimposed across an authentic-looking front page mock-up, topped by the Times' traditional masthead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depp's image -- emblazoned with the phrase, "Johnny Depp is the Mad Hatter" -- overlaps an old weather photo and two columns of reprinted stories about healthcare and Afghanistan, minus bylines and other names. The word "Advertisement" appears in smaller type just below the masthead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get to Friday's real news, readers had to open the so-called cover wrap, which was folded around the Times' entire A section as a two-page, front-to-back promotional spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Times spokesman, John Conroy, declined to discuss the cost of the ad, but said, "The Times' front section is our most valuable real estate, so the ad unit was priced accordingly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood blogger Sharon Waxman cited one "media buyer insider" as saying the Walt Disney Co, the studio behind the film, paid $700,000 for the space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a low price to sell your soul," said Roy Peter Clark, senior scholar at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, who expressed sympathy for the paper and discomfort at the blurring of commercial and editorial interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAD DAY FOR GREAT PAPER?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want the Los Angeles Times to make a lot of money, and I want them to do use that money to do some of the best journalism they've ever done," he said. "But I think that this strategy is deceptive, and that my old school ulcer is starting to burn a little a bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others were more blunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a sad day in the history of a great newspaper, and my impression is they have received a lot of calls from people who are incensed by it, loyal readers," said Bryce Nelson, a former Times correspondent who teaches journalism at the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times promotion apparently held little or no sway for the newspaper's main film critic, Kenneth Turan, whose review on Thursday called Tim Burton's take on the Lewis Carroll classic "middling" and "surprisingly inert." The film has drawn mixed reviews overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conroy disputed the notion that the ad undermines the paper's editorial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We made it clear that this was a depiction of the front page, rather than a real front page of the newspaper," he said. "We had an unusual opportunity here to stretch the traditional boundaries and deliver an innovative ad unit that was designed to create buzz."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nelson said the ad would prove a turnoff to many subscribers, some of whom he knows had called him to protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What this demonstrates is the newspaper's seeming willingness to put revenues over news coverage," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conroy said the editorial staff was informed in advance of the Depp ad, but he did not know if it elicited the kind of grumbling that occurred when the paper ran a cover-wrap in June promoting the new HBO television series "True Blood." That wrap was not presented as a faux front page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times, which began selling display ads on its front page in 2007, also raised eyebrows last year when it ran a front-page TV advertisement that resembled a news story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nationally circulated USA Today drew criticism for a pseudo edition of its newspaper distributed at an AIDS conference in Geneva as a promotion for a pharmaceutical company. The Wall Street Journal and other dailies have run partial wrap sleeves around the outsides of their papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many newspapers, the Times has been hit hard by declining circulation and shrinking ad revenues, forcing the paper to scale back coverage and lay off hundreds of employees in recent years. The paper's corporate parent, the Tribune Co, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Todd Eastham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has no intention of ending its business in China no matter how Google Inc.'s battle with the Chinese government ends, an executive in the firm's Asian operation was reported to have said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Regardless of whether or not Google stays [in China], we will aggressively promote our search and cloud computing," Zhang Yaqin, chairman of Microsoft's Asia-Pacific RD Group, told Reuters earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaqin spoke the news agency during the opening of China's National People's Congress in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To drive the point home, Yaqin told Reuters that Microsoft plans to spend some $500 million on research and development in China this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have been speculating about how Microsoft and Yahoo -- Google's biggest search rivals -- would react if the search giant pulls its business out of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google announced in January that a major attack launched against its network from China had forced it to consider pulling its business from the country. After the attack, which was aimed at exposing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists, Google said it was reconsidering its willingness to censor search results of users in China as required by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's stand against China largely is being met with support from industry watchers, who said the search giant has taken a major hit in good will in recent years by ceding to China's censorship demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Google does take a stand against censorship and Microsoft continues to comply with China's demands, it's unclear how the industry would react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft committing to China so explicitly underscores the huge opportunity they have in Asia now that Google has taken at least a step backward," said Dan Olds, an analyst at Gabriel Consulting Group. "Microsoft faces the same problems as Google, like how do you deal with a government that controls your business and demands that you censor content. Microsoft has decided that the potential rewards outweigh the risks of being perceived as toadying to an authoritarian government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer wrote in a blog post that engagement in China is very important to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have done business in China for more than 20 years and we intend to stay engaged, which means our business must respect the laws of China," wrote Ballmer at the time. "That's true for every company doing business in countries around the world: We are all subject to local laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked today if Microsoft intends to continue censoring search results in China, a Microsoft spokesperson simply referred to Ballmer's blog post about continuing on in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will officially launch Office 2010 to businesses at an event slated for May 12, the company announced today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, however, did not immediately respond to questions about the timing of when enterprises with volume license deals will be able to obtain the finished product. Typically, those customers can download new Microsoft software weeks or even months before the same programs are available to consumers. When Microsoft rolled out Office 2007, for example, business customers had the suite more than two months before consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 is set to go on general sale sometime in June, but Microsoft has not yet disclosed an exact ship date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, Microsoft today also unveiled a program that provides a free upgrade to Office 2010 for customers who purchase the older Office 2007 between now and Sept. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Microsoft's chief financial officer had confirmed that the Office 2010 Technology Guarantee Program would launch this month . Last month, details of the free Office 2010 upgrade program leaked to the Web when a Microsoft technology specialist briefly posted information to the firm's partner community site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who purchase an eligible copy of Office 2007 between March 5 and Sept. 30 will be allowed to download a corresponding edition of Office 2010 for free when the new suite is available in June. Users who want a DVD installation disc will have to pay a small shipping-and-handling fee. Microsoft said fees would be announced in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers of Office Home and Student 2007 will receive a free copy of Office Home and Student 2010, while buyers of Office Standard 2007 and Office Basic 2007 will be eligible for a free copy of Office Home and Business 2010, a new addition to the Office lineup. Purchases of Office Small Business 2007, Office Professional 2007 or Office Ultimate 2007 will be eligible for a free copy of Office Professional 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 is the first of Microsoft's suite line to drop less-expensive upgrade editions . Instead, Microsoft plans to sell single-license activation keys via its online store and select retail outlets to customers who want to upgrade from older editions, or from the bare bones Office Starter 2010 that will come pre-installed on new PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a limit of 25 free upgrades per person, a standard Microsoft practice meant to push businesses with multiple copies to its volume licensing deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has set up a site that spells out the upgrade program in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc stepped up its assault on Microsoft Corp's productivity software business with the acquisition of a small start-up company that allows Microsoft users to edit and share their documents on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google said on its company blog on Friday that it has acquired San Francisco-based DocVerse. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With DocVerse, people can begin to experience some of the benefits of Web-based collaboration using the traditional Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint desktop applications," Google Product Manager Jonathan Rochelle said in the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal represents the latest move in the competition between Google, the world's No. 1 Internet search engine, and Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has boosted investment in its Bing search engine during the past year, while Google is developing a PC operating system dubbed Chrome OS that will compete with Microsoft Windows, the software used in the vast majority of the world's PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is also trying to lure users to its Web-based productivity software, known as Google Docs, which competes with Microsoft's dominant Office software package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters, Google's Rochelle said that DocVerse software makes it easier for users and businesses to move their existing desktop PC documents to the Internet "cloud," where the documents reside on the Web and can be accessed from any PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google "fell in love with what they were doing to make that transition easier," Rochelle said of DocVerse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's business division, which makes Office, is the most profitable unit of the company, generating more than $12 billion in profit last fiscal year, more than half Microsoft's $20.4 billion overall profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in an emailed statement that Google's acquisition of DocVerse acknowledges that customers want to use and collaborate with Microsoft Office documents. "Furthermore, it reinforces that customers are embracing Microsoft's long-state strategy of software plus services, which combines rich client software with cloud services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DocVerse deal is Google's second acquisition announcement this week, and marks the company's fourth acquisition in less than four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based DocVerse was founded in 2007 by a pair of former Microsoft managers. The company has less than 20 employees, according to co-founder Shan Sinha and had raised nearly $1.5 million in funding prior to the Google deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a report in the AllThingsDigital blog, citing unnamed sources, the price of the deal was between $25 million and $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Tim Dobbyn and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

their documents on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google said on its company blog on Friday that it has
acquired San Francisco-based DocVerse. Terms of the deal were
not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With DocVerse, people can begin to experience some of the
benefits of Web-based collaboration using the traditional
Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint desktop applications,"
Google Product Manager Jonathan Rochelle said in the blog
post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal represents the latest move in the competition
between Google, the world's No. 1 Internet search engine, and
Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has boosted investment in its Bing search engine
during the past year, while Google is developing a PC operating
system dubbed Chrome OS that will compete with Microsoft
Windows, the software used in the vast majority of the world's
PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google is also trying to lure users to its Web-based
productivity software, known as Google Docs, which competes
with Microsoft's dominant Office software package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview with Reuters, Google's Rochelle said that
DocVerse software makes it easier for users and businesses to
move their existing desktop PC documents to the Internet
"cloud," where the documents reside on the Web and can be
accessed from any PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google "fell in love with what they were doing to make that
transition easier," Rochelle said of DocVerse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's business division, which makes Office, is the
most profitable unit of the company, generating more than $12
billion in profit last fiscal year, more than half Microsoft's
$20.4 billion overall profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said in an emailed statement that Google's
acquisition of DocVerse acknowledges that customers want to use
and collaborate with Microsoft Office documents. "Furthermore,
it reinforces that customers are embracing Microsoft's
long-state strategy of software plus services, which combines
rich client software with cloud services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DocVerse deal is Google's second acquisition
announcement this week, and marks the company's fourth
acquisition in less than four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; San Francisco-based DocVerse was founded in 2007 by a pair
of former Microsoft managers. The company has less than 20
employees, according to co-founder Shan Sinha and had raised
nearly $1.5 million in funding prior to the Google deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a report in the AllThingsDigital blog, citing
unnamed sources, the price of the deal was between $25 million
and $30 million.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft published the Microsoft Security Bulletin Advance Notification for March 2010 and there are only two security bulletins predicted for next Tuesday--both rated as Important. Following the nearly record-breaking Patch Tuesday in February, IT administrators will appreciate getting a little bit of a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advance notification discloses little in terms of details, but it does help IT administrators prepare by providing some warning of the number and severity of the security bulletins expected to be released next Tuesday, as well as a general idea of the type of vulnerability and the platforms affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first bulletin predicted for the March Patch Tuesday affects Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. According to the advance notification, a successful exploit of the vulnerability could result in an attacker being able to execute malicious code remotely on the target system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second security bulletin for next week affects Microsoft Office. The advance notification specifies that Office XP, Office 2003, and Office 2007 for the PC are all affected, as well as Office 2004 and Office 2008 for the Mac operating system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the various full versions of Microsoft Office, there are a number of other peripheral applications that are affected. The Open XML File Format Converter for Mac, the Microsoft Excel Viewer, the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats, and both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 are impacted as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Windows and Office security bulletins are ranked with an aggregate severity rating of Important--meaning that some platforms or configurations may be at lower risk, but taken as a hole the vulnerabilities addressed in the bulletin are considered Important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft defines the Important rating as "A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of users data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry Bryant, senior security communications manager at Microsoft, stressed in a blog post "To provide additional guidance for deployment prioritization, customers should note that both bulletins will address issues that would require a user to open a specially crafted file. There are no network based attack vectors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both security bulletins suggest that a system reboot may be required once the appropriate patches and updates are installed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After February, next Tuesday's security bulletins from Microsoft should be a proverbial walk in the park. But, it still helps to have a little heads up and be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/190896&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Novell Receives Buyout Offer

Enterprise software marker and leading technology company Novell, Inc. (Nasdaq:
NOVL) announced that it has received a buyout offer from Elliott Associates,
L.P., the largest institutional stockholder of Novell, which holds approximately
8.5% of NOVL common stock. Elliott is an investment firm with over $16 billion
in assets. 

Under the unsolicited offer, Elliott Associates plans to acquire Novell for
$5.75 per share in cash, which implies an enterprise value net of cash of $1.0
billion. This price represents a premium of 49% over the company's current
enterprise value, 77% over the company's 90-day volume-weighted average
enterprise value and a 115% premium over the company's enterprise value on
January 4, 2010, when Elliot planned to purchase Novell. 

The offer price also represents a 37% premium to Novell's closing stock price on
January 4, 2010 and a 20% premium over the company`s closing price on March 2. 

Novell said that its Board of Directors will review the buyout offer in
consultation with its financial and legal advisors J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) and
Skadden Arps. 

Novell shares rose 28% and closed at $6.08 yesterday. The shares soared 25.89%
(or $1.23) to $5.98 in after-hours trading, just after the company made the
offer public. The surge in share price indicates positive investor sentiments
regarding the takeover. 

According to analysts, the deal may be subject to a competitive bidding process
as it appears that larger companies such as Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ),
International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) may bid for
Novell.

&lt;p&gt; * Nine units included in Exxon refinery work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Work to last "a few weeks," company says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * West Coast markets steady as work expected
 (Updates with added details, market reaction, more work
expected.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, March 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) will
begin a planned overhaul this week at its 150,000 barrel per
day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in Torrance, California,
that will include the 100,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic
catalytic cracking unit, an Exxon spokeswoman said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to the FCC, the refinery will also overhaul the
alkylation unit, a hydrotreater, two hydrogen plants, a sulfur
recovery unit, the NAFTA pre-treater and the unsaturated gas
plant at the refinery during the overhaul, said Exxon's Aarti
Ramachandran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The work is expected to last "a few weeks," Ramachandran
said. The refinery has stockpiled supplies to meet its
contractual obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's overhaul has been expected for several months,
according to sources familiar with refinery operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News on Friday that the overhaul had started did not affect
wholesale prices in the Los Angeles market because the work was
anticipated, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another reason for the market's reaction is the
overabundance of gasoline in regional inventory. The U.S.
Energy Information Administration said West Coast stockpiles of
gasoline climbed by 800,000 barrels to 33.1 million barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least two other refinery overhauls are expected on the
West Coast in March as refiners prepare for the summer driving
season.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering its own version of technology acquired last year that offers cross-platform access to the Microsoft Visual Studio Team System Team Foundation Server (TFS) application lifecycle management (ALM) platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beta technology, based on the Teamprise software Microsoft bought from SourceGear in 2009, is called Microsoft Visual Studio Team Explorer 2010, said S. Somasegar, senior vice president of the Microsoft developer division, in a Thursday evening blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Earlier this week, Somasegar unveiled a promotional offer intended to move Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 Standard Edition users to the upcoming Visual Studio 2010 IDE. | Keep up with app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld's Fatal Exception and Strategic Developer blogs. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teamprise has enabled TFS to serve as an ALM server for multiple software platforms, including Java, Eclipse, Unix, Linux, and Mac OS X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This release includes the Team Foundation Server Plugin for Eclipse as well as the Team Foundation Server Cross Platform Command Line Client," Somasegar said. "It works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and multiple flavors of Unix, providing access to the same source control, work item tracking, build automation, and reporting features that Visual Studio customers have benefitted from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft detailed plans to acquire Teamprise assets last year and at that time expressed intentions to update Teamprise Client Suite to work with Visual Studio 2010, the company's software development platform upgrade due next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Teamprise products have been very popular with TFS customers who were developing applications across Microsoft and non-Microsoft platforms.&#160; Often customers want to standardize on a single enterprise-wide solution for ALM because of the cost savings and increased transparency this provides. The Teamprise technology is key in enabling cross-platform TFS access," Somasegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codenamed "Eaglestone," the Team Explorer 2010 beta is available for download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the blog, Somasegar showed a TFS user story work item in the Eclipse SDK, featuring a story implementation, pending changes, work item queries organized into folders, and the Eclipse import wizard connecting to TFS to import Java source code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft puts its stamp on cross-platform link to ALM server," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft 's idea that the fight against malware could be funded by an Internet tax is "horrible," an analyst said Thursday as other experts weighed in on a recent comment by the company's security chief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Scott Charney, Microsoft's vice president for its Trustworthy Computing group, said that while there are plenty of ways to combat malware, scrub infected PCs and take down botnets, no one wanted to foot the bill .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe markets will make it work," Charney said, but then added that an Internet usage tax might be the solution. "You could say it's a public safety issue and do it with general taxation," Charney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea of a general Net tax is a horrible idea," said John Pescatore, Gartner's security analyst. "Why not a tax on all retail goods for a standard anti-shoplifting service all merchants would have to use?" A business, he said, can now select what it thinks is the best anti-malware solution, but that choice would presumably vanish if funding for battling the bad guys went national.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A general tax would reduce the services to the lowest common denominator," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfgang Kandek, chief technology officer with security company Qualys, agreed. "I have a hard time seeing [a tax] work. The Internet is an international body, you can't regulate it and you cannot levy a tax. ISPs might have to up their fees to pay for something like this, I can see that, but a tax that brings government into play, I can't see that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others who disagreed with Charney's Net tax argued that Web users would pay, one way or another, tax or no tax, to fight hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A tax may be a bad idea, but people will pay for it one way or another," said Randy Abrams, director of technical education at ESET Security, ticking off higher ISP fees or if not that, then the lack of any price cuts by ISPs as the inevitable consequences of anti-malware efforts on the part of service providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some security pros questioned not only the concept, but also the mechanics of a taxation-for-mitigation scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have a problem with charging a fee and giving it to good works for the whole," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "The problem is that one, you have to find a big, smart and trustworthy organization to handle this. And most people will agree that's not the government, and that's not Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More likely, thought Storms, is that an ISP will take the plunge, charge its users a little extra to keep their machines clean, and prove it's possible. "Then I could see a consortium of ISPs getting together to do that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are other ways to clean up the Internet than to slap a tax on the Web, then use the money to launch search-and-destroy missions like the one Microsoft announced last week when it said it had crippled the Waledac botnet, a claim some researchers disputed .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kandek's idea was one sure to upset Microsoft's stockholders. "It would be a radical move, but Microsoft could cut the price of a Windows 7 upgrade to $29, the same price that Apple charges for Snow Leopard ," he said. By slashing the price of Windows 7, Microsoft would convince more users, especially those in developing countries where malware is a major problem in part because it's seeded on the pirated copies of Windows people purchase, to upgrade from less secure versions of Windows and keep their PCs patched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Giving us an incentive to move to Windows 7 would be a great thing," Kandek said. "It could help a lot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESET's Abrams, however, took offense that Charney would suggest a tax when there was so much Microsoft itself could do to make the Internet a safer place. (Abrams wasn't alone...numerous readers of the IDG News Service story that covered Charney's keynote at the RSA Conference this week said much the same thing, although often in more colorful language .)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has allowed a powerful malware-enabling technology to exist that most of the major threats have incorporated," Abrams said, referring to AutoRun, the Microsoft technology that starts some programs automatically when a CD, DVD or other media is inserted. The notorious Conficker worm spread by exploiting AutoRun on flash drives. According to ESET, which is best known for its NOD32 line of antivirus software, almost 30% of in-the-wild malware uses AutoRun as an infection vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft made moves last year to restrict AutoRun, first in Windows 7, then in Vista and XP , Abrams argued that because Microsoft didn't mandate the updates for the latter two operating systems, it doesn't have the right to ask for a tax to pay for clean-up. "They shouldn't point to the user when they have four fingers pointing back to themselves," said Abrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was even more blunt in an entry on the ESET company blog later Thursday. "I appreciate the remarkable and laudable security progress Microsoft has made, but before you, Mr. Charney, ask users to swallow a tax or fee for bot clean up, bite the bullet and clean up the AutoRun infection vector," Abrams wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Scarlato &amp; Karon, P.C. announces that it is investigating potential
violations of federal securities laws against Smithtown Bancorp, Inc. ("SBI" or
the "Company") (NASDAQ: SMTB), relating to the Company`s alleged scheme to
fraudulently inflate its financial results by materially understating its loan
loss reserves. 

An action has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased SBI common stock
between March 13, 2008 and February 1, 2010 (the "Class Period"), for violations
of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

The action alleges that SBI failed to value certain assets at their true fair
value by improperly delaying the recognition of asset impairments in order to
inflate its reported income and asset quality. The Company`s internal and
disclosure controls were also materially deficient - SBI failed to manage its
asset quality, credit administration, and loan and appraisal review processes.
In addition, the action alleges that the Company maintained a commercial real
estate loan concentration that was not commensurate with its business strategy. 

On February 1, 2010, the Company reported a loss of $19.8 million for its fourth
quarter. Operating earnings were more than offset by a $38 million loan loss
provision and a $7 million write-down of real estate owned. SBI also announced
that it entered into a Consent Agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation and a parallel Consent Order with the New York State Banking
Department, which require SBI to improve credit administration, loan
underwriting, loan underwriting, and internal loan review processes, and
maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. 

In response to this news, the Company`s shares declined $0.81 per share, or 15%,
to $4.60 per share. As a result of SBI`s undisclosed misconduct and the fallout
when the truth was revealed through a series of partial disclosures throughout
the Class Period, SBI`s shares lost 77.9% of their value during the Class
Period. 

If you bought Smithtown Bancorp, Inc. securities between March 13, 2008 and
February 1, 2010, you may move to serve as Lead Plaintiff. Lead Plaintiff motion
papers must be filed with the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York no later than April 26, 2010. A lead plaintiff is a
court-appointed representative for absent class members. You do not need to seek
appointment as lead plaintiff to share in any class recovery in this action. If
you are a class member and there is a recovery for the class, you can share in
that recovery as an absent class member. You may retain counsel of your choice
to represent you in this action. 

If you have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or if
you wish to discuss these matters or have any questions concerning this
announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please

&lt;p&gt;New Agreement Consolidates Relationship with Key Tracks Through 2015
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Thirsty race fans taking in the action at some of the most popular NASCAR
racetracks can continue to enjoy an ice-cold Coca-Cola for years to come.
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (SMI) and Coca-Cola North America (CCNA) are
extending their long-term partnership through 2015, ensuring NASCAR fans who
visit premier speedways in locations such as Charlotte, Atlanta and Las Vegas
can open a Coke and Open Happiness as they cheer on their favorite drivers. 

Under the terms of the new agreement, CCNA brands will continue as the "Official
Soft Drink," "Official Sparkling Beverage," "Official Water, "Official Sports
Drink" and "Official Enhanced Water" for six SMI tracks, which include:

* Atlanta Motor Speedway (Hampton, GA) 
* New Hampshire Motor Speedway (Loudon, NH) 
* Infineon Raceway Speedway (Sonoma, CA) 
* Las Vegas Motor Speedway (Las Vegas, NV) 
* Charlotte Motor Speedway (Concord, NC) 
* Texas Motor Speedway (Ft. Worth, TX)

The agreement also features title sponsorship of the Coca-Cola 600 -- the
longest continuous sponsorship of any race in NASCAR -- at Charlotte Motor
Speedway through 2015. 

"Coca-Cola and Speedway Motorsports share the same passion to refresh and
enhance the racing experience for fans," said Beatriz Perez, Senior Vice
President, Integrated Marketing, Coca-Cola North America. "We`ve built a deep
connection between Coca-Cola, NASCAR and its fans. Working with our partners at
SMI, we will continue to intensify that bond by creating even more programs that
bring fans closer to Coca-Cola and the sport they love." 

"For more than 25 years, we`ve worked together with Coca-Cola to entertain and
refresh fans at the world`s greatest speedways, including one of NASCAR`s
cornerstone events, the Coca-Cola 600 on Memorial Day Weekend at Charlotte Motor
Speedway," said Marcus Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer of Speedway
Motorsports, Inc. "Speedway Motorsports is pleased to extend this partnership
between Coca-Cola and six of our speedways where we proudly serve Coca-Cola
products along with the greatest racing entertainment in the world." 

The SMI partnership is a key part of Coca-Cola`s overall role in racing. The
Coca-Cola NASCAR relationship, the association with a majority of tracks, the
Coca-Cola 600, the Coke Zero 400 and the drivers of the Coca-Cola Racing Family
create an ideal relationship between Coca-Cola, the sport and fans. It offers a
multi-faceted experience that connects Coca-Cola with NASCAR fans at every level
-- locally, nationally, at the track, in store, at home and elsewhere. 

Through this partnership extension, Coca-Cola and SMI will continue to create
programs that engage NASCAR fans at SMI tracks and in the local markets and
regions where the tracks are located. NASCAR-themed advertising, packaging,
promotions, at-track activations and customer-specific programs will all be part
of the mix designed to create excitement among racing fans. 

Coca-Cola and NASCAR

Coca-Cola is the official sparkling beverage of NASCAR and has been involved
with stock car racing for more than 40 years. A signature part of the brand`s
NASCAR association is the Coca-Cola Racing Family, a group of top drivers that
includes Greg Biffle, Clint Bowyer, Jeff Burton, Denny Hamlin, Kevin Harvick,
Bobby Labonte, Joey Logano, Ryan Newman, David Ragan, Elliott Sadler, Tony
Stewart, and alumni drivers Kyle Petty, Michael Waltrip, Dale Jarrett and Ned
Jarrett. Coca-Cola Racing Family members make appearances and are featured in
advertising, promotions and packaging. 

In addition, the Coca-Cola 600, held annually at SMI track Charlotte Motor
Speedway, celebrated its 25th running in 2009. July Fourth weekend in 2010 will
mark the third running of the Coke Zero 400 Powered by Coca-Cola at Daytona
International Speedway.

 (Adds detail on subscriptions, buyers, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MILAN, March 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
sold its remaining 16.8 percent stake in Italian cable maker
Prysmian SpA (PRY.MI) on Friday, removing an overhang of stock
which had depressed its share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prysmian shares rose 3.5 percent to more than the price
which dealers said the U.S. investment bank had sold its stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman sold the stake to investors at 12.75 euros a share,
dealers said, in a process which brokers said had offered shares
in a price range of 12.50 to 13 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Orders covered the offering two to three times. The 30.4
million shares were sold to institutions, except for 1.5 million
to Prysmian Chief Executive Valerio Battista, market sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman had acquired the Prysmian cable activities of
Pirelli  C PCEI.MI in 2005 in a private equity deal and has 
sold down its stake. In November it placed a 14.3 percent stake
with institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although the end of the overhang is a clear positive for
the stock, which may therefore rebound in the short term, we
still don't see a recovery in the company's financials," a Milan
brokerage said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week Prysmian announced a fall in core profits,
in line with expectations, but expressed caution on the chances
of a pick-up this year. [ID:nLDE6221B3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Prysmian were up 3.6 percent at 13.67 euros by
1524 GMT, outperforming the Italian FTSEMIB .FTMIB blue chip
index.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is aiming to launch two phones that will be sold by top U.S. mobile operator Verizon Wireless in late spring or early summer, a person briefed on the matter said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phones would be targeted at heavy users of social network sites, according to the person who asked not to be identified as the devices have not yet been announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phones are being developed by Microsoft under the code name Project Pink, the person said. Representatives for Microsoft and Verizon Wireless declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft primarily competes in the wireless industry by selling its Windows mobile software to multiple handset makers, but it has been losing market share to Apple Inc, Google Inc and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software company also sells the Sidekick phone, which is manufactured by Sharp Corp. The Sidekick came from its acquisition of start-up Danger Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has long denied rumors that it is developing new cellphones beyond the Sidekick, but talk about Project Pink has persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology blog Gizmodo on Thursday posted photographs of a black phone with rounded edges that slides open and includes a mini-keyboard. (link.reuters.com/pes33j)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gizmodo said the photographs, which show Microsoft branding and the Verizon Wireless logo, were part of marketing materials that a tipster had sent to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sinead Carew and Bill Rigby, editing by Tiffany Wu, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Microsoft said it will stick to its development strategy for the China Internet search market regardless of the outcome of Google's high-profile spat with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has kept a relatively low profile in China since Google announced its decision to potentially withdraw from the market over censorship issues and following an attack on its systems that it believes originated in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer previously said his company had no plans to pull out of China, indicating it was unlikely to follow Google's lead in challenging a Chinese system that forces Internet companies to self censor their sites on sensitive topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regardless of whether or not Google stays, we will aggressively promote our search and cloud computing (in China)," Zhang Yaqin, chairman of Microsoft's Asia-Pacific RD Group, told Reuters on Friday, on the sidelines of the opening of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China was in consultation with Google to resolve their dispute, Minister Li Yizhong from China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said, also on the sidelines of the NPC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Google spokeswoman declined to confirm or deny that discussions were taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will not be commenting on any discussions with the Chinese government," she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google launched its China search site in 2006, and complies with local laws requiring censorship of certain content such as pornography and sensitive subjects such as the banned Fulun Gong spiritual movement and Tibetan independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and local players, including Baidu, China's search leader, and Sohu.com, must also comply with those laws. Google controls about 31.3 percent of the Chinese Web search market, compared with 63.9 percent for Baidu, according to Analysys International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Microsoft is a bit player in a market that was worth 2 billion yuan ($293 million) in the third quarter, but has high hopes there following the launch of a beta Chinese version of its highly hyped Bing search site launched last June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope to achieve a relatively important place in the China search market," Zhang said.

&lt;p&gt; * Says to spend $500 mln in China this year on RD
 (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Huang Yuntao and Doug Young&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEIJING, March 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) said it will
stick to its development strategy for the China Internet search
market regardless of the outcome of Google's (GOOG.O)
high-profile spat with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has kept a relatively low profile in China since
Google announced its decision to potentially withdraw from the
market over censorship issues and following an attack on its
systems that it believes originated in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer previously said his
company had no plans to pull out of China, indicating it was
unlikely to follow Google's lead in challenging a Chinese system
that forces Internet companies to self censor their sites on
sensitive topics. [ID:nN14165244]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Regardless of whether or not Google stays, we will
aggressively promote our search and cloud computing (in China),"
Zhang Yaqin, chairman of Microsoft's Asia-Pacific RD Group, told
Reuters on Friday, on the sidelines of the opening of the
National People's Congress, China's parliament, in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China was in consultation with Google to resolve their
dispute, Minister Li Yizhong from China's Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology (MIIT) said, also on the sidelines of
the NPC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Google spokeswoman declined to confirm or deny that
discussions were taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will not be commenting on any discussions with the
Chinese government," she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google launched its China search site in 2006, and complies
with local laws requiring censorship of certain content such as
pornography and sensitive subjects such as the banned Fulun Gong
spiritual movement and Tibetan independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and local players, including Baidu (BIDU.O),
China's search leader, and Sohu.com (SOHU.O), must also comply
with those laws. Google controls about 31.3 percent of the
Chinese Web search market, compared with 63.9 percent for Baidu,
according to Analysys International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison, Microsoft is a bit player in a market that was
worth 2 billion yuan ($293 million) in the third quarter, but has
high hopes there following the launch of a beta Chinese version
of its highly hyped Bing search site launched last June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We hope to achieve a relatively important place in the China
search market," Zhang said. "But we must be very patient, we
still need a lot of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zhang added that other key development areas for Microsoft in
China this year would include search and advertising platform
technologies, and development of mobile platforms and cloud
computing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft considers China a vital market for its Web search
business, and is hoping to duplicate early progress for the U.S.
version of Bing in China, the world's largest Internet market by
users with more than 350 million.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zhang added that Microsoft planned to spend about $500
million on research and development in China this year, and
another $150 million on outsourced projects.

Phase III Data Published in The Lancet also Demonstrate Comparable Rates of
Bleeding with Apixaban Versus Enoxaparin
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Apixaban, an oral anticoagulant being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
(NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), was statistically superior to 40 mg
once daily enoxaparin in reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism in
patients undergoing elective total knee replacement surgery, according to the
ADVANCE-2 study results published today in The Lancet. The study results also
showed numerically lower rates of major and clinically relevant non-major
bleeding in patients treated with apixaban compared with those treated with
enoxaparin. These results did not meet statistical significance. 

Apixaban is a novel, oral, highly selective Factor Xa inhibitor, part of a class
of agents being studied for their potential to prevent and treat blood clots in
the veins and arteries. Results of ADVANCE-2 were first presented in July 2009
at the 22nd Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis
in Boston. 

Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, including total knee replacement,
are at high risk for venous thromboembolism. In fact, venous thromboembolism
occurs in 40 to 60 percent of patients undergoing orthopedic surgery who do not
receive preventive care. With an estimated 400,000 people worldwide undergoing
total knee replacement surgery each year, the threat of venous thromboembolism
and its associated morbidity and mortality risk represent a growing challenge to
physicians. 

"One of the major concerns for orthopedic surgeons using oral anticoagulants for
venous thromboembolism prevention in knee surgery is the significant risk of
bleeding," said Michael Rud Lassen, M.D., Hoersholm Hospital in Copenhagen,
Denmark, lead investigator for the study. "We are encouraged by the ADVANCE-2
data, which demonstrated better antithrombotic effect and comparable bleeding
rates for apixaban compared with enoxaparin." 

About ADVANCE-2

ADVANCE-2, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, head-to-head trial was
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral, twice daily apixaban 2.5
mg compared with subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily, over a 10-to-14 day
treatment period for reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients
undergoing elective total knee replacement surgery. Of the 3,221 patients from
27 countries (Europe, Asia/Pacific, Latin America, Africa) enrolled in the
study, 1,973 patients were eligible for the analysis of the primary efficacy
endpoint defined as the composite of asymptomatic and symptomatic deep vein
thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, and death from any cause during study
treatment. The statistical plan for the study required testing non-inferiority
of apixaban before testing for superiority. 

When apixaban was compared with enoxaparin, the primary efficacy endpoint
occurred in 15.1 percent of patients in the apixaban group and 24.4 percent of
patients in the enoxaparin group, demonstrating a statistically significant
relative risk reduction for apixaban of 38 percent (p&lt;0.0001). 

The secondary efficacy outcome of major venous thromboembolism occurred in 1.1
percent of patients in the apixaban group compared with 2.2 percent in the
enoxaparin group, demonstrating a statistically significant relative risk
reduction for apixaban of 50 percent (one-sided p=0.02). 

The primary safety measure of major bleeding occurred in 0.6 percent of patients
who received apixaban, and in 0.9 percent of patients who received enoxaparin,
not reaching statistical significance (p=0.30). The composite outcome of major
bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 3.5 percent and
4.8 percent of patients in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups, respectively, and
did not reach statistical significance (p=0.09). 

The overall safety profiles of apixaban and enoxaparin were similar in
ADVANCE-2. During the treatment and follow-up periods, liver alanine
transaminase (ALT) and liver aspartate transaminase (AST) elevations greater
than three times the upper limit of normal were reported in 2 percent of
patients in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups. Discontinuations due to adverse
events in the apixaban and enoxaparin patient groups were similar. 

About Venous Thromboembolism

Venous thromboembolism encompasses two serious conditions: deep vein thrombosis,
a blood clot in a vein, usually in the leg that partially or totally blocks the
flow of blood; and pulmonary embolism, a blood clot blocking a vessel in the
lungs. Deep vein thrombosis causes multiple symptoms including pain, swelling
and redness and, more importantly, can progress to pulmonary embolism, which
carries the risk of sudden death. 

About the Apixaban Clinical Trial Program

Apixaban is being investigated within the EXPANSE Clinical Trials Program, which
is projected to include nearly 60,000 patients worldwide across multiple
indications and patient populations and includes a total of nine completed or
ongoing, randomized, double-blind Phase III trials, including ADVANCE-2. 

The dose and regimen for apixaban were informed by Phase I and II apixaban
clinical trial data and data modeling results. Dosing apixaban twice daily
appeared to reduce fluctuations in Factor Xa inhibition over the dosing interval
and lower the peak-to-trough ratio for apixaban blood levels compared with
once-daily dosing. 

In addition to prevention of venous thromboembolism, apixaban is in Phase III
trials studying the prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in
patients with atrial fibrillation, the treatment of venous thromboembolism and
in patients with acute coronary syndrome. 

About the Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer Collaboration

In 2007, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into a worldwide collaboration
to develop and commercialize apixaban, an investigational oral anticoagulant
discovered by Bristol-Myers Squibb being studied for the prevention and
treatment of a broad range of venous and arterial thrombotic conditions. This
global alliance combines Bristol-Myers Squibb's long-standing strengths in
cardiovascular drug development and commercialization with Pfizer`s global scale
and expertise in this field to maximize the potential benefits of apixaban for
patients.

&lt;p&gt;OSGi, which is intended to provide modularity for Java, is the focus of efforts afoot at IBM and the Eclipse Foundation, with IBM leveraging OSGi in its application server and Eclipse using it in a new framework for accessing enterprise technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an upcoming feature pack for WebSphere Application Server (WAS) v7, &#160;IBM seeks to make it easier to use OSGi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Last month, InfoWorld reported on Oracle upgrading Eclipse-based plugin technology for building Java and Web services applications. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[OSGi] &#160;provides great modularity and versioning benefits within the application server," said Erik Kristiansen, IBM product manager for WebSphere Application Server Feature Packs, in an interview on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company last month offered a combined beta release of application server technologies based on OSGi and Java Persistence API. The feature pack currently bears the cumbersome name, IBM WebSphere Application Server V7 Feature Pack for OSGi Applications and Java Persistence API &#160;(JPA) 2.0 Open Beta. IBM feels there are "a lot of synergies" between OSGi and JPA and thus combined the two efforts, Kristiansen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature pack, Kristiansen said, was "bringing the OSGi benefits of modularity and componentization to enterprise customers looking to build their applications on top of WAS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM had offered the OSGi feature pack in an alpha form prior to the beta release; no date has been set for the general release. IBM's feature pack is based on the Apache Aries project to offer OSGi services to enterprise application developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're exposing OSGi in a simple way," said Kristiansen. IBM previously has expressed intentions to leverage OSGi to componentize WebSphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSGi is intended to offer easier management of code bases while allowing for more dynamic software that can run plugins and extensions at runtime, Michael Cote, analyst at RedMonk, said. "Java code tends towards the monolithic for some reason and there's a ontinual technical and cultural effort to fight that large complexity," Cote said. "Design-wise, OSGi and other component efforts in Java aspire to be a better way to organize the code in a project with the hopes of making the daily lives of developers simpler."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cote said he has heard a "mixed bag" of views about the usability of OSGi but sentiment overall has been more positive than negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSGi once stood for Open Services Gateway initiative, but now is just referred to by its acronym. JPA 2.0, meanwhile, provides persistence benefits, saving developers from having to write SQL to access databases, Kristiansen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature pack can be downloaded at IBM's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Eclipse, the foundation's Project Gemini is an incubation project linked to the Eclipse runtime, which itself is based on OSGi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal of Gemini is to provide access to standard enterprise technology within a modular framework," according to a Web page describing a session on Gemini planned for the EclipseCon 2010 technical conference being held in Santa Clara, Calif. later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini "will take OSGi and make it possible to make enterprise server-side modules plug together nicely," said Mik Kersten, a former member of the Eclipse board of directors who is still involved with the organization as leader of the Mylyn project, for integrating task and application lifecycle management tools with the Eclipse IDE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini will provide "ready-to-use implementations" of many OSGi Alliance specifications for usage of enterprise technologies within OSGi, according to the EclipseCon 2010 Web page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another recent project at the foundation, Eclipse Virgo, provides an application server based on OSGi. Virgo was derived from the SpringSource dm Server product, which SpringSource has discontinued. SpringSource had cited difficulties in getting enterprise adoption of OSGi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "IBM and Eclipse efforts focus on OSGi modularity," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Christoph Waltz won a best supporting actor Oscar on Sunday for his role as a ruthless Nazi officer in "Inglourious Basterds," claiming his first ever Academy Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Austrian actor was largely unknown by U.S. audiences before his role in director Quentin Tarantino's raucous World War Two film, but his strong performance made him the virtual shoo-in for the Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is your welcoming embrace. There's no way I can thank you enough, but I can start right now," Waltz said, clutching the golden statuette with both hands. "Thank you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 53 year-old Waltz plays the cunning Colonel Hans Landa, who is known as "The Jew Hunter" and is the main villain -- besides, of course, from Adolf Hitler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranging across occupied France, Landa is a kind of evil detective who finds Jews hiding from the Nazi war machine, and also hunts the elite American unit called the Basterds that is scalping Nazi troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landa speaks German, French, English and Italian fluently, and his capacity for charm and persuasion is matched only by his ruthlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waltz comes from a family of actors and theater artists. He studied at the Lee Strasberg Theater  Film Institute in New York as a young man before returning to Europe to begin his career as a stage performer and later on television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his biggest roles came in the 1998 German film "Love Scenes from Planet Earth," in which he played a depressed writer who gets involved with two women after borrowing his father's new car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tarantino, the "Pulp Fiction" director known for rediscovering actors Hollywood has overlooked, liked what he saw in Waltz, and cast him for the central role of Landa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waltz competed for the best supporting actor Oscar this year against Christopher Plummer for "The Last Station," Matt Damon for "Invictus," Woody Harrelson for "The Messenger" and Stanley Tucci for "The Lovely Bones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his role in "Inglourious Basterds," Waltz previously won acting awards at the Cannes film festival, the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and a slew of critics' choice contests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Mary Milliken and Sandra Maler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Austrian unknown in U.S. before "Inglourious Basterds"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Comes from a family of actors and theater artists
 (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, March 7 (Reuters) - Christoph Waltz won a best
supporting actor Oscar on Sunday for his role as a ruthless
Nazi officer in "Inglourious Basterds," claiming his first ever
Academy Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Austrian actor was largely unknown by U.S. audiences
before his role in director Quentin Tarantino's raucous World
War Two film, but his strong performance made him the virtual
shoo-in for the Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is your welcoming embrace. There's no way I can thank

rediscovering actors Hollywood has overlooked, liked what he
saw in Waltz, and cast him for the central role of Landa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Waltz competed for the best supporting actor Oscar this
year against Christopher Plummer for "The Last Station," Matt
Damon for "Invictus," Woody Harrelson for "The Messenger" and
Stanley Tucci for "The Lovely Bones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For his role in "Inglourious Basterds," Waltz previously
won acting awards at the Cannes film festival, the Golden
Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and a slew of critics'
choice contests.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, March 7 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) wheeled
out its chief executive and pledged to invest in growth as it
sought to win the bidding to buy German generic drugmaker
Ratiopharm GmbH, sources familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Jeff Kindler and an array of top-rank managers at the
world's biggest drugmaker arrived on Friday in the southern
German town of Ulm, where Ratiopharm is based, for a closed-door
presentation on their vision for Ratiopharm, should Pfizer
succeed with what sources have previously said is around a 3
billion euro ($4 billion) bid. [ID:nN02189931]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several sources familiar with the meeting between the Pfizer
executives and about 50 Ratiopharm managers said the visitors
pledged to build out Ratiopharm's European generics business and
increase production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer promised investment," one source told Reuters on
Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer and Ratiopharm, which is being sold by the family of
late German billionaire Adolf Merckle to repay creditors,
declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is the second of three suitors to present its concept
for the Ratiopharm business, following generics industry leader
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icelandic generics maker Actavis is expected to outline its
offer on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources told Reuters that Pfizer's plan was to integrate
Ratiopharm into its Established Products business unit and make
it the centre of Pfizer's generics business in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Ratiopharm name would be retained and developed into a
worldwide brand, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is keen to push ahead with Ratiopharm's biotechnology
generics, known as biosimilars, an area where Pfizer has not
been active, the sources added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's Established Products business in Europe has
achieved sales of about 3 billion euros up to now but would be
expected to grow substantially after the addition of Ratiopharm
to reach sales of around 5 billion euros, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like rival drug majors such as Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) and
Novartis (NOVN.VX), Pfizer aims to couple its traditional
research-based drugs businesses with generics to turn the loss
of patent exclusivity -- at least in part -- to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has already struck a string of collaborations and
acquisitions to bolster its range of generics, particularly in
off-patent injectable drugs, unveiling an alliance with India's
Strides Arcolab Ltd (STAR.BO) earlier this year. [ID:nN05118596]
[ID:nN19348581]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say a takeover of Ratiopharm would help Pfizer sink
production costs in its generic business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REASSURING REPORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following the Pfizer presentation, Ratiopharm's management
wrote an internal letter to employees summarising its content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The investor is targeting significant growth in the coming
years and, with the Ratiopharm group, aims to achieve market
leadership in generics," Ratiopharm Chief Executive Oliver
Windholz said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The bidder emphasised the high efficiency of Ratiopharm's
domestic and foreign production sites and told the meeting it
was ready to make investments in Ulm," the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industrial heir Ludwig Merckle put Ratiopharm on the block
as part of concessions made to creditors by his father Adolf
Merckle, who committed suicide in January 2009 after ceding
control of his business empire to lenders during the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources have told Reuters that a decision on the sale of
Ratiopharm is unlikely before the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company vies with Stada Arzneimittel (STAGn.DE) for
second place among generics makers in Germany, the world's
second biggest generics market, trailing the Hexal brand owned
by Novartis's (NOVN.VX) Sandoz unit.

&lt;p&gt;Responding to reports last week that its European ballot screen was not truly randomizing the positions of the top five browsers, Microsoft today said it has changed the algorithm that shuffles the spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can confirm that we made a change to the random icon order algorithm in the browser choice screen for Europe," said Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz today. "We are confident the algorithm change will be an improvement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The browser ballot, which began to show last week in the Windows Update queues of European users, was mandated by an agreement Microsoft reached last year with European Union antitrust regulators. The ballot appears on Windows PCs where Internet Explorer (IE) is set as the default browser, and lets users download and install rivals, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Rob Weir, an IBM software architect who had tested the ballot screen's randomization, accused Microsoft of sloppy programming that skewed the results toward Google 's Chrome, most often put IE in the fifth spot at the far right, and gave Opera an edge over Firefox for the first position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weir noticed the improved algorithm last Saturday. "Sometime last week -- I don't know the exact date -- Microsoft updated the code for the browser choice website with a new random shuffle algorithm," Weir said in an entry on his personal blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His tests of the new algorithm showed that the chances of a browser ending up in each of the five top spots on the ballot are essentially equal. "This looks fine to me," Weir concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weir has posted a revamped HTML file that uses the new algorithm to test the ballot; users can run the test by entering an iteration count. To most accurately mimic the actual ballot, the HTML file should be run with IE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;Even though Microsoft has dropped a plan to wait nearly two years after Windows 7's launch to issue a first service pack, it won't deliver the update before the fourth quarter of this year, a site that has accurately predicted past Windows timetables said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would be smart to reconsider and delay a service pack as long as possible, one analyst countered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TechARP.com , a Malaysian Web site that has nailed previous service pack schedules for both Windows XP and Vista, said unnamed sources had originally pegged a 22-month development schedule for Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1). But Microsoft has since changed its mind, reportedly to address an unknown number of "serious" performance bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The earliest Microsoft can realistically release Service Pack 1 for Windows 7 is in the last quarter of 2010," the site said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That schedule would, in fact, fit with the timetable Microsoft used for the two desktop operating systems prior to Windows 7. The company issued Windows XP SP1 slightly more than 10 months after the release of XP in October 2001, and delivered the first service pack for Vista about 12 months after Vista's January 2007 retail launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no required rule for a service pack," observed Michael Cherry, an analyst with Kirkland, Wash.-based Directions on Microsoft. "It's a psychological milestone. They've trained us to wait for SP1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would benefit by postponing Windows 7 SP1, Cherry argued. "Windows 7 has pretty good momentum right now, and that might slow down if they announce a service pack. Then, logically, that's when people will wait. It could put the dampers on [Windows 7's] good sales right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Peter Klein, Microsoft's chief financial officer, the company has sold 90 million licenses to Windows 7 since July 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment on TechARP's claims, or on a Windows 7 service pack in general. "Per Microsoft policy, we do not comment on rumors or speculation," a spokeswoman said today via e-mail. "We have nothing new to announce at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Microsoft wants to break people of the habit of waiting for SP1, this would be the time to do it," said Cherry, citing the popularity of Windows 7 and the almost unanimous praise the operating system has received. "I'm not hearing any significant problems with Windows 7, so this time, waiting for SP1 you may be doing yourself a disservice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may also be leery of releasing a service pack because of those positive reviews of Windows 7, and the chance that a flawed service pack could poison the well. "You have a good success on your hands," said Cherry, "so the last thing you want is a bad service pack."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft first released Vista in 2007, company executives argued that a service pack wouldn't be necessary because Windows Update could deliver fixes as they became available. Microsoft later backed away from that position. It hasn't made the same argument about Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherry explained why a service pack was still necessary. "When a person buys a new computer and they go to Windows Update, and there's 50, 60, 70 updates waiting, at some point it becomes burdensome," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has issued several stability and reliability updates for Windows 7 since its late-October launch. The January stability update, however, caused some Windows 7 systems to randomly freeze or display the "Blue screen of death" error screen. Microsoft said the reports were not a "major problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission's decision to launch an antitrust investigation into Google Inc.'s activities has intensified that company's already heated competition with Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EC announced late last month that it had initiated an antitrust probe into Google based on complaints from three European companies, two with connections to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer last week acknowledged his company's role in pushing government regulators to pursue such investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not being silent; we're expressing some of the issues and frustrations we see. Certainly, sometimes that is unsolicited, but oftentimes, it's because we've been asked," Ballmer told an audience at the Search Marketing Expo in Santa Clara, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's complaints to the EC are just the latest skirmish in an escalating battle between Google and Microsoft on several fronts, including the operating systems and enterprise apps markets, and the online search business in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to industry analysts, the EC investigation could slow Google's momentum by forcing its executives to shift their focus from developing new tools and moving into new markets to defending the company against the antitrust allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the very least, this will force Google to spend time and resources complying with the investigation and mounting a legal defense," said Dan Olds, an analyst at Gabriel Consulting Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google has to take this seriously, [though] at this point, we don't know whether it's going to be a mountain or a molehill," Olds added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year or so, Microsoft has been spending a lot of money and development resources trying to poach some of Google's 60% share of the search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts to outdo Google in the search business "could take [Microsoft] a lot of years and a massive investment," said Rob Enderle, an analyst at Enderle Group. "The disparity in market share is simply too large for them to close the gap unless Google makes a massive sustained mistake or is hit by a successful antitrust action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using legal maneuvers to distract Google "potentially shortens the time and the investment needed," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia Holtz, Google's top antitrust lawyer, questioned Microsoft's motives in seeking an antitrust probe via complaints made to the EC by Ciao GmbH, a Munich-based company acquired by Microsoft in 2008, and Foundem, a Bracknell, England-based price comparison site and a member of the iComp trade group, which is largely funded by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is our competitor, and that explains many actions," Holtz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Heiner, vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft, countered in a blog post that "Google hasn't been shy about raising antitrust concerns about Microsoft in the last few years. Ultimately, what's important is not who is complaining, but whether or not the challenged practices are anticompetitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Niccolai, Nancy Gohring and Paul Meller of the IDG News Service contributed to this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) was sued on Monday by a large union pension fund that accused the Wall Street investment bank of overpaying its executives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Brotherhood of Electric Workers fund filed the lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, seeking to recover money for the company on behalf of other shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seeks to stop Goldman from allocating roughly 47 percent of 2009 net revenue as compensation, saying such allocations "vastly overcompensate management and constitute corporate waste."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit also wants Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and others in management, rather than shareholders, to be responsible for charitable contributions that Goldman is making as a an apology for its activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been at the center of a public debate over how much banks should pay out in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, after taking billions of dollars of federal bailout money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Goldman said it would cap 2009 compensation expense at $16.2 billion, for a 36 percent compensation ratio, despite posting a record profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also said its board rejected several shareholder demands to investigate recent pay awards and recoup excessive pay, while admitting it could face "negative publicity" from media portrayals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Ed Canaday said: "We believe the lawsuit is completely without merit." A lawyer for the plaintiff did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is similar to one filed in the same court in January by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA, which oversees public transit in the Philadelphia area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 98 Pension Fund v. Blankfein et al, Delaware Chancery Court, No. 5315,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Steve Eder; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

U.S. Gets $1.5B from BofA Warrants

The Treasury has received net proceeds of $1.5 billion from the sale of warrants
that entitled it to purchase common stock of Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC). 

The Treasury received these warrants as part of its investment in BofA through
the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) during the height of the financial
crisis. In Dec 2009, BofA repaid the entire $45 billion of bailout money it had
received from the government. 

The current move will completely free BofA from government intervention. This is
the largest amount received by the Treasury from the sale of warrants of a
single institution. 

The amount received from the auction of BofA warrants exceeds $1.1 billion
raised from the sale of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) warrants earlier. 

The Treasury auctioned one tranche of warrants at $8.35 each and the other at
$2.55 each. The 272.17 million warrants were sold by the Treasury in a modified
Dutch auction as BofA and the government did not agree on an acceptable price. 

BofA is the first among four banks whose warrants are scheduled to be sold via
auctions this month. The three other banks are Washington Federal (Nasdaq:
WFSL), Texas Capital Bancshares (Nasdaq: TCBI) and Signature Bank (Nasdaq:
SBNY).

Earnings estimates for Kraft Inc. (NYSE: KFT) are declining following the
release of strong fourth quarter and full year 2009 results. Kraft completed
2009 on a strong note with fourth-quarter earnings increasing 17.1% from the
year-ago period to 48 cents per share. Full-year earnings increased 6.8% to
$2.03 per share. 

Fourth-quarter revenues grew 3.2% to $11.0 billion. Revenues were positively
impacted by foreign exchange (FX) fluctuations (3.2%). However, full-year
revenues declined 3.7% to $40.4 billion. 

Providing for the impact of the divestiture mentioned above, several analysts
following the stock have revised their estimates over the past 30 days. As a
result, six of the 17 analysts following the stock lowered earnings estimates
for fiscal 2010. This brought the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year down to
$2.11, 5 cents below the estimate 30 days ago. 

The estimates for the March and June quarters of 2010 have also been reduced by
3 cents each. 

The company expects revenue growth of 4% for the upcoming quarter and earnings
growth excluding special items are expected at the high end of the 7% to 9%
guidance range, which is between 53 cents and 55 cents. The current Zacks
Consensus Estimate of $0.47 is below the guided range. However, considering
Kraft`s previous track record, we believe the company will achieve the guided
numbers. 

Our belief is strengthened by the fact that earnings exceeded the Zacks
Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with a four-quarter
average positive surprise of 8.25%. This means that on average, earnings beat
the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.25%. Therefore, although surprises have varied
considerably from quarter to quarter and this trend could continue in future, we
expect the average surprise for the year to be positive. 

AmEx Downgraded to Neutral

We are downgrading our recommendation on American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) to
Neutral from Outperform as we expect the overall economic recovery to be
sluggish and hence AmEx`s top line growth will face obstacles in the near term. 

AmEx`s fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of 59 cents per share
were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents, driven primarily by
lower provision for credit losses, increased cardmember spending and stable
expenses as a result of its re-engineering efforts. 

Also, credit trends are now showing signs of improvement. However, decreased
revenue, a lower return on average equity (ROE) and miserable real estate values
as a result of higher unemployment were downsides. 

OSG Commences Stock Offering

Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (NYSE: OSG) yesterday announced the beginning
of the public offering of its 3,500,000 shares underwritten on its common stock.
With this move, the company aims to increase its capital and enhance liquidity. 

At a sale price of $46.99 per share, the public stock offering is expected to
raise about $165 million for OSG upon successful completion on Mar 10, 2010. For
this, the company has appointed Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. (NYSE: GS) as the sole
underwriter. 

OSG expects to utilize the net proceeds of the stock offering for general and
corporate purposes that includes apportioning funds for capital expenditure and
working capital of the company. OSG also expects to pay back its revolving
credit facilities and other existing debt obligations from the proceeds of the
stock offering. 

Given the current volatility in the markets and the sluggish recovery that has
been affecting the operating results adversely, we believe that increasing
capital through share issue can provide liquidity and stability to the balance
sheet of OSG, although dilution of shares weighs on the earnings per share. 

Eastman Guides Lower

Eastman Chemical Co. (NYSE: EMN) has announced recently that it expects profits
in the first quarter to be down 25 cents per share. Eastman had previously
forecast first-quarter earnings to be slightly above fourth-quarter earnings of
$1.14 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.15. 

The Kingsport, TN-based company attributed the decline in earnings to power
outages at a Texas facility. Eastman had announced a power outage at its
Longview, Texas, plant on February 20 this year. The company stated that it
expects most of the impact of the outage to be offset by higher-than-expected
sales and operating margins. 

Eastman Chemical Company manufactures and sells chemicals, plastics and fibers
with 12 manufacturing sites in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific, supplying
products throughout the world. Eastman is the global leader in acetate yarn and
the only producer of acetate flake as well as acetate yarn in the U.S. This
provides the company an edge over its competitors such as Industrias del Acetato
de Celulosa S.A., SK, Mitsubishi Rayon, UAB Korelita and Novaceta SpA.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Second graph, first sentence of release should read: "It was the right thing to
do in 2006, and it continues to be the right thing to do today," said Sandy
Douglas, president of Coca-Cola North America (sted "It was the right thing to

The corrected release reads: 

THE COCA-COLA SYSTEM DELIVERS ON ITS COMMITMENT TO SCHOOLS ACROSS THE U.S.

Implementation of Beverage Industry School Guidelines Results in an 88 Percent
Decline in Calories Delivered to Schools by Industry

Today, the Coca-Cola system in the U.S. proudly joined with the William J.
Clinton Foundation, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation and members of the
American Beverage Association (ABA) to announce that it has successfully
delivered on its three-year commitment to increase the availability of no- and
low-calorie beverages to schools across the country. As a result, the industry
has driven an 88 percent reduction in total calories from beverages delivered to
schools in the first half of the current school year, as compared to the first
of the 2004-2005 school year. 

"It was the right thing to do in 2006, and it continues to be the right thing to
do today," said Sandy Douglas, president of Coca-Cola North America. "The
Coca-Cola system is extraordinarily proud of what we have accomplished and how
we are making it easier for schools and parents to help young people make
balanced choices." 

The Coca-Cola system helped institute the U.S. School Beverage Guidelines in
2006 by voluntarily removing regular soft drinks from U.S. schools. At the
beginning of the 2009-2010 school year, 98.8 percent of schools and school
districts measured were in compliance with the School Beverage Guidelines. 

"Coca-Cola recognizes that the world is changing and that Americans are
increasingly looking for ways to lead balanced, active lifestyles," said Steve
Cahillane, president of Coca-Cola Enterprises, North American Business Unit.
"Today`s achievement is the latest example of the Coca-Cola system`s commitment
to being a responsible school partner and to supporting education through active
lifestyle programs in schools." 

The Coca-Cola system`s commitment to schools and education goes beyond the
cafeteria. The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers share a legacy of supporting
education through programs like the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation. Since 1986,
the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation has awarded more than $53 million in
scholarships to more than 10,000 students across a variety of scholarship
programs. 

Through the popular online loyalty program, MyCokeRewards.com, parents and local
school communities can donate their MyCokeRewards points and enable local
schools to obtain sports and playground equipment, art and music supplies and
resources to supplement their educational programs for students. Since
MyCokeRewards for Schools launched in 2008, more than 21 million points have
been donated to 4,000 schools throughout the U.S. These schools have then
redeemed their points for more than 3,300 rewards valued at $320,000.

&lt;p&gt;Honing in on the need for more security in application development, IBM Rational is planning an enterprise-level &#160;product that features two separately acquired technologies for security testing and code scanning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product, which would be released later this year, would feature Rational AppScan testing capabilities, acquired when IBM bought Watchfire in 2007, and the former Ounce Labs software that checks code for security issues, said David Grant, director of security solutions at Rational, in an interview late last week. IBM bought Ounce last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld reported last month on Microsoft forging a linkage between SDL and agile development projects via a downloadable template. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[The combined product] brings a whole new level of accuracy to security testing," &#160;Grant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AppScan has tested software from the inside, looking at applications already built, while Ounce does inside-out testing of source code for security flaws. "What we're working on is really bringing those two together," said Grant. IBM furthered development of AppScan in 2008 to feature analysis during the software development process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AppScan technology, Grant said, has been embedded in Rational software delivery lifecycle products, such as RequisitePro and Quality Manager. Ounce technology also is being incorporated into Rational offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application security is becoming more important because software is driving everything these days and Web applications are front-ending business application, Grant said. This can expose systems to outsiders, including malicious individuals, who can access sensitive information, Grant said. But security typically has not been at the forefront of software development, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem with application security is developers typically aren't trained, aren't incented, to be honest with you," to prevent security flaws in applications, Grant said. Security issues can occur such as SQL injection, in which a database gives improper access to information, or cross-site scripting, in which a&#160; browser session is hijacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most software development shops lack security knowledge, said analyst Chenxi Wang, of Forrester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Developers largely do not care about security, nor do they have time to. Therefore, what we are seeing is that the high end of the market - the more sophisticated development shops, start to have security mandates but the majority of the development shops are far, far behind in terms of knowledge about security in development and the willingness to do something about it," Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also becoming an issue in secure application development is cloud application deployment. "Cloud is yet another driver of exposing more critical business apps [in] the wild," said Grant.&#160; "Out in the Web, when you're building cloud-enabled systems, you've got to make sure to put them through the secure lifecycle as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is not the only major vendor focusing on security for application development. Microsoft has released its SDL (Security Development Lifecycle) best practices for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SDL is a set of best practices and partnerships. They don't actually have security testing products," embedded in their software, Grant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "IBM looks to pair security technologies for software development," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

release contributed approximately 10.5% of the overall domestic box on an
estimated 2.5%of the total screens, and IMAX theatres posted a domestic per

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant Charged With Forum Shopping and Violating Promises to Litigate Claims
in Ecuador

(Chevron`s hearing is scheduled for 2 p.m. on March 10 before Judge Leonard B.
Sand in courtroom 
15A of the United States Courthouse at 500 Pearl St. in Manhattan.)  


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chevron will be forced to explain to a U.S. federal judge this Wednesday why it
believes it has the right to take the seven-year Ecuador environmental case
(Aguinda v. ChevronTexaco) to a closed-door binding arbitration where the
rainforest communities cannot appear, in apparent violation of the company`s
previous promises that it would litigate the case in its requested forum of
Ecuador. 

The trial judge in the environmental case - where Chevron faces damages of up to
$27 billion for allegedly poisoning an area the size of Rhode Island -- has yet
to rule in what experts believe is one of the most extensively litigated
environmental trials ever. Because Chevron expects to lose the trial due to
indisputable scientific evidence proving extensive contamination, it is trying
to use the arbitration to force Ecuador`s government to quash the case before it
can end, according to representatives of the rainforest communities. 

Chevron is trying to abandon the trial even though over the last seven years the
parties have produced more than 64,000 chemical sampling results, conducted 103
court-supervised inspections of former Chevron well sites scattered throughout
the rainforest, and created a trial record than runs to more than 200,000 pages.


"Chevron acts like a fugitive from justice in Ecuador because the evidence
establishing the company`s misconduct is overwhelming," said Jonathon Abady, an
American lawyer representing the rainforest communities in the federal court
action. 

"We plan to explain to the court that Chevron has no legal basis for the
arbitration and is engaging in blatant forum shopping to avoid responsibility
for an environmental disaster," added Abady, of the law firm Emery, Celli,
Brinckerhoff &amp; Abady in New York City. 

The hearing before Judge Sand will examine whether Chevron should be enjoined
from initiating a private arbitration against Ecuador`s government under the
U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In what the plaintiffs describe as a
"radical" maneuver that undermines the rule of law, Chevron claims the trade
treaty gives it the right to force Ecuador`s government to order its courts to
extinguish the Aguinda case on the grounds Chevron has been treated unfairly in
the trial even though Chevron has yet to actually lose. 

The arbitration is Chevron`s primary attempt to "escape" from an adverse
judgment in Ecuador that would significantly increase its financial exposure,
said Illann Maazel, who is litigating the case with Abady. "Chevron is
contriving the argument it is being treated unfairly to avoid its legal
obligations," he said. 

The Aguinda plaintiffs and the government of Ecuador have filed separate
petitions with the New York court claiming there is no legal basis for Chevron`s
hoped-for arbitration because it violates the company`s earlier promises to the
same court to subject itself to jurisdiction in Ecuador and abide by any
judgment there. The promises induced the U.S. court to transfer the case to
Ecuador in 2002 over the objections of the rainforest communities, who had filed
their action in the U.S. in 1993. 

From 1993 to 2002, Chevron submitted 14 sworn affidavits to the U.S. court
praising Ecuador`s judicial system in an effort to induce the court to transfer
the case to the South American nation. 

After Chevron won the battle over venue, the plaintiffs re-filed the lawsuit in
Ecuador in 2003 only to find on the first day of trial that Chevron tried to
fight jurisdiction in violation of its earlier promises to the U.S. judge. In
2004, as the evidence against it mounted, Chevron initiated a previous
arbitration against Ecuador`s government claiming it should bear all liability
in the case. 

In 2007, Judge Sand (the same judge presiding over the hearing on March 10)
permanently stayed Chevron`s first attempt at arbitration. Chevron also lost
unanimously on appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected its petition for
review. 

The plaintiffs plan to tell the court that Chevron is violating the rule of law
by trying to again start an arbitration that essentially will hijack their
claims into another court where they cannot appear, said Maazel. 

"Chevron apparently thinks it is above the law and therefore does not need to be
held accountable in any public court," said Maazel. "But no company should be
allowed to evade accountability for an egregious wrong just because it has an
unlimited budget to litigate the same issues endlessly." 

The Aguinda lawsuit charges that Texaco (which Chevron bought in 2001) created a
system of oil extraction in the Amazon rainforest that deliberately discharged
billions of gallons of toxic wastewater into streams and rivers and abandoned
more than 900 unlined waste pits filled with toxic sludge. In 2008, a Special
Master appointed by the Ecuador court found that the pollution had caused 1,401
excess cancer deaths and decimated indigenous groups, leading to a host of
oil-related illnesses.

&lt;p&gt;MORRISVILLE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Visara International announces the CNA-8000 Channel Network Appliance, a channel
attached gateway communications platform that provides a robust alternative to
Cisco Routers with Channel Interface Processors (CIP`s), IBM 3172 and 2216
gateways. The CNA-8000 can be configured to provide gateway functions for TN3270
clients, SNA PU2 traffic, and TCP/IP traffic.

The CNA-8000 Channel Network Appliance consists of an enterprise class 3U rack
mountable server platform running Linux software. The server is equipped with
dual RAID drives, three hot swappable power supplies and several hot swappable
fans. 

According to Visara International's CEO Dr. Kenneth A. Bloom: "IBM and Cisco
decided to end their production and support for 3172, 2216 and CIP, leaving
customers without an adequate replacement until the CNA-8000." 

The CNA-8000 can be configured to support up to 8,192 TN3270E capable clients.
Up to 2048 downstream PU2.0 and PU2.1 platforms are supported through each

&lt;p&gt;PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Animal Health today welcomed the signing of an agreement between Pfizer
and Elanco, the animal health business unit of Eli Lilly and Company, under
which Elanco will acquire European rights to a portfolio of certain Pfizer

contingent upon approval by European regulatory authorities and other closing
conditions. 

"This divestiture follows Pfizer`s acquisition of Wyeth that furthered our
commitment to the industry by providing even more comprehensive treatment
options across the animal health market," said Albert Bourla, Pfizer Animal
Health Area President of Europe, Africa, Asia and Pacific Region. "We are
continuing to build a new Pfizer Animal Health in Europe by delivering a product
portfolio across all species, investing in innovation and new partnerships, and
extending our Value Added Services program."

portfolio of products previously marketed by Pfizer Animal Health and Fort Dodge
Animal Health, including vaccines, parasiticides and feed additives, that are
used in both food production animal and companion animal segments, as well as a
Fort Dodge biologicals manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. All current

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant Charged With Forum Shopping and Violating Promises to Litigate Claims
in Ecuador

(Chevron`s hearing is scheduled for 2 p.m. on March 10 before Judge Leonard B.
Sand in courtroom 
15A of the United States Courthouse at 500 Pearl St. in Manhattan.)  


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chevron will be forced to explain to a U.S. federal judge this Wednesday why it
believes it has the right to take the seven-year Ecuador environmental case
(Aguinda v. ChevronTexaco) to a closed-door binding arbitration where the
rainforest communities cannot appear, in apparent violation of the company`s
previous promises that it would litigate the case in its requested forum of
Ecuador. 

The trial judge in the environmental case - where Chevron faces damages of up to
$27 billion for allegedly poisoning an area the size of Rhode Island -- has yet
to rule in what experts believe is one of the most extensively litigated
environmental trials ever. Because Chevron expects to lose the trial due to
indisputable scientific evidence proving extensive contamination, it is trying
to use the arbitration to force Ecuador`s government to quash the case before it
can end, according to representatives of the rainforest communities. 

Chevron is trying to abandon the trial even though over the last seven years the
parties have produced more than 64,000 chemical sampling results, conducted 103
court-supervised inspections of former Chevron well sites scattered throughout
the rainforest, and created a trial record than runs to more than 200,000 pages.


"Chevron acts like a fugitive from justice in Ecuador because the evidence
establishing the company`s misconduct is overwhelming," said Jonathon Abady, an
American lawyer representing the rainforest communities in the federal court
action. 

"We plan to explain to the court that Chevron has no legal basis for the
arbitration and is engaging in blatant forum shopping to avoid responsibility
for an environmental disaster," added Abady, of the law firm Emery, Celli,
Brinckerhoff &amp; Abady in New York City. 

The hearing before Judge Sand will examine whether Chevron should be enjoined
from initiating a private arbitration against Ecuador`s government under the
U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In what the plaintiffs describe as a
"radical" maneuver that undermines the rule of law, Chevron claims the trade
treaty gives it the right to force Ecuador`s government to order its courts to
extinguish the Aguinda case on the grounds Chevron has been treated unfairly in
the trial even though Chevron has yet to actually lose. 

The arbitration is Chevron`s primary attempt to "escape" from an adverse
judgment in Ecuador that would significantly increase its financial exposure,
said Illann Maazel, who is litigating the case with Abady. "Chevron is
contriving the argument it is being treated unfairly to avoid its legal
obligations," he said. 

The Aguinda plaintiffs and the government of Ecuador have filed separate
petitions with the New York court claiming there is no legal basis for Chevron`s
hoped-for arbitration because it violates the company`s earlier promises to the
same court to subject itself to jurisdiction in Ecuador and abide by any
judgment there. The promises induced the U.S. court to transfer the case to
Ecuador in 2002 over the objections of the rainforest communities, who had filed
their action in the U.S. in 1993. 

From 1993 to 2002, Chevron submitted 14 sworn affidavits to the U.S. court
praising Ecuador`s judicial system in an effort to induce the court to transfer
the case to the South American nation. 

After Chevron won the battle over venue, the plaintiffs re-filed the lawsuit in
Ecuador in 2003 only to find on the first day of trial that Chevron tried to
fight jurisdiction in violation of its earlier promises to the U.S. judge. In
2004, as the evidence against it mounted, Chevron initiated a previous
arbitration against Ecuador`s government claiming it should bear all liability
in the case. 

In 2007, Judge Sand (the same judge presiding over the hearing on March 10)
permanently stayed Chevron`s first attempt at arbitration. Chevron also lost
unanimously on appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected its petition for
review. 

The plaintiffs plan to tell the court that Chevron is violating the rule of law
by trying to again start an arbitration that essentially will hijack their
claims into another court where they cannot appear, said Maazel. 

"Chevron apparently thinks it is above the law and therefore does not need to be
held accountable in any public court," said Maazel. "But no company should be
allowed to evade accountability for an egregious wrong just because it has an
unlimited budget to litigate the same issues endlessly." 

The Aguinda lawsuit charges that Texaco (which Chevron bought in 2001) created a
system of oil extraction in the Amazon rainforest that deliberately discharged
billions of gallons of toxic wastewater into streams and rivers and abandoned
more than 900 unlined waste pits filled with toxic sludge. In 2008, a Special
Master appointed by the Ecuador court found that the pollution had caused 1,401
excess cancer deaths and decimated indigenous groups, leading to a host of
oil-related illnesses.

&lt;p&gt;Real-Time Navigation Application Among Several Improvements for Customers
FAIRFAX, Va.--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil introduced a new feature that will allow customers to download Exxon
and Mobil service station locations to their GPS devices. 

This feature is downloadable from the ExxonMobil Station Locator website and is
compatible with the leading consumer GPS devices, including Garmin, TomTom and
Magellan. The site features easy to follow instructions along with a video
tutorial. 

"This GPS download feature provides a fast and convenient way for our customers
to locate Exxon and Mobil stations," said Ben Soraci, Director, U.S. Retail
Sales. 

Other enhancements to the Station Locator feature include a Spanish-language
option and real-time traffic reports. 

Soraci said these enhancements build on improvements ExxonMobil made to its
web-based Station Locator feature in 2009. 

Last spring, ExxonMobil revamped its website to include Google mapping
technology. For the first time, ExxonMobil customers were able to produce
turn-by-turn driving directions to Exxon and Mobil stations, as well as a range
of useful consumer services such as repair shops, convenience stores and ATM
locations. 

This revamp more than doubled the traffic on ExxonMobil`s Station Locator
website over the last twelve months. Monthly views went from about 1 million at
the time to about 2.5 million views a month, currently. 

The Exxon and Mobil Station Locator serves as the online face for each retail
location, and links directly to individual station home pages. Customers can
reach the updated website by logging onto www.exxonmobil.com and clicking on
"Find a Station" under the quick links section.

&lt;p&gt;The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has awarded the 2009 A.M. Turing Award to Charles P. Thacker, for his work in pioneering the networked personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1974, while at the Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), Thacker built a prototype of a desktop computer, called the Alto. It featured a number of innovations that have since become commonplace on PCs, including a television-like screen, a graphical user interface and a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) text editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Alto was an amazing accomplishment," said Charles Simonyi, who worked with Thacker at PARC and contributed software to the Alto. Simonyi later went on to head up Microsoft's application software group. "The idea was to design something for the future, when the component prices came down. And that worked perfectly: The prices did come down and the design was correct."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with IDG, Thacker recalled that the Alto development was led both by himself -- he handled the hardware side -- and Butler Lampson, who developed the software. The original prototype cost US$12,000. "This was a time in which $12,000 was a lot of money," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw the appeal immediately. Simonyi said PARC employees and associates would sneak in at night to use the Alto to carry out mundane tasks like assembling Parent-Teacher Association newsletters or writing up a Ph.D thesis. "It was the first computer used by non-computer people for their own personal ends," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The innovation was not limited to the computer itself. "We had a system. We had the computers, the network, the laser printers and the servers all hooked up together," Thacker said. "That was the real benefit in my mind, that we were able to put together an entire system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award also recognizes Thacker's work in helping develop Ethernet, as well as his early prototypes of the multiprocessor workstation and the tablet personal computer. The secret to staying innovative? "You try to hire people who are smarter than you are," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Thacker studies computer architecture at Microsoft Research, at the company's Silicon Valley campus. He holds 29 patents in computer systems and networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1966, the ACM has bestowed the Turing Award, named after British mathematician and computer pioneer Alan M. Turning, on computer scientists and engineers who have made great strides in advancing the frontier of computer science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other recipients of the award, which ACM describes as the Nobel Prize in Computing, include Donald Knuth, Alan Kay and Vinton Cerf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thacker will be awarded a US$250,000 prize and will be honored in a banquet to be held in June in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fixed eight flaws in Windows and Office today, but passed on patching one Windows component because it cannot be automatically updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight bugs patched today were far from the near-record 26 that Microsoft fixed last month when it delivered 13 security updates. Both of today's bulletins were ranked "important," the second-highest rating in Microsoft's four-step severity scoring system, even though the company acknowledged that the eight vulnerabilities could be used to completely compromise a Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although security experts recommended that users deploy the Office fix first, several argued today that the Windows update was more interesting because Microsoft declined to patch one of the two pieces of involved software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS10-016 fixes a single flaw in Windows Movie Maker, a consumer-grade video editor bundled with Windows Vista, and available as a separate download for users of Windows XP and Windows 7 . Hackers could exploit the bug and hijack the PC by duping users into opening a malicious Movie Maker project file, which uses the ".mswmm" file extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft patched Movie Maker, it passed over Producer 2003, a downloadable add-on for PowerPoint 2002 and PowerPoint 2003 that allows those presentation makers to play .mswmm files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry Bryant, a senior manager for the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), and the group's usual spokesman, explained why the company didn't patch Producer 2003. "Our standard approach is to produce updates that can be deployed automatically for all affected products at the same time, but Producer 2003 does not offer a means for automatic update," he said in an entry on the MSRC blog today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security researchers took stabs at why Microsoft didn't patch Producer 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Someone made a strategic decision," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "Maybe because not enough people use the product to warrant a full release cycle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheldon Malm, the senior director of security strategy at Rapid7, had a different explanation. "They generally just don't ignore a vulnerability , so I think it's likely that the vulnerability and the patch touched other pieces of code," said Malm, who added that if that was indeed the case, Microsoft would want to spend more time testing before it issued a fix -- especially since it involves PowerPoint, a widely-used program in businesses. "There's the possibility that they will release a patch later," he said. "It may depend on whether there's a public outcry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the Internet, one person has a very loud voice," agreed Storms, referring to the chance that users of Producer 2003 will sound off about the lack of a patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Bryant didn't say one way or the other whether a patch was definitely not in the cards. "We continue to investigate Producer 2003," he said on the MSRC blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, users can break the link between the .mswmm file format and Producer 2003 by running the "Fix it" tool that Microsoft has made available on its support site. After running the tool, the PowerPoint add-on will no longer automatically launch Movie Maker project files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that Microsoft has declined to patch known vulnerabilities. Last December, for example, Microsoft disabled a 17-year-old video codec in older versions of Windows rather than patch multiple vulnerabilities. In September 2009, the company said that fixing a flaw in Windows 2000 Server SP4's implementation of TCP/IP was not feasible because it would have required too much reworking of the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office update, MS10-017 , fixes seven flaws in Microsoft Office on both Windows and the Mac, and is the first to patch a bug in an Open Office XML (OOXML) file format, the format introduced with Office 2007 and that is also the native format for the upcoming Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today marks the first day that Microsoft confirmed a vulnerability in the [Office] 2007 file format," said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms, Malm and Jason Miller, a data and security team leader with patch management vendor Shavlik Technologies, all agreed that MS10-017 should be addressed first. "Excel is very, very common on corporate networks," noted Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excel is the one to get patched quickly," added Malm, who confirmed Storms' take that the update included the first fix for a flaw in an OOXML format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven Excel vulnerabilities involve every supported edition of Office on both Windows and the Mac, including Office XP, Office 2003 and Office 2007 on Windows, and Office 2004 and Office 2008 on Mac OS X. One of the seven bugs also affects SharePoint Server 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, Microsoft did not patch any of the outstanding security advisories, including one from November 2009 that involves SMB (Server Message Block), and another issued last week in which Microsoft urged users to ignore a prompt to press the F1 key .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft did release another security advisory today that warned users of Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) and IE7 of a critical vulnerability which hackers are already using to attack PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's security update can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been busy breaking its record. Apple hit a 52 week
high last week of 219.70, to hit a new high yesterday of 220.09 only to surpass
that high today at 224.80. All things are moving along smoothly for the awaited
released of the iPad tablet. Last week, it was announced that Apple is suing HTC
of infringing on 20 of its patents related to the iPhone`s user interface,
underlying architecture and hardware. HTC is a maker of smartphones using
Google`s Android system, which are becoming a growing competitor to the iPhone.
Shares of Apple traded today between 217.89 and 225.00. Apple closed up $3.94 or
1.80% at 223.02. 

Dell Inc. (NASDAQ: DELL) announced that their new Dell OptiPlex 980 Desktop has
been made available which is now the most energy efficient commercial desktop
available from Dell. The Dell FX100 Zero Client Solutions centralizes the
desktop with the performance of flexibility of a traditional PC. Shares of Dell
traded between 13.86 and 14.40, up 1.21% or 0.17, closing at 14.18. The 52
week-high for Dell sits at 17.26 from August 2009. Dell Inc. offers desktop PCs,
software and peripherals, servers and networking, services and storage. 

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT),announced that it will contribute $2
million in cash and up to $6 million in software over the next two years to
support programs for members of the armed services and their family. Microsoft
aims to bring together public, private and non profit organizations to aid in
their support. This is aimed to give veterans and their spouses skills and
resources to be able to take part in the working world. Microsoft Corporation
focuses on developing, manufacturing, licensing and supporting a range of

28.80. MSFT hit its 52 week-high of 31.50 this past December. 

Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM), traded today between 72.95 and 74.65, up
0.22% or 0.16 cents at 73.55. Late last month it was announced that Slacker,
Inc. would make available the Slacker Radio 3.0 for BlackBerry smartphones from
Research In Motion. People will now be able to store their favourite Slacker
stations wirelessly and directly to their BlackBerry smartphones. Analysts have
also upgraded Research In Motion as they are expecting the Blackberry maker to
report strong quarterly results and a profitable outlook. Research in Motion
designs and markets wireless handsets, software and services. 

Palm Inc. (NASDAQ: PALM) provides mobile products to individuals and businesses
worldwide. Palm`s products include Palm Pre, Treo and Centro. Palm announced
that a public beta version of the Palm webOS Plug-in Development Kit (PDK) has
been made available at the Palm Developer Centre. PALM hit its 52 week-high this
past September of 18.09 and a 52 week-low yesterday of 5.48. It may be a while
before things move along as PALM hit even lower today at 5.46 and traded at a
high of 5.75. Some are left wondering if PALM will survive in the market as
Blackberry and the iPhone are severe competitor for this mobile product
provider. The company has also provided a warning that they do not think their
smartphone sales for the year will reach their desired target. Shares of PALM
were up 2.52 %, or 0.14 cents today and closed at $5.69.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today warned of a critical vulnerability in Internet Explorer that is already being exploited by hackers, the second such admission in the last two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) and its 2006 successor, IE7, contain a vulnerability that can be used by attackers to inject their own malicious code into a Windows PC. The oldest and newest of Microsoft's supported browsers, IE 5.01 and IE8, respectively, are not at risk from attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this time, we are aware of targeted attacks attempting to use this vulnerability," Microsoft acknowledged in an advisory posted simultaneously with the two security updates that patched eight bugs in Windows and Office. Elsewhere, Microsoft said that the vulnerability had been publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't look like an exploit has been publicly posted," noted Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, who added that Microsoft might have been made aware of the vulnerability either via a customer report, or from one of the security companies that partner with it in MAPP (Microsoft Active Protections Program). A report on the bug later today from the likes of Symantec or McAfee would indicate the latter, said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second time in the last 60 days that Microsoft has admitted that hackers were exploiting an unpatched bug in IE. In mid-January, Microsoft said that a flaw in IE had been used to attack several companies' networks , including Google 's and Adobe's. Microsoft patched that vulnerability, and seven others, later in the month when it issued an emergency update , often dubbed an "out-of-band" update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is its practice, Microsoft today did not spell out a timeline for patching the latest IE vulnerability, or commit to an out-of-band fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms said it was too early to say whether Microsoft would rush a patch to users. "Generally, one of the indicators is if an exploit has gone public," he said, noting that as far as he knew, none had. "That often determines how quickly they'll patch. Of course, the way the Internet moves, [an exploit] could be posted in minutes, and then the story changes completely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft does not go out-of-band for the IE vulnerability, it might be May before it patches the problem, Storms said, citing the need to thoroughly test the repair job. April might be possible, he added, depending on how long Microsoft has known of the vulnerability and where it is in the fix cycle. "But then they wouldn't get a full QA cycle on the patch," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next scheduled Patch Tuesday is April 13, five weeks from today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft listed several recommended actions users of IE6 and IE7 can take to defend themselves in lieu of a patch. They include modifying access to the "iepeers.dll," disabling scripting in the browsers and enabling DEP (data execution prevention).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, put some of its downstream operations up for sale, including its Pembroke refinery in the UK, and said it would eliminate 2,000 jobs this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it concentrates increasingly on extracting oil and natural gas, Chevron expects 1 percent annual production growth through 2014, and 4 percent to 5 percent growth in the three years after that, driven by two big Australian gas projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Watson, in his first full presentation to analysts since becoming chief executive this year, affirmed his support for refining and marketing on Tuesday, even as that downstream side of the business undergoes wrenching changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European refiners have been hit hard as the economic slump left them with too much capacity while demand for fuel declined, hammering their profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Wirth, Chevron's executive vice president for global downstream, expects the tough market conditions to last several years and said growing competition from refineries in Asia and the Middle East will threaten U.S. and European operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good refineries, competitive refineries in those markets will continue to exist, but the refineries at the margin and the weaker ones are the ones that are under the most pressure and the most vulnerable," he said at the meeting in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The less competitive facilities over time are likely to drop out of the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson told reporters after the meeting that he did not expect to have to close any refineries, as France's Total SA (TOTF.PA) said on Monday it is doing in Dunkirk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our refineries are competitive. The issue for us has been the industry conditions are very difficult right now," he said. The company will seek bids for some downstream operations in Europe, the Caribbean and Central America, and review operations in Hawaii and Africa outside South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the Hawaii refinery, already under review since May, Watson said that after making some improvements, Chevron does not plan to shut it or convert it to a fuel terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron had already received unsolicited expressions of interest in the Pembroke refinery in Wales, which has capacity to refine about 210,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the refineries up for sale will join many others already put on the market by rivals, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and Total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it ultimately wants its downstream business to be in fewer than 40 countries, versus 93 last year, and to own 1,900 filling stations, down from 3,200 in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with 1,900 jobs already cut, the downstream workforce will be reduced by a fifth by the end of 2010. Wirth expects after-tax severance charges of $150 million to $200 million this quarter, and Chevron will continue to cut jobs into 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEADY SHIFT AWAY FROM REFINING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson, a 30-year Chevron veteran who became vice president in charge of mergers and acquisitions in 1998, said the company had been reducing its downstream exposure for the past decade, selling off nearly $1 billion in assets per year on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Chevron has been reshaped, with capital employed in upstream rising to a 65 percent share from about half in 1999, and that share should grow further in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson told reporters that oil prices will rise eventually as supply dries up. "We don't expect sharp spikes in the near future; but in the years ahead when that surplus capacity diminishes, the potential for an increase in prices is there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like its rivals, Chevron sees natural gas as a growing part of its future. Liquid reserves fell to 62 percent of its total in 2009, down from 66 percent a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said on Tuesday it expects natural gas to represent 41 percent of production by 2017, up from 31 percent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company highlighted two huge gas projects off the coast of Western Australia: Gorgon, which should start up in 2014 and hit peak production of 450,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), and Wheatstone, starting two years later and expected to reach peak production of 260,000 boepd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next three years, Chevron is set to approve or start 25 upstream projects that cost at least $1 billion. One, due to begin early engineering work in 2011, is an expansion of the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, which should grow production by 250,000 to 300,000 barrels per day to about 900,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell 0.5 percent to close at $74.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) will outline its 2010 plans for analysts at a meeting in New York on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall; Editing by Gerald E.

 (Adds context for CEO quote, closing share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the

&lt;p&gt;The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has awarded the 2009 A.M. Turing Award to Charles P. Thacker, for his work in pioneering the networked personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1974, while at the Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), Thacker built a prototype of a desktop computer, called the Alto. It featured a number of innovations that have since become commonplace on PCs, including a television-like screen, a graphical user interface and a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) text editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award also recognizes his work in helping develop Ethernet as well as his early prototypes of the multiprocessor workstation and the tablet personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Thacker studies computer architecture at Microsoft Research, at the company's Silicon Valley campus. He holds 29 patents in computer systems and networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1966, the ACM has bestowed the Turing Award, named after British mathematician and computer pioneer Alan M. Turning, on computer scientists and engineers who have made great strides in advancing the frontier of computer science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other recipients of the award, which ACM describes as the Nobel Prize in Computing, include Donald Knuth, Alan Kay and Vinton Cerf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thacker will be awarded a US$250,000 prize and will be honored in a banquet to be held in June in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it earned
$38.1 million, or basic net income per share of $4.16, on net sales of $1.44
billion for fiscal 2009, compared to net income of $9.1 million, or basic net
income per share of $.99, on net sales of $1.46 billion for fiscal 2008. The
results for fiscal 2009 included $8.0 million of mark-to-market after-tax gains
($13.2 million on a pre-tax basis) due to the Company`s fuel and aluminum
hedging programs and $1.1 million on an after-tax basis ($1.9 million on a
pre-tax basis) of additional income from the 53rd week of fiscal 2009 (2009 was
a 53-week year). Fiscal 2009 results also included $7.1 million in tax benefits
which reduced the Company`s effective tax rate to 30.3%. The results for fiscal
2008 included $10.1 million of after-tax charges impacting comparability ($19.4
million on a pre-tax basis) which were due to pension exit and strike settlement
costs, restructuring expenses and fuel hedging losses.

(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow investors to more
clearly evaluate operating performance and business trends for the fourth
quarters of 2009 and 2008. Management uses this information to review results
excluding items that are not necessarily indicative of ongoing results. 

J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, "2009 was a very challenging
year for our industry and our Company, as it has been for the entire U.S.
economy. We are very pleased with the significant improvement in our reported
financial results especially given the challenges in our industry. While 2009
was a significant improvement over 2008 on a reported basis, these reported year
over year results include $8.0 million of non-cash, after-tax mark-to-market
gains on our commodity hedges, and fiscal 2008 included several operating
expense items that did not occur in fiscal 2009. On a comparable basis, our
bottom line performance was strong relative to last year on lower volume,
increased pricing and strong cost controls. Our team worked hard this year to
achieve these excellent results and we believe we have positioned our Company
for a successful 2010 as we pursue our objectives of profitable revenue growth
and continued cost management." 

William B. Elmore, President and COO, added, "We have faced many challenges and
a difficult operating environment over the past two years, which has caused us
to intensify our focus on profitable revenue growth, quality customer service,
productivity gains and diligent cost management. Our 2009 results were
positively impacted by these initiatives, and we believe we are well positioned
in what will continue to be a challenging business environment for 2010. We
appreciate the efforts of our employees, and we will continue to strive to find
new and improved ways to deliver quality Coke products and services."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen said on Tuesday her team's in-house view put the SP 500 stock index's .SPX fair value at between 1,250 and 1,300.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking in an interview on CNBC television, Cohen said equities probably offered better returns and valuations relative to bonds and it was unlikely that the U.S. economy will slip right back into a recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly over the last several weeks it has become less likely in our view that there will be a double-dip (recession)," she said. "The jobs number is looking less bad, demand for things, new orders for new equipment, retail spending are beginning to improve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Standard  Poor's 500 Index was up 4.77 points, or 0.42 percent, at 1,143.27 in midday trading on Tuesday. It is up 69 percent since hitting bottom on March 9, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ellis Mnyandu; Editing by James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM is teaming with researchers in academic institutions in Japan and India to explore an open, common user interface for mobile devices that will make them easier for aged or illiterate people around the world to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is doing the research with the National Institute of Design (NID) in India and the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST) at the University of Tokyo, it said Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the research and any applications or technology developed will be released to the open-source community, said Nitendra Rajput, Open Collaborative Research lead at IBM Research India. IBM's Open Collaborative Research program aims to promote innovation through research collaboration between universities and industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with the open-source community will help speed up the adoption of the technologies, and attract developers to build applications for the target populations, Rajput added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is focused on improving access to the mobile phone because of the affordability and proliferation of these devices, Rajput said. The researchers expect that the mobile phone rather than the PC will be the key device by which the aged and the illiterate will access IT because of its relative simplicity of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company decided to do the research in these two countries as Japan has a large aging population, while India has a large illiterate population, Rajput said. IBM has research labs in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large number of people in India are not significant users of IT because they cannot afford PCs, and because they are illiterate, according to Rajput. The aged in Japan may be able to afford IT, but they are not comfortable with complex interfaces, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the research is to find common points and differences in the response to IT by these two populations, and to work on a multimode interface that would perhaps be accessible by both categories, Rajput said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from these two countries will be extrapolated to other countries around the world that have similar characteristics, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the technologies to improve access to information through mobile phones are already available, but a lot of ethnographic field research needs to be done to find out which combination of technologies would be found useful by the two target groups -- the aged and the illiterate, Rajput said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While voice would appear to be the most relevant technology for access to information on mobile phones for illiterate people, it may not be the best option when it comes to information like statistical tables or pictorial data, Rajput said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and partners are also looking at other ways to access information, including the use of images as an accessory to text and audio content. Information on pesticides could for example be presented to farmers with visuals such as a picture of the crop, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also plan to use accelerometers to design interfaces that are more closely related to the physical environment. A number of mobile phones already use accelerometers for interface control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  KIRKLAND, QUEBEC, Mar 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: There is a photo and a video associated with this press
release.

    Sparked by the spirit and determination of the Canadian Paralympic Team,
long-time supporter Pfizer Canada is encouraging Canadians to show their
pride by viewing and sharing a short film featuring Canadian sledge
hockey star and gold medallist Todd Nicholson.

    The film entitled Believing in Yourself debuts on March 8, 2010 at
morethanmedication.ca, Pfizer's popular, free, made-in-Canada holistic
wellness site.

    Every time a supporter views the film and forwards it to a friend or
loved one, Pfizer will donate $5 to the Canadian Paralympic team - over
and above its partnership commitments. The film can also be shared on
Facebook, Twitter, Digg and other social media sites.

    "Our goal is to raise an extra $50,000 over the next three weeks as our
nation celebrates the power, spirit and skill of Paralympic athletes like
Todd, who is an inspiration on and off the ice," says Ghislain Boudreau,
Vice-President Public Affairs and Stakeholder Relations, Pfizer Canada.
The company has been a steadfast supporter of Paralympic sport in Canada
since 1996, contributing more than $2 million to the Team.

    "Canadian Paralympians have a lot to teach us all about living a healthy,
inspired life; pushing the limits of athletic performance; and most of
all, the power of believing in yourself," explains CEO of the Canadian
Paralympic Committee, Henry Storgaard. "This March, the Canadian
Paralympic Team for the Vancouver 2010 Paralympic Winter Games have the
opportunity of a lifetime to compete right here at home. We hope Canada
will join with us to show their support and appreciation by sharing this
film and most of all, their pride in our team."

    Paralympic pride

    Filmed in Toronto, the film begins with a close-up of sledge hockey
player Todd Nicholson training in an empty gym. The film was created in
collaboration with zig - one of Pfizer's advertising partners.

    As Nicholson, a four-time Paralympian, continues the grueling workout
with steely determination, a narrator describes the obstacles and
setbacks he was able to overcome on his way to earning a place on Team
Canada. A promising young hockey player, Nicholson was paralyzed in a car
accident in 1987. In 1992, he joined Canada's Paralympic sledge hockey
team and has played at the international level ever since.

    In 2006, Nicholson was selected to carry the Canadian flag during the
opening ceremonies, and helped Team Canada capture gold on the ice. The
film ends with a celebratory look back at Torino 2006 and the reminder
that to be truly healthy, it takes more than medication.

    Viewers are also invited to visit morethanmedication.ca, a made-in-Canada
site devoted completely to helping Canadians live healthier lives by
providing bite-sized, actionable, non-medicinal holistic wellness
information. As with all More than Medication(R) initiatives, Pfizer
medicines are not mentioned and there is no advertising.

    Earlier this year, Pfizer and the Canadian Paralympic Committee joined
forces to release Kids of Courage, a free e-book for Canadian families
available online at morethanmedication.ca. Families can view the e-book
online; download a free PDF and listen to audio recordings. 40,000
printed copies of the book were donated to Canadian schools and
libraries. Braille and audio versions are also available for educators.

&lt;p&gt;* Upstream growth driven by Australian natural gas developments and a deep queue
of major capital projects
* Downstream taking actions to improve returns amid difficult global market
conditions

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) enters the decade with an upstream portfolio of
major capital projects that uniquely positions the company for future growth,
executives said today at a meeting with financial analysts in New York. In the
downstream business, executives highlighted plans to improve returns by
aggressively lowering costs, exiting markets and streamlining the organization. 

"2009 was an outstanding year, capping a decade of performance improvements
achieved through consistency in strategy and execution. We have momentum, an
advantaged portfolio and proven capabilities that will continue to deliver value
to our stockholders," said John Watson, Chevron`s chairman and CEO. "Chevron has
held a long-term view favoring aggressive upstream investment, and the company
is poised for another decade of upstream growth. We expect a substantial
production increase mid-decade as our portfolio shifts toward natural gas and
Asia." 

George Kirkland, vice chairman and executive vice president, Global Upstream and
Gas, highlighted the strong 2009 performance of the upstream and natural gas
business. "Oil and gas production increased 7 percent for the year due to the
successful start up and ramp up of major capital projects. This placed us first
among competitors. Chevron also had another outstanding year in exploration,
continuing its industry-leading performance with a 57 percent success rate in
exploratory drilling. We added 1.1 billion barrels of net proved reserves,
replacing 112 percent of our production. Over the past 10 years, our reserve
replacement exceeds 100 percent." 

Kirkland also discussed Chevron`s extensive and diverse project queue and future
prospects. "Our execution success demonstrates our capability to deliver
large-scale, complex projects. This gives us confidence to deliver the next
generation of projects, in particular the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG developments
in Australia." He also noted that over the next three years 25 projects with net
Chevron investment of over $1 billion are expected to achieve start up or final
investment decision. 

Mike Wirth, executive vice president, Global Downstream, highlighted Chevron`s
strong refinery reliability performance, cost reduction efforts and successful
market exits achieved during 2009. 

Commenting on plans to deal with a challenging environment, Wirth stated,
"Downstream market conditions are likely to be difficult for the next several
years. We intend to further concentrate our downstream portfolio in North
America and Asia-Pacific. These are markets in which we have our greatest
competitive strength. We are also rapidly and aggressively lowering costs,
reducing capital spending, improving efficiency and simplifying our
organization." 

Wirth outlined plans to improve returns and further streamline Chevron`s
downstream portfolio and organization. The activities include soliciting bids
for certain operations in Europe (including the Pembroke refinery), the
Caribbean and select Central America markets; reviewing operations in Hawaii and
Africa, outside of South Africa; and further reducing the downstream workforce.
First quarter 2010 charges for severance are currently estimated to be in the
range of $150 million to $200 million on an after-tax basis. Staff reductions
will occur through 2011 with about 2,000 positions eliminated this year. 

Pat Yarrington, vice president and chief financial officer, stressed that
Chevron`s financial capacity and discipline continue to be a competitive
advantage. "We plan to sustain and grow our dividend, fund our deep queue of
capital projects, and maintain our financial strength and flexibility. We also
expect our cost reduction momentum to continue. In 2009, we lowered our
operating expenses by $3.9 billion, or 15 percent." 

John McDonald, vice president and chief technology officer, explained how the
company`s technology strategy underpins business success. "We develop, access
and apply technologies critical to our business. Our application of technology
is a competitive advantage resulting in increased resource recovery and capture,
lower costs and improved yields." 

Presentations delivered by Watson, Kirkland, Wirth, Yarrington, and McDonald are
available at Chevron.com on the Investors page.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. bank JPMorgan will expand its 'new energy' team in China to win more business from what it sees as a trend to increasingly popular "green IPOs," its China chief said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fang Fang, JPMorgan's China CEO, predicts that more new energy and natural resource companies will go public as they seek to fund their rapid expansion, and there could be more consolidation among wind and solar power suppliers, creating a potentially lucrative advisory fee stream for bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year, we see lots of opportunities in new energy, natural resources and construction material sectors," Fang said in an interview on the sidelines of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think such 'green IPOs' will be the trend for the next few years and some industry consolidation may take place, too. Technology, property and consumer sectors remain active," said Fang, who is a delegate to the CPPCC, China's top political advisory body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, China Longyuan Power Group Corp, the world's fifth-largest wind power generator, raised $2.2 billion via a Hong Kong listing, the biggest wind power IPO in 2009, and Xinjiang Goldwind Science  Technology Co, a wind power producer, plans to raise $1.5 billion this year via a Hong Kong IPO, Reuters reported in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fang, who joined JPMorgan in 2001 and was appointed to his current post in 2007, said the bank placed "a very significant focus" on China and was looking to grow its business there on several fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to provide multiple lines of services, not just investment banking but also something like corporate banking, asset management, commodities and carbon trading," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're building up our deal pipeline nicely, and I expect deal volume to increase from last year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fang submitted a proposal to Beijing last week that China should set up a domestic carbon trading exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has pledged to cut the amount of carbon dioxide produced for each unit of economic growth by 40-45 percent by 2020, compared with 2005 levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECURITIES VENTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fang added the bank was looking also to establish a securities joint venture in China as soon as possible, joining other investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and UBS that have already set up China securities joint ventures in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Chinese rules, foreign institutions must team up with local partners to form investment banking joint ventures to underwrite shares and conduct other securities business in domestic capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The securities venture will provide us a very good platform to expand into more and new business," said Fang. "For example, serving domestic investors and issuers and helping foreign investors and issuers access Chinese domestic capital markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, JPMorgan already has joint ventures in fund management and futures business. A securities venture would help it tap China's growing innovative financial business such as the landmark stock index futures scheme due for launch next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is also hiring at its locally incorporated bank in China, which provides commercial and corporate banking, and Fang said the bank would add more branches to the five it currently has in big Chinese cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see lots of growth opportunities in the traditional investment banking business and that still has a long way to go in China," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the same time, we see big potential in many other areas. For example, our local incorporated bank can help us reach more domestic enterprises and provide them with trade finance, treasury management and other corporate banking services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded three solar companies, including industry bellwether First Solar Inc, and said oversupply would likely become a major issue in the second half of the year. In a note to clients, the brokerage said module makers continue to aggressively add capacity, even as supply begins to outstrip demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It downgraded First Solar Inc and Energy Conversion Inc to "underweight," and cut Evergreen Solar Inc to "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a difficult 2009, when the global credit crisis dried up financing for new projects and panel prices plummeted, demand has now begun to pick up, prompting a number of solar players to boost capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This feels eerily similar to what happened to the industry in C2H08-C1H09 when the market was oversupplied by as much as 30 percent for several quarters," J.P. Morgan said, adding that oversupply could approach 3 to 4 gigawatts (GW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage also warned that falling average selling prices and subsidy cuts in Germany would further pressure demand and margins over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Adveith Nair in Bangalore; Editing by Anne Pallivathuckal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CANBERRA, March 11 (Reuters) - More than 90 Australian authors signed a letter on Thursday protesting against China's refusal to grant a visa to one of the country's most celebrated novelists because he was HIV-positive. Robert Dessaix, whose 1996 novel Night Letters dealt with the European travels of a man diagnosed with an incurable disease, was refused permission by Chinese authorities to attend the International Literary Festival in Shanghai on health grounds. More than 90 other writers, including Nobel laureate J.M. Coetzee and Booker Prize winner Thomas Keneally, who penned Schindler's Ark, rallied to Dessaix's support, demanding a public apology from Beijing. This was an act of discrimination that appears to be founded in fear or ignorance and is behaviour unworthy of any nation that desires to be seen as enlightened and civilised, the joint letter said. Mr Dessaix, an internationally published and acclaimed author, has been unjustly left out of the Australian government supported Writers' Tour currently under way in China, the group from The Australian Society of Authors wrote. Dessaix, 65, is the author of the poetic Night Letters and Corfu. The first novel was based around letters written home from a Venice hotel room, pondering Italian history, philosophy and questions of human fate, including his own. Dessaix's autobiography, A Mother's Disgrace, was published in 1994. I am not a threat. I don't write on political issues. I feel I've been spat on, Dessaix told The Age newspaper. I live in Australia and I can come home to a civilised place where people care. Dessaix's visa refusal follows strains with China over the arrest in Shanghai of an Australian mining executive and Canberra's decision last year to grant a visa to a high-profile Chinese ethnic separatist leader.

&lt;p&gt; * Fred Hu to retire as a partner at Goldman Sachs - memo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Hu plans to launch new China private equity fund - sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * CCB, Goldman and Temasek expected to help Hu - sources
 (Adds Hu's career path, more details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By George Chen and Samuel Shen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEIJING/SHANGHAI, March 10 (Reuters) - Fred Hu, a
high-profile Chinese dealmaker is stepping down as a partner of
Goldman Sachs (GS.N), according to an internal memo, as sources
said he plans to launch a new private equity fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hu, who worked for the Wall Street bank for 13 years, will
retire as a partner in April, but remain as an advisory director
of the firm, according to the memo obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An investment arm of China Construction Bank (601939.SS)
(0939.HK), China's top property lender, Singapore state investor
Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL], and Goldman were expected to help Hu
launch the China-dedicated fund, according to sources with direct
knowledge of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given Hu's high influence in China and now strong support
from his investors, I believe Hu's new private equity fund will
make the tough competitions for China deals even tougher," said
one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's interesting to see so many investment bankers are now
stepping into the private equity industry," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In China, as well on in Wall Street, Hu is well known for
several multi-billion-dollar landmark deals. In 2006, he made a
$3.78 billion investment for Goldman in Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (1398.HK) (601398.SS), now the world's largest bank
by market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2004, Hu helped Bank of Communications (3328.HK)
(601328.SS), China's No.5 bank by assets, sell a nearly 20
percent stake to Europe's No.1 bank HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L)
(0005.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No final agreement between Hu and institutional investors,
also known as limited partners for a private equity fund, has
been reached but Hu expects to launch the multi-billion-dollar
fund this year, according to the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources declined to be identified as they were not
authorised to speak to the media. Goldman confirmed the content
of the memo, but declined to comment further. Hu's mobile phone
went unanswered when contacted by Reuters for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOLDMAN BANKERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hu is set to become the latest senior Goldman banker to join
the private equity industry, while China remains as a focus for
dealmakers despite the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January 2009, Mount Kellett Capital Management, a private
equity firm run by former Goldman partner Mark McGoldrick - known
as 'Goldfinger' - raised at least $1.5 billion and was on the
hunt for investments. [ID:nHKG151908]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In November 2008, FountainVest, led by Frank Tang, a former
senior executive for Temasek who was also a former senior Goldman
banker, said it had raised nearly $1 billion for its first
private equity fund. [ID:nSHA102967]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hu's Goldman colleague, Fang Fenglei, who helped Goldman
launch its China investment banking joint venture, established
Beijing-based Hopu Investments in 2007 and completed raising a
$2.5 billion China fund in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopu's main investors also include Temasek and Goldman. After
Fang launched Hopu, Fang remained as chairman of Goldman Sachs
Gaohua Securities, the Beijing-based investment banking joint
venture of the Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, Hopu is one of China's most influential buyout funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hu joined Goldman as chief economist for Greater China in
1997. In 2002, he moved to the business side of Goldman and
helped the U.S. bank establish its onshore presence in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hu was promoted to a partner in 2004, making him one of very
few Chinese for the top-level posts at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was named Goldman Sachs Greater China Chairman in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For related Asian private equity news, Reuters 3000 Xtra

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's Chief Executive Bob Iger said on Wednesday that the top U.S. media company was keeping its options open for dealing with TV network ABC and its struggling news division, including a spin-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Disney's shareholders' meeting, Iger noted that ABC News, which cut 300 to 400 jobs as part of a drive to refocus and recapture viewers lost to the Internet, is in a business undergoing significant challenges because of changes in the way people access and consume news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked by a shareholder if Disney intended to spin off ABC, Iger said he was comfortable with the current mix of assets but added that the company was always reviewing the longer-term options for all its businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no guarantees in terms of what will remain part of our company and what will not," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation has surfaced from time to time in the media and among analysts that ABC might be split from Disney. But Alan Gould, an analyst with Soleil Research, does not believe Iger was signaling any developments in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Iger was just making sure he was not locking himself into a position by saying he'd never sell ABC News. He was keeping all of his options open," Gould said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanford C Bernstein analyst Michael Nathanson said such speculation resurfaces periodically, on the argument that ABC does not fit in well with Disney's focus on exploiting its content and theme park properties across all divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ABC doesn't add a lot of value to Disney's other divisions," he said. But he did not expect Disney to spin off ABC, particularly in light of its recent squabble with Cablevision Systems Corp over fees to transmit its programing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media conglomerates have pressured cable distributors for fees for transmitting their content, a much-needed new source of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ABC-Cablevision dispute followed a bitter battle last year over retransmission fees between Time Warner Cable Inc and News Corp. Time Warner Cable plans to renegotiate fees with Disney in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd wait to see how all these retransmission negotiations would go to see if the value of these assets would improve. I would not exit (from ABC) right now," said Nathanson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ONE PASS TO RULE THEM ALL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas, Disney also unveiled a $700 single annual pass to both Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pass was created as a special option for some of its most ardent fans who shuttle between the two resorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney generated $36 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year and owns media properties including the Walt Disney Pictures movie studio, ABC Television Networks and cable sports network ESPN, plus part of online video website Hulu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Disney reported better-than-expected earnings on the back of a strong performance at its cable division and cost cuts at its film studio, but signaled that its theme parks division remained under pressure, with room reservations at its parks for the second quarter down 10 percent from a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that 2009 had been challenging, Iger said the company had put in place various strategic measures.

operating officer of Facebook, and reelected the 12 other
nominees to its board, expanding its size to 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move to tap Sandberg reflects Disney's aggressive push
into the younger, popular world of online social networks,
which was a key part of its successful marketing of "Alice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandberg's experience at Facebook, which has more than
tripled in size during the past 16 months to more than 350
million users, will provide Disney with helpful insight from
one of the Internet's fastest-growing companies in a way that
is more cost-efficient than acquiring a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders voted against a proposal on executive pay that
had asked for a nonbinding, advisory vote on the pay packages
of top Disney executives. The "say on pay" initiative was voted
down in the previous year's annual meeting. Disney was one of
many companies facing such a proposal.

the back of a strong performance at its cable division and cost
cuts at its film studio, but signaled that its theme parks
division remained under pressure, with room reservations at its
parks for the second quarter down 10 percent from a year
before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noting that 2009 was challenging, Iger said the company has
put in place various strategic measures, citing its newly
restructured film division's success with the recently released
"Alice in Wonderland" and drawing applause when he unveiled
previews of its upcoming "Toy Story 3" and "Tron Legacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders at the meeting elected Sheryl Sandberg, chief
operating officer of Facebook, and reelected the 12 other
nominees to its board, expanding its size to 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move to tap Sandberg reflects Disney's aggressive push
into the younger, popular world of online social networks,
which was a key part of its successful marketing of "Alice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandberg's experience at Facebook, which has more than
tripled in size during the past 16 months to more than 350
million users, will provide Disney with helpful insight from
one of the Web's fastest-growing companies in a way that is
more cost-efficient than acquiring a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders voted against a proposal on executive pay that
had asked for a nonbinding, advisory vote on the pay packages
of top Disney executives. The "say on pay" initiative was voted
down in the previous year's annual meeting, and Disney was one
of many companies facing such a proposal.

&lt;p&gt; * Group wants court to set aside Shaw purchase agreement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Wants another stab at buying Canwest TV unit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Threatens litigation if appeal not heard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VANCOUVER, March 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) on Wednesday asked a Canadian court to give it and its
partners another shot at winning the broadcast assets of
bankrupt Canwest Global Communications Corp CGS.V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street investment bank asked Ontario's highest
court to hear its appeal to overturn a Feb. 19 lower court
decision that okays Canadian cable company Shaw Communications
Inc's (SJRb.TO) purchase of Canwest's TV arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a damning 30-page filing, Goldman Sachs said the lower
court "utterly failed in its duty to ensure that basic
principles of fair play and procedural due process" are being
adhered to when it approved the Shaw bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs submitted an unsuccessful 11th hour bid for
Canwest's broadcast arm along with consortium partners Catalyst
Capital and members of Canwest's founding Asper family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court approved Shaw's C$95 million ($92 million) offer
for at least 20 percent of Canwest's TV assets in a deal that
also gives it 80 percent of the voting shares. The
Goldman-Catalyst consortium offered C$120 million for 32
percent of the assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is a partner in Canwest's specialty TV assets after
helping the media group acquire channels such as History
Television and Food Network Canada from Alliance Atlantis in
2007 for C$2.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike Canwest's conventional TV holdings, like Global
Television, the specialty channels are profitable and are not
in creditor protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has complained for months that it is being left out
of Canwest's restructuring process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the court proceedings have become a vehicle "not
for a bona fide restructuring of Canwest, but for the
noteholders to achieve (their) commercial objective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the appeal court did not intervene it promised to
"continue down a path of acrimonious and time-consuming
litigation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Canwest media empire has struggled for survival after a
rapid rise to glory trapped it under a debt load of about C$4
billion. It filed for creditor protection for its television
operations in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of its debt woes date back to 2000 when it bought the
newspaper chain owned by former press baron Conrad Black's
Hollinger Group for C$3.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale of Canwest's TV assets is separate from a process
to sell its newspaper arm, which is also in bankruptcy
protection. The papers that may be sold off include the
National Post and Vancouver Sun.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The number of New Yorkers who die of cocaine overdose appears to go up when the temperature surpasses 75 degrees, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings, reported in the journal Addiction, suggest that relatively hot days may increase cocaine users' vulnerability to the drug's potentially fatal effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed data on deaths and weather for New York City for the years 1990 through 2006. They found that for every 2-degree increase in average temperature beyond 75 degrees, there were 0.25 additional cocaine-overdose deaths per 1 million residents each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied to New York, that would mean an extra two deaths per week, said lead researcher Dr. Amy Bohnert, a research fellow with the University of Michigan Medical School and the Ann Arbor VA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocaine is known to raise a person's core body temperature, Bohnert explained in an interview, and when people are on the drug, they are less likely to take steps to cool themselves down on a hot day. The resulting hyperthermia may make people more vulnerable to overdose at relatively lower blood-cocaine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the New York City medical examiner, Bohnert and her colleagues found that between 1990 and 2006, an average of 16 people died each week from an accidental drug overdose -- with a range of anywhere from 3 to 48 deaths per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocaine -- alone or along with other drugs -- was behind more than half of those deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bohnert's team found that hotter days were related to an increase in deaths from cocaine, but not to deaths from overdoses of opiates, such as heroin. Past research has suggested that opiates have a more complex effect on body temperature -- both raising it and lowering it at different points, Bohnert explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few of the deaths in the study involved neither cocaine nor opiates, so it was not possible to study the relationship between temperature and overdoses from amphetamines or other stimulants, according to Bohnert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, according to Bohnert, is that cocaine users should be aware of the potentially greater risks they face on hotter days. Ideally, they should stop using the drug altogether, the researcher noted -- and the current findings, she said, might serve as a reminder that cocaine is a dangerous drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bohnert also pointed out that each year, New York City sees about seven weeks with average temperatures of 75 degrees or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is not an extreme temperature. So we're not just talking about a risk during heat waves," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bohnert, it is likely that the effects of heat on cocaine-related deaths would be similar in other cities in the Northeastern U.S. In the South, though, it might take a higher "threshold" temperature to spur an increase in deaths, as people there are accustomed to consistently warm temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bohnert added that large cities like New York would be expected to have more days with above-threshold temperatures compared with smaller cities and suburbs in the same region. Big cities tend to trap heat and cool off less overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOURCE: Addiction, online March 2, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

appeal of a lower court decision allowing Shaw Communications
Inc (SJRb.TO) to buy the broadcast arm of bankrupt Canwest
Global Communications Corp CGS.V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Ontario Superior Court judge ruled on Feb. 19 that Shaw
could acquire Canwest's television arm, putting a quick end to
a last-minute bid for the assets, filed the night before by a
consortium led by private equity fund Catalyst Capital and
backed by Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Catalyst consortium includes the Asper family,
Canwest's founders. Leonard Asper was chief executive of

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Mar 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
dynaTrace software, the innovator in application performance management
(APM), has announced a major new release of its third-generation
continuous APM system. Designed for organizations that rely on Microsoft
technologies for their important applications, this new version offers an
enterprise-class APM system that delivers immediate value out-of-the-box,
complete coverage of the Microsoft application stack and integration with
the latest Microsoft application lifecycle management tools. With this
release, dynaTrace expands its production-proven PurePath continuous
transaction tracing technology further into Microsoft-centric
environments. This includes new and enhanced support for:


--  Microsoft applications like SharePoint Server and Dynamics CRM; 
--  Microsoft infrastructure components including BizTalk Server, IIS, and
    SQL Server; and, 
--  Microsoft application lifecycle management tools like Visual Studio 2010
    and Systems Center Operations Manager. 

    
The release also introduces dynaTrace Deployment FastPacks to enable
enterprises to rapidly deploy the dynaTrace APM system and immediately
capture and view richly detailed performance information from their
existing Microsoft SharePoint Server, Dynamics CRM, BizTalk Server and
.NET Framework-based applications. dynaTrace Deployment FastPacks include
application instrumentation templates, monitoring plug-ins, pre-built
dashboards and deployment best practice guides. The pre-built dashboards
deliver information captured by the dynaTrace system in a format that is
relevant, easy to interpret and actionable for the different stakeholders
in the performance of an application -- IT operations teams, architects,
testers, development teams and business users.

    Real Customers, Real Success: dynaTrace in Action
 Factory automation
solution provider ATS Automation Tooling Systems Inc. went from having no
insight into the performance of its mission-critical Microsoft SharePoint
Server-based application to complete visibility in a matter of hours
after implementing the dynaTrace APM system. ATS was running into serious
SharePoint performance issues that were threatening to delay the rollout
of a critical application. 

    "We brought in dynaTrace, and in a matter of hours had deep visibility
into our challenges thanks to dynaTrace and their Deployment FastPack for
SharePoint," said Ron Keyser, CIO of ATS. "Those immediate results, along
with dynaTrace's support for the full Microsoft stack, convinced us that
dynaTrace was the only solution that could deliver 100% transaction
coverage in production, and with the depth we needed to improve our
performance and deliver on time." 

    In addition to a series of new and enhanced dynaTrace Deployment
FastPacks for Microsoft technologies, the latest version also deepens
dynaTrace's existing integration into Visual Studio. A new plug-in for
the upcoming Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 enables testers and developers
to eliminate multiple test runs by rapidly isolating and diagnosing
performance issues at code-level. This integration further breaks down
the silos between test and development; it enables testers to trace the
detailed execution path of every transaction across distributed and
heterogeneous applications, and send poor-performing transactions
directly to development for rapid resolution.

    "With recent advances in Visual Studio we've decided to move our
performance test solution to Visual Studio 2010," said Dave Anderson,
Co-founder and Principal Architect of Peopleclick. "Not only has their
platform improved, but the growth in the Visual Studio ecosystem --
evidenced by deep integrations built by companies like dynaTrace upon
which we've come rely -- gave us the confidence to switch."

    View a multimedia presentation detailing the new capabilities in
dynaTrace 3.2 here. For more detailed information, see this description
of the capabilities provided in this latest release of dynaTrace's
third-generation APM system.

    "This latest release of the dynaTrace continuous APM system extends the
core capabilities distinguishing our third-generation approach to
application performance management and delivers a broad set of
capabilities for Microsoft-oriented enterprises," said Bernd Greifeneder,
CTO and co-founder of dynaTrace. "Traditional APM tools designed a decade
or more ago treat Microsoft applications as an afterthought. Our approach
has been to create a purpose-built agent for the .NET platform that
enables dynaTrace to trace all transactions in depth, across Java and
.NET, and in the most complex, high traffic applications. This is what
enterprises that rely on Microsoft applications and technologies need to
ensure their performance, scalability, and stability."

    "We're pleased that dynaTrace, a Visual Studio Industry Program partner,
has invested early in supporting our next-generation application
lifecycle management tools included in Visual Studio 2010," said Cyrill
Glockner, director of Business Development, Platform and Tools at
Microsoft Corp. "The new capabilities included in this release will
quickly provide customers great value in helping them increase and manage
the performance of the applications upon which their business depends."

    dynaTrace 3.2 is available immediately for dynaTrace customers, and
qualified prospects can see it in their own environment during a
dynaTrace PoC. For more information contact sales@dynatrace.com or visit

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a FIFA partner and the preferred card of the 2010 FIFA
World Cup&#8482;, today announced an extension of its first-ever global FIFA-themed
marketing campaign - Go Fans. The global campaign, which originally debuted in
Latin America in 2009, includes television, print and out-of-home
advertisements, usage promotions, experiential offers for cardholders and
merchant discounts. Go Fans was developed to connect with football fans
worldwide to drive preference for and usage of Visa products, promote Visa`s
association with the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa&#8482; and reinforce the ways in
which Visa enhances the fan`s FIFA World Cup&#8482; experience. Today, 78 markets
throughout the world are activating Visa FIFA-themed marketing programs with
over 200 clients. 

Utilizing the flexibility of the More people go with Visa campaign, advertising
creative from the Go Fans campaign will be customized and will appear in 30
markets around the world to strengthen the campaign`s relevance in those
regions. In addition to Go Fans, customized advertising extensions of the
campaign will utilize Go Football and Go [Country] (e.g. Go Brazil) taglines. 

"Football fans are unlike any other sports fans in the world. We`ve created a
campaign that captures these fans` inspirational passion for the game, taps into
their nationalistic pride and reminds them how Visa can help enhance their
experience," said Antonio Lucio, Chief Marketing Officer of Visa Inc. "Building
off Visa`s legacy of creating integrated marketing campaigns in support of
global sporting events, our platform enables us to reinforce the ways that Visa
enhances the fan`s World Cup experience while also advancing our own business
and that of our clients." 

The Go Fans campaign celebrates the common love that all fans have for football
and creative executions featuring the colors of the national flags of each of
the 32 qualifying countries, symbolize the expression of each fan`s true colors
and love of country. The campaign reinforces the ways that Visa enables fans to
express their true colors in support of their teams by offering an easier way to
pay, their Visa card. 

Television Advertising &amp; Customization

Localized versions of Visa`s "Anthem" commercial, which debuted the week of
March 1in Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, shows footage of fans
throughout the world expressing an array of emotions while viewing football
matches. The creative execution is overlaid with the colors of individual
national flags and follows the natural progression of anticipation, tension, joy
and heartache displayed by football fans during a match. The spot illustrates
how fans are divided by their passion for their favorite teams but united in a
shared love of football. 

The soundtrack to "Anthem" is an original composition written by South African
natives Nonkululeko and Philisiwe Moya entitled "Stand as One, Unite," and is
performed by the Agape Children`s Choir. First documented in the critically
acclaimed film "We Are Together," the Agape Children`s Choir is made up of
children from the Agape Orphanage in Durban, South Africa who find hope in song.
In February, Visa made a donation of $150,000 USD to benefit the Agape
Children`s Choir and assist with the children`s school fees, education costs and
the orphanage`s administrative costs. 

"Anthem" was directed by Jake Scott, the son of Ridley Scott, whose previous
work includes the iconic music video "Fake Plastic Trees" for Radiohead, as well
as two full-length feature films including the forthcoming "Welcome to the
Rileys," starring Kristen Stewart and James Gandolfini. 

Cardholder Experiences &amp; Usage Promotions

A core component of Visa`s FIFA sponsorship is developing cardholder programs
internationally to enhance the fan`s football experience through
once-in-a-lifetime experiences and usage promotions. 

For the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa&#8482;, Visa has created the "Go 2010
Football Experience" to provide fans with unique access and once-in-a-lifetime
experiences which include a pre-match Stadium Tour, viewing the team warm-up by
the pitch, and a half-time pitch-side tour. More than 500 "Go 2010 Football
Experiences" have been offered to Visa cardholders worldwide. 

Visa has also introduced customizable usage promotions in core markets that
provide Visa cardholders with the chance to win tickets to the 2010 FIFA World
Cup South Africa&#8482; every time they use their Visa cards. 

FIFA World Cup Sponsorship Activation

In the lead up to the FIFA World Cup, Visa provides financial institutions and
merchant partners throughout the world with FIFA-themed creative and marketing
materials to enhance their card-marketing efforts, help drive business and
achieve corporate brand objectives. 

Visa is one of six global FIFA partners with exclusive global category rights
through 2014, and is the preferred card for the 2010 FIFA World Cup&#8482;. In
recognition of Visa`s sponsorship of the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa&#8482;, Visa
credit, debit and prepaid cards are the only payment cards accepted, along with
cash, at all FIFA stadiums and the Onsite Stadium Merchandise Booths. The
partnership provides Visa with global rights in the Financial Services product
category to all FIFA World Cup&#8482; activities that may be activated by financial
institution clients and merchant partners. Visa`s FIFA sponsorship includes the
rights to the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa&#8482;, the FIFA Women`s World Cup
Germany 2011&#8482; and the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil&#8482;. 

Visa cardholders are reminded to contact their issuing banks before leaving for
South Africa to alert them of their travel plans and purchases in another
country. This will ensure their banks will not temporarily freeze their accounts
as an anti-fraud measure. Cardholders should also ask about daily withdrawal
limits, ATM fees and emergency phone numbers. Travelers to the 2010 FIFA World
Cup South Africa&#8482; who do not have a Visa card should contact their banks or go
to www.visa.com/globalgateway for additional information on how to obtain a Visa
card in their country.

&lt;p&gt;Brocade solutions support 2200 servers with 55,000 domains and customers in more
than 100 countries


SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Brocade today announced that MaximumASP, Microsoft`s 2009 Global Hosting Partner
of the Year, is building on its near-decade-long deployment of Brocade IP and
SAN networking solutions with the development of a third data center to support
its network traffic growth and expanding customer base. The company credits
Brocade with helping it maintain its "100 Percent Uptime Guarantee" which has
led to 95 percent customer retention since its inception in 2001.

Key Facts

* MaximumASP is based in Louisville, Kentucky and was founded in 2000 as an
outsourcing firm for Microsoft Windows-based hosting services. 
* The company currently hosts more than 55,000 domains for customers in more
than 100 countries. 
* MaximumASP provides comprehensive network protection, automated server
patching, and advanced server monitoring for more than 2,200 servers. 
* With a strong focus on hosting solutions that combine advanced monitoring and
management tools, MaximumASP has become a top choice for Microsoft developers
seeking a robust hosting platform for mission-critical Web applications. 
* MaximumASP customers are application developers, small to large Web
development companies, and Fortune 500 companies with Web hosting needs. Many of
these entities host and deliver software as a service to clients all over the
world. 
* MaximumASP is designated as a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner.

Requirements

The company serves thousands of customers with more than 55,000 domains in more
than 100 countries around the world, and needed a highly reliable,
high-performance data center networking solution with the ability to grow as
their base expanded. First replacing Cisco and Dell switches in 2001, the
Brocade gear has served them well ever since, with no unplanned downtime and
having accommodated steady growth. 

MaximumASP has a new product, MaxV, that uses HyperV on top of R2 in Windows.
The company needed a fast, reliable network to provide live migration and
instant scalability, with virtualization, to all of its customers. 

Brocade Solution

MaximumASP has traditionally used Brocade BigIron Series switches at the core of
its network. However, for its new data center the company will deploy Brocade
NetIron XMR routers at the core with NetIron MLX routers at the access layer,
and a variety of FastIron Models, ranging from FastIron Edge Series to FastIron
LS Series, at the edge. They also take advantage of the Brocade ServerIron
switches for application delivery and load balancing between multiple data
centers. Maximum ASP maintains three separate SAN fabrics, a main fabric that
touches all customers and two others for virtualization, all of which run on
Brocade SAN switches. 

Business Benefits

With every piece of technology deployed in its hosting environment touching the
customer, and uninterrupted uptime being the company`s key promise to its
customers, the reliability of the Brocade products is the main benefit. The
simplicity and infrequency of the Brocade upgrade path was another reason the
company chose Brocade. The company has also found that Brocade solutions are
extremely energy efficient, resulting in lower costs to operate.

Flexibility

"We have a lot of customers in different segments, so it`s everything from
shared hosting to virtual dedicated and co-lo. So there are a lot of different
needs," said Dominic Foster, CTO, MaximumASP. "With Brocade, we can use them for
anything from fiber, to iSCSI implementations, to 10Gbps network gear. We`ve
used them for a long time, and they`ve never let us down. Also, they are
constantly innovating, so it`s not stagnant. We know there is going to be better
gear coming out every year." 

Vs Competition

"We use Brocade instead of Cisco because the gear does everything we need it to
do, and it is wire-speed," said Matt Griffin, storage architect and product
manager, MaximumASP. "The hosting business is a general business, we have
thousands of customers and each one has a business of his own so we can`t
leverage big, expansive applications that are built into the hardware for every
customer. There`s no point in paying for them and taking the performance hit." 

Green

"Brocade is great from a green standpoint," said Dominic Foster, CTO,
MaximumASP. "We`re extremely interested in how we can save the Earth but, just
as importantly, save money. Brocade solutions do a great job of that by reducing
the heat and allowing equipment consolidation so we don`t have `sprawl`
throughout the facility. Our focus on green also benefits our customers because
one of our largest costs is power." 

Need for Speed

"Our data center traffic is fairly linear," said Dominic Foster, CTO,
MaximumASP. "However, one of the great spikes that we are seeing is internal -
server to server, server to SQL server, server to SAN - so for that reason, 10
Gbps and 10 Gbps density is hugely important to us. We want to leverage that
network pipe as much as we can." 

ServerIron Application Delivery

"The ServerIron platform is something we use both for customers when they need a
private load balancing solution, and it`s something we`ve implemented in one of
our products, MaxESP, to load-balance the front end and make it highly available
from top to bottom," said Matt Griffin, storage architect and product manager,
MaximumASP. "One of the things we like about the ServerIron is that it uses the
same interface as our other Brocade switches, so we are able to use our existing
knowledge across platforms."

United States has stalled, the wireless industry is looking
especially towards the elderly who have so far thought they

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Hollywood's dealmakers have a busy couple of weeks ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day after March 19 was set as the deadline for binding offers for MGM, the same date has emerged as a deadline in the latest round of bidding for Miramax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owner Walt Disney Co. hopes to select a winning bidder from offers received by that date and close on a sale of the one-time indie highflyer within 30 days of the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested parties offer conflicting takes on how heated interest in Miramax has been. Some say Disney's suggested minimum bid of $700 million is overcooked by at least $200 million, and others claim sufficient interest to deliver offers of that level or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney finally allowed some financial due diligence among prospective suitors during the past few weeks. But with the studio running the Miramax auction without the assistance of an outside consultant, Disney has been able to control information about individual bidders -- and the Burbank studio's ultimate intentions in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're keeping things tightly under wraps," a representative of one interested party said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MGM, which is using Moelis  Co. to conduct its solicitation of bids, is racing against a March 31 deadline on a big interest payment owed by the studio. If no acceptable offer is secured by then, a bankruptcy reorganization of the Lion and its $3.7 billion in debt is likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney execs have no such gun to their heads in putting Miramax and its 700-title library up for sale. But the studio maintains hope of wrapping up its auction quickly, assuming one or more reasonable offer is secured by the bidding deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering financial enticements to customers of on-demand ERP (enterprise resource planning) vendor NetSuite to switch over to Microsoft's Dynamics family of business applications.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NetSuite customers will be credited up to US$850 for each user who converts to Dynamics GP, NAV or SL. The promotion is in effect until June 25 and available to customers in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's announcement has a ring of familiarity, as NetSuite itself has made a string of similar marketing efforts in the past against other vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single ERP deployment method, whether on-demand or on-premises, will be appropriate for every business, Microsoft said in a statement. Microsoft offers Dynamics as an on-premises application or it can be hosted through partners, but it has not moved to the multi-tenant SaaS (software as a service) model used by NetSuite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multi-tenancy, many customers share the same instance of an application, with their data kept private from other customers. The model saves computing resources and makes version or feature upgrades easier, since all customers can be served at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's ERP strategy also includes a series of on-demand extensions for Dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NetSuite didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's announcement raises questions, such as how SaaS vendors like NetSuite can counter vendors who can provide a range of deployment models, said 451 Group analyst China Martens via e-mail. "Will the SaaS pure-plays end up turning to partners to turn their SaaS into on-premises apps as well?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the fact Microsoft has singled out NetSuite as a rival should be music to NetSuite's ears, Martens said. "It's more validation for NetSuite."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the announcement was met with welcoming words from NetSuite CEO Zach Nelson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's only gong to make our installed base bigger," Nelson said in an interview. "At the end of the day Microsoft just said, 'Here's the competitive offering you should look at.' I want to thank Microsoft for all the extra marketing they gave us today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nelson also decried the migration offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's kind of the last gasp of a dinosaur," made in support of "Stone Age software," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering financial enticements to customers of on-demand ERP (enterprise resource planning) vendor NetSuite to switch over to Microsoft's Dynamics family of business applications.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NetSuite customers will be credited up to US$850 for each user who converts to Dynamics GP, NAV or SL. The promotion is in effect until June 25 and available to customers in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's announcement has a ring of familiarity, as NetSuite itself has made a string of similar marketing efforts in the past against other vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single ERP deployment method, whether on-demand or on-premises, will be appropriate for every business, Microsoft said in a statement. Microsoft offers Dynamics as an on-premises application or it can be hosted through partners, but it has not moved to the multi-tenant SaaS (software as a service) model used by NetSuite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multi-tenancy, many customers share the same instance of an application, with their data kept private from other customers. The model saves computing resources and makes version or feature upgrades easier, since all customers can be served at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's ERP strategy also includes a series of on-demand extensions for Dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NetSuite didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's announcement raises questions, such as how SaaS vendors like NetSuite can counter vendors who can provide a range of deployment models, said 451 Group analyst China Martens via e-mail. "Will the SaaS pure-plays end up turning to partners to turn their SaaS into on-premises apps as well?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the fact Microsoft has singled out NetSuite as a rival should be music to NetSuite's ears, Martens said. "It's more validation for NetSuite."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now under new management, MySpace is looking to reinvent itself and rise like a Phoenix from the ashes. The once dominant social networking site fell from nearly 70 percent of the social networking market, to only 30 percent in less than a year, and was plummeting on the verge of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that MySpace is looking to build some relevance again is through the Microsoft Outlook social connector feature--giving it some new business credibility it has always lacked. MySpace beat its social networking rival Facebook to the punch to integrate its member information and updates into Microsoft Outlook. Facebook and Windows Live integration is still listed as "coming soon".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its been a while since MySpace has been mentioned in the same breath as social networking leaders Facebook and Twitter. But, new co-presidents Jason Hirschhorn and Mike Jones have ambitious plans to rebrand and rebuild MySpace not only to where it once was, but beyond. Currently around 100 million members, MySpace has set a goal--with no specified timeline per se--of reaching 300 million plus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I have a MySpace account--or is it had? It is out there, but it has been probably more than a year since I have logged in to or cared about what was going in MySpace. The fact that the account was still out there--live, but stagnant--raises a number of security concerns which I'll save for another article, but the bottom line is that I am one of the defectors that MySpace is looking to reconnect with to extend its reach even farther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Outlook social connector may be a key element of rebuilding membership. Like the LinkedIn social connector, installing the MySpace social connector inserts MySpace as an option for social network integration. It also creates a separate contacts page with entries for each of your MySpace friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the FAQ page set up by MySpace, "MySpace for Outlook allows you to see your MySpace friend status and activity updates right inside Outlook, without having to log in to MySpace in a browser."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The description continues "The activity updates can be seen every time a friend's email is selected, or when you open the MySpace Contacts page and open a contact in Outlook. From the MySpace Contacts page, you can email your MySpace friends directly from Outlook. Email sent to their MySpace Mail address will show up in their MySpace Mail account on MySpace. Hyperlinks in the activity updates allow you to quickly jump to see the activities, such as posting a new picture, recording a new video, recording a new song, or making a new friend, all with a simple click."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the full value of the integration may require a little effort, though. When I tried to log in to my MySpace account, I found that I had set it up using an e-mail address that I still have, but rarely use. It would seem that many of my MySpace friends fall into that same boat. Because the MySpace data does not reflect the e-mail address(es) currently being used by my MySpace friends, the MySpace link and status updates does not automatically appear for new messages or events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you need to do in order to complete the integration and get the value of incorporating your MySpace network with Outlook is add the current email address(es) used by your contacts onto the MySpace contact entry. Once you do that, Outlook and MySpace will recognize that the contact is one and the same and the integration magic can occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add contacts from Outlook into your MySpace social network with a couple clicks, and any new friends added within MySpace are automatically populated and synced with Outlook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is definitely a good approach for MySpace. Leveraging a dominant messaging platform like Outlook to remind people that MySpace is out there and facilitate reconnecting with old MySpace friends, as well as providing a simple method of adding new contacts and expanding the sphere of the MySpace social network seems like a solid strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, I don't feel like I need more social networks. I am already maintaining Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter--which is part of why I left my MySpace account stagnant so long. While integrating with Outlook brings MySpace into the business environment, my perception of MySpace is still as a social networking site for junior high school students more than business professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I meet new contacts, I am much more likely to add them to my Facebook and/or LinkedIn networks, and I don't see any value in having the same network of contacts in both Facebook and MySpace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So--while I applaud the MySpace Social Connector and appreciate the concept of integrating my social networks with my primary messaging platform--the growth, or survival, of MySpace depend more on the other rebranding initiatives the new leadership is working on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bradley is co-author of Unified Communications for Dummies .

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, March 11 (Reuters) - A new ultra-deepwater
drillship that Chevron USA Inc  (CVX.N) is deploying in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico could help develop the Jack, St. Malo and
Buckskin discoveries, Chevron said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; All three projects are in the highly touted Lower Tertiary
trend, which has generated excitement as a potentially huge
find but awaits further development to determine how well the
reservoirs are connected and how easily oil will flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jack and St. Malo will be developed together and are in the
engineering and design phase with a final investment decision
expected later this year. Buckskin is not as far along, a
Chevron spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Discoverer Inspiration, operating under a five-year
contract between Chevron and Transocean Ltd (RIG.N), will drill
exploration wells and a Buckskin appraisal well before moving
on to Jack and St. Malo, a news release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our plan is to drill three exploration wells in the
deepwater Lower Tertiary trend, along with the first Buckskin
appraisal well," a Chevron spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She did not have details on the location of the exploratory
wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jack was discovered in 2004, St. Malo in 2003, and Buckskin
in early 2009. All are in water about 7,000 feet (2,134 meters)
deep with well depths between 20,000 and 30,000 feet. The
discoveries are about 190 miles (306 km) southeast of Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Inspiration is the second Transocean deepwater drill
ship built to Chevron specifications and deployed in recent
months. The Discoverer Clear Leader went to work last August.
Both are under five-year contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is one of the largest leaseholders and one of the
most active deepwater operators in the U.S. Gulf oil and gas
fields.

&lt;p&gt;Findings will Contribute to Understanding and Future Study of Figitumumab
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. announced today the discontinuation of A4021018 (also known as
ADVIGO 1018), a Phase 3 trial examining the effects of investigational compound
figitumumab (CP-751,871) in combination with erlotinib as a second/third-line
treatment in patients with previously treated advanced non-adenocarcinoma
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An independent Data Safety Monitoring
Committee (DSMC) recommended A4021018 be stopped after concluding that the
addition of figitumumab to erlotinib is unlikely to demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall survival compared to
erlotinib alone in the study population. 

"This outcome is disappointing to us and to patients with NSCLC. Pfizer is
working to thoroughly analyze all available data from the figitumumab program to
better understand the compound and the IGF-1R (insulin growth factor-1 receptor)
pathway," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical
development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. "As a
pioneer in the IGF-1R field, we are committed to a thorough evaluation of
figitumumab. We will carefully review our extensive clinical database and use
this information to refine the figitumumab clinical program with the goal of
identifying the right patient population in which to evaluate this compound." 

The Company has notified A4021018 clinical investigators and has initiated the
notification procedure for all involved regulatory agencies of the
discontinuation of A4021018. Investigators have been instructed to work with all
of their patients in the A4021018 study on an individual basis to determine an
appropriate course of action. 

In December 2009, Pfizer announced the stop of A4021016 (ADVIGO 1016), a Phase 3
study examining the effects of figitumumab as first-line treatment in patients
with advanced non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC, after an analysis by the DSMC showed
that addition of figitumumab to carboplatin plus paclitaxel would be unlikely to
meet the primary endpoint of improved overall survival compared to paclitaxel
plus carboplatin alone. 

Pfizer is continuing to study figitumumab in clinical trials for the potential
treatment of prostate, breast and lung cancers, and Ewing`s sarcoma. 

About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. NSCLC accounts for about 85
percent of lung cancer cases and 25 to 30 percent are of squamous histology.
Nearly 60 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with Stage IIIB/IV
advanced disease. Despite recent advances, NSCLC remains difficult to treat,
particularly in the metastatic setting. 

About Figitumumab (CP-751,871)

Figitumumab, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly
specific inhibitor of the insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway. The
IGF-1R pathway is thought to be one of the fundamental signaling pathways that
leads to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor cells, and may represent a
resistance mechanism against EGFR inhibitors and other anti-cancer therapies. 

About Pfizer Oncology

Pfizer Oncology is committed to the discovery, investigation and development of
innovative treatment options to improve the outlook for cancer patients
worldwide. Our strong pipeline, one of the most robust in the industry, is

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights TRW Automotive Holdings (NYSE: TRW) as the Bull
of the Day and Novatel Wireless (Nasdaq: NVTL) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG), Microsoft
Corp (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Dell Inc. (Nasdaq: DELL). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

TRW Automotive Holdings (NYSE: TRW) is well positioned to take advantage of an
industry rebound, given its advanced technology portfolio, leading
diversification and improved cost structure. 

The company's innovative product portfolio is capable of generating top- and
bottom-line growth. It has been successful in its restructuring and cost
containment actions to mitigate the impact of the industry-wide downturn, as
reflected in the better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. 

As such, we are maintaining our long-term Outperform recommendation for the
stock with a target price of $32. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are downgrading Novatel Wireless (Nasdaq: NVTL) to Underperform following its
fourth quarter 2009 financial results, which were significantly below Zacks
Consensus Estimates. 

Novatel is facing intensifying competition for its core embedded solutions for
wireless data access. Although Novatel has developed a niche for its MiFi mobile
intelligent hot spot, we foresee increased competition as large firms like
Qualcomm, ZTE and Huawei Technologies are on the verge of introducing their own
version of intelligent mobile hot spots. 

The company's outlook was tepid. We do not find any immediate growth catalysts
for Novatel and believe the company will incur losses for full-year 2010.

Google Steps Closer to the Cloud

Mountain View, California-based Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG), which is slated to
introduce its cloud-based Chrome operating system later this year, took another
step towards achieving this goal. The company has announced an online
marketplace where software developers will be able to offer their products. 

The software to be sold at the store will be closely tied to Google`s own cloud
computing services, essentially enhancing Google`s current lineup and
encouraging consumers to adopt the Google system. 

Developers will be able to offer their products at a $100 fee, they will be able
to fix their own prices and collect the proceeds after leaving Google a margin
of 20% on sales. 

Google stated that around 50 companies had already agreed to sell via the app
store and we expect the number to increase going forward. 

However, the cloud computing system does have its own hurdles, as businesses are
usually concerned about security and access. Although Google has been spending
billions to improve the reliability of its services, only time will tell how
successful it will be. 

Archrival Microsoft Corp (Nasdaq: MSFT) dominates the operating systems market
and has declared that it is spending heavily on the development of cloud-based
services. The company has also followed Google in offering a free version of its
extremely popular Office Application. 

But this latest announcement seems to indicate that Microsoft will be behind
Google when it comes to cloud-based services. Microsoft`s advantage lies in its
operating system and the new Windows 7 offering, which large enterprises are
likely to prefer. 

Dell: Downward Estimate Revisions

Earnings estimates for the computing major Dell Inc. (Nasdaq: DELL) have taken a
nosedive despite the company`s reporting decent fourth quarter 2010 numbers. 

Dell reported fourth quarter 2010 EPS of 28 cents, which exceeded the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. However, EPS was down 3.0% from the year-ago
quarter. The full-year 2010 earnings of $1.05 also declined, dropping 27.0% from
the year-ago quarter. 

Revenue for the fourth quarter was $14.9 billion, up 11.0% from $13.4 billion
reported in the year-ago quarter and up 16.0% from $12.9 billion reported in the
previous quarter. 

The strength may be attributed to improvement in revenues across all business
segments. The commercial business was particularly strong, fueled by growth in
Enterprise Technology and an increase in product shipments. The company reported
its first consolidated results after the Perot acquisition, which was closed
during the fourth quarter.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

P Recalls Pringles Chips

Recently, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) voluntarily recalled two
flavors of Pringles Chips in response to the recommendation from the Food &amp; Drug
Administration (FDA) to protect consumers from potential salmonella exposure.
The flavors were Pringles Restaurant Cravers Cheeseburger potato crisps and
Pringles Family Faves Taco Night potato crisps. However, the company confirmed
that there have been no reports of salmonella-related illness in relation to
these products. 

P also confirmed that no other Pringles varieties or flavors were affected by
this recall. These two products represent only 0.5% of Pringles' U.S. volume.
Management at PG also mentioned that the safety of its products is its top
priority and the company follows rigorous food safety and ingredient testing
standards. 

Salmonella is a common food-related pathogen that can cause severe illnesses,
including fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The company was notified by one
of its suppliers that a seasoning used in these two recalled products contained
hydrolyzed vegetable protein or HVP, manufactured by Basic Food Flavors, Inc.,
which could lead to potential salmonella exposure. 

Last week, McCormick (NYSE: MKC), the manufacturer of spices, also issued a
recall when salmonella was found in its equipment and was transferred to its
product. MKC pulled packages of French onion dip mix, vegetable dip mix, onion
gravy mix and corn stuffing mix; all of which contained hydrolyzed vegetable
protein manufactured by Basic Food Flavors. 

TiVo Beats on Higher Revenues

TiVo Inc. (Nasdaq: TIVO) reported a net loss of 9 cents per share for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2010, 3 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of
12 cents per share but fell from the prior-year quarter. The company had
reported a loss of 4 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. 

Although revenue growth was encouraging in the quarter driven by higher hardware
sales, growing costs and reduced subscriber additions led to lower
profitability. TiVo is not immune to the current challenging economic
environment and is facing erosion of its subscriber base. 

Moreover, intense competition from cable companies such as Comcast (Nasdaq:
CMCSA) and Cox is posing a threat to its DVR business. As a result, TiVo has
been increasing its R spending to stay ahead of the competition, which is
hurting its profitability. 

TiVo reported a net loss of $10.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010,
better than its guided range of a net loss of between $13 million and $15
million. Loss in the quarter was higher than the $3.6 million net loss in the
year-ago period due to higher R and litigation expenses. 

Net revenue for the reported quarter increased 15.7% year over year to $68.5
million, compared to $59.2 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Services
(the company's largest segment) witnessed a year-over-year decline of 13.9%,
offset by a rise in Technology revenue, which was up 56.7% in the quarter and
Hardware revenue, which was up 116.5%. Service and Technology revenue together
declined 6.6% to $45.3 million, but was in line with the company`s guidance of
$43 - $45 million. 

Gross margin dropped to 36.8% from 49.8% in the year-ago period. Operating
expenses rose 5.1% year over year in the quarter, leading to higher loss from
operations. While R expenses rose in the quarter, the company cut its sales
and marketing costs. 

Adjusted EBITDA of a negative $3.2 million was better than management`s guidance
of ($5) million to ($7) million. However, this was down from a positive adjusted
EDITDA of $2.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The decline in EBITDA
was driven by increased research &amp; development spending relating to new products
and higher distribution cost. 

TiVo-owned subscription gross additions for the quarter were 46,000, down 22%
from 59,000 gross additions in the year-ago quarter. Churn increased to 2.6% in
the quarter. On a net basis, TiVo-owned subscriptions decreased by 72,000 in the
fourth quarter and the TiVo-owned subscription base ended the quarter at
approximately 1.5 million subscriptions. 

TiVo exited the quarter with $244.5 million in cash and marketable securities
and no debt. 

In the quarter, TiVo unveiled TiVo Premiere DVR and a new high-definition user
interface. This is TiVo`s first new DVR in nearly three years and comes in
configurations of 320-gigabyte and 1-terabyte hard drives that seamlessly blend
broadcast TV, as well as the Internet and signals. The partnership with Best Buy
(NYSE: BBY) will help TiVo in the launch of the TiVo Premiere and will help it
improve brand visibility and marketing in 2010.

&lt;p&gt;WELLINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - Oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) is looking to sell its New Zealand downstream assets,
including a network of almost 200 petrol stations, local media
reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil is the second global player to look to quit New
Zealand, with Shell (RDSa.L) close to striking a deal with a
consortium of the state pension fund and utilities investor
Infratil Ltd (IFT.NZ)  for the sale of its downstream assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil is in talks with two other parties over the
sale of its assets, the Dominion Post newspaper reported. Its
assets in New Zealand include 183 petrol stations and a 19.2
percent stake in the country's only oil refinery, the New
Zealand Refining Company Ltd (NZR.NZ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell has a similar number of petrol stations, and a 17
percent stake in NZ Refining. The value of its deal is widely
expected to be around NZ$1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon Mobile spokesman in New Zealand declined to
comment to the Dominion Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Infratil and Shell have been in negotiations since late
2009, and earlier this month Infratil said it expected a deal
by April.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) will increase capital spending nearly 4 percent this year to $28 billion in part as the largest U.S. oil company seeks to increase its share of the global market for natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon, with huge liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar and its planned deal to buy U.S. gas producer XTO Energy Inc XTO.N in a $28 billion, all-stock deal, has been placing big bets on future demand for natural gas and that spending will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas is expected "to contribute more significantly to the energy mix over the coming decades," CEO Rex Tillerson told analysts at a presentation at the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large part of the increase is expected to come from power demand, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, also told analysts that it had completed initial tests at Iraq's West Qurna field, where it won a 60 percent stake in the field that is estimated to have 8.7 billion barrels of reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson declined to discuss potential volumes from the field, but said initial planning was going well. Security incidents, while still a challenge, seemed to be lessening in severity, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm encouraged, but we are going to have to remain diligent to ensure we protect our people," the executive said. "But at this point, we feel reasonably positive about moving forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the company said it expects its oil and gas output to rise 3 to 4 percent, while it forecast long-term production growth of 2 to 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploration plans for this year and the next call for Exxon to evaluate offshore fields in Southeast Asia, the Black Sea, Libya, and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest global refiner, said its downstream business could face depressed margins for the next several years.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp may pursue an international arbitration claim over environmental pollution allegations in Ecuador, a judge ruled on Thursday, part of a long-running case that carries a potential $27 billion liability for the second-largest U.S. oil company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government of Ecuador had asked Manhattan federal court Judge Leonard Sand to prevent Chevron from taking the 17-year-old case to arbitration under the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. courts had previously sent the litigation to be heard in Ecuador, where Chevron said last year that it had uncovered a $3 million bribery plot linked to the case. A lawyer for the government said Thursday's ruling does not halt the litigation in the South American country, where a court has yet to render a judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has complained of government interference in the case, in which indigenous communities accused Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, of damaging their health and the Amazon rain forest and causing river pollution while operating petroleum facilities in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original lawsuit was brought by farmers and residents in 1993. One of their lawyers, Jonathan Abady, said the judge's decision means "delay but not defeat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sand said it would be up to the arbitrators to determine the timing and parameters of any proceeding by a tribunal, whose members have been selected but which has not yet held a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The court finds that there is at least one arbitrable issue in Chevron's petition," Sand said in his ruling after hearing hours of oral arguments on Wednesday and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last September, Chevron made the claim in U.S. District Court for arbitration under the treaty, opening a new defense of the potential $27 billion liability lawsuit. Three months later, the government of Ecuador asked the court in New York to stop Chevron from pursuing a claim that the company had been denied due process rights in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron is pleased that Judge Sand denied a stay and the Bilateral Investment Treaty arbitration can proceed," Chevron general counsel Hew Pate said outside the courtroom. "Chevron is seeking to hold Ecuador and its government oil company to the promise it made to complete the environmental cleanup, a promise that Texaco made to clean up and did clean up under government supervision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the Amazon rain forest communities who sued 17 years ago said they believe the cleanup was a sham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyer Abady argued in court that Chevron's notice for arbitration "is a wolf in sheep's clothing to devour the litigation." He said the communities would have no standing or rights before an arbitration panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron cited violations by Ecuador under the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. The company said Ecuador breached the treaty by not forcing an Ecuadorean court to dismiss the environmental lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron lawyer Randy Mastro argued that the government and the plaintiffs were "acting in concert" in their hopes of receiving a multibillion-dollar judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need a level playing field ... to decide our rights vis-a-vis the Republic of Ecuador," Mastro told the judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are Republic of Ecuador v Chevron Corp and Texaco Petroleum Company, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-9958 and Yaiguaje et al v Chevron Corp and Texaco, No. 10-0316.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool, editing by Maureen Bavdek and Gerald E.

denied due process rights in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron is pleased that Judge Sand denied a stay and the
Bilateral Investment Treaty arbitration can proceed," Chevron
general counsel Hew Pate said outside the courtroom. "Chevron
is seeking to hold Ecuador and its government oil company to
the promise it made to complete the environmental cleanup, a
promise that Texaco made to clean up and did clean up under
government supervision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for the Amazon rain forest communities who
sued 17 years ago said they believe the cleanup was a sham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawyer Abady argued in court that Chevron's notice for
arbitration "is a wolf in sheep's clothing to devour the
litigation." He said the communities would have no standing or
rights before an arbitration panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron cited violations by Ecuador under the U.S.-Ecuador
Bilateral Investment Treaty. The company said Ecuador breached
the treaty by not forcing an Ecuadorean court to dismiss the
environmental lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron lawyer Randy Mastro argued that the government and
the plaintiffs were "acting in concert" in their hopes of
receiving a multibillion-dollar judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We need a level playing field ... to decide our rights
vis-a-vis the Republic of Ecuador," Mastro told the judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cases are Republic of Ecuador v Chevron Corp and Texaco
Petroleum Company, U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York, No. 09-9958 and Yaiguaje et al v Chevron
Corp and Texaco, No. 10-0316.

&lt;p&gt; * Issues in long-running case go to international tribunal * Chevron wins round in lawsuit over pollution allegations * Ecuador government tried to stop arbitration claim  (Adds Chevron, plaintiff reaction; background, byline) By Grant McCool NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) may pursue an international arbitration claim over environmental pollution allegations in Ecuador, a judge ruled on Thursday, part of a long-running case that carries a potential $27 billion liability for the second-largest U.S. oil company. The government of Ecuador had asked Manhattan federal court Judge Leonard Sand to prevent Chevron from taking the 17-year-old case to arbitration under the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. U.S. courts had previously sent the litigation to be heard in Ecuador, where Chevron said last year that it had uncovered a $3 million bribery plot linked to the case. A lawyer for the government said Thursday's ruling does not halt the litigation in the South American country, where a court has yet to render a judgment. Chevron has complained of government interference in the case, in which indigenous communities accused Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, of damaging their health and the Amazon rain forest and causing river pollution while operating petroleum facilities in the region. The original lawsuit was brought by farmers and residents in 1993. One of their lawyers, Jonathan Abady, said the judge's decision means delay but not defeat. Sand said it would be up to the arbitrators to determine the timing and parameters of any proceeding by a tribunal, whose members have been selected but which has not yet held a hearing. The court finds that there is at least one arbitrable issue in Chevron's petition, Sand said in his ruling after hearing hours of oral arguments on Wednesday and Thursday. Last September, Chevron made the claim in U.S. District Court for arbitration under the treaty, opening a new defense of the potential $27 billion liability lawsuit. Three months later, the government of Ecuador asked the court in New York to stop Chevron from pursuing a claim that the company had been denied due process rights in Ecuador. Chevron is pleased that Judge Sand denied a stay and the Bilateral Investment Treaty arbitration can proceed, Chevron general counsel Hew Pate said outside the courtroom. Chevron is seeking to hold Ecuador and its government oil company to the promise it made to complete the environmental cleanup, a promise that Texaco made to clean up and did clean up under government supervision. A spokeswoman for the Amazon rain forest communities who sued 17 years ago said they believe the cleanup was a sham.

&lt;p&gt;Project Harnesses Power of the Sun to Save California School District $36
Million
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Energy Solutions, a unit of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and East
Side Union High School District in San Jos&#233;, California, today announced the
start of construction on a 3.7-megawatt solar project that is expected to
provide more than $1.5 million in budget relief to the district`s general fund
in the first year and $7.6 million over five years. It is anticipated that the
project will reduce the district`s electric utility costs by 30 percent and
deliver $36 million in savings over the life of the project. 

"Our schools will all benefit from these savings, especially in these tough
economic times when they`re needed most," said East Side Union High School
District Interim Superintendent Dan Moser. "Also, this project reduces our
carbon footprint and allows us to incorporate solar into our teaching curriculum
so our teachers and students can learn about renewable energy technologies
firsthand." 

The solar panels at six school sites will generate enough power to light more
than 250,000 average-sized compact fluorescent light bulbs. The district will
also reduce its purchase of utility power through this project, which is
expected to reduce carbon emissions by more than 3,100 metric tons per year,
equivalent to planting more than 980 acres of trees. Through professional
development workshops, the district`s teachers will learn how they can use
hands-on solar kits and activity guides in the classroom to teach students about
solar energy. 

Chevron Energy Solutions will design, build, operate, maintain, measure and
guarantee the solar energy system`s performance for the district. The project
will also help stimulate the local Silicon Valley economy by hiring more than
100 local union contractors. Chevron Energy Solutions is the nation`s largest
installer of solar energy for education institutions and has developed hundreds
of projects involving energy efficiency and renewable power for education,
government and business customers in the United States since 2000. 

"We are pleased to help East Side Union High School District celebrate its 60th
anniversary by creating savings and learning opportunities through solar
energy," said Jim Davis, president of Chevron Energy Solutions. "This project is
a prime example of how education institutions can use solar projects to provide
budget relief and teach the next generation about clean technologies." 

The groundbreaking for this project is being celebrated today at Santa Teresa
High School in San Jos&#233;, at an event attended by students and district,
government and business officials. The project is expected to be completed later
this year. 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is driven by
the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their application of the most
innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is involved in virtually every

&lt;p&gt;  AUBURN HILLS, MI, Mar 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Plex Systems, Inc., provider of the No. 1 rated ERP software for

status in the Microsoft Partner Program with competencies in Business
Intelligence and Hosting Solutions, recognizing Plex Systems' expertise
and impact in the technology marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner,
Plex Systems has demonstrated expertise with Microsoft technologies and a
proven ability to meet customers' needs. Microsoft Gold Certified
Partners receive a rich set of benefits, including access, training and
support, giving them a competitive advantage in the channel.

    "Plex Systems is proud to be a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner," said
Plex Systems CEO Mark Symonds. "Customers want to know that the vendors
they work with have a deep and sophisticated knowledge of the technology
and provide excellent customer service. These are areas where we excel.
Gold Certification is a definite differentiator in the market."

    "Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap
between their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison
Watson, corporate vice president of the Worldwide Partner Group at
Microsoft Corp. "They need to trust in a company that can act as an
expert adviser for their long-term strategic technology plans. Microsoft
Gold Certified Partners, which have certified expertise and direct
training and support from Microsoft, can build a positive customer
experience with our technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes Plex
Systems as a Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its expertise in
providing customer satisfaction using Microsoft products and technology."

    As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status,
Plex Systems had to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft
Competencies are designed to help differentiate a partner's capabilities
with specific Microsoft technologies to customers looking for a
particular type of solution. Each Competency has a unique set of
requirements and benefits, formulated to accurately represent the
specific skills and services that partners bring to the technology
industry. Within select Competencies, there are Specializations that
focus on specific solution areas that recognize deeper expertise within
that Competency. Serving as a specialized path to earning those
Competencies, Specializations give direct access to the tools and
resources that support that specific area of focus.

training they need to meet their customers' needs. And for partners, the
opportunity to highlight their expertise to customers is tremendous in
the fast growing business intelligence market."

    The Hosting Solutions Competency is designed for partners that have
proven proficiencies in developing hosting solutions based on Microsoft
solutions. This competency is vital as partner hosted services play a key
role in how customers consume Microsoft software. 

    "The starting point for promoting partner proficiency in developing
hosting solutions to customers is by attaining the Hosting Solutions
Competency," said John Zanni, general manager of the worldwide software +
services industry for the Communications Sector at Microsoft Corp.
"Partners need resources designed to support their expertise in creating
hosting solutions based on Microsoft Solutions for Windows-based Hosting
and Hosted Messaging and Collaboration in the context of real-world
business scenarios."

    The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The

partner expertise, rewards the total impact that partners have in the
technology marketplace, and delivers more value to help partners'
businesses be successful.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with details on the new JPMorgan ETFs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
plans to jump into the burgeoning exchange-traded fund (ETF)
business, according to two Securities and Exchange Commission
filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The filings, made on Wednesday, sought approval for both
index-based and actively managed ETFs. One index-based fund
will track an index of investment-grade U.S. municipal bonds
with maturities between one and 12 years, while the other will
track investment-grade U.S. corporate debt with an issuance of
at least $300 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For actively managed funds, the filing sought approval for
funds that could hold stocks, bonds, open-end funds, closed-end
funds and unit investment trusts. The strategy for JPMorgan's
first actively managed ETF would be to invest in about 300 U.S.
large-cap stocks across many sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The process overweights inexpensive stocks with improving
fundamental characteristics and underweights expensive stocks
that have deteriorating fundamental characteristics," the
filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawrence Carrel, author of "ETFs for the Long Run," said
the bank already runs the JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ),
but "this exchange-traded note isn't a true ETF." He said it is
an unsecured debt sold to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carrel noted that JPMorgan is not the fund's sponsor --
Bear Stearns is. "JPMorgan acquired the ETN when it bought Bear
Stearns in 2008," he said. The AMJ tracks the market of master
limited partnerships. MLP are partnerships that sell shares
like a public company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ETFs globally breached the $1 trillion level for the first
time in 2009. Assets in ETFs rose 46 percent during the year to
$777 billion.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
The Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy today selected 200 elementary school
teachers from across the country to learn innovative new math and science
teaching skills at three academies to be held this summer. 

The selection of the teachers from applications submitted at
www.sendmyteacher.com marks the second year that teachers from all 50 states
have been chosen to participate in the five-year-old professional development
program. 

The academy is an intensive one-week, all-expense paid professional development
program designed to provide teachers with innovative math and science teaching
skills. The participants were selected by a panel of educators from the National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the National Science Teachers Association
based on their qualifications, dedication to inspiring students at an early age
and overall commitment to enhancing the teaching profession. 

"We`re excited to announce the selection of the teachers today and encouraged by
the overwhelmingly positive response we have received from academy graduates,"
said Mickelson. "Working with ExxonMobil, we designed the academy to be an
exciting learning experience that will provide more teachers with tools to
inspire students in these critical areas." 

In 2005, ExxonMobil partnered with Mickelson and his wife, Amy, the teachers
association and Math Solutions to launch the program, which has hosted more than
2,000 teachers at one of the three annual academies, which will be held this
summer in New Jersey, Texas and Louisiana. 

The Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy is part of ExxonMobil`s investment in
math and science education in the United States. The company supports
initiatives that encourage students to take an active interest in careers in the
math and science fields, support the professional development of highly
qualified teachers and promote involvement of women and minorities students. 

"Through our investments in math and science programs, ExxonMobil is investing
in developing a highly skilled workforce to help our nation remain globally
competitive," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of
Exxon Mobil Corporation. "Through programs like the Mickelson ExxonMobil
Teachers Academy, we are equipping today`s students with a solid foundation in
math and science and providing them pathways to pursue careers in science,
engineering and technology."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
plans to jump into the burgeoning exchange-traded fund (ETF)
business, according to two Securities and Exchange Commission
filings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The filings, made on Wednesday, sought approval for both
index-based and actively managed ETFs. One index-based fund
will track an index of investment-grade municipal bonds with
maturities between one and 12 years, while the other will track
investment-grade corporate debt with an issuance of at least
$300 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For actively managed funds, the filing sought approval for
funds that could hold stocks, bonds, open-end funds, closed-end
funds and unit investment trusts. The strategy for J.P.
Morgan's first actively managed ETF would be to invest in about
300 large-cap stocks across many sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawrence Carrel, author of 'ETFs for the Long Run,' said
the bank runs the J.P. Morgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ), but
"this exchange-traded note isn't a true ETF." He said it is an
unsecured debt sold to investors.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) delivered industry-leading results in 2009
during a volatile and challenging industry environment and is well positioned
for future growth across a range of market conditions, the company said today in
its annual presentation to investment analysts at the New York Stock Exchange. 

"Each of our three business segments, Upstream, Downstream and Chemical,
outpaced our competitors," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive
officer. 

"We manage each of our business lines for the long term. A disciplined approach
to investing through the business cycle has established a long record of
responsible stewardship of our shareholders` money." 

In 2009, ExxonMobil reported earnings of $19.3 billion and generated cash flow
of $28.4 billion. This provided the company with important flexibility to fund
business plans and generate strong returns for shareholders through its annual
dividend, which has increased by 57 percent over the past five years, and a
share purchase program, which has increased per-share ownership by 26 percent
over the same period. 

ExxonMobil`s return on capital employed, a key indicator of disciplined decision
making and financial performance, was 16.3 percent, more than 50 percent higher
than its nearest competitor. 

Tillerson said ExxonMobil is well positioned for future growth. 

"Our portfolio of opportunities is healthy and geographically diverse, our
global functional organization remains a competitive advantage, we are steadfast
in our disciplined approach to our business and technology leadership continues
to be our defining characteristic," he said. 

"Our financial flexibility positions us for many outstanding future
opportunities and we will not be distracted from our focus on maximizing
long-term shareholder value. Because of these characteristics and the
exceptional talents of our employees, ExxonMobil is uniquely positioned for the
future." 

Tillerson said ExxonMobil`s capital spending plans are largely unaffected by the
current global recession. 

"We are executing a large inventory of projects and many others are under
development. Actual spending in a given year will vary depending on the pace and
the progress of each project. However, we are anticipating an investment profile
of approximately $28 billion in 2010 and a range of $25 billion to $30 billion
per year on average through the year 2014." 

The company outlined its major achievements in 2009 and plans for the future.
Highlights include:

* ExxonMobil replaced more than 133 percent of its 2009 production with proved
reserves additions totaling 2 billion oil equivalent barrels, based on long-term
pricing used by the company to make investment decisions. It was the 16th
consecutive year the company replaced more than 100 percent of its production. 
* The company added the equivalent of 3.9 billion barrels of oil to its resource
base through by-the-bit additions, resource acquisitions and revisions to
existing fields. Of the 3.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent increase to the
resource base, 2.1 billion barrels were through by-the-bit additions resulting
from exploration drilling that discovered new resources. The company had a
64-percent success rate from the 45 wildcat wells drilled during the year and
has increased prospective net exploration acreage by 17 percent to 72 million
acres over the past five years. Exploration plans for 2010 and 2011 will
evaluate offshore plays in Southeast Asia, the Black Sea, Canada`s East Coast,
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Libya, Brazil and Australia, and also onshore
unconventional gas potential in North America, Europe and Indonesia. 
* During 2009, eight major projects started operations and are projected to add
the equivalent of 400,000 net barrels per day to ExxonMobil`s production in
2010. An additional 12 major projects are expected to start production between
2010 and 2012. Combined with other projects, ExxonMobil expects its share of
production from new projects to increase by 1.5 million oil-equivalent barrels
per day by 2015. The company`s major projects portfolio contains more than 130
oil and gas projects that span all resource types and regions of the world.
ExxonMobil`s net share of the resources represented by those projects is the
equivalent of 24 billion barrels of oil. 
* In the downstream, the company continues to progress plans at two U.S.
refineries and one in Europe to invest more than $1 billion to increase the
supply of lower-sulfur diesel. Once completed later this year, these projects
are expected to increase the production of lower-sulfur diesel by about 6
million gallons per day. 
* In 2009, successful start-up was achieved at China`s first integrated refining
and petrochemical facility with foreign participation. More than $4.5 billion
was invested by ExxonMobil and partners in the Fujian facility, which tripled
the capacity of the existing refinery to 240,000 barrels per day to produce
transportation fuels and other refined products. The project also added a new
petrochemical complex. 
* Also in 2009, 375 megawatts of cogeneration capacity were commissioned,
reflecting new facilities at the Fujian complex and ExxonMobil`s refinery in
Antwerp, Belgium. Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity and
useful heat or steam used for industrial processes resulting in lower operating
costs and fewer greenhouse gas emissions. 
* Despite weak economic conditions, ExxonMobil Chemical Company delivered a 13.9
percent return in 2009, leading other international oil companies' chemical
divisions and key competitors. The chemical business continues to have
attractive growth opportunities, supported by an investment of $3.1 billion in
2009, the highest level in more than 10 years. 
* In 2010, ExxonMobil will continue to progress its biofuels program and
alliance with a leading biotech company, Synthetic Genomics Inc., to research
and develop next-generation biofuels from photosynthetic algae.

This is the eighth year that ExxonMobil has made an annual presentation to
analysts at the New York Stock Exchange.

statements of future events or conditions in this release are forward-looking
statements. Actual future results, including capital expenditures; resource
recoveries; production rates and growth; project plans, schedules, and outcomes;
and the outcome of research programs could differ materially due to changes in
market conditions affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term oil and gas
price levels; political or regulatory developments; reservoir performance;
timely completion of development projects; technical or operating factors; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; and other factors discussed in Item 1A of

&lt;p&gt;Next Generation Drillship Has Unsurpassed Drilling Capabilities
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:
CVX), today announced that it has commenced operations on the Discoverer
Inspiration, an ultra-deepwater drillship, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The
vessel has the capability to drill wells in 12,000 feet (3,650 meters) of water
to a total depth of 40,000 feet (12,200 meters). 

The state-of-the-art vessel is the second such vessel commissioned by Chevron in
the last six months. Last August, Inspiration`s sister ship, DiscovererClear
Leader, began work for Chevron in the ultra-deep water Gulf of Mexico. 

"Both these newly built vessels were designed to Chevron`s specifications and
will work on a strong queue of deepwater opportunities," said George Kirkland,
vice chairman, Chevron. "Going beyond the limits of previous technology,
Inspiration and Clear Leader provide Chevron with the most advanced offshore
drilling capabilities as we explore for new sources of energy in the U.S. and
globally." 

The Inspiration will begin work for Chevron drilling deepwater Gulf of Mexico
exploration prospects and then develop existing discoveries such as Jack, St.
Malo and Buckskin. Chevron will operate Inspiration under a five-year contract
with Transocean. Chevron is one of the top lease holders and producers in the
Gulf. 

The new drillship`s upgrades not only improve safety, reliability and
efficiency, but also extend overall deepwater drilling and completion
capabilities. Enhancements include an upgraded top-drive system, an expanded
high-pressure mud-pump system and expanded completions capabilities. These
enhancements, along with Transocean`s patented dual-activity technology, allow
parallel operations from a single derrick. These innovations are expected to
reduce drilling costs by 5 to 15 percent over conventional single-activity rigs,
depending on reservoir depth and complexity. 

Chevron is widely recognized as a leader in deepwater drilling. The company
holds the current world record for drilling water-depth at 10,011 feet (3,051
meters). 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is driven by
the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their application of the most
innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is involved in virtually every
facet of the energy industry. The company explores for, produces and transports
crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels
and other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy efficiency
solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future, including biofuels.
Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is

&lt;p&gt;March 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs removed Hershey Co
(HSY.N) from its conviction sell list but kept its "sell"
rating on the stock, citing a lower chance of the chocolate
maker missing near-term earnings estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage had a conviction sell rating on the stock as
it expected high commodity prices to pressure profit growth
that could lead to a potential earnings miss for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We now see a reduced risk of a near-term earnings miss due
to recent announcement of incremental cost savings and a
decline in key commodities over the past month," analyst Judy
Hong wrote in a note dated March 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a consumer analyst conference held last month, the maker
of Reese's peanut butter cups and Hershey kisses presented
plans for cost savings in areas such as freight, logistics and
procurement, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also raised its earnings per share estimates
on Hershey by 2 cents to $2.31 for 2010 and by 3 cents to $2.49
for 2011 to reflect the additional cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Goldman Sachs kept its "sell" rating on the stock
citing potential for weakening chocolate sales, difficulty in
increasing prices to offset higher commodities and slowing
gross profit dollar growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Long-term, we continue to see challenges to Hershey's
competitive position as a U.S.-centric player in the global
confectionary market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $41.50 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan's (JPM.N) private bank has embarked on an international expansion in a bid to reduce its focus on the United States, expand its Europe footprint and join the battle to tap the ultra-wealthy in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pablo Garnica, private banking chief for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said the bank had kicked off a hiring spree and is also looking at possible acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't rule out any opportunistic growth opportunity ... we cannot only rely on aggressive organic growth," Garnica told Reuters in an interview. He added the bank had looked at potential acquisition targets in the UK and continental Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our plans, international growth is higher than domestic (U.S.) growth," said Garnica, who has headed the Private Bank's EMEA business since January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his region alone, Garnica said the bank is targeting a 15 percent increase in headcount among senior, client-facing bankers through recruitment and may look to poach entire teams of experts or regional specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy to globalize the business, which caters to super-rich clients with more than $20 million in investible assets, hinges in part on chasing new wealth being created in emerging markets such as the Middle East, Garnica said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis and recession has slowed corporate activity that creates new millionaires -- such as stock market flotations and buyouts -- to a trickle in the developed world, forcing private banks to look elsewhere for new business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIDDLE EAST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe and the United States many are relying on capturing market share from rivals by poaching staff and clients, though Garnica noted corporate activity remains robust in some Middle Eastern markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Middle East is our biggest business and it continues to be a region where there is wealth creation. Again we have aggressive plans to grow there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the best performing market in 2009 in the EMEA region was the UK, Garnica said, largely on account of London's continuing pre-eminence as a financial center and home base of choice for many of the world's super rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan Private Bank had $639 billion in client assets at the end of 2009, a 14 percent increase on the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of these assets are held on behalf of U.S. clients, however, as the international private bank division, including EMEA, Asia and Latin America, holds some $150 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private bank, catering to the ultra wealthy, forms part of JP Morgan's broader wealth business which includes the Private Wealth Management unit, serving more moderately rich U.S. clients with less than $20 million to invest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealth business also includes Bear Stearns' U.S. brokerage, acquired in 2008 as part of the deal to buy out JP Morgan's former Wall Street rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of Citi Private Bank, part of Citigroup (C.N), also recently told Reuters the bank expects to diversify its business globally away from a focus on its U.S. home market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Joel Dimmock and David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, March 11 (Reuters) - U.S. bank JPMorgan (JPM.N) has
agreed to set up an investment banking venture with China's First
Capital Securities this year, Caijing magazine reported on
Thursday, citing an unidentified investment banking source close
to the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has signed memorandum of understanding (MOU) with
First Capital to set up the venture, after four years of talks
with China's Liaoning Securities and Bohai Securities collapsed,
the Chinese-language publication said on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan representative in Hong Kong declined to comment on
the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreign investors are allowed to hold up to one-third of a
Chinese securities venture, which would be granted a licence to
underwrite share sales by domestic companies, the article said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First Capital, founded in 1993 and based in the southern
Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, was China's 33rd
largest brokerage by investment banking revenue in 2009, Caijing
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan China Chief Executive Officer Fang Fang told Reuters
on Tuesday that the company was looking to establish a securities
joint venture in China as soon as possible, joining rivals such
as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and UBS (UBSN.VX) (UBS.N) which had
already set up China ventures in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In China, JPMorgan already has joint ventures in the fund
management and futures businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A securities venture would help it to tap expanding
opportunities from planned reforms and innovations in China's
brokerage sector, including a landmark stock index futures scheme
due for launch next month.

&lt;p&gt;   (Tweaks lead and adds Chinese official comments in pars 7-9) CANBERRA, March 11 (Reuters) - More than 90 Australian authors signed a letter on Thursday decrying China's refusal to grant a visa to one of the country's most celebrated writers because he was HIV-positive, a move that Beijing defended. Robert Dessaix, whose 1996 novel Night Letters dealt with the European travels of a man diagnosed with an incurable disease, was refused permission by Chinese authorities to attend the International Literary Festival in Shanghai on health grounds. More than 90 other writers, including Nobel laureate J.M. Coetzee and Booker Prize winner Thomas Keneally, who penned Schindler's Ark, rallied to Dessaix's support, demanding a public apology from Beijing. This was an act of discrimination that appears to be founded in fear or ignorance and is behaviour unworthy of any nation that desires to be seen as enlightened and civilised, the joint letter said. Mr Dessaix, an internationally published and acclaimed author, has been unjustly left out of the Australian government supported Writers' Tour currently under way in China, the group from The Australian Society of Authors wrote. Dessaix's visa refusal follows strains with China over the arrest in Shanghai of an Australian mining executive and Canberra's decision last year to grant a visa to a high-profile Chinese ethnic separatist leader. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, told reporters in Beijing he was unfamiliar with Dessaix's case and why he was refused a visa, but defended China's rules barring HIV-positive people from entering the country. If he is HIV-positive, then based on China's relevant regulations, he cannot enter China. The rules about this are clear, Qin told a regular news conference. I hope the Australian side and the author himself will be able to understand this. The spokesman added: In China, AIDS sufferers and HIV-positive people are respected and their legitimate rights protected. Dessaix, 65, is the author of the poetic Night Letters and Corfu. The first novel was based around letters written home from a Venice hotel room, pondering Italian history, philosophy and questions of human fate, including his own. Dessaix's autobiography, A Mother's Disgrace, was published in 1994. I am not a threat. I don't write on political issues. I feel I've been spat on, Dessaix told The Age newspaper.

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Court of Appeals has once again upheld a jury's verdict that Microsoft willfully infringed on patents awarded to i4i.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The verdict, which the appeals court first affirmed in December, required Microsoft to pay more than US$240 million in damages and forced it to remove a feature in versions of Microsoft Word 2007 starting in January. Microsoft had been charged with infringing a patent owned by i4i with a feature in Word 2003 and 2007 that lets people create custom XML documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft asked the appeals court to reconsider its decision, and on Wednesday the appeals court upheld its previous affirmation of the district court ruling. Much of the latest decision is identical to the December document, except for an expanded explanation of the three-judge panel's decision to uphold the "willfulness" issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A reasonable jury could have concluded that Microsoft 'willfully' infringed the '449 patent based on the evidence presented at trial," the judges wrote. The decision pointed to evidence presented at the trial showing that Microsoft employees attended demonstrations of i4i software and received i4i sales kits that identified the software as patented technology. This piece of evidence and others imply that Microsoft was aware of the i4i patent, the decision says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Similarly, there is no evidence Microsoft ever made a good faith effort to avoid infringement; internal emails show Microsoft intended to render i4i's product 'obsolete' and assure 'there won't be a need for [i4i's] product,'" the judges wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel will now circulate the document to the rest of the judges on the appeals court, who will decide whether to take up Microsoft's request for an en banc review. If they do, that would mean that all 12 appeals court judges will reconsider the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no set time frame for the court to decide if it will accept the en banc request, but Loudon Owen, chairman of i4i, expects the court to decide in the next four to six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the judges decide against an en banc review, Microsoft can ask the Supreme Court to hear the case, Owen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was pleased with Wednesday's decision. "From our perspective, there are only so many more avenues for appeal for them," he said. "It also resulted in an even more detailed and structured decision in our interest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late last week, Google made another aggressive move to stay ahead of Microsoft in the online productivity tools space by acquiring DocVerse, a startup founded by two former Microsoft employees, known for tools that let users collaborate on Microsoft Office files on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google nabbed the three-year-old, San Francisco-based DocVerse for $25 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. What Google gets in return is the technology to make Microsoft Office operate more like Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DocVerse provides a 1MB plug-in to Office 2007 that allows users to edit and share Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents online and in real-time with all the features of the Office client versions intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the acquisition gives Google the authority to let users access full-featured Office files in a Web-based environment before Microsoft does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google plans to add the DocVerse functionality to Google Apps for free, but it has not announced when that will take place. Yet one thing's for sure: Google is giving Microsoft no breathing room in the race to bring cloud-based productivity tools to businesses. Just yesterday, Google unveiled an online store called Google Apps Marketplace, where enterprises can buy cloud-based applications designed to work with Google's own apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Body Blow to Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that Microsoft already provides the same kind of online-collaboration capabilities as Docverse via its free Office Live Workspace service. But this is an offering that Microsoft has barely marketed, likely because with the upcoming Office 2010, arriving in June (May 12 for businesses), Microsoft will include Office Web Apps. These are free, stripped-down online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. If users want the full features of Office 2010 they will still have to buy the full Office 2010 desktop suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft still has an undeniable lead in the productivity tool space, especially at enterprises, the latest moves by Google turn up the heat. Just as Steve Ballmer announced Microsoft's "all in" commitment to cloud computing last week, Google comes along and integrates online collaboration with Office docs through its own established cloud-based productivity suite and opens up a apps store for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd say this [Google's Docverse buy] was a body blow to Microsoft," says veteran industry analyst Roger Kay. "Microsoft has to respond as best it can, whether shipping Office 2010 earlier or pushing Office Web Apps more, or both."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chasing Google's Web Apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office still remains Microsoft's main cash cow, along with Windows. It generates 90 percent of the revenue for Microsoft's business division. However, the Office suite faces a variety of growing threats, not only from Google Apps, but also from IBM with LotusLive iNotes and Oracle with its newly announced "Cloud Office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kay says that regardless of Microsoft's new devotion to cloud computing, it still runs behind Google when it comes to online collaboration tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google is always trying to outflank Microsoft," Kay says. "There are a lot of benefits to a client-based collaborative system that synchs periodically via the cloud. Having it as an Office plug-in through Google Apps is pretty sweet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Real Problem: Google Incompatibility with Office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there is a flip side to Google's purchase of DocVerse: It is an acknowledgement by Google that Office is the king of productivity apps and that incompatibility between Office and Google Docs has been a weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does DocVerse solve this weakness? No, writes PCWorld columnist David Coursey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DocVerse is essentially an Office add-on that stores files in Google's cloud, writes Coursey. This may help convince Office users to try Google Apps, but it doesn't address the bigger problem of feature and file format incompatibility with Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Limited compatibility with Microsoft Office is a major reason why many Google Apps free and paid customers prefer to use the e-mail and calendar features, but not the word processor, spreadsheet and presentation modules of Google Docs," writes Coursey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still Early Going for Google Apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the time being Office still dominates at large enterprises. A November survey of 2,000 IT decision-makers by research firm Forrester revealed that 80 percent of companies surveyed support some version of Microsoft Office, and 78 percent have no plans for implementing an alternative to Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could change as Google continues to tighten its focus on online collaboration tools for businesses, says Forrester analyst Sheri McLeish. But, she emphasizes, it's still early going for Google Apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, businesses are experimenting with Google Apps, but Google is still trying to sort out its apps and enterprise solution sets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLeish adds it's hard for most companies to make the business case to switch tools when users are comfortable and familiar with Office. "Google realizes this," she says, "which is why it is resorting to acquiring a company that basically helps people work online with Office formatted documents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly Google's long-term goal is to chip away at Microsoft's Office desktop suite dominance, but the DocVerse acquisition doesn't move the ball too far down the field, says McLeish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see this as a complement to Office apps, not a replacement technology," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co plans to close director Robert Zemeckis' ImageMovers Digital facility in Northern California, laying off 450 workers there, or more than 5 percent of its movie studio division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney will shut down IMD and lay off those workers as it wraps up production on "Mars Needs Moms," an animated film that will hit theaters a year from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan to close IMD comes as Rich Ross, recently appointed chairman of Walt Disney Studios, shakes up the company's movie division to focus on films that can be leveraged across other platforms, including toys and video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given today's economic realities, we need to find alternative ways to bring creative content to audiences and IMD no longer fits into our business model," Alan Bergman, president of Walt Disney Studios, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last movie to emerge from IMD was the November 3-D release "A Christmas Carol," which took in $324 million at worldwide box offices and reportedly cost $175 million to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMD's past films include 2007's "Beowulf" and 2004's "Polar Express," two films that helped usher in Hollywood's latest wave of 3-D movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, then-Walt Disney Studios Chairman Dick Cook announced that Zemeckis would work on a 3-D remake of rock band The Beatles' 1968 film "Yellow Submarine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Disney said it hopes to create a new, long-term production deal with Zemeckis and his IMD partners, Jack Rapke and Steve Starkey, to cover continued development of their "Yellow Submarine" film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mars Needs Moms," IMD's last project, is based on a picture book by "Bloom County" cartoonist Berkeley Breathed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's studio division employs about 8,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis: Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOVA YORK--(Business Wire)--
A Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) apresentou os melhores resultados do setor
em 2009, em meio a um ambiente desafiador e vol&#225;til, estando bem posicionada
para crescer futuramente em v&#225;rias condi&#231;&#245;es de mercado, segundo declara&#231;&#227;o de
hoje feita pela empresa durante a sua apresenta&#231;&#227;o anual para analistas de
investimentos na Bolsa de Valores de Nova York. 

"Todos os nossos tr&#234;s segmentos, prospec&#231;&#227;o/extra&#231;&#227;o, refino/distribui&#231;&#227;o e
qu&#237;micos, ultrapassaram a concorr&#234;ncia", afirmou Rex W. Tillerson, presidente do
conselho e diretor executivo. 

"Administramos cada uma de nossas linhas de neg&#243;cios visando o longo prazo. A
abordagem disciplinada de investimento em todo o ciclo de neg&#243;cios estabeleceu
um longo hist&#243;rico de gest&#227;o respons&#225;vel do dinheiro de nossos acionistas". 

Em 2009, a ExxonMobil informou ganhos de US$ 19,3 bilh&#245;es e gerou um fluxo de
caixa de US$ 28,4 bilh&#245;es. Isto proporcionou &#224; empresa uma flexibilidade
importante para financiar planos de neg&#243;cios e gerar retornos s&#243;lidos para os
acionistas por meio de seu dividendo anual, que aumentou 57% nos &#250;ltimos cinco
anos, e um programa de compra, que aumentou a propriedade por a&#231;&#227;o em 26% no
mesmo per&#237;odo. 

O retorno da ExxonMobil sobre o capital empregado, um indicador chave de tomada
de decis&#227;o disciplinada e desempenho financeiro, foi de 16,3%, 50% acima do
concorrente mais pr&#243;ximo. 

Tillerson declarou que a ExxonMobil est&#225; bem posicionada para crescimento
futuro. 

"O nosso portf&#243;lio de oportunidades &#233; saud&#225;vel e geograficamente diversificado,
nossa organiza&#231;&#227;o funcional global continua sendo uma vantagem competitiva,
continuamos com a nossa abordagem disciplinada nos neg&#243;cios, e a lideran&#231;a
tecnol&#243;gica continua a ser nossa caracter&#237;stica definidora", disse ele. 

"O nossa flexibilidade financeira nos posiciona para muitas oportunidades
futuras extraordin&#225;rias e n&#227;o seremos desviados do nosso foco na maximiza&#231;&#227;o do
valor do acionista em longo prazo. Por causa destas caracter&#237;sticas e dos
excepcionais talentos dos nossos funcion&#225;rios, a ExxonMobil tem uma posi&#231;&#227;o
&#250;nica para o futuro." 

Tillerson disse que os planos de gastos de capital da ExxonMobil s&#227;o em geral
pouco afetados pela atual recess&#227;o global. 

"Estamos executando um amplo invent&#225;rio de projetos e muitos outros est&#227;o sendo
desenvolvidos. Os gastos reais de um determinado ano v&#227;o variar, dependendo do
ritmo e do avan&#231;o de cada projeto. No entanto, estamos prevendo um perfil de
investimento de aproximadamente US$ 28 bilh&#245;es em 2010, e entre US$ 25 bilh&#245;es e
US$ 30 bilh&#245;es por ano, em m&#233;dia, at&#233; 2014." 

A empresa informou suas principais realiza&#231;&#245;es em 2009 e os planos para o
futuro. Em destaque est&#227;o:

* A ExxonMobil substituiu mais de 133% da sua produ&#231;&#227;o de 2009, com adi&#231;&#245;es de
reservas provadas totalizando dois bilh&#245;es de barris de &#243;leo equivalente, com
base em pre&#231;os de longo prazo usados pela empresa para tomar decis&#245;es sobre
investimento. Foi o 16&#186; ano consecutivo em que a empresa substituiu mais de 100%
da sua produ&#231;&#227;o. 
* A empresa adicionou o equivalente a 3,9 bilh&#245;es de barris de &#243;leo &#224; sua base
de recursos por meio de adi&#231;&#245;es graduais, aquisi&#231;&#245;es de recursos e revis&#245;es dos
campos existentes. Do aumento de 3,9 bilh&#245;es de barris de &#243;leo equivalente para
a base de recursos, 2,1 bilh&#245;es de barris foram adi&#231;&#245;es graduais, resultantes de
perfura&#231;&#227;o explorat&#243;ria que descobriu novos recursos. A empresa apresentou um
&#237;ndice de sucesso de 64% nos 45 po&#231;os pioneiros perfurados durante o ano e
aumentou a &#225;rea de explora&#231;&#227;o prospectiva l&#237;quida em 17%, subindo para 72
milh&#245;es de acres (13 milh&#245;es de hectares) nos &#250;ltimos cinco anos. Os planos de
explora&#231;&#227;o para 2010 e 2011 v&#227;o avaliar as opera&#231;&#245;es c&#237;clicas no sudeste da
&#193;sia, no Mar Negro, costa leste do Canad&#225;, Golfo do M&#233;xico dos EUA, L&#237;bia,
Brasil e Austr&#225;lia, e tamb&#233;m o potencial de g&#225;s n&#227;o convencional em terra na
Am&#233;rica do Norte, na Europa e na Indon&#233;sia. 
* Em 2009, oito importantes projetos iniciaram opera&#231;&#245;es e est&#227;o planejados para
adicionar o equivalente a 400 mil barris l&#237;quidos por dia &#224; produ&#231;&#227;o da
ExxonMobil em 2010. Doze importantes projetos adicionais devem iniciar a
produ&#231;&#227;o entre 2010 e 2012. Aliados a outros projetos, a ExxonMobil espera que
sua parcela de produ&#231;&#227;o de novos projetos aumente em 1,5 milh&#227;o de barris de
&#243;leo equivalente por dia at&#233; 2015. O portf&#243;lio de importantes projetos da
empresa cont&#233;m mais de 130 projetos de petr&#243;leo e g&#225;s que abrangem todos os
tipos de recursos e regi&#245;es do mundo. A parcela l&#237;quida dos recursos da
ExxonMobil representada por estes projetos &#233; equivalente a 24 bilh&#245;es de barris
de petr&#243;leo. 
* No setor de refino e distribui&#231;&#227;o, a empresa continua a avan&#231;ar com os planos
em duas refinarias dos EUA e uma na Europa para investir mais de US$ 1 bilh&#227;o
para aumentar o suprimento de diesel com menor teor de enxofre. Uma vez
conclu&#237;dos estes projetos, o que ocorrer&#225; mais para o final do ano, eles devem
aumentar a produ&#231;&#227;o de diesel com baixo teor de enxofre em cerca de seis milh&#245;es
de gal&#245;es por dia. 
* Em 2009, iniciou-se com sucesso as opera&#231;&#245;es da primeira instala&#231;&#227;o integrada
de petroqu&#237;mica e refino da China, com participa&#231;&#227;o estrangeira. Mais de US$ 4,5
bilh&#245;es foram investidos pela ExxonMobil e parceiros nas instala&#231;&#245;es de Fujian,
que triplicaram a capacidade da refinaria existente para 240 mil barris por dia,
para produzir combust&#237;veis de transporte e outros produtos refinados. O projeto
adicionou tamb&#233;m um novo complexo petroqu&#237;mico. 
* Tamb&#233;m em 2009, 375 megawatts de capacidade de cogera&#231;&#227;o foram comissionados,
refletindo as novas instala&#231;&#245;es do complexo de Fujian e a refinaria da
ExxonMobil em Antu&#233;rpia, na B&#233;lgica. Cogera&#231;&#227;o &#233; a produ&#231;&#227;o simult&#226;nea de
eletricidade e calor ou vapor &#250;til para uso em processos industriais, o que
resulta na redu&#231;&#227;o dos custos operacionais e em menores emiss&#245;es de g&#225;s de
efeito estufa. 
* Apesar das fracas condi&#231;&#245;es econ&#244;micas, a ExxonMobil Chemical Company produziu
um retorno de 13,9% em 2009, &#224; frente de outras divis&#245;es qu&#237;micas de empresas
internacionais de petr&#243;leo e concorrentes essenciais. O setor de produtos
qu&#237;micos continua a ter oportunidades atraentes de crescimento, apoiado em um
investimento de US$ 3,1 bilh&#245;es em 2009, o n&#237;vel mais alto em mais de dez anos. 
* Em 2010, a ExxonMobil continuar&#225; a avan&#231;ar com seu programa de biocombust&#237;veis
e a alian&#231;a com uma importante empresa de biotecnologia, a Synthetic Genomics
Inc., para pesquisar e desenvolver biocombust&#237;veis de pr&#243;xima gera&#231;&#227;o a partir
de algas fotossint&#233;ticas.

Este &#233; o oitavo ano em que a ExxonMobil faz uma apresenta&#231;&#227;o anual para
analistas na Bolsa de Valores de Nova York.

&lt;p&gt; * Disney closes studio co-founded by Robert Zemeckis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Layoff amounts to more than 5 percent of studio staff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co
(DIS.N) plans to close director Robert Zemeckis' ImageMovers
Digital facility in northern California, laying off 450 workers
there, or more than 5 percent of its movie studio division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney will shut down IMD and lay off those workers as it
wraps up production on "Mars Needs Moms," an animated film that
will hit theaters a year from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan to close IMD comes as Rich Ross, recently
appointed chairman of Walt Disney Studios, shakes up the
company's movie division to focus on films that can be
leveraged across other platforms, including toys and video
games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given today's economic realities, we need to find
alternative ways to bring creative content to audiences and IMD
no longer fits into our business model," Alan Bergman,
president of Walt Disney Studios, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The last movie to emerge from IMD was the November 3-D
release "A Christmas Carol," which took in $324 million at
worldwide box offices and reportedly cost $175 million to
produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IMD's past films include 2007's "Beowulf" and 2004's "Polar
Express," two films that helped usher in Hollywood's latest
wave of 3-D movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September, then-Walt Disney Studios Chairman Dick Cook
announced that Zemeckis would work on a 3-D remake of rock band
The Beatles' 1968 film "Yellow Submarine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, Disney said it hopes to create a new, long-term
production deal with Zemeckis and his IMD partners, Jack Rapke
and Steve Starkey, to cover continued development of their
"Yellow Submarine" film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mars Needs Moms," IMD's last project, is based on a
picture book by "Bloom County" cartoonist Berkeley Breathed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's studio division employs about 8,000 people.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft confirmed today that a security update for its Excel spreadsheet had turned English text in an important Windows tool into Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The admission was the second in the past two days from Microsoft's Office team of a gaffe involving a recent security update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's announcement involved the seven-patch update Microsoft shipped on Tuesday for Excel. "We have received reports from some of our Excel 2003 and Excel 2002 customers that after installing update KB978471 or KB978474, they are seeing non-English text in the 'Add or Remove Programs' tool (Win[dows] XP) or the 'Programs and Features' -- 'Installed Updates' view (Vista, Win[dows] 7)," Microsoft said in an entry published early today on the "Office Sustained Engineering" blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two updates Microsoft referenced, KB978471 and KB978474 , were the patch collections for Excel 2002 and Excel 2003, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft , the patches are displayed in "Add or Remove Programs" in simplified Chinese rather than the intended English. "If English text ... is a requirement, there is a two-part workaround available," said Microsoft as it told users to first uninstall Tuesday's Excel update, then download and install a revamped version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's snafu wasn't as serious as the one Microsoft acknowledged Thursday, also on the Office blog . Yesterday, the company confirmed that a Feb. 9 non- security hotfix that added support for .Net 4.0 to Office 2007 caused the suite's programs to crash when they were run on Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008 with Terminal Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some users claimed that the update also made Internet Explorer 8 (IE8) crash when working with SharePoint 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yanked the hotfix -- which was served in limited fashion last month and then more widely via Microsoft Update starting last Tuesday -- and replaced it with another that corrected the crash problem. The crash-making hotfix was also pulled Thursday from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), the patch-management system that many businesses use to distribute security and other fixes to company PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had a string of update problems this year, the most widely-reported a February patch for a 17-year-old Windows vulnerability that caused computers to lock up and display the dreaded "blue screen of death" error message. Microsoft withdrew the update within days, and later said that only PCs infected with a rootkit had been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Trade Deficit Falls, But&#8230;

The nation's trade deficit fell in January to $37.3 billion from a downwardly
revised $39.9 billion in December. It did so, however, for the "wrong reason." 

We saw a bigger decline in imports, which dropped by $3.1 billion or 1.69% to
$180.0 billion, than we did in exports, which fell by $0.5 billion or 0.35%, to
$142.7 billion. It is the wrong reason because both imports and exports fell. We
want to see an expansion in world trade, not a contraction. 

The oil side of the deficit is a particularly intractable problem, since it is
not helped by a weaker dollar. If the dollar weakens, the price of oil just
tends to rise in reaction. To solve this problem, we need to move to non-oil
energy sources. We simply do not have the domestic oil reserves anymore for
"drill baby drill" to be an effective answer, at least with regards to oil. 

Domestic Natural Gas Usage Should Increase

It would be a very effective answer if we could shift over to using more natural
gas, where supplies are extremely abundant thanks to the new shale plays. On an
BTU equivalent basis, natural gas is also dirt cheap, welling for the equivalent
of less than $30 a barrel. 

Natural gas-powered vehicles are a well-tested technology, and are in use around
the world...why not here? Both Ford (NYSE: F) and GM already make them, they
just don't sell them here. It would even be possible to have a "gas station" at
home if you already have gas for cooking or heating. 

Yes, there are some potential environmental problems with shale gas, most
notably potential groundwater contamination. However, those potential problems
are very small relative to the environmental disaster which is coal. Not only
does coal produce about twice as much CO2 as gas per BTU, is also creates
massive amounts of fly ash that are left in huge piles near power plants. Last
year, one of the dams holding back fly ash broke in Tennessee and cause one of
the largest environmental disasters ever in the lower 48 states. 

Coal also spew all sorts of other very nasty stuff into the atmosphere,
including mercury, lead and arsenic. Clean coal would be nice, but then again it
would be nice to catch a leprechaun and get his pot of gold. That's not going to
happen because leprechauns don't exist, and neither does "clean coal." The
administration's infatuation with clean coal is just plain silly, or just
something that helps keep Senators Rockefeller and Byrd happy. 

Weaker Dollar Helps Non-Oil Side

A weaker dollar would help greatly on the non-oil side of the deficit, however.
Prices of imported goods would become more expensive relative to domestically
made goods. People might decide to buy more Fords and fewer Toyotas, or at least
Toyota might decide to sell more cars built in its plants here. 

Our exports could be more competitive with the offerings of other nations,
either the country we are selling to directly, and against other exporting
countries' offerings. For example, General Electric (NYSE: GE) might have a
better shot at selling electrical generators in India rather than the order
going to Siemens (NYSE: SI) of Germany. 

The rebound in the dollar over the last few months (mostly in response to the
"Greek drama") works in the wrong direction. "King Dollar" is a tyrant who needs
to be overthrown. Yes, sending King Dollar to the guillotine would cause
inflation to be somewhat higher, but the problem the country faces right now is
jobs and growth, not inflation, which is very much under control. Not only do
the economic statistics tell you that, but the bond market is practically
screaming it. 

If inflation were about to zoom to 5 or 6% why would any person with an above
room temperature IQ buy a 10 year T-note at 3.7%? If inflation were the problem,
not unemployment, I would favor a stronger dollar, but that is not the case
today. 

Looking Ahead in China

By country, our biggest deficit by far is with China, where it expanded to $18.3
billion from $18.1 billion in December. This presents another problem for
solving the trade deficit problem as long as China keeps pegging the Yuan to the
dollar. If the dollar weakens, then so does the Yuan, and U.S. imports from
China will not fall, and our exports to China will only benefit indirectly -- to
the extent we displace other countries exporting to China. 

To bring the world economy back into balance, the Yuan must rise as the dollar
falls. China does not have a big problem with growth right now, but it is
starting to have a growing inflation problem, so it would be in the interest of
the Chinese people to see the Yuan strengthen as well. I think it will
eventually happen, but probably in a controlled way. 

As it does, firms that are tied to the Chinese domestic economy should do very
well. A large-cap beneficiary of this would be China Mobile (NYSE: CHL), which
gets almost all its revenues from within the Middle Kingdom, not from exports. 

Another way to play this would be through the Claymore China Small-Cap ETF
(NYSE: HAO), since small-cap stocks in China tend to be more domestically
focused than are the large caps.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

AIG Sees $490M on Stake Sale

American International Group Inc.`s (NYSE: AIG) expects $490 million from its
stake sale in the reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings Inc. (NYSE: TRH). 

Last Friday, the company announced its plan to sell its remaining 14% stake in
Transatlantic owned by American Home Assurance Company (AHAC), an AIG
subsidiary. 

Last Tuesday, the offering of 8,466,693 shares of Transatlantic`s common stock
was priced at $53.35 each. The underwriters of the offering include Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS), Wells Fargo Securities of Wells Fargo &amp; Company
(NYSE: WFC) and BofA Merrill Lynch, a part of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). They
have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 725,969 shares of
Transatlantic common stock from AHAC. 

In total, the offering would generate proceeds of around $490 million for AIG.
Last year, AIG raised over a billion from selling a part of its Transatlantic
stake. 

AIG, which received federal support worth $182.5 billion, has been trying for
the past several quarters to sell assets and streamline its operations in an
effort to repay the bailout money.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft this week made available a final release of ASP.Net MVC 2, which provides a Model View Controller&#160;pattern for building Web applications leveraging ASP.Net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 2 is available for Visual Studio 2008/Visual Web Developer 2008 Express with ASP.Net 3.5, said Scott Guthrie, corporate vice president in the Microsoft Developer Division, in a blog entry on Thursday evening. A release candidate for ASP.Net MVC 2 was offered last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ A Microsoft executive last month revealed application development investment priorities for the company. | Keep up with app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld's Fatal Exception blog. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ASP.Net MVC 2 is the next significant update of ASP.Net MVC. It is a compatible update to ASP.Net MVC 1 -- so all the knowledge, skills, code, and extensions you already have with ASP.Net MVC continue to work and apply going forward," Guthrie said. "Like the first release, we are also shipping the source code for ASP.Net MVC under an OSI-compliant open source license."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Features in version 2 include improved Visual Studio tooling support, strongly typed HTML helpers, and enhanced model validation support across client and server. Other improvements include&#160;auto-scaffold UI helpers with template customization and support for splitting large applications into "areas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support also is included for JavaScript validation in the browser. In addition, developers can use DataAnnotation support in the .Net Framework to declaratively define and add validation rules to business objects and properties. Additional capabilities include asynchronous controllers support for executing long-running tasks in parallel, support for rendering subsections of a page/site using Html.RenderAction, and new helper functions, utilities, and API enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MVC framework, according to Microsoft, encourages developers to maintain a separation of concerns among the responsibilities of applications, including UI logic via the view, user-input handling using the controller, and domain logic using the model. ASP.Net MVC applications can be tested using techniques such as test-driven development. The framework is built on ASP.Net 3.5 Service Pack 1, enabling developers to leverage features such as authentication and authorization, profile settings, and localization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Version 2 can be installed side-by-side with ASP.Net MVC 1, so applications built with version 1 can run on the same computer as applications built with version 2, Guthrie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASP.Net MVC 2 can be downloaded using the Microsoft Web Platform Installer and is also available for download at the Microsoft Download Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft releases MVC upgrade for building Web apps," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;In this installment of IDG Enterprise's "CEO Interview Series," Cisco CEO John Chambers talks with IDGE Chief Content Officer John Gallant, Computerworld Editor-in-Chief Scot Finnie and InfoWorld.com Editor-in-Chief Eric Knorr about Cisco's changing relationship with IBM, HP and others as it forges ahead into new enterprise IT markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chambers answers his critics: What premium pricing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your goal of being the No.1 IT company puts Cisco into a different market. People know you as the network company because you are selling against, say, Juniper on point products. But now you'll be selling a vision of IT against the HPs and IBMs of the world. That's a very different thing, no?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[We're] one of the top architectural players, as well as the top communications company, which you could argue we're in pretty good shape on. We'll play architecturally on both technology and on business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've had a track record in whatever markets we've entered, becoming the No.1 player. Even our toughest critics would probably give us credit for that. The first generation of competitors we took on were very good companies: SynOptics, Wellfleet, 3Com, Cabletron. Only none of those now exist. And, the same thing could happen to Cisco if we don't get market transitions right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chambers: Why the Flip video camera matters to CIOs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we have a healthy paranoia. We know we could be left behind too. Make no mistake about it. While we have no fear, we have a lot of healthy paranoia about what can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third; when we started in the service provider market, people said we didn't understand service providers. It's a different set of competitors, Nortel, Lucent, Alcatel, Siemens, Ericsson. To think you could even play here is probably a stretch. To think you can become the No.1 player, forget it. And yet, we did. Those were tough competitors. But we got our market transition right. We moved in a way they did not. We did it on architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were at the Mobile World Congress, you ask any service provider who is your most likely business partner? And who's your most likely technology architecture partner? We'll get the answer the majority of the time. Now, that was something you would have said five or six years ago was not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the data center, I did not want to compete against IBM and HP. I tried to partner with both of them. I would have preferred that. But we knew going in - and the decision was made five years ago - once we started down the path with virtualization, that if they would partner we'd prefer to do that, and would have actually given them a large part of our technology. But if not, it was too important strategically to us, because it wasn't a question about moving into new markets. I'm not after servers. I'm after virtualization, where you don't know where your processors are, your information's stored, the application resides. You don't care. If done another way, the network becomes dumb pipes, commodity like. So we had to move into this in terms of where the market was going. We focused on market transition, not competitors. And I think you'd have to argue, we're off to a good start, both in mind share and vision and strategy. But it comes down to how well we do on our first pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco CEO says public and private clouds are what networking is all about&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is it about the data center that Cisco gets that you think these other big companies don't get?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn't a question of 'gets'. It's all about virtualization in the cloud and the role the network plays in it. We think the network is the central piece. It's not the data center or the end user device. It's any device to any content wherever it is in the world over any combination of networks wired or wireless to the home, to an Apple device, to a Microsoft device, to an IBM device, HP. Doesn't matter to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is not going to be about voice or data. It's going to be about video. Now, you can say that's a big stretch. But, remember again, we said before it would be all-in-one data, voice, video. [We] made that decision a decade-and a half ago and we began building them to architecturally work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chambers: Why the Flip video camera matters to CIOs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is it a stretch? Perhaps. But we've done this multiple times before. We do it through innovation. We can acquire companies. How good are the large companies at acquiring companies? How many times have they acquired a company, kept the top leaders, kept the top engineers, brought out the next generation product and gained market share? The answer is: not very often. We've done 137 acquisitions. The vast majority of them have exceeded what we told our board we would do. This is innovation. This is our game. It's about market transformation. It's about being customer driven. And, I learned that the hard way at IBM and Wang. I don't fall in love with technology. Most every move we make, including this virtualization focus, was driven by customers. It was the customers' grasping what we needed to do. Then, it's usually internal innovation or an acquisition that kick starts you into it. Much like buying three switch companies kick started us into switching, which is now 40% plus of our revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You said you would have preferred to partner on this data center initiative, but isn't one natural consequence of wanting to be the No.1 IT company that you have to burn some bridges? There certainly is the perception that that is happening now. Is there a risk of Cisco becoming isolated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think to look at the models that have tried to go it alone, that's a fair question. But Cisco is a partnering culture - we've been rated No.1 in terms of resellers and partners for almost a decade. Doesn't mean we're perfect, but we're pretty good. And secondly, you partner with the players that you have to [have] to win the long-term architecture. So, service providers align very tightly across the board. And it isn't just about selling routers and switches to them. Or doing technology. If you talk to [ATT CEO] Randall Stephenson, I'd be surprised if he didn't say we were his best business partner too. Who would have thought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that important to an enterprise CIO? The candid answer is that it's probably not as important now as I think it will be three, four, five years from now. But it's something they would not want to bet against because I think service providers will play a different role in terms of the enterprise CIO three to five years from now vs. where they are today. But I'm not asking the CIOs to commit. We'll provide that capability. We'll take the lead. We'll partner with the players like ATT or Verizon. And then if their role expands as I expect, we're right. If it doesn't, we've got the customers covered on it. Our ability to catch a market transition has been very good. It's a new generation of players. Who would have thought that Intel would be a strategic partner for me like they are today? Or EMC or VMware? Or Net App?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably wouldn't have thought that our key services partners would be Accenture, Wipro [Technologies], Infosys, Tata Consulting. Yet if you watch who the new movers and shakers are in this industry, it's them. If you're going to compete on services, I don't want to be a body shop and have to compete against all those players. I'd much rather do the project management and use our partners to implement, because I couldn't staff it even if I could afford it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn't burn bridges. Instead we formed new partnerships. I never burned the bridge. Is the bridge still there at IBM? Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You burned one recently with HP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question of who burned the bridge. Very simply, there's a point in time where you've got to be realistic about what's going on in the market. Your customers see it. Your partners see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we [decided not to renew our systems integrator contract with] HP, my customers were pretty much unanimous saying it was about time. You can't be giving your partner your product plans, your directions, your evolution and then compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that was less about you and more about their increasing aggressiveness in your market &#8211; in your core market?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I think it had to do with the way that we would partner, sharing information was not constructive, in terms of giving them product plans and directions. And, for our existing customers and partners, it made no sense to be doing that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this is Cisco's Unified Computing System. It's tuned toward a segment of the market that understands the data center transition and can afford to make that kind of transition. How do you make it a bigger market opportunity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is pretty simple. You have to make the first major installations go well. Will most CIOs really look hard at our strategy for virtualization? Absolutely. Will they adopt UCS if the initial couple dozen accounts, the majority of them are really satisfied? Yes, they will. You&#8217;ve seen the volumes. We announced the [Nexus] 7000 is growing, year-over-year, at 150%. The 5000s, which are the key elements of implementing UCS, grew at 450%. UCS, in terms of number of customers, is off to a great start. But it's like anything you do. You've got to make your initial pilots, first 50 systems work well. If they do, then I think we're in good shape to get pretty excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about data center in Network World's Data Center section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;  (Changes sourcing to confirm Goldman's hiring, adds Goldman,
GMAC reactions, NEW YORK dateline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - GMAC Financial Services,
majority-owned by the U.S. government after multiple bailouts,
has hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to advise it on a possible sale
of Residential Capital, its troubled mortgage unit, a source
familiar with the situation said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ResCap, which has triggered billions of dollars of losses
for GMAC, could draw the interest of billionaire investor
Warren Buffett, according to the New York Post, which first
reported the news of Goldman's hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett owns a sizable chunk of ResCap's debt and has been
interested for months in buying the lender, according to the
paper. In December, the paper said Buffett was in talks to buy
ResCap. [ID:nN24172737]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Congressional Oversight Panel, the U.S. bailout
watchdog, said earlier this week that despite three separate
bailouts totaling $17.2 billion GMAC continues to struggle with
its mortgage liabilities. [ID:nN10178145]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GMAC, one of the largest car loan companies in the United
States, has said it is exploring strategic alternatives for the
mortgage unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GMAC and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;E.A.R.L. Was Created with Microsoft Silverlight
PONTE VEDRA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
MDI Healthcare Solutions, based in Ponte Vedra, Florida, announced today that
the second-generation E.A.R.L., part of the MDI Analytics Suite, will be
featured in the keynote address at Microsoft`s MIX10, The Next Web Now
Conference in Las Vegas on Monday, March 15th (http://live.visitmix.com). The
MDI Analytics Suite is a collection of practical data visualization and
analytics solutions for the complex healthcare environment. E.A.R.L. (Empowered
Analysis and Reporting Log) was created with Microsoft Silverlight, a browser
plug-in that powers rich interactive experiences through Web, desktop and mobile
applications. 

"Our customers have been using the E.A.R.L. technology for almost two years,"
said MDI Healthcare Solutions President Ted Willich. "We have been working on
this latest iteration for the better part of 2009, and what we`ve created is a
detailed graphic representation of data that up until now has been very hard to
understand. To be recognized at this very important gathering of industry
professionals is very gratifying." 

E.A.R.L. is a user-friendly graphic tool that visualizes a patient`s medical
history, including diagnoses, claims and pharmacy information. Through an
interactive visual interpretation of the human body, users are able to review
claim-supported patient history at a glance. Color identifies the severity of
the affected organs, bones, and other areas within the body, allowing customers
to quickly identify high-risk situations and manage future healthcare costs.
E.A.R.L. is accessed through a secure portal by MDI`s customers, protecting
patient identity and privacy. 

The second-generation E.A.R.L. is part of the company`s newly launched MDI
Analytics Suite, which allows users to analyze and manipulate data to manage
current and future healthcare costs in an easy-to-use, flexible, web-based
reporting gateway. MDI`s driven staff, along with Silverlight`s rapid
development capabilities, made it possible to create and implement this
revolutionary product in a very short timeframe. 

"Silverlight enables a variety of business application scenarios, and Microsoft
looks forward to seeing how the healthcare industry will benefit from MDI
Healthcare Solutions` new Silverlight-based E.A.R.L. technology," said Steve
Sklepowich, director for Silverlight at Microsoft Corp. "E.A.R.L. is a great
example of how companies can use Silverlight to power rich, line of business
applications that provide users with an efficient, visual way to interpret
data." 

The MDI Analytics Suite also includes powerful health data analysis tools that
make a variety of standard and customizable reports available to assist in
decision-making and understanding medical claims data. 

MDI Healthcare Solutions, a Florida-based division of MDI Holdings, provides
practical solutions to complex healthcare challenges. Through customer-driven
innovation and a commitment to personal service, MDI gives customers the
independence to control costs, manage risk and enhance the quality of their

&lt;p&gt; * Says 'we agree with most of the proposals out there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Insists industry views must be taken into account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Wants some derivatives to be traded over the counter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Sees some positive signs on economy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jim Christie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PALO ALTO, California, March 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase
 Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Friday that
U.S. banks agree with 70 to 80 percent of proposed financial
regulatory reform and he hopes a bill passes this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon, sounding a conciliatory note as Democrats move to
sculpt legislation after efforts at a bipartisan compromise
collapsed, also insisted that he and other banks support
consumer protection although they oppose a standalone agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Banks recognize, almost all of them, that the regulatory
system failed and that we need to simplify it and strengthen
it," he told an audience at Stanford University. "We agree with
most of the proposals out there, I'd say 70 or 80 percent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he insisted that the industry's views should be taken
into account in crafting the legislation as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We may be right about the other 30 percent and we are
entitled to be part of the conversation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While "we agree on the need for better oversight and
transparency" in the derivatives markets, JPMorgan believes
that there is a place for some derivatives trades to take place
outside of clearinghouses, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon, who runs the No. 2 U.S. bank by assets and the one
which best weathered the financial crisis, also said he sees
some positives in the economy going forward and that he does
not expect real estate problems to torpedo the recovery.

&lt;p&gt;IBM says it is the No. 1 technology employer in the U.S. and the world, but as time moves on it may be harder to tell just what is happening to its domestic workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has stopped providing breakouts of the number of employees it has in the U.S., and in doing so is closing a door to data that provided insights into this bellwether company's employment shift. Over the years, IBM workforce data showed accelerating overseas employee hiring, especially in India, and a steadily declining U.S. workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its most recently released annual report, the company only provides its global headcount. Overall, IBM finished 2009 with 399,409 employees worldwide, up .2% or just short of 1,000 from 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's U.S. workforce, according to the latest data from last fall, which appeared in congressional testimony, is 105,000. In 2007, IBM employed 121,000 in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alliance@IBM/CWA Local 1701, which has been trying to win bargaining rights for employees has estimated that the company laid off about 10,000 U.S. workers last year and IBM recently conducted another layoff , that the Alliance says has reached about 2,900.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the change in the annual report, an IBM spokesman responded in a note, that "our competitors report headcount globally. Going forward we will report it globally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is true that many high-tech firms only disclose aggregate headcount data, but some go a little further. Microsoft , for instance, reported that as of June last year it employed approximately 93,000 -- 56,000 in the U.S. and 37,000 internationally. In 2008, it reported 91,000 workers, 55,000 in the U.S. and 36,000 internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ron Hira, an associate professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, said the workforce data is critical for policymakers in understanding the dynamics of offshoring. "By hiding its offshoring, IBM is doing a disservice to America -- through omission the company is providing misleading labor market signals and information to policy makers," Hira said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is trying to convince the government to provide the funds and policies to promote more STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) graduates in the US as well as increase the H-1B cap, said Hira. "Yet at the same time IBM is actually decreasing its demand of that same labor," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hira said he believes that Congress should ask firms to disclose their offshoring. "With better information and transparency we'd all be better off -- workers would understand where there are opportunities (and where they are not), taxpayers would understand where their tax dollars are flowing (especially stimulus dollars), and policymakers could better respond to offshoring," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hira also argues that the shift overseas also makes clear how critical the tax deferral on foreign profits is to IBM's bottom line and why they are opposing President Barack Obama's "proposal to end the tax breaks that encourage firms to move American jobs overseas," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM was one of a long list of companies opposing the tax deferral rules in a letter to congressional leaders last year. The letter argued that repeal of the deferral "will result in a loss of jobs for Americans and serious negative impacts on the U.S. economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Thibodeau covers SaaS and enterprise applications, outsourcing, government IT policies, data centers and IT workforce issues for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt; * Oil market to move into brief backwardation summer 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * More persistent backwardation in 2011 as oil demand rises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * OECD oil stocks to fall by 100-150 mln bbls by late summer
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - Falling oil inventories and a
recovery in demand will boost spot crude prices this summer,
moving the market into backwardation for the first time since
2008, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Backwardation is a market structure where future contracts
for immediate delivery are more expensive than contracts for
delivery in the future. It generally occurs when supplies are
tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For this time of year, OECD total petroleum inventories
would need to be 100-150 million barrels below current estimated
levels for front-month to rise above second-month WTI crude oil
prices," Goldman analysts David Greely and Jeffrey Currie said
in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given our forecasted path for inventories, we don't expect
to see this happen until later this summer although we would
expect front-month WTI (U.S. crude futures) to price above
longer-dated contracts earlier and for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A steep drop in oil demand during the financial crisis
depressed the price of crude oil regardless of delivery date,
but future contracts for delivery far in the future held up
better as traders predicted an eventual recovery in demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the peak of the crisis, the price of U.S. crude (WTI) for
delivery in two months was as much as 20 percent above the
front-month contract, as oil inventories started to mount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As inventories decline and the benefits to physical oil
producers, consumers, and refiners of having oil inventories
on-hand begin to outweigh their costs of storing it, they will
increasingly be willing to pay to hold inventories," Goldman
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Refiners in the United States often need more oil in the
summer months as the peak demand driving season gets into full
swing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs forecasts oil prices will be between $92 and
$97 a barrel in 3-6 months time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude oil for delivery in April was trading around
$82.70 a barrel on Friday. The contract for May delivery was
just 30 cents more expensive. Contracts for delivery in a year's
time traded around $85.50 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said any move into backwardation this summer would
likely be short-lived, as members of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries would likely take the opportunity
to increase production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we expect the market to return to a more
persistent backwardation in 2011, as OPEC spare capacity is
absorbed by the market as world oil demand continues to grow
with the strengthening economic recovery," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The International Energy Agency (IEA) revised its forecast
for oil demand growth in 2010 up slightly on Friday to 1.57
million barrels per day (bpd). World demand is expected to
average 86.57 million bpd. [IEA/M]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil stocks in industrialised countries that are members of
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
rose to 59.2 days of forward demand at the end of January from
58.3 days at the end of December, the IEA said in its latest
report.

&lt;p&gt;NUEVA YORK--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) obtuvo resultados l&#237;deres en la industria en
el a&#241;o 2009 durante un escenario vol&#225;til y desafiante para la industria, y se
encuentra bien posicionada para un futuro crecimiento a trav&#233;s de una serie de
condiciones de mercado, seg&#250;n anunci&#243; hoy la empresa en el marco de su
presentaci&#243;n anual para analistas de inversiones, en la Bolsa de Valores de
Nueva York. 

"Cada uno de nuestros tres segmentos de negocios, generaci&#243;n de energ&#237;a,
distribuci&#243;n de energ&#237;a y productos qu&#237;micos, vencieron a nuestros
competidores", expres&#243; Rex W. Tillerson, presidente y director ejecutivo. 

"Administramos cada una de nuestras l&#237;neas de negocios a largo plazo. Un enfoque
disciplinado de las inversiones a trav&#233;s del ciclo comercial ha forjado una
larga trayectoria de gesti&#243;n responsable del dinero de nuestros accionistas". 

En 2009, ExxonMobil inform&#243; ganancias de 19.300 millones de d&#243;lares
estadounidenses y gener&#243; un flujo de dinero de 28.400 millones de d&#243;lares
estadounidenses. Esto le brind&#243; a la empresa una importante flexibilidad para
financiar planes comerciales y generar s&#243;lidas ganancias para los accionistas a
trav&#233;s de su dividendo anual, que aument&#243; un 57% durante los &#250;ltimos cinco a&#241;os,
y un programa de compra de acciones que aument&#243; la propiedad por acci&#243;n en un
26% durante el mismo per&#237;odo. 

El retorno sobre el capital invertido de ExxonMobil, un indicador clave de la
toma de decisiones informadas y el rendimiento financiero, fue del 16,3%, m&#225;s
del 50% superior al de su competidor m&#225;s cercano. 

Tillerson afirm&#243; que ExxonMobil se encuentra bien posicionada para un futuro
crecimiento. 

"Nuestra cartera de oportunidades es pr&#243;spera y variada en t&#233;rminos geogr&#225;ficos,
nuestra organizaci&#243;n funcional a nivel global mantiene una ventaja competitiva,
estamos firmes en nuestro enfoque disciplinado hacia nuestro negocio, y el
liderazgo tecnol&#243;gico contin&#250;a siendo la caracter&#237;stica que nos define", agreg&#243;.


"Nuestra flexibilidad financiera nos acerca muchas oportunidades futuras
excelentes y no perderemos nuestra atenci&#243;n en maximizar el valor de los
accionistas a largo plazo. Gracias a estas caracter&#237;sticas y al extraordinario
talento de nuestros empleados, ExxonMobil ocupa una posici&#243;n &#250;nica para el
futuro". 

Tillerson expres&#243; que los planes de inversi&#243;n de capital de ExxonMobil se
mantienen intactos tras la recesi&#243;n mundial actual. 

"Estamos ejecutando una extensa lista de proyectos y muchos otros est&#225;n en v&#237;as
de desarrollo. La inversi&#243;n real en un a&#241;o determinado variar&#225; seg&#250;n el ritmo y
el progreso de cada proyecto. No obstante, anticipamos un proyecto de inversi&#243;n
de aproximadamente 28.000 millones de d&#243;lares estadounidenses para el a&#241;o 2010,
y un margen promedio que oscila entre los 25.000 millones y los 30.000 millones
de d&#243;lares estadounidenses por a&#241;o hacia el a&#241;o 2014". 

La empresa resumi&#243; sus logros m&#225;s importantes en el a&#241;o 2009 y sus planes para
el futuro. Los puntos destacados incluyen:

* ExxonMobil reemplaz&#243; m&#225;s del 133% de su producci&#243;n de 2009 con incrementos de
reservas probadas que alcanzan los 2.000 millones de barriles de equivalente en
petr&#243;leo, sobre la base de precios a largo plazo, que la empresa utiliza para
tomar decisiones de inversi&#243;n. Por decimosexto a&#241;o consecutivo, la empresa
reemplaz&#243; m&#225;s del 100% de su producci&#243;n. 
* La empresa agreg&#243; un equivalente a 3.900 millones de barriles de petr&#243;leo a su
base de recursos a trav&#233;s de incorporaciones graduales, adquisiciones de
recursos y revisiones de los campos existentes. Del incremento de 3.900 millones
de barriles en equivalente en petr&#243;leo a la base de recursos, 2.100 millones de
barriles fueron incorporados de manera gradual, como resultado de perforaciones
de exploraci&#243;n que llevaron al descubrimiento de nuevos recursos. La empresa
obtuvo un &#237;ndice de &#233;xito del 64% de los 45 pozos de perforaci&#243;n experimental
perforados durante el a&#241;o, y ha incrementado su superficie potencial de
exploraci&#243;n neta en un 17%, hasta alcanzar las 29 millones de hect&#225;reas durante
los &#250;ltimos cinco a&#241;os. Para los planes de exploraci&#243;n de 2010 y 2011 se
evaluar&#225;n proyectos en el mar, en el sureste de Asia, el Mar Negro, la costa
este de Canad&#225;, el Golfo de M&#233;xico de los Estados Unidos, Libia, Brasil y
Australia, y tambi&#233;n proyectos potenciales de gas no convencional en tierra en
Norteam&#233;rica, Europa e Indonesia. 
* Durante 2009 comenzaron las operaciones de ocho proyectos de gran envergadura
que se proyecta que proporcionar&#225;n un incremento de un equivalente de 400.000
barriles netos por d&#237;a a la producci&#243;n de ExxonMobil en 2010. Entre 2010 y 2012,
se espera que 12 proyectos importantes adicionales comiencen sus actividades de
producci&#243;n. Junto con otros proyectos, ExxonMobil espera que su participaci&#243;n de
la producci&#243;n proveniente de nuevos proyectos aumente en 1,5 millones de
barriles de equivalente en petr&#243;leo por d&#237;a para el a&#241;o 2015. La cartera de
proyectos de gran envergadura de la empresa contiene m&#225;s de 130 proyectos de gas
y petr&#243;leo que incluyen todo tipo de recursos y regiones del mundo. La
participaci&#243;n neta de ExxonMobil de los recursos representados por esos
proyectos es el equivalente a 24.000 millones de barriles de petr&#243;leo. 
* En cuanto a la generaci&#243;n de energ&#237;a, la empresa contin&#250;a desarrollando planes
en dos refiner&#237;as en los Estados Unidos y una en Europa, para invertir m&#225;s de
1.000 millones de d&#243;lares estadounidenses e incrementar el suministro de di&#233;sel
con menor contenido de azufre. Una vez que estos proyectos concluyan a finales
de este a&#241;o, se espera que el incremento en la producci&#243;n de di&#233;sel con menor
contenido de azufre alcance aproximadamente los 23 millones de litros (6
millones de galones) por d&#237;a. 
* En 2009, se logr&#243; la exitosa puesta en marcha del primer complejo integrado de
refiner&#237;a y petroqu&#237;mica de China con participaci&#243;n extranjera. ExxonMobil y sus
socios en la instalaci&#243;n de Fujian invirtieron m&#225;s de 4.500 millones de d&#243;lares
estadounidenses en el complejo, lo que triplic&#243; la capacidad de la refiner&#237;a
existente a 240.000 barriles por d&#237;a para la producci&#243;n de combustibles de
transporte y otros productos refinados. El proyecto tambi&#233;n incorpor&#243; un nuevo
complejo petroqu&#237;mico. 
* Tambi&#233;n en 2009, se habilitaron 375 megavatios de capacidad de cogeneraci&#243;n,
como reflejo de las nuevas instalaciones en el complejo de Fujian y la refiner&#237;a
de ExxonMobil en Amberes, B&#233;lgica. La cogeneraci&#243;n es la producci&#243;n simult&#225;nea
de electricidad y calor &#250;til o vapor que se utiliza en procesos industriales, lo
que permite reducir los costos operativos y disminuir las emisiones de gas de
efecto invernadero. 
* A pesar de las condiciones econ&#243;micas desfavorables, la empresa qu&#237;mica
ExxonMobil obtuvo un 13,9% de ganancias en 2009, y super&#243; a las divisiones
qu&#237;micas de otras empresas petroleras internacionales y competidores clave. El
negocio qu&#237;mico contin&#250;a ofreciendo atractivas oportunidades de crecimiento, con
el apoyo de una inversi&#243;n de 3.100 millones de d&#243;lares estadounidenses en 2009,
el mayor nivel de inversiones en m&#225;s de 10 a&#241;os. 
* En 2010, ExxonMobil continuar&#225; desarrollando su programa de biocombustibles y
su alianza con Synthetic Genomics Inc., una empresa de biotecnolog&#237;a l&#237;der, para
la investigaci&#243;n y el desarrollo de biocombustibles de &#250;ltima generaci&#243;n a
partir de algas fotosint&#233;ticas.

Este es el octavo a&#241;o que ExxonMobil realiza una presentaci&#243;n anual para
analistas de la Bolsa de Valores de Nueva York.

&lt;p&gt;March 12 (Reuters) - Societe Generale began coverage of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) with a "buy" rating, and said
the company was leaving the downturn with strengthened market
positions across most of its businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman is well positioned to outperform its peers due to
its pre-eminent investment banking franchise and by leveraging
its strong positions across equity-related businesses with
increased risk taking, the brokerage said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Societe Generale said better-than-expected resilience in
Goldman's fixed income, currency and commodities segment, and
increasing MA activity, could be catalysts for the company's
share price, and set a $190 price target on Goldman's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also initiated coverage of Morgan Stanley

the firm still had to work through the rebuild of its trading

significant step to re-shape its business model with the Smith
Barney deal, providing greater exposure to retail/equity

Two Phase 3 Trials Of Sunitinib With Commonly Used Chemotherapies In Advanced Breast Cancer Did Not Meet The Primary Endpoint</headline><body>

Detailed Results to be Presented at Future Medical Meeting
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc. announced today that two Phase 3 studies of Sutent (sunitinib
malate) in advanced breast cancer did not meet their primary endpoints. The SUN
1064 Phase 3 study of sunitinib in combination with docetaxel for the first-line
treatment of patients with advanced HER-2 negative breast cancer did not show a
statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with
docetaxel alone. In addition, the SUN 1099 Phase 3 study of sunitinib plus
capecitabine, in previously-treated advanced breast cancer patients, did not
show a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival
compared with capecitabine alone. 

"Sunitinib has been thoroughly evaluated in advanced HER-2 negative breast
cancer, and while we are disappointed in the results, these trials have helped
us define the limits and opportunities for the compound and better understand
the complex biology of this disease," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice
president of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology
Business Unit. "Pfizer Oncology is committed to the rigorous evaluation of
investigational therapies in breast cancer, which despite recent advancements,
continues to claim far too many lives each year." 

There were more adverse events, including serious adverse events, in the
investigational arm than in the comparator arm of each study. A continuing
analysis of efficacy and safety data will be completed and presented at a
medical meeting in the near future. 

Sutent is currently approved for both gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)
after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate, and advanced /
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on efficacy and safety data from
large, randomized Phase 3 clinical trials. Sutent has played a significant role
in advancing the treatment landscape and remains standard of care in its
approved indications. To date, more than 82,000 patients globally have been
treated with sunitinib in the clinical setting and in trials across multiple
tumors. 

Pfizer remains committed to the development program for sunitinib and is
continuing to study its potential role in the treatment of other solid tumors
including advanced non-small cell lung cancer, advanced castration-resistant
prostate cancer, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and as adjuvant therapy for
renal cell carcinoma, in Phase 3 trials. 

Pfizer Oncology is dedicated to further understanding and developing agents to
better match specific patients with treatments and increase benefits from
selected therapies. 

About Advanced Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related
death among women globally. Compared to early stage breast cancer, effective
therapy for advanced breast cancer, which includes inoperable locally advanced
and metastatic disease, remains a clinical challenge in the oncology community.
Additional treatment options are desperately needed to address this continuing
unmet medical need. 

About Sutent () (sunitinib malate)

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of GIST
after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced /
metastatic RCC. 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important SUTENT targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent () (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of childbearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in GIST and RCC clinical trials were fatigue,
asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal
pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration,
altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

Findings will Contribute to Understanding and Future Study of Figitumumab
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc. announced today the discontinuation of A4021018 (also known as
ADVIGO 1018), a Phase 3 trial examining the effects of investigational compound
figitumumab (CP-751,871) in combination with erlotinib as a second/third-line
treatment in patients with previously treated advanced non-adenocarcinoma
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An independent Data Safety Monitoring
Committee (DSMC) recommended A4021018 be stopped after concluding that the
addition of figitumumab to erlotinib is unlikely to demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall survival compared to
erlotinib alone in the study population. 

"This outcome is disappointing to us and to patients with NSCLC. Pfizer is
working to thoroughly analyze all available data from the figitumumab program to
better understand the compound and the IGF-1R (insulin growth factor-1 receptor)
pathway," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical
development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. "As a
pioneer in the IGF-1R field, we are committed to a thorough evaluation of
figitumumab. We will carefully review our extensive clinical database and use
this information to refine the figitumumab clinical program with the goal of
identifying the right patient population in which to evaluate this compound." 

The Company has notified A4021018 clinical investigators and has initiated the
notification procedure for all involved regulatory agencies of the
discontinuation of A4021018. Investigators have been instructed to work with all
of their patients in the A4021018 study on an individual basis to determine an
appropriate course of action. 

In December 2009, Pfizer announced the stop of A4021016 (ADVIGO 1016), a Phase 3
study examining the effects of figitumumab as first-line treatment in patients
with advanced non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC, after an analysis by the DSMC showed
that addition of figitumumab to carboplatin plus paclitaxel would be unlikely to
meet the primary endpoint of improved overall survival compared to paclitaxel
plus carboplatin alone. 

Pfizer is continuing to study figitumumab in clinical trials for the potential
treatment of prostate, breast and lung cancers, and Ewing`s sarcoma. 

About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. NSCLC accounts for about 85
percent of lung cancer cases and 25 to 30 percent are of squamous histology.
Nearly 60 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with Stage IIIB/IV
advanced disease. Despite recent advances, NSCLC remains difficult to treat,
particularly in the metastatic setting. 

About Figitumumab (CP-751,871)

Figitumumab, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly
specific inhibitor of the insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway. The
IGF-1R pathway is thought to be one of the fundamental signaling pathways that
leads to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor cells, and may represent a
resistance mechanism against EGFR inhibitors and other anti-cancer therapies.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday said it is testing a patch for a critical vulnerability in Internet Explorer (IE), but stopped short of promising to deliver an emergency fix before the next scheduled Patch Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have seen speculation that Microsoft might release an update for this issue out-of-band," said Jerry Bryant, a senior manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), referring to the term the company uses for a rush fix. "I can tell you that we are working hard to produce an update which is now in testing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft first warned users of the vulnerability in IE6 and IE7 last Tuesday when it said hackers were exploiting the bug. The next day, Israeli security researcher Moshe Ben Abu grabbed the attack code from a site that had been using it to conduct "drive-by" attacks, then crafted a public exploit , which he published to the popular Metasploit penetration testing framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before Abu posted his exploit, security experts had said they expected Microsoft to ship an out-of-band update if attack code went public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant, however, did not commit Microsoft to an emergency patch, saying only, "We never rule out the possibility of an out-of-band update," in an entry on the MSRC blog Friday. Testing, he added, was a "critical and time intensive" part of the process because Microsoft had to confirm the update worked with all versions of both IE and Windows. Only IE6 and IE7 harbor the bug; the oldest and the newest editions, IE 5.01 and IE8 respectively, do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also yesterday, Microsoft offered an automated "Fix it" tool to disable the component in the "iepeers.dll" file that contains the vulnerability . The free tool works on machines powered by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. That workaround was an addition to those that Microsoft recommended last Tuesday, which included disabling scripting, enabling DEP (data execution prevention) and upgrading to IE8 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival browsers, including Mozilla's Firefox, Google 's Chrome and Opera Software's Opera, are also safe from the in-the-wild attacks aimed at IE6 and IE7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest zero-day is the second this year that Microsoft has admitted hackers have exploited before a patch was ready. In mid-January, Microsoft said that a flaw in IE had been used to attack several companies' networks , including Google's and Adobe's. Microsoft patched the vulnerability on Jan. 21 in an out-of-band update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's next scheduled Patch Tuesday is April 13, more than four weeks away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - JP Morgan (JPM.N) Asset Management has invested almost a quarter of its $860 million Asian infrastructure fund in China and India assets, as part of efforts to complete investments in the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Asian Infrastructure  Related Resources Opportunity Fund invested in cement and water treatment companies in China and a hospital in India over a month after the fund was closed, said Philip Jackson, chief of JP Morgan's Asia infrastructure investments group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ten or 15 years ago, Asia was an optional, alternative investment as a geography. The teenager has come of age and I find it hard to believe that any global investor could really not have Asian investment as a core part of their holdings," Jackson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly we anticipate China and India will be the two largest markets, but frankly we are anticipating we could be investing equally easily in Korea or in Southeast Asia," he told Reuters in an interview late on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heady economic growth in China and India has enticed investors to tap the potentially lucrative emerging economies whose populations make up a third of the world's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson said the rationale behind investing in Scitus Cement in China's southwestern province of Guizhou was that the region needed huge resources such as cement to build up its infrastructure network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Guizhou) is about the size of California. It is very mountainous and it needs a lot of infrastructure. And the infrastructure is not going to be built if the cement isn't available," said Jackson, who has been living in Asia since 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund also invested in a water treatment company that operates in China's southern boomtown of Shenzhen called Goldtrust Water, and India's SevenHills Hospital, which is expanding in Mumbai, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan Asset Management, which has global assets of around $43 billion in the real estate and infrastructure sectors, has been actively scouting for assets in Asia, where economies are growing solidly compared to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the infrastructure fund, the management arm has a $350-million Indian property fund and another in greater China that raised $600 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure has become a distinct asset class over the past few years, with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi (C.N), Macquarie (MQG.AX) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) sponsoring funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jonathan Hopfner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebration Marks Debut of Academy Award-Nominated "The Princess and the Frog"
on Disney Blu-Ray Plus the First Product Line Featuring Tiana in Multi-Disney
Princess Merchandise


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
She sang "Almost There" in the hit holiday film The Princess and the Frog - but
today, Princess Tiana has officially arrived - and she`s here to stay. At a
star-studded event highlighted by a rare gathering of all eight Disney Princess
characters, Princess Tiana was warmly and regally welcomed as the ninth member
of the beloved Disney Princess Royal Court today during a magical crowning
ceremony at the historic New York Palace in Manhattan. 

(Editors' note: Event images available at
http://dcp.smugmug.com/Events/Princess-Coronation/11490709_o4Cfbno log-in
required)

As Disney`s newest Disney Princess character, Tiana will forever be celebrated
and recognized as a Disney Princess across all divisions of The Walt Disney
Company and will be included in all Disney Princess merchandise programs
featuring multiple Disney Princess characters starting this July. The event also
celebrated the arrival of the Academy Award-nominated The Princess and the Frog
on Disney Blu-Ray, which releases March 16. Disney Princess licensees Mattel and
CDI, a division of JAKKS Pacific, co-sponsored the event and showcased the
latest Disney Princess and The Princess and the Frog toy and role play lines.
Since the beginning of this year, more than a quarter of a million toys
featuring Princess Tiana have already flown off shelves. 

With celebrities and their daughters in attendance including Tina Fey, Audra
McDonald, Kelly Rutherford, Melissa Joan Hart, Nigel Barker, Alessandra
Ambrosio, Matt Walton and Amy Landecker, among others, Princess Tiana made her
entry in grand style as she exited a horse-drawn carriage on Madison Avenue
surrounded by an entourage of adorable little princesses donning their gorgeous
princess gowns and walked the red carpet through the New York Palace`s famed
15th Century-inspired courtyard as fanfare trumpeters lined the processional
aisle and created a canopy for her entrance. Once Tiana reached the ceremony
stage, a royal proclamation was read and Prince Naveen crowned the ninth
enchanting Disney Princess as her sisters in royalty - Ariel, Aurora (Sleeping
Beauty), Belle, Cinderella, Jasmine, Mulan, Pocahontas and Snow White - looked
on. 

"We`re thrilled to recognize Princess Tiana and officially announce that she is
here to stay as a full-fledged Disney Princess," said Sheila Ullery, vice
president of girls franchise development for Disney Consumer Products. "Little
girls quickly embraced her independent, strong-willed character and the rich
storyline of The Princess and the Frog. We`ll continue to showcase Princess
Tiana in stand-alone and multi-princess merchandise, including apparel,
accessories, costumes, toys, stationery, food, beauty products and home
entertainment." 

Releasing March 16, 2010 on Disney Blu-Ray Combo Pack and DVD, The Princess and
the Frog will bring families much fun and excitement with an array of bonus
features and an incredible high-definition viewing experience. Bonus features
include deleted scenes, inside access to the animation studios and filmmakers,
family activities and much more. The Princess and the Frog Blu-ray Combo Pack
includes a Blu-ray, DVD and DisneyFile Digital Copy of the movie all in one
package. Combo Packs provide unprecedented value, quality, and versatility with
the exceptional picture and sound of Blu-ray and the extended utility of DVD and
digital copy of the film in a single package. 

The Princess and the Frog product line triumphed at retail last fall, proving
that Princess Tiana is here to stay. Among key highlights are: The Princess
Tiana Sparkle Doll and the new Transforming Tiana Doll, both from Mattel, have
been particularly popular, delivering strong sales. Princess Tiana role play
dresses from CDI have been the top selling dresses in the Disney Princess lineup
at retailers nationwide. Carol`s Daughter beauty products featuring Princess
Tiana sold out in just two hours online. The Princess and the Frog Kellogg`s
fruit snacks have been one of the most popular choices in the snack aisle. Since
the domestic theatrical film release, more than 2.5 million books featuring
Princess Tiana have sold globally. And this month, Disney Stores sold out of its
limited edition Princess Tiana collector doll during the pre-sell period. 

Beginning this spring and through the holiday season, Disney Princess licensees
Mattel and CDI will release a new assortment of stand-alone and multi-Disney
Princess products featuring Princess Tiana. Exciting new toys and playthings
featuring Princess Tiana include her addition to Mattel`s Disney Princess
Sparkling Princess Doll Assortment line (SRP $9.99) and Disney`sThe Princess and
the Frog Princess-to-Frog Tiana Doll (SRP $24.99) where Princess Tiana
transforms from princess to frog and back again. 

New home decor, apparel and accessories, stationery and personal care items
featuring Princess Tiana alongside other Disney Princess characters will be
available for the first time beginning in July. Disney Store retail locations
nationwide and DisneyStore.com will also release an exclusive assortment of new
Princess Tiana products throughout the year. 

With Academy Award nominations for Best Animated Feature and Best Song ("Almost
There" and "Down in New Orleans," both by Randy Newman), The Princess and the
Frog and Princess Tiana are sure to remain in the hearts of Disney fans of all
ages for generations to come.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft at its Mix10 conference on Monday showed off application capabilities for its Windows Phone 7 Series platform and offered a release candidate for its upcoming Silverlight 4 rich Internet application plug-in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 7 Series leverages Silverlight and the XNA gaming platform for application development. Visual Studio and Microsoft Expression Blend are positioned, respectively, as development and design tools for the phone OS, which features graphical capabilities akin to the Apple iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Earlier today, InfoWorld reported Microsoft's  plans to offer analytics support for Silverlight. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm pleased to announce that the Windows Phone 7 developer tools are now available for anyone to download on the Web," said Scott Guthrie, corporate vice president for the .Net developer platform at Microsoft. Windows Phone 7 Series was unveiled last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available at Microsoft's Windows Phone Web page,&#160;tools are being offered as a preview and include Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone, Windows 7 Series Add-in for Visual Studio, Windows Phone 7 Series emulator and XNA Game Studio 4.0. Microsoft is making available a community technology preview of Expression Blend 4 for Windows Phone at the same Web site. The tool provides a streamlined development workflow for the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morning presentation at the Las Vegas conference featured demonstrations of a variety of graphical applications for Windows Phone, including push notifications for the phone and an application from Seesmic that unites social networks, such as Facebook, on the phone via plugins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's great for us here is that the code that we use here [on the phone], the majority is the same as for Windows desktop," said Loic Le Muir, Seesmic founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone can incorporate Web applications and data onto a phone, said Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president of Windows Phone at Microsoft. He showed applications including a phone-based diary that can include both text and photos on a Windows Phone device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the phone features squares, or tiles, to customize the phone experience. Tiles can take care of such tasks as listing contacts or messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company Monday also said developers will be able to bring applications and games to market via Windows Phone Marketplace. Among the companies building applications for Windows Phone 7 Series are Associated Price, Citrix Systems, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverlight 4, which is to be generally available next month, offers capabilities such as microphone and multi-screen support as well as offline digital rights management. Also, a pivot capability, for visualizing large sets of data, will be available as a control for embedding in Silverlight 4 applications. The release candidate is available on the Silverlight Web page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-screen capabilities make Silverlight 4 "the first and only Web technology that allows you do that," Guthrie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Silverlight delivers the highest-quality video on the Web," Guthrie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mix10 on Tuesday will feature details on the planned Internet Explorer 9 browser, ASP.Net and services-based Web development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft touts Windows Phone 7 Series and Silverlight 4," was originally published  at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft at its Mix10 conference on Monday will introduce a framework enabling Web analytics to be performed for Siliverlight rich media applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open source Microsoft Silverlight Analytics Framework will debut in a beta form at the conference in Las Vegas, said Michael Scherotter, Microsoft media experience evangelist. The framework, which will be released on the company's CodePlex site for open source projects, will work with third-party analytics services from companies such as Preemptive Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Last month, InfoWorld reported on&#160;Microsoft's release candidate for Visual Studio 2010. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[The idea] is to enable rich analytics like you have on the Web in Silverlight applications," Scherotter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The importance is to understand how people are using your application," via analytics, said Scherotter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the framework, which calls natively to Web services exposed by different analytics vendors, applications can track details about how applications are being used, providing details on such factors as usability and video quality. Also, details can be furnished, such as when volume is decreased in a video, when a video is paused, and even when there are buffer issues. The framework lets designers using the Microsoft Expression Blend tool track application events, via a visual mechanism. Additionally, the framework can work offline and resynchronize with analytics services later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the framework, Microsoft's Visual Studio 2010 IDE next month will feature Runtime Intelligence Services from Preemptive Solutions, technology enabling developers to track application analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea is to be able to track functionality, you don't have to write any code. You just merely select the things you want to track," said Gabriel Torok, president of Preemptive. Runtime Intelligence Services is based on the company's Dotfuscator product for protecting, measuring and managing applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other partners also will be working with Microsoft on the analytics effort; they will be revealed at Mix10, Scherotter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at Mix10, Microsoft will talk about the planned release of Silverlight 4, which adds printing support and the ability to connect to webcams and microphones. A trusted security capability is offered for accessing videos and pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also will talk about developer technologies for the Windows Phone 7 series of planned phones. The phones will leverage Silverlight as a development platform, Scherotter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft to offer Web analytics for Silverlight," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging New Open-Source Framework and Runtime Intelligence, Designers and
Developers Can Now Capture Both User and Application Behaviors on - and Beyond -
the Client
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
PreEmptive Solutions, a leading provider of solutions to protect, measure, and
manage application investments, announced today the immediate availability of
the Runtime Intelligence Analytics Provider, giving designers and developers the
ability to integrate Runtime Intelligence into Microsoft Silverlight
applications through the new Silverlight Analytics Framework. 

"We offer Silverlight instrumentation for developers through the post-compile
injection capabilities of Dotfuscator," said Sebastian Holst, CMO PreEmptive
Solutions. "Now, thanks to the Silverlight Analytics Framework, we can, for the
first time, extend our analytics services to both designers and developers
through Microsoft Expression Blend." 

The Silverlight Analytics Framework is a new open-source framework to allow
designers and developers to integrate Web analytics into Silverlight
applications in a consistent manner. Because the framework is enabled as a set
of behaviors in Expression Blend, designers and developers can visually
instrument their designs and configure A/B testing rapidly without writing any
code. 

"I already considered PreEmptive Solutions` Runtime Intelligence to be a
critical tool in my Silverlight toolbox," said David Kelly, Principal User
eXperience Architect, Wirestone, and Silverlight MVP. "Extending its reach
beyond the developer and to surface it inside Expression Blend should make
Runtime Intelligence that much more relevant to anyone who cares about Business
Intelligence usage of their applications." 

PreEmptive Solutions` Runtime Intelligence offers the following advantages over
traditional Web analytics services:

* The analytics endpoint (and the resulting data) can be self-hosted and managed
by the application provider. 
* While the resulting Web analytics maps to the Microsoft Silverlight Analytics
Framework data model, the underlying SOAP schema is shared with Dotfuscator`s
instrumentation included with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

The common schema allows Dotfuscator to provide a complementary instrumentation
method for any .NET Framework component.

* Middle and back-office application tiers can be instrumented providing a
deeper view across distributed application workflows. 
* Components running on Azure can also be instrumented and measured and
synchronized with the Silverlight user experience.

"PreEmptive Solutions has successfully used the Silverlight Analytics Framework
to open its application instrumentation and performance monitoring to a new
audience of designers using Microsoft Expression Blend," said Michael S.
Scherotter, principal architect evangelist at Microsoft Corp. and architect of
the analytics framework. 

About PreEmptive Solutions

PreEmptive Solutions produces the Dotfuscator and DashO application protection,
monitoring and management product families and the Runtime Intelligence Service.
With more than 4,000 corporate clients, 40,000 registered installations in 100+
countries and inclusion with Microsoft`s 6,000,000+ Visual Studio seats,

1CLICK offers a single point of access to the range of Goldman Sachs strategies
to meet the unique trading objectives of clients. 1CLICK launches orders into
the marketplace after the user selects a preferred trading strategy, ranging
from "ultra passive" to "super aggressive." 

"The complexity of our algorithmic offering has evolved significantly since the
initial release of our VWAP and percent-of-volume algorithms in 2002," noted
Greg Tusar, Managing Director and co-head of GSET. "Clients continue to seek
increasingly sophisticated strategies and intelligent liquidity-seeking
behavior. However, traders are also demanding simpler workflows with intuitive
and consistent order entry. 1CLICK is our response to this." 

The launch of 1CLICK headlines a global initiative to streamline Goldman Sachs`
electronic offering. Clients utilizing strategies across Asia, Europe, and the
Americas will benefit from a consistent set of order parameters and interface.
Customers are able to access Goldman Sachs algorithms through all major
channels, including third-party order and execution management systems as well
as REDIPlus, GSET`s execution management system. 

According to Tusar, "A broad and flexible algorithmic offering is
critical-however we`ve found that many clients struggle to manage multiple
parameters and strategies across multiple products, markets and brokers. The
streamlined Goldman Sachs algorithmic suite, combined with 1CLICK and a new,
globally consistent naming convention, minimizes the complexity of order
placement while still offering customization of the underlying strategies. In
addition to offering global equity algorithmic strategies, customers can utilize
Goldman Sachs algorithms for options and futures products.

&lt;p&gt;  BELLEVUE, NE, Mar 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Tigerpaw Software, Inc., developer of the most comprehensive business
building software for technology providers, announced today the release
of Journal Connect for Outlook. Integrating Microsoft Outlook email into
a client's historical notes in Tigerpaw enables customers to store and
view a rich history of Outlook email correspondence for clients and
prospects.

integrates contact management, sales/marketing automation, service
management, purchasing, and inventory control. A complete CRM contact
management system provides account management, scheduling, customer
history and notes, and management of tasks with Outlook synchronization. 

    As emails come into Microsoft Outlook, Tigerpaw's Journal Connect for
Outlook searches for the email address in Tigerpaw and matches it to the
appropriate account, automatically adding the email body and its contents
to the journal notes in Tigerpaw. The same process occurs when you send
emails out of Outlook, so that all email correspondence ends up in the
journal notes making it easy to track client and prospect correspondence
forever -- regardless of what is done with the original emails.

    "IT, telecom, and other technology product and service providers
routinely have to check multiple sources for information in order to
provide a high level of customer support," said James Foxall, senior vice
president of Tigerpaw Software. "This is yet another great outcome of our

&lt;p&gt;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Mar 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRSN), the trusted provider of Internet
infrastructure for the networked world, has been selected by Microsoft
Corp. to provide code signing services for applications distributed
through Windows Marketplace for Mobile. 

    Microsoft is relying on VeriSign(R) Code Signing Services to safeguard
applications developed for Windows(R) phones. When a mobile application
is signed with a VeriSign(R) Code Signing Certificate, it signals to
Windows phone owners that the application comes from a trusted publisher.
A code signing certificate serves as virtual "shrink wrap" for downloaded
applications by applying a digital signature that is independently
verified by VeriSign. A broken digital signature tells users that the
application has been tampered with or modified, and protects them from
hackers or malicious code.

    "Code signing follows the best practices of software development, and
helps to ensure that all Windows phone applications will install and run
with the right privileges -- and without limiting features or
functionality," said Jason Lim, director of ISV and developer experience
at Microsoft. "We protect applications with VeriSign Code Signing
Certificates because only VeriSign offers the robustness and scale that a
fast-growing applications store demands. This world-class, customizable
code signing solution protects our investment in Windows Marketplace for
Mobile, and gives us more ways to control the integrity and quality of
the Windows phone experience." 

    Windows Marketplace offers people an easy way to find and purchase
high-quality mobile applications for both work and play, while creating a
new opportunity for developers to reach millions of people using Windows
phones worldwide. In addition to an array of essential business
applications, Windows phone owners can download applications for
Facebook, MySpace, Netflix, Twikini, WunderRadio and ZAGAT, as well as
leading game titles including Sudoku, "Guitar Hero World Tour" and the
"PAC-MAN" series, all of which can be easily purchased and installed
directly on a Windows phone. All purchased applications are certified by
Microsoft to run on Windows phones and are backed by a simple return
policy. 

    "Mobile apps call for the same kind of protections that PC applications
have relied on for years, and that's what VeriSign Code Signing
Certificates offer to Windows phone app developers," said Michael Lin,
vice president and general manager of SSL at VeriSign. "We're delighted
to serve as the code signing partner for Windows Marketplace for Mobile.
Microsoft and the Windows phone development community can be assured that
as the marketplace grows, VeriSign's code signing platform will scale
with it, providing the same reliable safeguards down the road as it does
with every download today."

    VeriSign's role as code signing partner for Windows phone applications is
the latest in a long history of collaboration with Microsoft. The
companies recently announced plans for Microsoft to use proven
VeriSign(R) Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificates and VeriSign(R) Code
Signing Certificates to safeguard cloud-based services and applications
developed and deployed on the Windows(R) Azure(TM) platform.

infrastructure services for the networked world. Billions of times each

financial close process," said Theresa Clark, Trintech's Vice President of
Finance Transformation and one of the principle authors of the paper. "But in
many cases, the close is a managed crisis at best. People can only do so much,
but automation enables financial teams to take command of the entire financial
process instead of simply managing to controls."

Webinar registrants will learn how systematic automation can enable a strategic
"command and control" approach to the entire financial close process, reducing
risk and effort while increasing transparency and compliance.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Pacific Drilling today announced it has entered into a Letter of Intent with
Chevron USA, Inc. for the ultra-deepwater drillship "Pacific Santa Ana" to
operate in the Gulf of Mexico. 

The "Pacific Santa Ana" drillship will provide Chevron and Pacific Drilling the
opportunity to develop and deploy Dual Gradient Drilling technology during its
activities in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 

Pacific Santa Ana, under construction in South Korea, represents the height of
current drilling technology, with capabilities to operate in up to 12,000 feet
water depth and drill to over 35,000 feet well depth. 

Pacific Drilling Limited is a privately owned, ultra-deepwater drillship
operator, which has an interest in six ultra-deepwater drillships. The first two
vessels, which have been delivered and are under contract, are held in a 50% JV.
The remaining four are expected to be delivered between September 2010 and July
2011 and will be wholly owned and operated. Additional information can be found
at www.pacificdrilling.com.

&lt;p&gt; * CNOOC hires JPMorgan as advisor on joint venture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Beijing-based Hopu hired by Argentina's Bridas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Deal marks first advisory role for Hopu
 (Adds JPMorgan's comments, more details about Hopu)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By George Chen, Asia Private Equity Correspondent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI, March 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street bank JPMorgan
(JPM.N) and Beijing-based Hopu Investments, run by influential
China dealmaker Fang Fenglei, are advisers for a $3.1 billion
energy joint venture between CNOOC (0883.HK)(CEO.N) and
Argentina's Bridas Energy Holdings, banking sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has long-time business ties with China National
Offshore Oil Corp, China's biggest offshore oil explorer, while
the deal marks the first advisory role for Hopu, which usually
invests on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CNOOC hired JPMorgan as sole adviser on the buy side, while
Beijing-based Hopu was hired by Bridas as adviser for the sell
side, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan confirmed its advisory role in the deal, while Hopu
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sunday, CNOOC said it would pay $3.1 billion to take a 50
percent stake Bridas Energy subsidiary Bridas Corp. Bridas Corp,
wholly-owned by Bridas Energy, would become equally owned by the
partners, CNOOC said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. [ID:nTOE62D01I]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is an important transaction for CNOOC that has been
well-structured and executed," said Yash Kaman, head of Asia oil
and gas investment banking at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This will ensure CNOOC maximises the benefits of the
operational and regional expertise of Bridas management and the
Bulgheroni family, instead of starting from scratch," Kaman said
in an emailed statement in response to Reuters inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bridas has been built into the top performer in a region that
is relatively new for CNOOC. Rather than buying out Bridas, the
two companies are entering into a partnership in which Bridas'
management and the founding Bulgheroni family are equally
motivated to continue to drive value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOPU AIMING TO MOVE BEYOND PRIVATE EQUITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan advised on CNOOC's high-profile acquisition of
Unocal in 2005. The deal, which caught international public and
media attention, eventually failed after being blocked by a
political outcry from the United States. Despite the failure,
business ties between JPMorgan and CNOOC have since strengthened.
The New York-headquartered bank later helped CNOOC on its $2
billion share placement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal also reveals Hopu's ambition to expand into the
already competitive merger and acquisition advisory business in
China, as well as to continue to invest on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Apparently, Hopu wants to become something like Blackstone
(BX.N) in China. I am sure you will see Hopu take on more
advisory roles in major deals in the future," said a banker
familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is just a beginning for Hopu," he said, adding that the
fund itself would not invest in the CNOOC-Bridas tie-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fang, who helped Goldman Sachs (GS.N) launch its China
investment banking joint venture, established Beijing-based Hopu
Investments in 2007 and completed raising a $2.5 billion China
fund in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For related Asian private equity news, Reuters 3000 Xtra

&lt;p&gt;Potentially toughening the competitive landscape for its own Silverlight rich Internet application platform, Microsoft will expand support for the HTML5 specification in its Internet Explorer 9 browser, under a plan revealed Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an announcement at the Mix10 conference in Las Vegas, Microsoft unveiled the Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview, which features expanded support for the World Wide Web Consortium HTML5 specification as well as hardware-accelerated graphics and text and a new JavaScript engine, known as "chakra." These efforts will enable developers to use the same markup and deliver graphically and functionally rich Web applications, Microsoft said. The preview is available at Microsoft's IE test drive Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld's Paul Krill reported on the possibility that HTML5  could kill technologies like Flash and Silverlight. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTML 5 has the potential to bring standards-based multimedia capabilities to applications that rival what is possible now with proprietary plug-in software like Adobe Systems Flash and, yes, Silverlight. But Microsoft nonetheless appears gung-ho on HTML5, which has been in development for several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We love HTML5 so much we want it to actually work," said Dean Hachamovitch, general manager of Internet Explorer at Microsoft, during a keynote presentation. "In IE9, it will."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company officials even demonstrated support for HTML5 SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) in IE9. Previously, Microsoft has not backed the graphics standard. Additionally, an update planned for the IE9 platform preview will add support for HTML5 video capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we started looking deeply at HTML5, we saw that it enabled a whole new class of applications," Hachamovitch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE9 will run HTML5 better via GPU acceleration, Hachamovitch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But asked during a subsequent press conference whether HTML5 might take away business from the company's prized Silverlight technology, Hachamovitch said the two technologies were "quite complementary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think developers who want to use the exact same markup across multiple browsers, devices, and platforms today choose to use a plug-in," he said. "Over time, there may be more choices. But today, they're clearly complementary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An attendee lauded Microsoft's backing of HTML5 but still saw a role for Silverlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[HTML5] certainly gives you more options," said Joe Christopher, vice president of software development at HealthStream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still see a need for Silverlight [to provide] some of the richness of interacting with the server and data and things like that," Christopher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analyst also did not see HTML5 as presenting any imminent threat to Silverlight or Flash. "Really, HTML is powerful but Silverlight is quite a bit more powerful," said analyst Al Hilwa, of IDC. "The question is, how much can a developer do with HTML5 [and] will there always be a role for something more sophisticated to describe 3D graphics, that kind of stuff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTML5 still is in flux and it might be four or five years before it has stabilized; Silverlight and Flash are here today, Hilwa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is using the H.264 codec in its implementation of HTML5, which does not have a specified codec of its own, Hachamovitch noted. The company also is supporting other HTML5 specifications including CSS3 and XHTML parsing. Asked if Microsoft would support HTML5 Canvas tags in IE9, Hachamovitch said graphics supported in IE9 are GPU-powered and it remains to be seen what else might be supported in that vein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hachamovitch also urged upgrades from IE6. "The world has changed in so many ways since August 2001, when IE6 was first released," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're excited to get users off IE6 to Windows 7 and IE8 and then onto IE9," said Hachamovitch. Microsoft will continue to support IE6 with security updates, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Microsoft's older Windows XP OS would support IE9, Abramovitch seemed to frown on the notion. "Building [a] modern browser requires a modern operating system," he said. The successor Windows Vista and Windows 7 OSes offer capabilities in security, performance and graphics infrastructure not offered in previous OSes, said Hachamovitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not provide a date for the general release of IE9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at Mix10, the company said it plans to contribute to development of new features to the jQuery JavaScript library and made moves to back the Open Data Protocol, or OData, which enables access to cloud-based data for inclusion in applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With jQuery, the company will seek better interoperability between ASP.Net and jQuery and package the library with the upcoming Visual Studio 2010 IDE and ASP.Net MVC 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also released software development kits for OData as well as a second community technology preview of "Dallas," which is an information marketplace powered by the Windows Azure cloud platform. Content and data will be available with an OData feed via Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Doug Purdy, a software architect, stressed the company's commitment to OData via a number of means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the Open Data Protocol is really going to open up data for the open Web," enabling capabilities such as mashups, Purdy said.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is back in the browser race, an analyst said today after the company unveiled a rough developer's preview of its next browser, IE9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They want to be more than a follower or just on features parity," said Forrester analyst Sheri McLeish as she talked about what she saw as a recommitment to Internet Explorer (IE). "And they've created a whole new team for IE. Microsoft is clearly taking the browser seriously again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the newer faces on the IE team, said McLeish, is Ted Johnson, the co-founder of Visio Corp. and from January 2000 to March 2003, a corporate vice president at Microsoft . Johnson, who according to his LinkedIn account rejoined Microsoft in August 2008, now carries the title Partner PM Architect on IE, and is the senior architect responsible for the browser's graphics and rendering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has lined up some very experienced engineers" for the IE team, McLeish said. "It's really a crack team."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The renewed emphasis shows that Microsoft is taking its browser, and the competition in the browser market, seriously. "You want that real estate," McLeish said, adding that IE is important to Microsoft, something others have questioned. "It's important from a pure visibility and branding angle. The browser is the way to promote search, for Microsoft that means Bing, and of course Microsoft has an interest in creating the best experience it can within Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may not believe that only its engineers can create the best Windows browser, but it certainly thinks they're up to the task. As proof, McLeish noted the hardware acceleration Microsoft's touting for IE9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Dean Hachamovich, the general manager for IE development, spelled out IE9's performance enhancements during a 40-minute presentation at MIX10, the Web developer conference Microsoft kicked off Monday. Among them: background JavaScript compiling on a separate processor core, graphics processor acceleration of text and graphic rendering, and an upcoming update to the IE9 preview for hardware acceleration of HTML 5 video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IE9 is exponentially faster at dynamic rendering than its predecessor," said McLeish. "It's very slick, very speedy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hachamovich repeated a claim made last fall by his boss, Stephen Sinofsky, Microsoft's president of Windows, that IE9 had essentially closed the enormous JavaScript performance gap between itself and rivals made by Mozilla, Google and Apple . Today, Hachamovich showed a slide during his keynote that put IE9's platform preview as slightly faster than Firefox 3.6, slightly slower than Safari, Chrome and Opera 10.5 on the SunSpider JavaScript benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're faster than many other browsers," Hachamovich said, pointing to the slide. "And we've only done a little bit of optimization for SunSpider so far."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On other browser benchmarks, IE9 has a longer way to go. According to Hachamovich, IE9 Platform Preview's Acid3 score is now at 55 out of a possible 100. Last fall, Sinofsky said the internal build of IE9 scored 32 out of 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Acid3 benchmark checks how closely a browser follows certain standards, particularly specifications for Web 2.0 applications, as well as standards related to DOM (Document Object Model), CSS2 (Cascading Style Sheets) and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was HTML5 that Hachamovich repeatedly hammered home during his time on stage. "We planned IE9 from the ground up for HTML5," he said, talking about the still-unfinished revision of the Web's core markup language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's almost an about-face," said McLeish of Microsoft's taking to HTML5. "Microsoft was not about to jump on the latest greatest thing just because enthusiasts clamored for it, but after some thoughtful review and the pressures of the market, they reevaluated their browser's capabilities, took a hard look at HTML5 and decided there was a lot of potential there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLeish saw the shift to support HTML5 as more evidence that Microsoft wants to be a leader in the browser race. "I'd argue that they're in the forefront with IE9," McLeish said. "Certainly, [Google's] Chrome and [Mozilla's] Firefox have their own labs, but I think Microsoft is out front in presenting this to developers. It's an affirmation that they're planning to give HTML5 their full support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IE9 Platform Preview can be downloaded from Microsoft's Web site and run within Windows 7 , Windows Server 2008 R2 or Vista Service Pack 2 (SP2). The preview is not a full-fledged browser, but essentially a frame for showing off the new browser's JavaScript and rendering engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this shows that Microsoft is serious again about innovation," said McLeish. "And when Microsoft gets serious about something, you'd better be ready to get out of the way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has its work cut out for it in reclaiming its once overwhelmingly-dominant lead in browsers. IE has lost approximately 8 percentage points of share as measured by NetApplications.com in the last 12 months, and now accounts for about 62% of all browsers in use. Even the introduction of IE8 a year ago hasn't stemmed the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) as the Bull of the
Day and Bayer AG (OTC: BAYRY) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), Visa Inc.(NYSE:
V) and Kroger Company (NYSE: KR). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) is a leading provider of IP-based networking and
other products. The company's second-quarter results beat the Zacks Consensus on
both the top and bottom lines. Orders continued to strengthen in the last
quarter, indicating continued business momentum. 

New products, growth initiatives, improving operating performance, solid
financials and a sound restructuring policy are positives. Of course,
competition remains something to look out for, since the company has been losing
some market share. Additionally, the complicated decision-making process and
integration risks remain. 

However, we believe the positives outweigh the negatives at this point.
Consequently, we are upgrading CSCO shares to Outperform. 

Bear of the Day: 

Bayer AG (OTC: BAYRY) reported fourth quarter core earnings per share of 0.90
surpassing 0.71 reported in the year-ago period. Bayer has been shifting its
focus towards its HealthCare segment over the past few years in order to
maintain solid growth in the long run. 

While we are pleased with the growth recorded by the HealthCare segment, we
remain concerned with the disappointing performance of the Material Science
segment. Moreover, we are disappointed with the delay in approval of Xarelto,
one of Bayer's most promising pipeline candidates. 

In addition, the outlook for 2010 provided by the company is not quite
encouraging. Given these factors, we downgrade the stock to Underperform from
Neutral.

JPMorgan, FDIC Resolve with WaMu

Washington Mutual Inc.`s (WaMu) 18 month-long battle with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) came to a resolution
on Mar 12, whereby WaMu has agreed to accumulate about 6 billion as against the
$20 billion to be collected from lawsuits, tax refunds and disputed cash
deposits that were estimated by the shareholders of WaMu. 

According to the terms of the resolution, fixed after the dispute between the
WaMu, FDIC and JPMorgan, WaMu will receive the $4 billion of cash deposit that
was held by JPMorgan when it bought Washington Mutual Bank for $1.9 billion in
Sep 2008. The three entities will also share two tax refunds expected to be
worth about $5.6 billion. In addition to turning over the $4 billion in
deposits, JPMorgan has agreed to purchase Visa Inc.(NYSE: V) shares from WaMu
for $50 million. 

The matter caught fire when WaMu`s bank was taken over by JPMorgan. While WaMu
wanted to seek for the $4 billion cash deposit to repay its creditors worth $8
billion, FDIC argued that it should take temporary custody of the cash because
of losses caused by the failure of WaMu`s bank. On the other hand, JPMorgan
alleged that it should have a right to the cash as it had bought the failed
bank. 

Following the resolution, the money granted to WaMu will be used to repay $7
billion in debt, mostly owed to bondholders who support the settlement, which
leaves a paltry sum for the shareholders. However, the judge must approve the
settlement, which will be filed by Mar 26 with the court as a part of the WaMu`s
liquidation plan. 

Kroger Upped from Underperform

We recently upgraded our recommendation on Kroger Company (NYSE: KR) to Neutral
from Underperform with a target price of $23.00. 

Kroger`s dominant position among the nation`s largest grocery retailers enables
the company to sustain top-line growth, expand store base and boost market
share. The company`s fourth-quarter 2009 total revenue (including fuel center
sales) rose 7.2% to $18,554.5 million. 

Kroger`s customer-centric business model provides a strong value proposition to
consumers. The company is well positioned to deliver higher earnings primarily
through strong identical supermarket sales growth (sans fuel). Identical
supermarket sales are expected to grow 2% to 3% in fiscal 2010, although down
from an average growth of 4.1% achieved in the last three years, given the
economic conditions. 

Kroger`s management is also actively managing its capital, returning much of its
free cash to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. Since the inception
of the dividend program in 2006, the company has increased its dividend every
year. The dividend was last increased in fiscal 2009 by 5.5% to 9.5 cents a
share. Kroger also repurchased 10.3 million shares aggregating $218.3 million.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Industry Outlook. Today, Zacks Equity Research
discusses the CoalIndustry, including Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU), Patriot Coal
Corporation (NYSE: PCX), Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE: WLT) and Arch Coal Inc.
(NYSE: ACI). 

A synopsis of today`s Industry Outlook is presented below. The full article can
be read at
http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/31672/Coal+Industry+Outlook+and+Review+-+Mar.+2010.


Coal Industry Outlook &amp; Review

The larger coal players with strong balance sheets will be able to capitalize on
the current market environment in the form of acquisitions. In particular, we
like companies with exposure to the international coal markets. We also like
companies with leverage to metallurgical coal markets. Companies like Peabody
Energy (NYSE: BTU), Patriot Coal Corporation (NYSE: PCX), Walter Energy Inc.
(NYSE: WLT) and Arch Coal Inc. (NYSE: ACI) look attractive currently. 

Peabody is the largest pure-play coal producer, with significant leverage to the
Australian export market. Due to the high quality of coal produced and its
proximity to Asia (emerging markets), Australian seaborne coal trades at a
premium to all other coals. Peabody would benefit with the rebound of China and
other Asian emerging markets. Furthermore, Peabody has significant leverage to
the improving prices for seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal. 

Arch Coal has a significant amount of reserves and is a top-three producer in
the Powder River Basin (PRB). In our opinion, PRB coal will be in great demand
over the coming years. Going forward, the significant coal-fired power plant
build-out will increase annual thermal coal demand by more than 43 MM tons, most
of which will be fueled by PRB coal. 

Tampa, Florida-based Walter Energy has high quality metallurgical reserves,
which are advantageously located. It is one of the largest producers of premium
metallurgical coal. The company has the ability to expand its production by
roughly 50% at its Mine No. 7 East Expansion longwall -- taking production
capacity up to 9.5 million tons in 2012.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pakistan has cut by more than half a visa backlog affecting U.S. officials and contractors needed to run American aid programs aimed at combating extremism there, a State Department official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Pakistan were developing a "more cooperative, constructive relationship" in the first year of a $7.5 billion, five-year civilian aid plan for Pakistan passed recently by Congress, said the official, Dan Feldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it's going to take time," Feldman, the deputy special U.S. representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told a House of Representatives subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials complained in December about hundreds of Pakistani visa delays, saying this could hamper aid intended to stabilize the Islamabad government and help Pakistan's people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there was a backlog of 500 visas in January. It's down to less than 200 at this point," Feldman told the subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, part of the House Oversight and Government Reform panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the United States is Pakistan's biggest aid donor and is now launching the five-year-plan of $1.5 billion in nonmilitary aid a year, there is suspicion on both sides, and analysts speak of a "trust deficit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan's support is crucial for the United States as it strives to defeat al Qaeda and bring stability to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But conditions attached to the civilian aid package for Pakistan -- including those related to counterterrorism and nuclear nonproliferation efforts -- have angered many Pakistanis, including the powerful military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visa backlog delayed the arrival of U.S. auditors, accountants and inspectors to implement the civilian aid program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to make clear to the government of Pakistan that U.S. civilian assistance comes as a package: funding, programing and oversight," said Representative John Tierney, chairman of the subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feldman said some U.S. aid would be going to help areas where the Pakistani army recently launched an offensive against Taliban and al Qaeda linked militants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of March, the United States will have completed arrangements to spend $55 million on roads and electricity in South Waziristan, he said. Another $16.5 million will go for the rehabilitation of Tarbela Dam in northwest Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some $52 million will go to the Pakistan Electric Power Company to rehabilitate three thermal plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Chris Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Activists ask Goldman to report on pay disparities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * SEC denies Goldman bid to leave question off proxy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ross Kerber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, March 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
has lost its bid to exclude a proposal on executive pay from
its upcoming annual proxy filing, according to a response from
U.S. securities regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under fire for its continued generosity to executives so
soon after the U.S. government bailout of the financial sector,
Goldman has taken steps such as capping compensation expense
for 2009 despite posting a record profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that has not ended the pressure, including a suit filed
last week by the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers fund, claiming the bank's executives are overpaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proxy matter, pursued by shareholder activists led by
the nonprofit Nathan Cummings Foundation of New York, takes the
criticism on a slightly different tack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foundation filed a proposal that would require
Goldman's compensation committee to produce a report comparing
pay for top managers like Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein with
median wages at the company. It also sought an evaluation of
whether the pay is excessive and should be modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for permission to leave the measure off the proxy
ballot that will be mailed to all shareholders, citing what it
called errors in the way the activists had written the
supporting statement for their proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in letter dated March 11, SEC special counsel Gregory
Belliston told the firm: "We are unable to conclude that you
have demonstrated objectively that the portions of the
supporting statement you reference are materially false or
misleading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, Goldman may not omit the proposal, Belliston
wrote. Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lance Lindblom, president of the Nathan Cummings
Foundation, said he was pleased by the SEC's decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The SEC is saying, 'We totally do not buy Goldman Sachs'
arguments," he said. "Frankly, we were shocked that Goldman
Sachs was trying to get us knocked off the proxy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lindblom said the original proposal had contained one
error: it incorrectly cited a court decision related to pay
rather than a news article about that decision. He said he has
offered to fix the language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Richard Chang)

&lt;p&gt;Memory Protection Issue in Microsoft Virtual PC Hypervisor Software May Leave
Systems Open to Infiltration
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Core Security Technologies, provider of the CORE IMPACT family of comprehensive
enterprise security testing solutions, today issued an advisory disclosing a
vulnerability that could affect large numbers of organizations and consumers
using Microsoft`s Virtual PC virtualization software and leave them open to
potential attack. 

Microsoft`s Virtual PC hypervisor is an element of the company`s Windows Virtual
PC package, which allows users to run multiple Windows environments on a single
computer. The hypervisor is a key component of Windows 7 XP Mode, a feature in
Microsoft`s latest desktop operating system aimed at easing the migration path
into the new OS for users and enterprises that need to run legacy Windows XP
applications on its native OS. 

A Core Security Exploit Writer working with CoreLabs, the research arm of Core
Security Technologies, found that affected versions of Virtual PC hypervisor
contain a vulnerability that may allow attackers to bypass several security
mechanisms of the Windows operating system to compromise vulnerable virtualized
systems. The issue may also transform a certain type of common software bug into
exploitable vulnerabilities. 

Affected versions of the product include: Microsoft Virtual PC 2007, Virtual PC
2007 SP1, Windows Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual Server 2005. On Windows 7 the
XP Mode feature is affected by the vulnerability. 

Microsoft Hyper-V technology is not affected by this problem. 

The issue was reported to Microsoft in August of 2009. The vendor indicated that
it plans to solve the problem in future updates to the vulnerable products. 

We recommend affected users to run all mission critical Windows applications on
native iron or use virtualization technologies that aren`t affected by this bug.
Windows operating systems and applications that must run virtualized using
Virtual PC technologies should be kept at the highest patch level possible and
monitored to detect exploitation attempts. 

"Virtualization is an area that offers tremendous promise to the entire
computing world, but it must be remembered that the technologies that enable
this process may also introduce potential risks that previously didn`t exist,"
said Ivan Arce, CTO of Core Security Technologies. "This particular case
provides a good example of how mechanisms designed to improve an operating
system`s security over many years can eventually become ineffective when some of
the basic underlying aspects of their operation are changed by virtualization
technology". 

Nicolas Economou, a Core Security Exploit Writer working with CoreLabs, is
credited with discovering the Virtual PC Hypervisor vulnerability. 

Vulnerability Specifics

Windows Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 are desktop systems
virtualization applications from Microsoft that are used to run one or many
virtual hosts on a single physical system. Windows Virtual PC is used to run
Windows XP Mode applications directly from a Windows 7 desktop. 

In Microsoft Virtual PC and Windows Virtual PC, the Virtual Machine Monitor
(VMM) is responsible for mediating access to hardware resources and devices from
operating systems running in a virtualized environment. A vulnerability found in
the memory management of the Virtual Machine Monitor makes it such that memory
pages mapped above the 2GB level can be accessed with read or read/write
privileges by user-space programs running in a Guest operating system. 

By leveraging this vulnerability it is possible to bypass several security
hardening mechanisms of Windows operating systems, such as Data Execution
Prevention (DEP), Safe Exception Handlers (SafeSEH) and Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR). As a result, some applications with bugs that are not
exploitable when running in a not-virtualized operating system are rendered
exploitable if running within a guest OS in Virtual PC. 

In particular, a vulnerable application running in Windows XP Mode on Windows 7
may be exploitable in a virtual environment, while the same application running
directly on a Windows XP SP3 operating system is not. 

The vulnerability invalidates a basic assumption about the memory management
operations of the Windows operating system on which several security hardening
mechanisms rely for correct operation. As a result, those defense-in-depth
mechanisms should no longer be considered effective enough to prevent
exploitation of un-patched vulnerabilities in Windows applications running on
systems virtualized using the Virtual PC hypervisor. Additionally, software bugs
that may have been dismissed as not security-relevant due to being not
exploitable and for which security patches may not be readily available could
become exploitable vulnerabilities due to the Virtual PC hypervisor bug.

&lt;p&gt; * Backlog of 500 now down to less than 200 * Five-year $7.5 bln civilian aid program affected By Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - Pakistan has cut by more than half a visa backlog affecting U.S. officials and contractors needed to run American aid programs aimed at combating extremism there, a State Department official said on Tuesday. The United States and Pakistan were developing a more cooperative, constructive relationship in the first year of a $7.5 billion, five-year civilian aid plan for Pakistan passed recently by Congress, said the official, Dan Feldman. But it's going to take time, Feldman, the deputy special U.S. representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told a House of Representatives subcommittee. U.S. officials complained in December about hundreds of Pakistani visa delays, saying this could hamper aid intended to stabilize the Islamabad government and help Pakistan's people. I think there was a backlog of 500 visas in January. It's down to less than 200 at this point, Feldman told the subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, part of the House Oversight and Government Reform panel. Although the United States is Pakistan's biggest aid donor and is now launching the five-year-plan of $1.5 billion in nonmilitary aid a year, there is suspicion on both sides, and analysts speak of a trust deficit. Pakistan's support is crucial for the United States as it strives to defeat al Qaeda and bring stability to Afghanistan. But conditions attached to the civilian aid package for Pakistan -- including those related to counterterrorism and nuclear nonproliferation efforts -- have angered many Pakistanis, including the powerful military. The visa backlog delayed the arrival of U.S. auditors, accountants and inspectors to implement the civilian aid program. I want to make clear to the government of Pakistan that U.S. civilian assistance comes as a package: funding, programming and oversight, said Representative John Tierney, chairman of the subcommittee. Feldman said some U.S. aid would be going to help areas where the Pakistani army recently launched an offensive against Taliban and al Qaeda linked militants. By the end of March, the United States will have completed arrangements to spend $55 million on roads and electricity in South Waziristan, he said. Another $16.5 million will go for the rehabilitation of Tarbela Dam in northwest Pakistan. Some $52 million will go to the Pakistan Electric Power Company to rehabilitate three thermal plants.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) could not hand back its banking charter and shake off Federal Reserve policing even if it wanted to, under the "Hotel California" provision of the financial reform bill unveiled this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a shame, investors and analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Goldman traded in its investment banking charter for bank holding company status during the darkest hours of the financial crisis, Wall Street's dominant firm has never looked like a bank or acted like a bank. It has been a bank in charter only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, for its part, has said repeatedly that it has no desire to hand back the banking charter it was granted, along with rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charter at the time was a sign of safety to investors as Goldman would be regulated more strictly by the U.S. Federal Reserve. It also gave Goldman access to the Fed's credit window and cheap funding sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The main benefit of getting the bank charter is over. Now it may be more of a hindrance than a help," said Michael Wong, a stock analyst on the banking industry team at Morningstar, about Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wong said for a firm like Goldman Sachs, being a highly regulated bank comes with more restrictions and lower profit possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Morgan Stanley and other firms such as American Express (AXP.N) would be trapped under the Federal Reserve's thumb under a provision that Republican Senator Bob Corker championed in the financial reform bill Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd released on Monday. [nN15206128]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corker's so-called Hotel California provision would prevent large firms that took Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds from escaping Fed supervision by handing back in their bank charters. Hotel California refers to a lyric from a 1970s Eagles song that says, "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Goldman has not exactly been a pauper since gaining bank status in September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm came roaring back in 2009, reporting net earnings of $13.39 billion, compared to $2.3 billion in 2008, on strong trading momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a quick bounceback has made Goldman a target. Perhaps coincidentally, President Barack Obama announced the so-called Volcker rule on the very day Goldman announced 2009 earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule would prevent banks from engaging in proprietary trading for their own profits, and could strip Goldman of about 10 percent of its net revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN SACHS CLAUSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors see Corker's provision as punitive and another sign that the government was not a "good faith" partner in the bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You might as well call this the Goldman Sachs clause," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TARP is like the roach motel -- once you get in, in any way, shape or form, you can't get out of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, "Once you pay back the government every dime, they should have no more control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corker sees it differently. He said the provision is simply good housekeeping to prevent financial firms from scurrying back to their imprudent, risky ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had some companies that ran into the shade of the federal government," Corker said in an interview with Reuters. "What you don't want to have happen is when times get good, people start running out from under that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corker has been a key player on the Senate Banking Committee, working closely with Dodd to try to put forth a bipartisan financial reform bill before talks collapsed last week and Dodd went ahead with a mostly Democratic bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if the Hotel California provision was tailored for Goldman Sachs, Corker said, "It sort of is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, for its part, reiterated to Reuters on Tuesday that it has "no interest" in changing its status as a bank holding company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wong said analysts will be closely watching to see if that tune changes if legislative proposals such as the Volcker rule and other bank crackdowns approach the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said firms such as Goldman will then have a short window to try to turn back in their charters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I were a shareholder, I would like Goldman ... to have as many options as possible," Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder in New York and Karey Wutkowski in Washington; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM will soon offer software development and testing services through its public cloud, adding to a private cloud option launched in June 2009, the company said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducting development and testing with an elastic pool of cloud infrastructure is supposed to save IT shops money, since that work no longer has to tie up a fixed set of machines, much of which may sit idle at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, cloud-based development can help programmers work more nimbly, since resources can be called up as needed, without the hold-ups associated with reserving time and space on in-house systems, proponents say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Blue also released a list of cloud partners Tuesday, including RightScale and Kaavo, which make cloud management software; security vendor Navajo Systems; performance monitoring software maker AppFirst and application development vendors Aviarc, Corent and Wavemaker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's public cloud development and test service also employs virtualization technology from Red Hat and supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Novell's SUSE Linux and Java. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is set for availability in the second quarter in the U.S. and Canada, with a global release occurring during the rest of the year. It will compete with public cloud infrastructure vendors like Amazon Web Services and Rackspace, both of which have formed similar partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But IBM could have a competitive edge over those companies, given its long track record in enterprise IT and the widespread use of its Rational software development tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the latter end, IBM announced Rational Software Delivery Services for Cloud Computing v1.0 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

billion acquisition of U.S. oil and gas company XTO Energy Inc

still lacks the approval of XTO's shareholders, according
Exxon's filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp (TKM.TO) said it would collaborate with Pfizer (PFE.N) to evaluate the use of its technology to deliver, with a higher degree of stability, Pfizer's gene "silencing" mechanism, sending its shares up 24 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada-based Tekmira's stable nucleic acid-lipid particle (SNALP) technology uses lipid nanoparticles to deliver RNAi therapeutics, such as siRNAs used to treat a range of diseases, to its target by protecting the drug from degrading quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (the collaboration) adds further validity and support to Tekmira's SNALP technology, and that is what is driving investor interests," said Pooya Hemami, an analyst with Desjardins Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Tekmira's first formal research collaboration with Pfizer. Tekmira is also working with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc (ALNY.O) and Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX), both of whom are developing drugs using the SNALP technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So if other companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer, which have initial agreements with Tekmira, were to develop more comprehensive licensing agreements, it would be very positive to the extent of the depth of the potential revenue for the technology," Hemami said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news of the collaboration sent Tekmira's shares up 24 percent -- its highest percentage gain in 10 months -- making it one of the highest gainers on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock was up 20 percent at 84 Canadian cents in afternoon trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLU FEARS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns with the SNALP technology is safety. In January, an early stage trial for Tekmira's own internal cholesterol drug candidate using the same technology showed that one of the two patients, treated at the highest dose level, experienced flu-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My main concern really, and I think for a lot analysts covering the company, is the safety of the technology. There were concerns with the first phase study of ApoB SNALP as there was a case of flu-like response," Hemami said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ApoB SNALP is expected to start early stage studies again in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So what investors will be looking for is whether or not the new revision...eliminates the risk of immune response," the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will evaluate Tekmira's SNALP formulations in preclinical models. Financial terms of the collaboration were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to sign additional collaborative agreements in 2010," Mark Murray, Tekmira's chief executive officer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares were trading down 10 cents at $17.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gowri Jayakumar in Bangalore; Editing by Savio D'Souza)&lt;/p&gt;

DETROIT, March 16, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Marygrove College Department of
English and Modern Languages today announced that the award-winning mystery
writer, novelist and social commentator Walter Mosley will be the twenty-second
guest--and the first mystery writer-- in its Contemporary American Authors
Lecture Series. This annual event brings a nationally-known author to its campus
for a morning class session with high school students and an evening reading for
the general public.

Walter Mosley will deliver the Lillian and Donald Bauder Lecture at 8 p.m. on
Friday, April 16, 2010, in Alumnae Hall on the Marygrove College campus.
Afterward, he will sign copies of his works, which will be available for

To schedule an interview with Mr. Mosley, contact Karen Wood at (313) 927-1446
or kwood@marygrove.edu.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Mr. Mosley has written thirty-two books and his work has been translated into
twenty-one languages. Ten novels and one book of short stories feature private
investigator Easy Rawlins, the first of which, Devil in a Blue Dress, was made
into a movie starring Denzel Washington and Jennifer Beals.

Mosley has written many works of fiction, including RL's Dream, 47, Fortunate
Son, Killing Johnny Fry, Diablerie, The Tempest Tales, and The Man in My
Basement, which New Yorker reviewer Ben Greenman called "a compelling, peculiar
exploration of race and identity." His most recent novel, The Long Fall, which
begins a new series featuring private investigator Leonid McGill, was published
in March 2009. A second Leonid McGill novel, Known to Evil will be published
this March.

ABOUT THE SERIES

This series, now in its twenty-second year at Marygrove, is an annual event
bringing a nationally-known author to its campus for a public lecture and
seminar with students. It began when the late Frederick P. Currier, a former
Marygrove College trustee, attended a reception on campus and remarked that he
would like to bring a national writer to Marygrove for a weekend. Mr. Currier's
start-up check soon followed his suggestion, and in 1989 nearly 600 guests of
the College heard Gloria Naylor inaugurate the series.

To date, nearly 8,000 people have joined Marygrove at the Friday night public
readings to hear outstanding writers share their work.

DOHA, Qatar--(Business Wire)--
Qatar General Electricity &amp; Water Corporation "KAHRAMAA" and BARWA &amp; Qatari Diar
Research Institute (BQDRI), signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the
provision of measures to create a sustainable built environment, in relation to
energy and water conservation while addressing the specific needs of Qatar. 

The MOU was signed by Eng. Essa Hilal Al-Kuwari, KAHRAMAA's Acting Managing
Director, and Dr. Yousef Mohamed Al-Horr, BQDRI's Chairman &amp; MD. 

The main objective behind this MOU is to demonstrate KAHRAMAA`s and BQDRI's full
commitment and ability to support the accomplishment of the objectives of Qatar
Vision 2030 based on developing a sustainable built-environment for the
generations to come. These objectives include:

1
        Cooperation in applying Qatar Sustainable Assessment System (QSAS) to 
        increase the efficiency of energy and water usage aiming to reduce the 
        impacts of climate change and provide a better living environment that 
        maintains the balance between economic, environmental and national 
        identity of Qatar.
      2
        Contribute to research and development of advanced built-environment 
        studies of common concern to support the implementation and 
        application of sustainability in Qatar.

The initiative of both KAHRAMAA and BQDRI came in response to Qatar Vision 2030,
in terms of sustainable development, and to preserve the natural resources and
the environment while supporting the economical boom of Qatar witnessed today. 

Commenting at the signing Ceremony, Eng. Essa Hilal Al-Kuwari said: "Our MOU
with BQDRI and the deployment of QSAS will allow KAHRAMAA to take the lead in
addressing strategic issues related to Qatar's energy and water efficiency
policies, reduction of carbon emissions, minimization of ecological impacts, and
insurance of high indoor environmental quality."

Eng. Al-Kuwari added that: "This is one step towards aligning the strategic
national role of KAHRAMAA in addressing Qatar Energy and Water Consumption and
Energy Management issues with the deployment strategy of QSAS."

"Being the provider of electricity and water for the state of Qatar, KAHRAMAA
requires innovative systems with complete flexibility. The choice of QSAS, as a
rating system, was based on the advantages that differentiate QSAS from other
practiced rating systems in the region."

Eng. Al-Kuwaricontinued, "Our partnership with BQDRI to deploy QSAS is due to
the fact that QSAS was developed based on local needs while leveraging best
practices which is a definite advantage, especially for regions where
environmental, economic, social, and cultural conditions are unlike other areas
in the world."

Eng. Al-Kuwari concluded: "From our belief and commitment to Qatar National
Vision 2030, partnering with BQDRI's rating system that adheres to international
standards and addresses sustainability goals specific to the area, KAHRAMAA will
serve as a premier example for government bodies and companies in Qatar, the
region and across the globe."

On behalf of BQDRI, Chairman Al-Horr said: "I would like to first of all
congratulate KAHRAMAA and BQDRI for this partnership. Both organizations share a
commitment to Qatar Vision 2030 and to the need of advanced and integrated
sustainability practices."

"BQDRI analyzed the real estate industry on the basis of sustainable development
and concluded that there was a need for an assessment system based on the needs
of Qatar and the region. All other solutions are imported and don`t comply with
the society, culture, climate as well as other various environmental conditions
which exist in the region," Dr. Al-Horr added. 

Dr. Al-Horr commenced saying: "QSAS offers a lot of advantages which are not
available in any other imported system. For instance, QSAS responds to urgent
issues such as preserving the architectural identity of Qatar and the region,
and enhancing the creative solutions to address other challenges like water
scarcity and lack of non-hydrocarbon raw materials. Moreover, this system
determined the types of plants which are suitable to the Gulf environment, and
are distinguished by low consumption of water as well as providing the suitable
greening and other environmental issues. QSAS, for instance, is Qatari made
designed in consideration to established global best practices. All its
categories, criteria, and measurements are defined to be performance-based and
quantifiable. It has a flexible scoring method which has overcome the
limitations of other international rating systems." 

Kahramaa &amp; BQDRI Facing the Impacts Resulting from Built Environment on the
increasing consumption of "Energy &amp; Water"

The built environment, in Qatar and across the globe, contributes to air
pollution, land use and contamination, fossil fuel and water depletion, water
pollution, materials depletion, impacts on human health, and climate change.
Responsible design, construction and building operations can mitigate the
negative effects of the built environment. 

Energy Consumption in Qatar

Studying Fossil Fuel Depletion, Qatar is recognized amongst the world's largest
consumers of energy, per capita. According to the United Nations Statistic
Division, relative to the size of Qatar`s economy, the country on a whole uses
twice the amount of energy as the nations of Germany or Japan. The burning of
fossil fuels for energy consumption leads to increased air pollution through
carbon dioxide emissions. 

Fossil fuels contain a high percentage of carbon and hydrocarbons, and the
burning of fossil fuels produces carbon emissions that further impact climate
change. 

Water Consumption

Water consumption in Qatar, between 1900 and 2000, has increased dramatically.
And freshwater availability is decreasing at rapid rates, especially in Qatar
and among the GCC countries. 

The natural water cycle is a system in which water resources are continuously
exchanged between the atmosphere, soil water, surface water, ground water, and
plants. This cycle treats and recharges fresh water supplies. Human consumption
of fresh water, in Qatar, outpaces the natural cycle due to the scare of
rainfall and limited aquifers capacity; and under these circumstances water
cannot be considered a renewable resource. 

Domestic water consumption accounts for a significant depletion of natural water
resources. This includes personal consumption and household use. Other large
contributors to water depletion include agriculture, which can infect the water
supply with contaminants, and industrial processes that return water to fresh
water supplies without proper treatment. 

Climate Change

It refers to any long-term changes in the Earth`s weather and atmospheric
conditions and can have detrimental effects on natural landscapes, wildlife, and
humans. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a major factor related
to recent climate change patterns. The burning of fossil fuels in particular has
led to increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is
considered a greenhouse gas because while it allows visible light from the sun
to reach the Earth, it traps the reflected infrared radiation, leading to a
warming of the atmosphere and climate change. As the concentrations of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere increases, more infrared radiation is trapped, leading
to the warming of the atmosphere and climate change. Drastic increases in the
amount of carbon emissions by humans are leading to noticeable and sudden
changes in global weather patterns. 

The per capita emission of carbon is very similar to the per capita consumption
of energy. As per the IEA Statistics Division, 2006, The GCC Countries,
including Qatar, have high per capita values. 

"This memorandum with Kahramaa will open new horizons of business and
development to achieve our objectives. I am confident that our partnership with
companies like Kahramaa will add great value to what BQDRI has done. This
cooperation will encourage the adoption and implementation of QSAS in Qatar and
abroad, especially as Kahramaa represents one of the main bodies that a
successful nation needs," Dr. Al-Horr concluded. 

QSAS and the Benefits of Responsible and Sustainable Design

The built environment has a direct impact on the Qatar's natural environment,
the economy and human health. These aspects can be improved through the way
buildings are designed, constructed and operated or in other words adapting to
Green building practices. 

The following are potential benefits of green building practices: 

Environmental Benefits

* Enhance and conserve flora/fauna, biodiversity and ecosystems 
* Conserve and restore natural and non-renewable resources 
* Improve air, land and water quality 
* Increase energy efficiency while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
* Reduce waste production

Economic Benefits

* Reduce operating and maintenance costs 
* Create new opportunities and markets for green products and services 
* Improve occupant productivity 
* Faster occupancy rate and lower turnover rate

Social Benefits

* Enhance human comfort and health 
* Reduce strain on local infrastructure 
* Improve quality of life 
* Preserve cultural identity

The criteria of QSAS are divided into eight categories, each with a direct
impact on environmental stress mitigation and can measure a different aspect of
the project`s environmental impact. 

Kahramaa and BQDRI MOU focuses on challenges related directly to Energy and
Water. 

QSAS Emphasis on energy

The Energy category, that represents 24% of the total impact of the build
environment in Qatar according to QSAS, consists of factors associated with
energy demand of buildings, the efficiency of energy delivery, and the use of
fossil energy sources that result in harmful emissions. QSAS considers the
following impacts resulting from energy use and unsustainable practices in
Qatar:

* Climate Change 
* Fossil Fuel Depletion 
* Air Pollution 
* Human Comfort &amp; Health

To mitigate the impact of Energy on Qatar's environment, Kahramaa and BQDRI,
while deploying QSAS, should consider

* Designing buildings to lower its energy demand 
* Selecting efficient building systems 
* Lowering the demand on non-renewable sources of energy thereby reducing
harmful emissions and depletion of fossil fuels 
* Minimizing the amount of harmful substances produced by the energy delivery
systems and the energy supply network

QSAS Emphasis on Water

The Water category, that represents 16% of the total impact of the build
environment in Qatar according to QSAS, consists of factors associated with
water consumption and its associated burden on municipal supply and treatment
systems. The environmental impact resulting from water consumption and
unsustainable practices is water depletion. To mitigate the environmental impact
and lower emissions, Kahramaa and BQDRI, through QSAS, will consider the
following:

* Specifying efficient plumbing fixtures. 
* Creating a system for the collection and storage of rainwater. 
* On-site treatment of water for later reuse. 
* Designing a landscaping plan that minimizes the need for irrigation.

With a cumulative of 40% from the total impact of the built environment
according to QSAS, with water 16% and energy 24%; the MOU between Kahramaa and
BQDRI should facilitate the deployment of QSAS in Qatar, and hence plant the
seeds to entrench the importance of Responsible and Sustainable Design. 

More than 128buildings in Qatar are under QSAS certification process

Following the adoption of green building principles by BARWA Real Estate Company
(BARWA) and Qatari Diar Real Estate Development Company (Qatari Diar) for all
their future projects, BQDRI started deploying the QSAS amongst their projects. 

Sufficiently satisfying QSAS standards, testing criteria &amp; other requirements;
BQDRI honoured BARWA's "BARWA City Project" the accreditation as "QSAS - RATED
GREEN PROJECT". 

Having BARWA City's 128 buildings accredited as "QSAS - RATED GREEN PROJECT"
gave BARWA Real Estate the advantage to become among the first few QSAS rated
buildings that are notified as being GREEN. 

BARWA City is one of the largest projects being constructed in Qatar. The
project, built on more than two and a half million square meters, offers
residential units for more than thirty five thousand people. BARWA city will
utilize district cooling plants to provide air conditioning, central gas
network, and central TV channels system. The project offers apartments with
diversified interior layouts to satisfy the different demands and needs of the
tenants. It includes health clubs, commercial compounds, parks, playgrounds and
multi usage buildings, banks, a two hundred fifty-bed hospital, schools,
nurseries and a hotel. The project will be completed in two phases where the
first phase includes six thousand apartments. 

BARWA City Project Receives QSAS Certification according to the following:

* BARWA City Phase-I Residential Buildings` Design has received a total score of
One Star in Qatar Sustainability Assessment System (QSAS). 
* BARWA City Phase-I comprises of 128 Apartment Buildings; 4 to 6 stories; and
each apartment building will receive the QSAS certification.

QSAS, being the first of its kind performance-based sustainability rating system
in the MENA region developed by BQDRI, is now being amongst the top
sustainability rating systems in relation to the number of certified projects. 

QSAS registered projects consists more than 128 Buildings in the State of Qatar
compared to 34 registered buildings under other rating systems. 

BQDRI &amp; QSAS Inception

BQDRI first introduced QSAS as the "Middle East`s first performance-based Green
Building Design Rating System" at the Global City Sustainable Urban Development
Forum in Abu Dhabi in April 2009. BQDRI confirms its commitment in continuing
this march and supporting Qatar`s role as "the capital of sustainable
development in the Middle East", allowing Qatar to take the lead in addressing
regional and national energy efficiency policies, reducing carbon emissions,
minimizing ecological impacts, and ensuring high indoor environmental quality. 

BQDRI, since inception, has been organizing T workshops assuring its committee
to the ability to lead sustainability in the Qatari real estate market. QSAS
workshops welcomed industry leaders from across the GCC and took place alongside
major real estate and sustainability conferences worldwide. The workshops aimed
at empowering industry professionals with the necessary tools and means of
sustainable development including:

* The training to become QSAS - CERTIFIED GREEN PROFESSIONALand secure project
submission to Lusail Municipality and BARWA Real Estate, 
* The latest knowledge and understanding of QSAS green building practices and
principles, and how to apply them in Qatar, 
* The guidance to QSAS procedures, tools, applications and assessment
requirements, 
* The necessary educational materials to support them during their practice.

QSAS won the Award of Excellence for outstanding contribution to sustainable
development at the IREF Summit 2009, London - UK. The event was attended by
leaders of real estate industry and financial services, as well as political and
business figures. QSAS award was received by Dr. Al-Horr from Mrs. Liz Peace,
CEO of British Property Federation.

&lt;p&gt;Continues to Urge Procter &amp; Gamble to Issue a Full and Immediate Recall of
Zinc-Containing Fixodent Denture Adhesives
GREAT NECK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Parker Waichman Alonso LLP is pleased with Procter &amp; Gamble's recent decision to
include a caution on its Web site, http://www.dentureliving.com/, regarding the
health risks posed by excessive exposure to zinc in Fixodent denture cream. The
caution was added to the Web site by Procter &amp; Gamble with little fanfare in
recent days. In addition to informing consumers that Fixodent contains zinc, the
new caution states that: "Some reports suggest that excessive and prolonged zinc
intake may be linked to adverse health effects." The entire text may be viewed
at: http://www.dentureliving.com/fixodent-denture-products/how-to-use-fixodent. 

While Procter &amp; Gamble's decision to finally acknowledge the potential risks
posed by excessive exposure to the zinc in Fixodent is to be commended, this
action is still not adequate to protect consumers from this serious public
health threat. In fact, we feel that the lack of a clear warning combined with
ambiguous instructions for use only serve to enhance the danger faced by
consumers. For that reason, Parker Waichman Alonso continues to call on Procter
&amp; Gamble to immediately issue a full recall of all zinc-containing Fixodent
denture cream products. Procter &amp; Gamble`s main competitor in the market for
denture adhesives, GlaxoSmithKline, recently decided to cease marketing its zinc
containing adhesives. For the sake of millions of denture adhesive users
worldwide, Procter &amp; Gamble needs to take the same action. 

"While any new caution regarding Fixodent is a step in the right direction, it
does not go nearly far enough," says Andres Alonso, a partner of Parker Waichman
Alonso. "Procter &amp; Gamble`s attempt to do this quietly will leave too many
consumers unaware of the danger that Fixodent could pose to their health. As
long as these products continue to be sold, they remain a serious public health
threat." 

Parker Waichman Alonso LLP has filed numerous lawsuits on behalf of the victims
of Fixodent. These lawsuits allege that Procter &amp; Gamble misled consumers about
health risks and failed to provide adequate warnings and instructions to prevent
deviation from accepted use. 

A small amount of zinc is necessary for a balanced diet. However, excessive
exposure to zinc in denture creams can result in copper depletion, leading to
the development of severe neurological injuries and blood disorders. In August
2008, an article appearing in the peer reviewed journal "Neurology" specifically
linked zinc in denture cream to "profound neurologic disease" in four patients
reviewed. 

Dozens of denture cream zinc poisoning lawsuits have been consolidated in the
Denture Cream Products Liability Multidistrict Litigation currently pending in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami
Division, before the Honorable Judge Cecilia Altonaga (MDL No. 2051). In an
order filed on July 13, 2009, Judge Altonaga appointed Andres F. Alonso Esq., a
partner with Parker Waichman Alonso LLP, as Co- Lead Counsel to the Plaintiffs'
Steering Committee in the Denture Cream Products Liability Litigation. 

Parker Waichman Alonso has received thousands of calls from denture cream users
and continues to offer free consultations to the victims of denture cream zinc
poisoning. If you or a loved one uses or have used Fixodent and now suffer from

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Mar 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Vertigo announced today the company's plans to develop consumer and
enterprise mobile experiences for Windows(R) Phone 7 Series at Microsoft
Corp.'s MIX10 Conference. In anticipation of the launch of Windows Phone
7 Series in holiday 2010, Vertigo has been quietly working with the
Windows Phone 7 Series for key media and entertainment clients.

    Unlike competing smart phones, Windows Phone 7 Series combines Microsoft
Silverlight for rich Internet applications (RIAs) and the XNA Framework
for game development, which provides an end-to-end mobile development
platform based on a familiar programming language and toolset. "Windows
Phone 7 Series will enable Vertigo to build on our strength of designing
user experiences for a variety of form factors, while leveraging our
agile engineering process on the familiar Silverlight development
platform," said Paul Osburn, Engineering Director for Vertigo's Touch
practice. "The addition of XNA for 3D and game development raises the bar
both in terms of what's possible, and the types of applications we can
develop, with few limitations." 

    With a sleek, consumer-focused user experience, Windows Phone 7 Series
represents a fresh alternative to current providers. But that's just the
tip of the iceberg for Vertigo. As Silverlight market adoption steadily
accelerates, Vertigo sees using Silverlight to help increase the
portability of line of business applications as they begin to gain
momentum within the enterprise. 

    "With the introduction of Windows Phone 7 Series, Microsoft has delivered
a powerful development platform that extends from the Web, to desktop and
mobile devices, with Silverlight as the common thread," said Scott
Stanfield, CEO of Vertigo. "The maturity and extensibility of the
platform complements our diverse experience in developing solutions
ranging from rich Internet applications and media solutions, such as Deep
Zoom photo viewers and video players using Internet Information Services
(IIS) Smooth Streaming, to Touch-enabled solutions for Microsoft Surface,
Windows(R) 7 Touch, and now, Windows Phone 7 Series."

    As an early adopter of Microsoft technologies and one of the first
development firms to embrace Silverlight, Vertigo has a longstanding
history of delivering engaging and immersive experiences for both the
Web, and the emerging landscape of Touch interfaces and devices. The
proliferation of multi-touch has placed renewed emphasis on designing
context-aware experiences that provide relevant information, and ensure
that the right options are literally at your fingertips. 

    ABOUT VERTIGO

    Vertigo Software, Inc. is an award-winning design and development firm
that uses the latest Microsoft technologies to redefine the user
experience for the Web, mobile and multi-touch environments. Vertigo

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Mar 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation (TSX: TKM), a leading developer of
RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics, announced today the initiation of a
new research collaboration with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).

    Tekmira and Pfizer will collaborate on evaluating Tekmira's stable
nucleic acid-lipid particle (SNALP) technology to deliver small
interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules provided by Pfizer. Tekmira will be
responsible for preparing the SNALP formulations and Pfizer will evaluate
the formulations in preclinical models. Financial terms of the
collaboration were not disclosed.

    Dr. Mark J. Murray, Tekmira's President and CEO, said "We are pleased to
be working with Pfizer, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical
companies and an organization that has made a commitment to the
development of nucleic acid therapeutics. The collaboration combines
Tekmira's expertise in the delivery of RNAi therapeutics with Pfizer's
research excellence in nucleic acid therapeutics."

    "We continue to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies thereby broadening the use of our leading SNALP delivery
platform. Our goal is to sign additional collaborative agreements in
2010," added Dr. Murray.

    This is Tekmira's first formal research collaboration with Pfizer.
Tekmira currently has license or collaborative agreements in place with
seven other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

    About RNAi and SNALP

    RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat a broad number of human
diseases by "silencing" disease causing genes. The discoverers of RNAi, a
gene silencing mechanism used by all cells, were awarded the 2006 Nobel
Prize for Physiology or Medicine. RNAi therapeutics, such as "siRNAs,"
require delivery technology to be effective systemically. Lipid
nanoparticles (LNPs) are one of the most widely used siRNA delivery
approaches for systemic administration. Tekmira's SNALP (stable nucleic
acid-lipid particles) technology is the leading class of LNPs being used
in clinical development. SNALP technology encapsulates siRNAs with high
efficiency in uniform lipid nanoparticles which are effective in
delivering RNAi therapeutics to disease sites in numerous preclinical
models. SNALP formulations are manufactured by a proprietary method which
is robust, scalable and highly reproducible. SNALP-based products have
been reviewed by multiple FDA divisions for use in clinical trials. SNALP
formulations comprise several lipid components that can be adjusted to
suit the specific application.

    About Tekmira

    Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a biopharmaceutical company
focused on advancing novel RNAi therapeutics and providing its leading
lipid nanoparticle delivery technology to pharmaceutical partners.
Tekmira has been working in the field of nucleic acid delivery for over a
decade and has broad intellectual property covering SNALP and LNPs.

Tekmira is based in Vancouver, B.C.

Innovative provider of cloud computing management to support use of the IBM
Cloud
STAMFORD, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Kaavo, Inc., an innovative provider of solutions for managing distributed
applications in the clouds, today announced it has released the edition of IMOD
(Infrastructure and Middleware on Demand) for the IBM Cloud to provide
application centric infrastructure management. In beta version since October
2009, the IBM Smart Business Development and Test on the IBM Cloud has
officially launched today, and customers will be able to leverage IMOD. 

The IBM Cloud gives users immediate access to infrastructure resources such as
servers and storage to develop and test application code. Kaavo`s core product,
IMOD (Infrastructure and Middleware on Demand), configures the infrastructure
resources and deploys and runs the workload within minutes. With Kaavo`s IMOD
edition for IBM Cloud, users will have instant, secure access to infrastructure
resources, as well as seamless configuration, deployment and execution of their
workload. Benefits also include:

* One Click Deployment: With a single click, IMOD automatically brings online

growth. Kaavo`s patent-pending technology provides the ability to easily,
securely and efficiently run applications in the cloud, and as a result, users
maximize the full potential of cloud computing. 

"Kaavo and IBM have a shared vision to allow enterprise customers to run
applications and workloads on the cloud in an easy and secure way. With Kaavo
support of the IBM Cloud enterprises will be able to deliver on this vision,"
said Jamal Mazhar, Founder and CEO of Kaavo.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Mar 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
AtHoc, Inc., the pioneer and leader in network-centric emergency mass
notification systems, today announced the company will exhibit at
Microsoft's Air Force symposium, dubbed "Mission Critical," which is
taking place in Redmond, Wash., March 16 through March18. During the
Mission Critical symposium, AtHoc will demonstrate its AtHoc
IWSAlerts(TM) in its corporate booth at the event.

    The Mission Critical symposium provides a valuable forum for Microsoft
and its partners to demonstrate technologies that can support and benefit
U.S. Air Force (USAF) programs throughout the world. Attendance at this
symposium, as well as similar at events for the Army and Navy, is a
continuation of AtHoc's efforts to work with Microsoft and deliver
state-of-the-art mass notification technologies to the Department of
Defense (DoD) and other mutual customers.

    AtHoc is a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner and builds its solutions on
top of the Microsoft stack.

    AtHoc is the No. 1 provider of network-centric mass notification systems
to the U.S. military and is currently deployed at more than 175
installations worldwide. AtHoc specializes in enterprise deployments
supporting entire organizations -- Major Command, Region and Service --
from a private cloud application, hosted at internal DoD data centers. 

    Specifically in the USAF, AtHoc is helping to safeguard more than 500,000
USAF personnel at almost all USAF Major Commands and Direct Reporting
Units worldwide, with enterprise-level deployments at Air Force Air
Combat Command; Air Force Reserve Command; Air Education and Training
Command; U.S. Air Force Materiel Command; AF District of Washington; and
Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance Agency. AtHoc is
also deployed at the entire AF Central Command, supporting all USAF in
the central theatre. AtHoc also supports AF Recruiting Service, AF
Personnel Center and numerous bases in other USAF Major Commands.

    "The Microsoft Symposia places AtHoc in front of Air Force personnel to
demonstrate why major commands throughout the military have standardized
their network-centric emergency alerting with AtHoc," said Andy Anderson,
AtHoc vice president of DoD Operations. "AtHoc's field-proven
third-generation mass notification solution can alert hundreds of
thousands of people in minutes and provides real-time response tracking
reports for an enterprise-wide view of the status and safety of all
personnel. AtHoc IWSAlerts helps USAF facilities better protect personnel
and property in response to all types of threats."

    AtHoc provides the DoD with emergency mass notification technology that
unifies multiple forms of alerting into a single solution. Through the
AtHoc system, military facilities and entire commands can trigger alerts
to computers, mobile devices, landline telephones, cell phones, sirens,
public address systems, BlackBerry devices, digital displays, land mobile
radios and any channel that can be reached through an Internet Protocol
(IP) interface. 

    The centralized deployment of AtHoc IWSAlerts creates a USAF "Private
Cloud" supporting the Air Force enterprise while still meeting the mass
notification needs of individual localized facilities. This approach
significantly reduces infrastructure and maintenance costs, protects
sensitive contact information and allows a command to disseminate alerts
to all personnel, while providing each facility with its own "private"
alerting system. 

    About AtHoc
 AtHoc is the pioneer and recognized leader in providing
enterprise-class, network-centric emergency notification systems to
military, government and commercial organizations. AtHoc's products are
used for physical security, force protection, personnel accountability,
recall and regulatory compliance. Millions of end-users worldwide, in
organizations such as the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S.
Coast Guard, NASA, UCLA, Microsoft, Boeing and PricewaterhouseCoopers
rely on AtHoc's unified notification systems for their emergency alerting
and critical communication needs. AtHoc has partnered with market leaders
including Microsoft, Cisco, Dell, Harris, Siemens, Avaya, MIR3, Lockheed
Martin and others to bring these notification solutions to the public and
commercial markets.

with Office Communications Server 2007 is truly unique in the industry," said
Hugh Oakes, Managing Director Time2Market. "Now with AudioCodes' SPS, it's even
easier and more cost-effective to migrate to Office Communications Server 2007
R2. The requirement of changing out your legacy handsets is mitigated, we can
leverage the SIP handsets already in place. The ability to use the existing
handsets makes the migration to Unified Communications even more cost-effective
and provides yet another reason why we always recommend that our customers
deploy Office Communications Server with AudioCodes' gateways." Time2Market is a
Microsoft Gold Certified partner with the coveted voice specialization.

Enterprises migrating into the Microsoft Unified Communications environment have
been showing great interest in enabling cost-effective IP Phones to connect to
Office Communications Server. According to Synergy Research, the current
installed base of IP Phones in the market is approximately 65 million. By 2014,
around 20 million new IP Phones will be sold annually. Most of these phones have
not had direct access to Microsoft Office Communications Server. Gartner Magic
Quadrant for Unified Communications 2009 stated that "Enterprises looking into
UC, particularly those with Microsoft applications already in place, should
understand the Microsoft portfolio, because it represents a new paradigm for
communication by a market leader. Microsoft's solution, while comprehensive, is
also the basis for a range of partner offerings." Based on the Microsoft
leadership and customers' demand for partner solutions, customers can now
protect their existing investment in third-party IP-Phones, while enjoying the
full benefits of the Microsoft infrastructure, including unified call control,
integration with their Microsoft Office Communicator, presence information and
more.

"We believe that this is a very significant announcement since many enterprises
are dependent on Microsoft desktop applications and have been forced to live in
two separate worlds, one for their phone technology and the other for their
desktop software environment," said Elka Popova, North American Program
Director, Unified Communications &amp; Collaboration, Frost &amp; Sullivan. "Many
enterprises are looking for integrating the two worlds by connecting their
existing installed base of IP Phones directly to the Microsoft Unified
Communications environment."

The IP phones supported by SPS include AudioCodes' 300HD family of High
Definition IP Phones, as well as other third-party IP Phones, such as Cisco,
Avaya, Aastra, Polycom and other standards-based SIP phones. The mobile smart
phones support is enabled using AudioCodes' Mobile SIP clients, supporting all
major smart phones' operating systems, including Windows Mobile, iPhone OS,
Symbian and Android.

AudioCodes' 300HD family of IP Phones offer integrated, DSP-based support of
Microsoft Real Time Audio (RTA) codec and the support of Secured Real Time
Protocol (STRP) and SIP over TLS, enabling maximum security, high definition
calls between IP Phones and Office Communicator clients. In addition,
AudioCodes' phones provide enhanced presence and Active Directory support in the
phone user interface, offering enhanced user experience for the Microsoft
clients.

"Utilizing AudioCodes' Mediant family of Media Gateways, SPS can enable
connectivity of other vendors' SIP phones into the Microsoft environment,"
stated Lior Aldema, Chief Operating Officer at AudioCodes. "Supporting Secure
RTP and enabling a wide variety of narrowband and wideband codecs, AudioCodes'
SPS can connect legacy SIP phones into the Microsoft Office Communications
Server environment, while maintaining security, providing high quality voice and
user presence."

Existing customers of AudioCodes' Mediant gateways can now upgrade their
existing installed base to support SPS. The same gateway can support the SPS
functionality while providing a Media Gateway function between Microsoft Office
Communications Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server and the enterprise TDM
PBX and/or the PSTN. SPS can scale from small demos of a few users all the way
up to supporting enterprise installations of thousands of IP Phones and SIP
Mobile Clients. By optionally integrating it with the different AudioCodes'
Mediant Media Gateways it can scale from 120 concurrent RTP to SRTP calls on the
Mediant 1000 all the way up to 884 calls on the fault-tolerant Mediant 3000.

&lt;p&gt;New IT Technology Options Expand Choices for Enterprise-Level Deployments of
Thin Client Voice Applications in Warehouses
HAMILTON, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Voxware, Inc. (Nasdaq: VOXW), a leading supplier of voice picking software for
warehousing operations, announced support for the IBM WebSphere application
server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system. A major US retailer has
chosen this technology stack for the rollout of their Voxware 3 voice picking
solution. 

"Voice vendors traditionally offered few if any choices in system software
needed to operate their solutions," said Scott Yetter, Voxware CEO. "Most
companies have been moving toward thin client, loosely-coupled applications
deployed on true enterprise platforms because they are easier to scale, manage,
and support. Yet many voice solutions are fat client, tightly-coupled
applications that don`t fit easily into a modern IT technology stack. 

"Today`s announcement reflects Voxware`s commitment to modernize voice in the
warehouse by supporting the kind of technology options that today`s enterprise
IT organizations have integrated into their operational standards." 

Pricing for IBM WebSphere and Red Hat Enterprise Linux support is available from

&lt;p&gt;Free Metric Helps IT Teams Prioritize Microsoft Vulnerabilities
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
nCircle, the leader in security and compliance auditing solutions, today
released the nCircle Patch Priority Index for Microsoft, a monthly ranking of
the highest Microsoft-related vulnerabilities that adjusts to reflect how a
vulnerability`s risk changes over time. The free publicly available Patch
Priority Index (PPI) provides a repeatable, consistent metric that global IT
security teams can use to effectively prioritize the most critical Microsoft
vulnerabilities for remediation.

"With the prevalence of Microsoft products in use in organizations around the
world, the nCircle Patch Priority Index provides an objective list of
vulnerabilities that should be patched immediately," said Andrew Storms,
Director of Security Operations at nCircle.

Patch Priority Index rankings are based on nCircle`s Risk Score, a composite
metric developed over several years using data collected from hundreds of
thousands of security audits and designed to scale to very large networks. It
provides a highly granular metric to facilitate true prioritization based on
actual risk to the network.

A key component of the nCircle Risk Score is the elapsed time since the
vulnerability was publicly disclosed. This time component prioritizes new
patches within the context of all patches previously released by a vendor within
the preceding twelve months, information that is not available through other
public sources.

The Patch Priority Index for Microsoft will be updated regularly and is publicly
available to any IT security professional.PPI for other vendors will follow.

&lt;p&gt;* Deepwater Champion capable of drilling 12,190 meters in up to 3,660 meters of
water 
* Ultra-deepwater drillship to undertake 2011 drilling program in Turkish Black
Sea

ANKARA, Turkey--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Turkey B.V., an ExxonMobil affiliate, will
use the Deepwater Champion, a specially designed, newly built drillship from a
subsidiary of Transocean Ltd. to explore the deepwater Black Sea offshore
Turkey. 

Elwyn Griffiths, vice president, ExxonMobil Exploration Company, announced plans
for the Deepwater Champion during a speech today at the annual 9th Turkish Oil
and Gas Showcase and Conference in Ankara. 

"We look forward to utilizing a world-class drillship with superior
ultra-deepwater technology in the Turkish Black Sea," Griffiths said. 

Drew Goodbread, ExxonMobil Turkey general manager in Ankara, said the Deepwater
Champion is currently under construction at the Hyundai Heavy Industries
shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea. It is expected to drill its first well in the
Turkish Black Sea in the first half of 2011. 

Goodbread said the Deepwater Champion is a sixth-generation drillship capable of
drilling to 12,190 meters (40,000 feet) in up to 3,660 meters (12,000 feet) of
water. 

The vessel`s drilling derrick contains two drilling stations capable of a
variety of simultaneous operations to improve efficiency. 

The derrick has two removable sections for more efficient transit under the
bridges spanning the Bosphorus Strait at Istanbul. The double-hulled vessel is
self-propelled and capable of holding its position in open water in nine meter
(30 feet) waves and 60 knot (70 miles per hour) winds. 

ExxonMobil entered into an agreement with the Turkish national oil company TPAO
in November 2008 to jointly explore deepwater prospects in the Samsun block of
AR/TPO/3922 exploration license and the eastern portion of AR/TPO/3921
exploration license in the Black Sea. In January 2010, ExxonMobil signed an
agreement with Petrobras and TPAO to acquire a 25 percent interest in the Sinop,
Ayancik and &#199;ar&#351;amba sub-blocks of the AR/TPO/3922 exploration license. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project
plans and schedules and commercial arrangements could differ materially due to
changes in long-term oil and gas price levels or other market conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry; political or regulatory developments,
technical or operating factors; the outcome of commercial negotiations; and
other factors discussed under the heading "Risk Factors Affecting Future
Results" included in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's most recent Form 10-K and posted on
our website (www.exxonmobil.com).

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 (Reuters) - Beverage company
Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) on Tuesday said it would invest 1 billion
ringgit ($301.4 million) over the next five years to set up a
bottling plant in Malaysia, a move that could help the
Southeast Asian country offset recent large investment
outflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Malaysia recorded a net outflow of direct investment of
24.9 billion ringgit in 2009 after an outflow of 26.1 billion
ringgit in 2008 as it lagged reforming regional peers like
Indonesia in its bid to win foreign investment and as Malaysian
companies invested overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The new investment will directly create 600-800 new jobs
at the bottling plant, and is expected to create between 6000
and 8000 jobs with local suppliers," the company said in a
statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Malaysia's government started to liberalise its economy to
attract more investment when Prime Minister Najib Razak took
office in April last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, some reforms to tackle the budget deficit have
been rolled back and the government said at the weekend that it
had abandoned plans to introduce a goods and services tax,
following its failure to implement unpopular petrol price hikes
aimed at cutting its subsidy bill. [ID:nSGE62E002]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Royce Cheah; Editing by David Chance)

Intensive Lipitor Therapy Was Associated With Reduced Risk Of Cardiovascular Events In Two High-Risk Patient Groups</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100316005153/en

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Lipitor&#174; (atorvastatin calcium) 80 mg was associated with a significantly
reduced risk of major cardiovascular events compared with Lipitor 10 mg among
patients with both coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
who were obese or had metabolic syndrome. These data, from two sub-analyses of
the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial that were designed and completed
following the completion of TNT, were presented today atthe 59th Annual
Scientific Session of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) in Atlanta, Ga. 

"Nearly 26 million Americans suffer from CKD, which is often associated with
co-morbidities - such as heart disease, metabolic syndrome or obesity - that can
increase risk for heart attack and stroke," said Dr. Prakash Deedwania,
professor of Medicine, UCSF School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA and Chief,
Cardiology Section, VACCHCS/UCSF Program, Fresno, CA. "The new data presented at
ACC demonstrate that Lipitor 80 mg may help prevent cardiovascular events in
these high-risk patients." 

According to the new analyses, for patients with both CHD and CKD, being obese
or having metabolic syndrome may further increase their risk for cardiovascular
events. 

In one sub-analysis, which looked at the 1,859 patients in TNT who had CHD, CKD
and metabolic syndrome, Lipitor 80 mg was associated with a 35 percent reduction
in the risk of major cardiovascular events compared with Lipitor 10 mg. In a
separate sub-analysis of the 954 patients in TNT with CHD, CKD and obesity,
Lipitor 80 mg was associated with a 33 percent reduction in the risk of major
cardiovascular events compared with Lipitor 10 mg. For both sub-analyses, major
cardiovascular events included a combined endpoint of death from heart disease,
non-fatal heart attack, resuscitated cardiac arrest and fatal or non-fatal
stroke. 

The safety of Lipitor in these patient sub-sets was consistent with that in the
overall TNT trial. Lipitor is not approved for the treatment of CKD, obesity or
metabolic syndrome. 

About the TNT Study

The original TNT study was an investigator-led trial coordinated by an
independent steering committee and funded by Pfizer. The study enrolled 10,001
men and women with coronary heart disease aged 35 years to 75 years in 14
countries and followed them for an average of five years. After an eight week
run-in on Lipitor 10 mg, patients were randomized to receive either Lipitor 10
mg or Lipitor 80 mg. Primary study results were published in The New England
Journal of Medicine in 2005. 

The primary endpoint of the original TNT study was the time to occurrence of a
first major cardiovascular event, defined as death from heart disease, non-fatal
heart attack, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or non-fatal stroke. 

Lipitor 80 mg is not a starting dose. Lipitor is not approved in all countries
to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with existing heart
disease. 

Throughout the TNT study, Lipitor was generally well tolerated. 

About Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome

Obesity, defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher, affects more than
one-third of the U.S. adult population, according to the latest National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey. Obesity is now recognized by the American
Heart Association (AHA) as a major risk factor for CHD, which can lead to heart
attack. Obesity is also associated with metabolic syndrome, which the AHA
defines as the presence of three or more related health factors, including
insulin resistance, high waist circumference, low HDL cholesterol levels and
high blood pressure and triglycerides. Patients with metabolic syndrome are at
increased risk for CHD and other diseases related to plaque build-ups in artery
walls. 

About Chronic Kidney Disease

Patients with CKD do not effectively filter toxins from the blood. When CKD
progresses to kidney failure, either dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed.
CKD has been recognized as an important independent predictor of cardiovascular
risk, and patients with CKD are more likely to die from a cardiovascular event
than to reach end-stage renal disease. 

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

Lipitor is a prescription medicine that is used along with a low-fat diet. It
lowers the LDL ("bad" cholesterol) and triglycerides in your blood. It can raise
your HDL ("good" cholesterol) as well. Lipitor can lower the risk for heart
attack, stroke, certain types of heart surgery, and chest pain in patients who
have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease such as age, smoking, high
blood pressure, low HDL, or family history of early heart disease. 

Lipitor can lower the risk for heart attack or stroke in patients with diabetes
and risk factors such as diabetic eye or kidney problems, smoking, or high blood
pressure. 

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant. 

Patients taking Lipitor should tell their doctor if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctor about all medications they take. This may help
avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check your
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. Common side
effects are diarrhea, upset stomach, muscle and joint pain, and changes in some
blood tests.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Japanese tax authorities have
accused IBM's (IBM.N) Japan unit of failing to report more than
$4.4 billion in income, and the unit may be asked to pay more
than $300 million in back and additional taxes, the Asahi
newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM Japan spokesman Motoyuki Suzuki said that taxation
authorities had asked for a correction in the amount of taxes
paid but that the company believes it has made its filing in
line with the law and intends to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Asahi said 400 billion yen ($4.4 billion) in income
would be the biggest unreported amount discovered by Japanese
tax authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newspaper said IBM Japan had made a profit in 2008 on
its operations but a sale of shares within its group structure
led it to report a loss and make no tax payment. Japanese
authorities have determined that the moves constitute tax
avoidance, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Japan's taxation bureau declined to comment
on the report.

&lt;p&gt;A bug in Microsoft's software gives hackers a way to exploit virtual Windows machines which would be attack-proof if they were running on real hardware, a researcher said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw is in some of Microsoft's virtualization software, including Windows XP Mode , the free add-on for Windows 7 that lets users of the newer OS run older applications in a virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core Security went public with information about the flaw yesterday, seven months after reporting the problem, because Microsoft declined to patch it. "They don't believe this requires a patch," Ivan Arce, CTO of Core Security, said in an interview today. "They said that they would address it with an update or in a service pack some time in the future. We believe this needs to be fixed sooner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft confirmed that it doesn't consider the bug in Virtual PC, Virtual PC 2007 and Virtual Server 2005 a security hole . "The functionality that Core calls out is not an actual vulnerability per se," said Paul Cooke, a director for Microsoft who manages enterprise security technology in Windows group. "Instead, they are describing a way for an attacker to more easily exploit security vulnerabilities that must already be present on the system," he continued. "It's a subtle point, but one that folks should really understand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core and Microsoft don't disagree on the facts, said Arce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flaw makes it possible for hackers to bypass several major Windows security defenses, including DEP (data execution prevention) and ASRL (address space layout randomization), that are designed to deflect some types of attacks against Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the two companies don't see eye-to-eye on the need for a patch. "We don't agree with Microsoft's decision not to patch," said Arce. "Applications in a virtualized environment are more easily exploitable than if they were running on real hardware. This should be fixed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackers could exploit the flaw to attack virtualized copies of Windows that normally would be immune to attack, or at the least, much more difficult to attack, because of mechanisms like DEP and ASLR, Arce said. And the bug could make vulnerabilities once thought trivial, and not worth the trouble to patch, worthy of exploitation. "In light of this bug, vulnerabilities believed to not apply to the virtualized OS and that were dismissed as not exploitable, may, in fact, be exploitable," Arce added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arce acknowledged that by publishing its lengthy advisory -- which includes proof-of-concept attack code -- Core was pressuring Microsoft to patch. "We understand that it may be difficult to fix, but this puts pressure on them to do something about it sooner rather than later," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Hyper-V technology, which is employed by Windows Server 2008, is not affected by the flaw, Microsoft and Core agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the "guest" operating systems running in virtual machines are at risk, the "host" operating system -- the one powering the actual physical hardware -- is not, Microsoft assured customers. Nor can the flaw be used to jump from one virtualized guest OS on a single machine to another. Even so, Microsoft's Cooke urged users to run virtualized applications on the desktop only when there was no substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual PC are great bridging strategies to help customers who have legacy applications get up and running on Windows 7," he said in an entry to the Windows Security blog . "For those customers who need Windows XP Mode, they should look to install only the required subset of applications that need Windows XP in order to function properly while planning to move those applications to Windows 7 in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Virtualization software is actual software, it's not magic," said Arce. "It's vulnerable, and sometimes bugs in it are not minimal. Should we wait five years -- and I'm exaggerating here -- for Microsoft to fix this, but not tell anyone? Sure, it may take some time for Microsoft to fix this, but there are other virtualization packages people can use that don't have this vulnerability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core's advisory spelled that out in plain English, telling users to either run mission-critical Windows applications on non-virtualized systems or to use alternate virtualization software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arce credited Nicolas Economou, who works at Core as an exploit writer, with uncovering the bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has taken the same stance in the past when it's argued that what others classify as security vulnerabilities it believes are nothing of the sort. Nearly three years ago, for instance, the company claimed that Office 2007 crashes reported as flaws were actually part of the suite's design .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Mesa and Disney declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bid deadline for Miramax comes as binding offers for another storied Hollywood studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, also come due on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platinum Equity Partners, a Beverly Hills investment firm headed by Tom Gores, is also expected to bid for Miramax, the independent company behind such art-house fare as "Pulp Fiction" and "No Country for Old Men," sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weinstein Co, headed by Bob and Harvey Weinstein, who launched Miramax in 1979 and then sold it to Disney in 1993, would also bid, other sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources have said Disney is seeking more than $650 million for Miramax, which it bought from the Weinsteins for $80 million, but that several initially interested parties, like Summit Entertainment and Lions Gate Entertainment, have balked at the price. It was unclear if Lions Gate is still interested, but Summit is no longer interested, according to a source familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, Summit, Mesa, Lions Gate, Platinum and the Weinstein Co declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the company's website, Mesa's Patricof has worked on various entertainment industry transactions and has extensive experience in Hollywood on digital initiatives, including a stint at Creative Artists Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources said Mesa was packaging a buyer for Miramax that involves both a strategic and private equity bidder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in February, the Weinstein Co confirmed its interest in Miramax. After selling Miramax to Disney in 1993, the Weinsteins remained as co-chief executives until five years ago, when they left to form the Weinstein Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the situation said the Weinsteins had been approached by financial partners to help them purchase Miramax, but details about their financing were unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources said an earlier round of non-binding bids for MGM went as high as $1.7 billion, but bidders are unlikely to put in second round offers above $1.5 billion after studying its assets like a library of mostly older gems like the James Bond and Pink Panther franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MGM's creditors may also decide to keep and restructure the studio, possibly filing for pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, sources have said. MGM is owned by a group including private equity firms TPG, Providence Equity Partners, DLJ Merchant Banking Partners and Quadrangle Group, and media companies Sony Corp and Comcast Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sue Zeidler; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lenny Dykstra filed a $100 million lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co alleging he was fraudulently induced into borrowing more money than he could afford, leading to the former star baseball center fielder's bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dykstra contended that Washington Mutual Inc, now owned by JPMorgan, let him borrow $20.5 million even though it knew the sum was "well beyond" his means. He said the thrift them reneged on an assurance it would let him refinance a mortgage used to buy a mansion from hockey legend Wayne Gretzky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Defendant issued a loan designed to fail," Dykstra said in a complaint filed on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court. "The end result was that plaintiff incurred losses of approximately $100 million." Dykstra seeks triple and punitive damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined to comment. Arturo Cisneros, a court-appointed trustee liquidating Dykstra's assets through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding in California, was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case arose out of Dykstra's roughly $17.4 million purchase in 2007 of Gretzky's six-bedroom, eight-bath mansion on 6.7 acres in Thousand Oaks, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dykstra, 47, alleged Washington Mutual agreed to lend him $12 million. He said a loan officer then steered him to a different lender for an $8.5 million "piggyback" loan, payable in full in one year, to cover the rest of the mortgage and to pay off loans at a property in Simi Valley, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dykstra alleged this arrangement left him responsible for $135,000 in monthly loan and property tax payments, which was more than then the $125,000 in monthly income he then had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dykstra said he was eventually forced to enter a series of transactions to pay off the $8.5 million loan, causing him to take on more debt and sell assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last July, Dykstra filed for bankruptcy in the wake of more than 20 lawsuits over his entrepreneurial activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Dykstra asked a California judge to dismiss that case, saying he would do a better job satisfying creditor claims than the trustee, whom he said is "only interested in dumping assets as quickly as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By ending the bankruptcy proceedings, Dykstra said he could "once again claim his role as a productive member of society."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hearing in that case is set for April 6. The Thousand Oaks mansion is being listed by Ewing  Associates Sotheby's, with a $14.9 million asking price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dykstra retired from baseball in 1996 after 12 years with the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies.

&lt;p&gt;With improved speed and support for HTML 5, Internet Explorer 9 could be Microsoft's next step toward restoring its old mojo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hasn't shown very much of its next Web browser, and hasn't announced a release date. The most you can do is preview some of Internet Explorer 9's capabilities, which say nothing about the browser's user interface. Still, what Microsoft has shown so far is enough to get people excited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of Internet Explorer have lagged behind other browsers on speed and support for new technology --the problems that Microsoft is working on with IE9. While Microsoft used to insist that Javascript speed wasn't that important, it's now using benchmarks to show that it can go toe-to-toe with any browser. Support for HTML 5, which is still not a standard, hardware-accelerated 3D graphics show that Microsoft is thinking ahead on performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we don't know about yet are user interface and security. Even if Microsoft overhauled neither, Internet Explorer 9 would still be in pretty good shape. IE8 got creative with accelerators and Web slices. It also caught up with the competition on features like drag-and-drop tabs and private browsing. With the addition of other security features, a test by NSS Labs, albeit sponsored by Microsoft, found that Internet Explorer 8 was the safest browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But users of Chrome and Firefox are likely to say that something just feels faster about their browsers, and for good reason: PCWorld's speed tests from last summer put Chrome ahead of the pack, and Firefox in front of Internet Explorer. With IE9, Microsoft's at least showing a willingness to join the horse race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Microsoft still has a wide lead in the browser wars. In the most recent market share estimates from NetApplications, Internet Explorer has 61.2 percent, compared to 24.2 percent for its closest competitor, Firefox. However, IE's share slides every month, and the browser now faces tougher competition from Google Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that Microsoft will be powerless to bring back defecting users. There may be something about the look and feel of Internet Explorer, or its standing as the most common target for security attacks, that drives people away. But at least Microsoft's tackling the issues that have held its browser back from greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/191724&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX (Reuters) - Texas Rangers manager Ron Washington tested positive for cocaine last July but has since completed a drug-treatment program and will be retained by the team, the Rangers' website said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I am truly sorry for my careless, dangerous and frankly stupid behavior last year," Washington said at a hastily called news conference in Surprise, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington admitted to using cocaine once during the first half of last season, the website (texas.rangers.mlb.com) said. He subsequently told the Rangers about his drug use and entered a treatment program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 57-year-old former major league infielder offered to resign but the Rangers decided to keep him on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington has been the Rangers' manager for three seasons, compiling a 241-245 record. The club finished second in the American League West in 2009 with an 87-75 record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington addressed the players early Wednesday after learning that several media outlets were about to report the story, the website said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Steve Ginsburg, Editing by Clare Fallon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARLINGTON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)&#174; today applauded Senators John Kerry
(D-MA) and Richard Lugar (R-IN) for introducing the StartUp Visa Act of 2010 and
urge Congress to take action toward quick passage. This bipartisan legislation
would create thousands of new jobs and spur innovation in the United States by
creating a new visa category for immigrant entrepreneurs called EB-6.
Entrepreneurs would qualify after proving they have raised $250,000 from a
recognized venture capital firm in the U.S. 

"CEA firmly believes innovative immigrants are key to restoring America to its
leading role in job creation and global competitiveness," said CEA President and
CEO, Gary Shapiro. "The U.S. economy needs to open itself up to new
opportunities and innovation by attracting the most ingenious entrepreneurs from
around the world and keeping them in the United States." 

Some of our greatest companies including Yahoo!, Google, Sun, Intel, Audiovox,
Qualcomm and eBay were founded and led by immigrants whose successful companies
today employ hundreds of thousands of Americans. Today`s strict visa rules,
however, make it difficult for many immigrants to pursue opportunities in the
United States. 

"We support the pending legislation (StartUp Visa Act of 2010) that would
attract more entrepreneurs to the United States," added Shapiro. "Keeping the
best and brightest within our borders is what made our country great, and it is
necessary to maintain America`s innovation economy and to remain competitive on
the global stage."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades, assigns Rating Outlooks and Loss Severity (LS) Ratings
to JP Morgan Commercial Mortgage, series 2004-C1. A full list of ratings follows
the end of the press release. 

Affirmations are due to the pool's stable performance and minimal future
expected losses following Fitch's prospective review of potential stresses to
the transaction. The downgrades are the result of projected losses on the two
specially serviced assets (1.58%). Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction
of any changes to the ratings over the next one to two years. 

There are 105 of the original 117 loans remaining in the transaction, 19 of
which have defeased (13.3% of the current transaction balance). 

The largest specially serviced asset (1.39%) is an office building located in
San Diego, CA. The loan transferred to special servicing Oct. 11, 2009 due to
monetary default. The borrower has been unresponsive and the special servicer is
still collecting due diligence. Occupancy at the property declined to 58.7% as
of February 2009, down from 94% at issuance. 

The second largest specially serviced asset (0.19%) is a multifamily property
located in Arlington, TX. The loan transferred to the special servicing Jan. 9,
2009 due to material impairment default. The borrower negotiated to extend the
date to perform required repairs at the property until the end of March 2010.
Borrower also won a $2.3 million judgment from the original seller which has
been appealed. The special servicer is working with the borrowers' counsel to
defend against the appeal so proceeds can be used to pay down the loan. The
borrower has continued to remit monthly payments, which are currently being held
since the loan has been accelerated. 

Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining non-defeased loans by applying a
10% reduction to 2008 fiscal year end net operating income and applying an
adjusted market cap rate between 7.5% and 10% to determine value. 

Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage commercial mortgage
backed securities (CMBS), each loan also underwent a refinance test by applying
an 8% interest rate and 30-year amortization schedule based on the stressed cash
flow. Loans that could refinance to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 times
or higher were considered to pay off at maturity. Of the non-defeased or
non-specially serviced loans, none incurred a loss when compared to Fitch's
stressed value. 

Fitch has downgraded and assigned LS ratings as follows: 

--$207.3 million class M to 'B/LS5' from 'B+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$303.2 million class N to 'B-/LS5' from 'B'; Outlook Negative; 

--$172.4 million class P to 'B-/LS5' from 'B-'; Outlook Negative. 

In addition Fitch has affirmed, assigned Rating Outlooks and LS ratings as
follows: 

--$207.3 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$303.2 million class A-3 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$172.4 million class A-1A at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-Only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-Only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable. 

--$27.4 million class B at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$11.7 million class C at 'AAA/LS5'; Outlook Stable; 

--$22.1 million class D at 'AA-/LS5'; Outlook Stable; 

--$13 million class E at 'A/LS5'; Outlook Stable; 

--$11.7 million class F to 'A-/LS5'; Outlook Stable; 

--$9.1 million class G at 'BBB+/LS5'; Outlook Stable; 

--$10.4 million class H at 'BBB-/LS5'; Outlook Stable; 

--$6.5 million class J at 'BB+/LS5'; Outlook Negative; 

--$5.2 million class K to 'BB/LS5'; Outlook Negative; 

--$10.4 million class L at 'BB-/LS5'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch does not rate the $11.1 million class NR.

&lt;p&gt;Continues to Urge Procter &amp; Gamble to Issue a Full and Immediate Recall of
Zinc-Containing Fixodent Denture Adhesives
GREAT NECK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Parker Waichman Alonso LLP is pleased with Procter &amp; Gamble's recent decision to
include a caution on its Web site, http://www.dentureliving.com/, regarding the
health risks posed by excessive exposure to zinc in Fixodent denture cream. The
caution was added to the Web site by Procter &amp; Gamble with little fanfare in
recent days. In addition to informing consumers that Fixodent contains zinc, the
new caution states that: "Some reports suggest that excessive and prolonged zinc
intake may be linked to adverse health effects." The entire text may be viewed
at: http://www.dentureliving.com/fixodent-denture-products/how-to-use-fixodent. 

While Procter &amp; Gamble's decision to finally acknowledge the potential risks
posed by excessive exposure to the zinc in Fixodent is to be commended, this
action is still not adequate to protect consumers from this serious public
health threat. In fact, we feel that the lack of a clear warning combined with
ambiguous instructions for use only serve to enhance the danger faced by
consumers. For that reason, Parker Waichman Alonso continues to call on Procter
&amp; Gamble to immediately issue a full recall of all zinc-containing Fixodent
denture cream products. Procter &amp; Gamble`s main competitor in the market for
denture adhesives, GlaxoSmithKline, recently decided to cease marketing its zinc
containing adhesives. For the sake of millions of denture adhesive users
worldwide, Procter &amp; Gamble needs to take the same action. 

"While any new caution regarding Fixodent is a step in the right direction, it
does not go nearly far enough," says Andres Alonso, a partner of Parker Waichman
Alonso. "Procter &amp; Gamble`s attempt to do this quietly will leave too many
consumers unaware of the danger that Fixodent could pose to their health. As
long as these products continue to be sold, they remain a serious public health
threat." 

Parker Waichman Alonso LLP has filed numerous lawsuits on behalf of the victims
of Fixodent. These lawsuits allege that Procter &amp; Gamble misled consumers about
health risks and failed to provide adequate warnings and instructions to prevent
deviation from accepted use. 

A small amount of zinc is necessary for a balanced diet. However, excessive
exposure to zinc in denture creams can result in copper depletion, leading to
the development of severe neurological injuries and blood disorders. In August
2008, an article appearing in the peer reviewed journal "Neurology" specifically
linked zinc in denture cream to "profound neurologic disease" in four patients
reviewed. 

Dozens of denture cream zinc poisoning lawsuits have been consolidated in the
Denture Cream Products Liability Multidistrict Litigation currently pending in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami
Division, before the Honorable Judge Cecilia Altonaga (MDL No. 2051). In an
order filed on July 13, 2009, Judge Altonaga appointed Andres F. Alonso Esq., a
partner with Parker Waichman Alonso LLP, as Co- Lead Counsel to the Plaintiffs'
Steering Committee in the Denture Cream Products Liability Litigation. 

Parker Waichman Alonso has received thousands of calls from denture cream users
and continues to offer free consultations to the victims of denture cream zinc
poisoning. If you or a loved one uses or have used Fixodent and now suffer from
neurological problems, please contact our office by visiting www.yourlawyer.com.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, March 17 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on
Wednesday it expects normal operations to return soon at its
279,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in El
Segundo, California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The refinery began flaring on Tuesday due to "issues with

in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The issues ... were corrected quickly and we should be
back to normal shortly," Spackman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron warned of unplanned flaring at the refinery in a
notice filed with California pollution regulators on Wednesday.
The notice said the flaring could last through Thursday
morning.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgraded, assigned Loss Severity (LS) ratings and revised Rating
Outlooks for J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. mortgage
pass-through certificates, series 2004-PNC1, as follows: 

--$13.7 million class C to 'BBB/LS3' from 'AA-'; Outlook to Negative from
Stable; 

--$17.8 million class D to 'BB/LS3' from 'A'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$11 million class E to 'B/LS3' from 'A-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$16.5 million class F to 'B-/LS3' from 'BBB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$11 million class G to 'B-/LS3' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch affirmed and revised the Outlook on the following class: 

--$28.8 million class B at 'AA/LS2'; Outlook to Negative from Stable. 

In addition, Fitch affirmed, maintained Stable Outlooks, and assigned LS ratings
to the following classes as indicated: 

--$213 million class A-1A at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$57.7 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$98 million class A-3 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$426.2 million class A-4 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable. 

--$20.6 million class H at 'CCC/RR1'; 

--$2.7 million class J at 'C/RR6'; 

--$6.9 million class K at 'C/RR6'; 

--$4.1 million class L at 'C/RR6'; 

--$5.5 million class M at 'C/RR6'; 

--$2.7 million class N at 'C/RR6'; 

--$2.7 million class P at 'C/RR6'. 

Fitch does not rate the $8.7 million class NR. Class A-1 has paid in full. 

The downgrades are due to an increase in expected losses on specially serviced
assets coupled with expected losses following Fitch's prospective review of
potential stresses to the transaction. The majority of the total expected losses
(79%) are associated with loans currently in special servicing. 

As of the February 2010 distribution date, the pool's certificate balance has
paid down 13.6% to $947.7 million from $1.1 billion at issuance. 

There are 96 of the original 100 loans remaining in transaction, 16 of which
have defeased (23% of the current transaction balance). There are ten specially
serviced loans of which five are current, three are 90 days delinquent and two
are 60 days delinquent. Fitch expects losses from loans currently in special
servicing to deplete classes J thru NR and impact class H. 

The largest specially serviced asset (5.1%) was originally secured by a
portfolio of six retail properties totaling 683,846 square feet (sf), located in
CT, NH, NC, and TN; of which two have been sold. The loan was transferred to
special servicing in July 2008. The Borrower is a subsidiary of Centro
Properties Group, and Centro did not have the ability to obtain new debt.
Originally, a modification was negotiated, approved and documented which
extended the maturity date to Feb. 1, 2010 and provided terms for the partial
release of collateral (greater of 125% of allocated loan balance or lender
approved net sale proceeds) and the full repayment of all lender costs and fees
(including SS fees). A second loan modification dated Jan. 29, 2010 was executed
extending the loan until Feb. 1, 2011 and allowing for another one-year option
to extend to Feb. 1, 2012. 

The second largest specially serviced asset (3.4%) is secured by a portfolio of
five properties (four office and one industrial) located in southern New
Hampshire and northern Boston, Massachusetts, totaling 527,749 sf. The loan
transferred to special servicing in March 2009 due to the borrower's inability
to make debt service payments as a result of the loss of three large tenants.
The borrower informed the special servicer that insufficient tenant improvement
funds caused the property to lose tenants and made lease-up nearly impossible.
Additionally, the Guarantor is in litigation with the equity partner. A receiver
was appointed in June 2009 with the ability to market and sell the property. The
property is currently being marketed for sale and Fitch expects significant
losses upon liquidation of the asset. 

Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining non defeased loans by applying a
10% reduction to 2008 fiscal year end net operating income and applying an
adjusted market cap rate between 7.5% and 10% to determine value. 

Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage CMBS, each loan also
underwent a refinance test by applying an 8% interest rate and 30-year
amortization schedule based on the stressed cash flow. Loans that could
refinance to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 times or higher were
considered to payoff at maturity. Of the non-defeased or non-specially serviced
loans, six loans (4.5% of the pool) incurred a loss when compared to Fitch's
stressed value. 

Additional information on Fitch's amended criteria for analyzing recent vintage
U.S. CMBS is available in the July 7, 2009 report, 'Surveillance Methodology for
Recent Vintage U.S. CMBS,' which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' under

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's next-generation Internet Explorer 9 browser may not be anywhere close to competition, but you can test drive a "platform preview" of the software that provides a taste of IE9's capabilities. So what's the deal with Redmond's upcoming browser, and how does it differ from IE8 and worthy competitors such as Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox, Opera Software's Opera, and Apple's Safari? Here's a quick primer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's New in Internet Explorer 9? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is touting IE's speedy performance and its much-improved support for Web standards. The browser's strongest attribute is likely its adherence to HTML5, the major revision of Web's core markup language that's still under development. HTML5 will allow IE9 (and other browsers) to move beyond resource hogging browser plug-ins, like the ubiquitous Adobe Flash, to display multimedia content online. Toss in better CSS 3 support (to help Web designers created the right look for their sites) and an improved JavaScript engine (to the crank up the speed of Web apps), and IE9 promises to be a more nimble browser that eschews the slow, lumbering Internet Explorer versions of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Does IE9's Interface Look?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's too to say. Since the Platform Preview isn't a compete browser, it's not a good indicator of IE9's final fit and finish. However, given the growing popular of Google Chrome, a streamlined browser with few menus to befuddle users, there's hope that Microsoft will give IE9 a cleaner look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So What's the IE9 Platform Preview?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Preview is primarily a way for Web developers to test their sites and see how they can implement HTML5's capabilities, Microsoft says. Redmond plans to release a new Preview version every 8 weeks or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I use it in Place of My Regular Browser? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. The Platform Preview isn't a fully-functional browser. There's no back button, for instance, or an address bar. It opens links in your default browser, not the Preview app. In addition, some of the features may or may not appear in the shipping version of IE9, depending on feedback from Platform Preview testers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any Particularly Cool Platform Preview Features? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has released a few technology demos that spotlight IE9's improved handling of JavaScript, its HTML5 capabilities, and its support for hardware-accelerated graphics. These are mostly simple demonstrations, such as flying images, map zooming, an HTML5 t-shirt designer, and GPU-powered falling balls. Naturally, you'll need to download and install the Platform Preview to check them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the Preview Run on My PC?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, if you're running either Windows 7 or Vista. On Vista, however, you'll need to install Internet Explorer 8 (if you haven't already) and the Platform Update for Windows Vista, an OS upgrade that allows Vista to use some Windows 7 technologies.  And while the IE9 Platform Preview comes only in a 32-bit x86 version, it'll run on 64-bit Windows 7 and Vista PCs too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm Running Windows XP. What About Me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, you're out of luck. The GPU-powered graphics of the IE9 Platform Preview rely on display driver enhancements first introduced in Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Will IE9 Be Ready? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear. Microsoft plans to release a beta version of IE9 after feedback from Platform Preview users indicates the technologies are ready for everyday Web browsing. Again, with roughly two months between Platform Preview releases, it's a safe bet that a shipping IE9 is still months away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Features Will be in the IE9 Beta? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn't saying. Obviously, however, the features highlighted in the Platform Preview, including support for HTML5 and other Web standards, will be a cornerstone of the new release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/191687&lt;/p&gt;

* Bohrschiff f&#252;r extreme Meerestiefen wird 2011 ein Bohrprogramm im t&#252;rkischen
Teil des Schwarzen Meeres durchf&#252;hren

ANKARA, T&#252;rkei--(Business Wire)--
Die ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Turkey B.V., ein Unternehmen des
weltweiten ExxonMobil Konzerns, wird die Deepwater Champion einsetzen, um die
tiefen Gew&#228;sser des Schwarzen Meeres vor der t&#252;rkischen K&#252;ste zu erkunden. Dabei
handelt es sich um ein speziell konstruiertes Bohrschiff, das von einem
Zweigunternehmen der Transocean Ltd. neu gebaut wird. 

Elwyn Griffiths, Vizepr&#228;sident, ExxonMobil Exploration Company, gab heute das
Vorhaben mit der Deepwater Champion bekannt anl&#228;sslich seiner Rede zur 9.
Internationalen Fachmesse und Konferenz f&#252;r &#214;l und Gas im t&#252;rkischen Ankara. 

&#8222;Wir freuen uns auf den Einsatz eines Bohrschiffs der Spitzenklasse mit
&#252;berlegener Ultra-Tiefseetechnologie im t&#252;rkischen Schwarzen Meer ", so
Griffiths. 

Drew Goodbread, Generaldirektor ExxonMobil Turkey in Ankara, sagte, dass sich
die Deepwater Champion derzeit im Bau befindet in der Werft der Hyundai Heavy
Industries in Ulsan, S&#252;dkorea. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass sie ihre Bohrungen
in der ersten Jahresh&#228;lfte von 2011 im t&#252;rkischen Teil des Schwarzen Meeres
aufnehmen wird. 

Goodbread erkl&#228;rte, dass es sich bei der Deepwater Champion um ein Bohrschiff
der sechsten Generation handele, das bei einer Wassertiefe von 3.660 Metern
12.190 Meter tief bohren k&#246;nne. 

Der Bohrturm des Schiffes hat zwei Arbeitspl&#228;tze, so dass eine Reihe von
Aufgaben gleichzeitig ausgef&#252;hrt werden kann, was die Effizienz erh&#246;ht.. 

Der Bohrturm hat zwei demontierbare Teile, damit die Br&#252;cken durchfahren werden
k&#246;nnen, die sich in Istanbul &#252;ber den Bosporus spannen. Das mit Eigenantrieb
versehene Doppelh&#252;llenschiff kann auf offener See seine Position noch bei neun
Meter hohen Wellen und einer Windgeschwindigkeit von 60 Knoten (110 km/h)
halten. 

ExxonMobil hatte im November 2008 mit der staatlichen t&#252;rkischen &#214;lgesellschaft
TPAO einen Vertrag dar&#252;ber geschlossen, die Vorkommen im Tiefseebereich des
Samsun-Blocks der Explorationslizenz AR/TPO/3922 und des &#246;stlichen Teils der
AR/TPO/3921 im Schwarzen Meer gemeinsam zu erforschen. Im Januar 2010
unterzeichnete ExxonMobil au&#223;erdem einen Vertrag mit Petrobras und TPAO &#252;ber den
Erwerb eines 25-prozentigen Anteils an den Teilbl&#246;cken Sinop, Ayancik und
&#199;ar&#351;amba der Explorationslizenz AR/TPO/3922.

&lt;p&gt; * Says tests on Visa transactions successful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says network infrastructure "almost ready" for Visa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, March 17 (Reuters) - Redecard RDCD3.SA,
Brazil's second-largest credit card payment processor, will
start processing Visa card transactions on July 1 as
competition heightens in the nation's $190 billion industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sao Paulo-based Redecard, which mainly processes MasterCard
transactions in Brazil but does not have an exclusivity
agreement with the U.S. company, said in a regulatory filing on
Wednesday that it is working on a licensing plan for Visa
cards. Tests were carried out successfully, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redecard's network infrastructure is "almost ready" to
begin processing Visa transactions, the filing added.
Redecard's network currently clears payments from 17 different
card companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move comes as Brazil, Latin America's most populous
country, moves to boost competition in the industry, where
customers and merchants complain about exorbitant rates and a
dearth of options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proposals unveiled last October include ending the
exclusivity that local card operator Cielo (CIEL3.SA) has with
Visa (V.N). Cielo, formerly known as VisaNet, and Redecard have
a combined market share above 90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redecard shares gained 0.07 percent to 28.02 reais on
Wednesday, compared with an increase of 0.64 percent in the
benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP.

&lt;p&gt;  SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Mar 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC), a leader in viewing,
collaboration and redaction technology, announced today that its Net-It
Enterprise 7.0 automated document publishing platform will convert
oversized CAD drawings -- including AutoCAD(R), MicroStation, and
SolidWorks formats -- images and office documents to Microsoft Deep Zoom
images. Created by Microsoft Labs, Deep Zoom is revolutionary technology
that enables high resolution viewing of images as a collection. The
images can be accessed through Silverlight, Seadragon AJAX and the
Seadragon iPhone App.

    Architects, contractors, facilities management professionals and
attorneys specializing in these practice areas will benefit from the new
portability and instant accessibility of drawings and project files
afforded by this technology. With Net-It Enterprise, new drawings or
documents are automatically detected, processed and added to RSS-ready
Deep Zoom collections, ensuring project collections are always current.
Contractors, sub-contractors, inspectors and other authorized personnel
can call up the latest drawings on their desktops, iPhones or other
mobile devices from online project RSS feeds, right from the job site,
while at a meeting or anywhere else. 

    Net-It Enterprise and Deep Zoom is the first technology combination that
truly makes even the largest CAD drawings from a variety of CAD systems
electronically accessible in the field without carrying rolls of
blueprints everywhere. Because Net-It delivers such high resolution,
users can zoom in to the smallest detail with excellent fidelity. 

    "Net-It's ability to publish CAD drawings, images and documents to
Microsoft Deep Zoom offers professionals in construction-related firms
immediate access to the drawings and documents they need with great
resolution, even on an iPhone," said Gary Heath, President and CEO of
IGC. "In fact, with the great interaction that smartphone touch screens
offer, it is remarkably easy to navigate huge drawings quickly." 

    The Microsoft Seadragon iPhone App is free and can be downloaded from the
iTunes App Store. Net-It Enterprise is scalable server software that can
process many different types of file formats and create PDF, secure CSF,
TIFF, DWF, JPG/PNG thumbnails and now Deep Zoom output. In addition,
Net-It Enterprise can burn-in annotations, stamps and watermarks and it
can be integrated to any collaboration portal or data management solution.

Other Data Support the Inclusion of Pneumococcal Serotypes 6A and 19A in
Prevenar 13


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


According to results from a Phase III safety and immunogenicity study presented
today, Prevenar 13* (Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, [13-valent,
adsorbed]) was shown to be immunogenic and generally well tolerated in healthy
young children who had received at least three prior doses of Prevenar*
(Pneumococcal Saccharide Conjugated Vaccine, Adsorbed). These data were
presented today at the 7th International Symposium on Pneumococci and
Pneumococcal Diseases (ISPPD) in Tel Aviv, Israel. 

Prevenar 13 includes the seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in
Prevenar plus six additional serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). Together,
these 13 serotypes represent the most prevalent invasive disease-causing strains
in young children worldwide. 

"Prevenar has significantly reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal
disease in young children in areas where it is routinely used. The data from
this Phase III study showed that children up to 5 years of age previously
vaccinated with Prevenar had an increased immune response against all 13
serotypes included in Prevenar 13," says Robert W. Frenck, Jr., M.D., the
study`s coordinating investigator and professor of pediatrics, Cincinnati
Children's Hospital Medical Center. 

Also presented at this meeting were data comparing immunogenicity and functional
antibody responses in young children who were administered Prevenar and Prevenar
13. It has been suggested that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that include
serotypes 6B and 19F may provide some cross protection against invasive disease
caused by 6A and 19A. The data presented suggest that the immunogenicity and
functional antibody responses induced by Prevenar 13 for serotypes 6A and 19A
were greater than the responses elicited by Prevenar. These results are believed
to be attributable to the inclusion of these two serotypes in Prevenar 13. 

"These data further suggest the importance of providing direct coverage against
the 13 most common pneumococcal disease-causing serotypes worldwide," says
Emilio Emini, Ph.D., chief scientific officer, Vaccine Research, Pfizer Inc.
"Notably, serotypes 6A and 19A, which are included in Prevenar 13, are prevalent
in many regions of the world." 

About the Studies

Abstract #153: Immunogenicity and Safety of 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate
Vaccine in Children Previously Immunized with 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate
Vaccine

This abstract pertained to an open-label Phase III study that was conducted to
evaluate the immune response of 307 children between the ages of 15 months and 5
years who received at least three prior doses of Prevenar (the evaluable
immunogenicity population). The study measured immunoglobulin G (IgG) and
response was assessed as greater than or equal to 0.35 mcg/mL for each of the
Prevenar 13 serotypes measured one month after the last scheduled vaccination
(the study`s primary endpoint). 

The study showed that children aged &gt;15 months to &lt;2 years who received two
doses of Prevenar 13 responded to vaccination with Prevenar 13 with a high
proportion of responders to the six additional serotypes included in the
vaccine, ranging from 94.5 percent (serotype 3) to 100 percent (serotypes 1, 7F
and 19A, n=126). In children &#8805;2 to &#8804;5 years old who received one dose of
Prevenar 13, response to vaccination was also high for the six additional
vaccine serotypes with proportion of responders ranging from 92 percent
(serotype 3) to 100 percent (serotype 19A, n=181). Children in both age groups
also experienced a booster effect of increased immunity against the seven common
serotypes in both vaccines. 

In addition, data from the study showed that Prevenar 13 was generally well
tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection-site
reactions, fever, irritability, decreased appetite, and increased and/or
decreased sleep. Most local reactions were mild and lasted approximately two
days. 

Abstract #572: Immunity to Serogroups 6 and 19 by CRM197-based PCV7 and PCV13:
The Relative Importance of Direct and Cross Protection

This abstract described data from five Phase III pediatric clinical studies
conducted in the United States and Europe that assessed and compared the immune
responses to serotypes 6A and 19A for infants and toddlers vaccinated with
Prevenar and Prevenar 13. Children in the studies received immunizations of
either three infant doses followed by a toddler dose or two infant doses
followed by a toddler dose, according to the National Vaccine Program in each
country. Immune responses to serotypes 6A and 19A were analyzed by testing blood
samples using ELISA anticapsular IgG (GMCs and percent responders achieving the
World Health Organization-established threshold of greater than or equal to 0.35
mcg/mL) and functional opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) after vaccination with
Prevenar or Prevenar 13. 

The data showed concordance between IgG and OPA activity to serotype 6A with
both Prevenar and Prevenar 13, but the functional antibody response induced by
Prevenar 13 was four to 25 times greater than that for Prevenar. 

Moreover, although Prevenar elicited IgG antibody responses to serotype 19A, it
elicited only a negligible functional response. Prevenar 13 IgG responses were
1.3 to 2.5 times greater than Prevenar and Prevenar 13 showed a marked anti-type
19A functional OPA activity. 

Pneumococcal Disease

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2002 estimate, pneumococcal
disease is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children
younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of
illnesses, all caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pneumococcal
disease affects infants and young children and includes invasive infections such
as bacteremia/ sepsis and meningitis, as well as pneumonia and acute otitis
media. 

Indication for Prevenar 13

Prevenar 13 is indicated for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia, and
otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B,
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F in infants and children from 6 weeks to 5
years of age. 

Important Safety Information for Prevenar 13

The use of Prevenar 13 should be determined on the basis of official
recommendations taking into consideration the impact of invasive disease in
different age groups as well as the variability of serotype epidemiology in
different geographical areas. 

In clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were
injection-site reactions, fever, irritability, decreased appetite, and increased
and/or decreased sleep. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevenar 13. Hypersensitivity
to any component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its use.
As with other vaccines, the administration of Prevenar 13 should be postponed in
subjects suffering from acute, severe febrile illness. However, the presence of
a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in the deferral of
vaccination. Prevenar 13 does not provide 100% protection against vaccine
serotypes or protect against nonvaccine serotypes. 

Indication for Prevenar

Prevenar is indicated for active immunization of infants and children from 6
weeks through 9 years of age against invasive disease, pneumonia, and otitis
media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and
23F. 

Important Safety Information for Prevenar

In clinical studies (n=18,168), the most frequently reported adverse events
included injection-site reactions, fever (&#8805;38&#186;C/100.4&#186;F), irritability,
drowsiness, restless sleep, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevenar. Hypersensitivity to
any vaccine component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its
use. Prevenar does not provide 100% protection against vaccine serotypes or
protect against nonvaccine serotypes. The decision to administer Prevenar*
should be based on its efficacy in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease. 

The frequency of pneumococcal serotypes and serogroups can vary from country to
country, which could influence the effectiveness of the vaccine in any given
country.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, March 17 (Reuters) - India's Tata Power Co Ltd
(TTPW.BO) and Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) Indonesian unit are among
several firms which have submitted bids for a geothermal power
project in Indonesia, a ministry official said on Wednesday.
 Indonesia's PT Medco Energi Internasional (MEDC.JK) is part of
a consortium with Ormat Technologies (ORA.N), and several other
local firms made separate bids for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tata, India's largest private-sector utility, is part of a
consortium with Indonesian firm PT Supraco Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bids are to build a geothermal power plant in Sorik
Merapi, North Sumatra, with initial capacity of 55 megawatts
(MW) gradually increasing to 200 MW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a preliminary bid, the government will look
carefully at the capabilities of the firms before deciding on
the winner," said the official at the energy and mines
ministry, who declined to be quoted by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has launched the first phase of the programme to
add 10,000 MW of generating capacity from 35 new coal-fired
power plants, which are mostly still under construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government is still finalising the second phase of the
crash programme to add another 10,000 MW using coal, geothermal
and renewable energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, with hundreds of active and extinct volcanoes,
has the potential to produce an estimated 27,000 MW of
electricity from geothermal sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, that potential remains largely untapped because
the high cost of geothermal energy makes the price of
electricity generated this way expensive.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Austrian actor Christoph Waltz, whose career is red-hot since he won the best supporting actor Oscar as a Nazi officer in "Inglourious Basterds," will make his feature directing debut on the German-language movie "Auf und Davon" ("Up and Away"), based on a script he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waltz also might play a role in the Fox International Prods. project, which centers on the ruthless host of a dating show competition. She finds herself in over her head when the show's romantic story line bumps into her own feelings for a contestant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This love story reflects Christoph's formidable sense of humor," said Gabriela Bacher, who oversees Fox International Prods. in Germany and brought the project to the studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie will be loosely based on Meike Winnemuth and Peter Praschl's German-language novel "Auf und Davon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film will not necessarily be seen outside of German-speaking countries. Fox executives first discussed it with Waltz shortly after "Inglourious Basterds" premiered at Cannes. Waltz, who has directed for German television, has been working on the script for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waltz will be seen in the Fox 2000 movie "Water for Elephants" in the role of an animal trainer. He also has been cast in Columbia Pictures' "The Green Hornet," and is considering other roles, including one in the Kevin Costner-directed World War II drama "A Little War of Our Own."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging the relationship between Microsoft and the open source community has been contentious, a Microsoft official Thursday nonetheless emphasized the company's embrace of the open source paradigm, even if it was not necessarily for altruistic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation by Microsoft's Stuart McKee, who holds the title of national technology officer for the United States, continued a pattern in recent years that has seen Microsoft publicly embracing the open source movement and even funding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Read InfoWorld blogger Zack Urlocker's take on Microsoft's  open source glasnost. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Microsoft feels] strongly that Microsoft's success has been based on the fact that we can run a lot of diverse technologies on the Microsoft platform including open source," McKee said. Microsoft has had a "contentious" relationship with open source proponents but "things are really changing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKee, who focuses on governmental customers for Microsoft, offered his perspectives in a keynote speech at the OSBC (Open Source Business Conference) in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft contributes to open source efforts, including sponsoring Linux, he said. Microsoft has contributed 20,000 lines of device driver code to the Linux kernel so Linux can run on Microsoft's Hyper-V virtualization technology, noted Robert Duffner, Microsoft director of open source strategy, &#160;who also was present at OSBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be quite honest, it's not that we're altruistic, necessarily. Our key desire is to satisfy customers. We build software for a living -- that' what we do," McKee said. "And we understand profoundly that a diverse ecosystem is absolutely critical to satisfying the needs of customers and increasingly, that ecosystem does include open source."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other examples of Microsoft's embrace of open source cited by McKee included the Microsoft.web site for the Microsoft Web platform, which features 23 open source applications out of a total of 25 applications. Also, Apache software, the MySQL database, and PHP all run on Microsoft's Windows Azure cloud platform, McKee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft in recent years has been endorsing open source via efforts such as sponsoring the Apache Foundation. The Microsoft-backed CodePlex Foundation, meanwhile, was set up last year as an effort to enable collaboration between open source communities and software companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to McKee's appearance, David Recordon, head of open source initiatives at Facebook, stressed the emphasis on open source software on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We rely on the Varnish project. Varnish is an incredible open source cache," Recordon said. Billions of requests are served through Varnish everyday around the world on Facebook, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To boost PHP performance on the site, Facebook developed an open source technology, HipHop for PHP, which transforms PHP code into highly optimized C++, said Recordon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook also uses the open source Memcached distributed memory object caching system and the MySQL database, Recordon said. &#160;Memcached, he said, "is sort of like that magic pixie dust" for scalability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really use MySQL as our data store," offering data integrity, decent backup tools and reliability, Recordon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft says its contentious relationship with open source is changing," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Ecuadorean plaintiffs have appealed a U.S. judge's decision to allow Chevron Corp to seek arbitration of a case of alleged pollution in the Amazon rainforest with a potential $27 billion liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, indigenous Ecuadoreans, filed the notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit on Thursday, a week after a judge ruled in favor of the second-largest U.S. oil company in its efforts to seek international arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron cites violations under the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty in the case, which was originally filed in New York in 1993 and is now being heard by a court in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company says Ecuador breached the treaty by not forcing that court to dismiss the lawsuit, in which indigenous people say Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, damaged their health and the forest and polluted rivers while operating there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After more than 17 years of litigation fraught with delay caused largely by Chevron itself, these individuals deserve to have their claims resolved in the forum that Chevron chose," Jonathon Abady, a lawyer who represents the rainforest residents, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says Ecuador and state oil company Petroecuador, Texaco's partner there, released Texaco from further liability in 1998 after the U.S. company's share of remediation work was complete.

&lt;p&gt; * Ecuadoreans file with U.S. appeals court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, March 18 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean plaintiffs
have appealed a U.S. judge's decision to allow Chevron Corp

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today announced service packs for both Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, but declined to set a release date or a schedule for getting a beta in users' hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a company spokesman, Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) will primarily contain "minor updates," including patches and hotfixes that will have been delivered earlier via the Windows Update service, rather than new features. One of the latter: an updated Remote Desktop client designed to work with RemoteFX, the new remote-access platform set to debut in SP1 for Windows Server 2008 R2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Server 2008 R2 will also be upgraded to SP1, Microsoft said, presumably at the same time as Windows 7 since the two operating systems share a single code base. Besides RmoteFX -- which Microsoft explained yesterday in an entry on the Windows virtualization team's blog -- Server 2008 R2 will also include a feature dubbed "Dynamic Memory," which lets IT staff adjust guest virtual machines' memory on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not spell out a timetable for the service packs, saying only that it would provide more information as release milestones approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, a Web site that has regularly predicted release dates for Windows and its service packs said that Microsoft had dumped plans for a 22-month development cycle for Windows 7 SP1, and instead might deliver the upgrade in the fourth quarter of this year. At the time, Microsoft declined to talk about Windows 7 SP1, with a spokeswoman saying, "We do not comment on rumors or speculation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Windows 7 SP1 follows the pace set three years ago by Vista SP1, the fourth quarter is a good bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After much hemming and hawing, Microsoft admitted it would create SP1 for the then-new Vista in late July 2007, announced a schedule in August, seeded an invite-only group of testers with an early build in September, posted a release candidate for public download in December 2007 and formally launched SP1 in mid-March 2008. From start to finish, the Vista SP1 process lasted just over eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same timeline for Windows 7 SP1 would put its release in late November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Windows 7 SP1 may be less important than previous first service packs if a recent survey of over 900 IT administrators is on the button. According to the poll, which was conducted in January by Dimensional Research, 46% of the admins said they wouldn't wait for SP1 before deploying Windows 7. By tradition -- if little else -- many businesses postpone their migrations to a new Windows until that version's SP1 shows up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That may not sound like a lot, but for IT, it's a huge number," said Diane Hagglund, the senior research analyst with Dimensional who authored the survey and the follow-up report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first hint of Windows 7 SP1 came more than two months ago, when Rafael Rivera, who writes the Within Windows blog, sniffed out several keys in Windows 7's registry that add an eligibility check for SP1 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Shell Gears to Raise Volume

At its annual strategy update, energy major Royal Dutch Shell PLC (NYSE: RDS.A)
unveiled its business policy. In particular, the company outlined plans to
increase production by 11% by 2012 and at the same time cut costs by selling
some of its refining and retail assets and reducing more headcount. 

According to the company, these initiatives are expected to improve the
organization`s efficiency and sharply boost cash flow from operations. 

The strategic actions became necessary as Shell`s downstream operations have
struggled in recent times due to weak demand for fuel, leading to mounting
losses in this segment. The company, which has a high exposure to refining, has
lagged rivals such as BP Plc (NYSE: BP) in cutting costs to cope with the new
climate. 

Shell will now focus on growth in its gas business. The company also pegged its
capital expenditure budget at a minimum of $25 billion for the next several
years. 

Highlights of the meeting are summarized below:

Job Cuts &amp; Asset Sale

The integrated major said that it plans to cut an additional 1,000 jobs by the
end of 2011 (on top of 1,000 job cuts planned for 2010). Shell aims to save at
least $1 billion in 2010. Last year, the firm slashed 5,000 jobs (or 5% of its
worldwide staff of roughly 100,000). Further, the company plans to sell $1 - $3
billion per year in non-core assets. 

Downstream Operations to Be Trimmed

To help fund its ambitious growth plans, Shell has decided to do away with some
of its less profitable businesses. It will sell 35% of its petrol station
operations, while reducing refining capacity by 15%. 

Upstream Focus

The Anglo-Dutch supermajor also said that it expects its annual production to
increase 11% by 2012 (up from the previous estimate of 6 - 9%), driven by a new
wave of project startups. Shell`s targeted output rise, to 3.5 oil-equivalent
barrels per day (MMBOE/d), would reverse the declining trend in the last several
years. In 2009, the group`s volumes averaged 3.15 MMBOE/d. The Hague-based oil
producer is currently assessing more than 35 new projects that should guarantee
upstream growth to at least 2020. 

In line with other supermajors like ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron
Corp. (NYSE: CVX), Shell sees natural gas playing an important part in its
future. The company`s targeted volume growth will be achieved primarily by new
natural gas projects coming onstream in Qatar, Australia and North America.
Shell said that it expects natural gas to represent 52% of total volumes by
2012. 

Cash Flow Boost

As new projects come onstream, Shell expects cash flows to increase
significantly by 2012, by around 50% with oil at $60 per barrel, and by over 80%
at $80 per barrel. 

Capital Expenditure &amp; Funding

To meet these targets, the company expects to spend at least $25 billion
annually in capital expenditure in the years to come, quite high by industry
standards. 

In order to finance this huge capital spending and keep its balance sheet strong
while waiting for the production and cash-flow increases to materialize, Shell
has decided to maintain its 2010 dividend at the 2009 level. Thereafter, the oil
giant would look for a payout hike. 

Our Take

In view of the increasingly bearish outlook for the marketing and refining
operations, we believe that Shell has taken the right decision by looking to
streamline its loss-making downstream portfolio, a plan that has been followed
by several other oil majors, including Chevron and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP). 

The company plans to boost returns and remain competitive in this difficult
environment by embarking on aggressive cost reduction initiatives, exiting
unprofitable markets, and streamlining the organization. As of now, Shell has
decided to boost focus on the more lucrative and well performing `upstream`
exploration and production end of the business mainly natural gas.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Hartford to Repay TARP

In order to repay the entire $3.4 billion of bailout money it received from the
government for its participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) at
the height of the credit crisis, Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE:
HIG) said on Tuesday that it will raise $3.05 billion from new securities. 

The securities of Hartford will consist of $1.45 billion in common stock, $500
million in convertible preferred stock and $1.1 billion in bonds. 

The move will free the life and property insurer from government involvement in
its affairs and pay restrictions, even though the Treasury will still hold
Hartford`s warrants for about 52 million shares at an exercise price of $9.79
each. However, Hartford does not intend to repurchase the warrants at this
point. 

In Jan 2009, Hartford became a thrift holding company with the approval of the
Office of Thrift Supervision. The holding company status made Hartford eligible
to apply for TARP funds. 

Separately, Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) said on the same day that it
has got regulatory approval to repay $1.2 billion of TARP money it received from
the government. 

After incurring sturdy credit losses, Hartford reduced its dividend and raised
billions of dollars in private and public transactions last year. It has also
reduced headcount to stabilize its financial position. 

Nevertheless, during fourth quarter of 2009, Hartford returned to profitability
for the first time since mid-2008. Hartford`s fourth quarter core earnings came
in at $1.51 per share, substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of
$1.40. This also compares favorably with the core loss of 72 cents in the
year-ago quarter. 

The upside was primarily attributable to stability in Hartford`s life and
property and casualty businesses. Also, Hartford ended the year with a strong
capital position. Despite the overall market conditions remaining timid,
Hartford delivered strong underwriting results. During the fourth quarter,
rising stock markets helped strengthen investment income in the company`s life
insurance business. 

However, the results suffered from losses in Hartford`s investment portfolio and
higher costs related to the variable-annuity business. We remain concerned with
Hartford`s exposure to variable annuities and pressure on the Life segment as
consumers seek relatively safe investment vehicles for their retirement assets. 

Most of the major institutions in the financial market like JPMorgan Chase and
Co. (NYSE: JPM), Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE:
WFC) have repaid the TARP loan. Also, the Treasury has started auctioning stock
warrants it acquired from the banks that received a significant portion of
taxpayers` money and have fully repaid the same.

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to capture what it sees as a growing market for virtual desktops within enterprises, Microsoft is simplifying some licensing agreements and enhancing its virtual-desktop-related software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When we're talking with customers, we're seeing a huge interest in reducing the total cost of ownership of the desktop environment," said Dai Vu, Microsoft director of virtualization solutions marketing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vu noted that many organizations are still running Windows XP and looking to upgrade to Windows 7, though they are wondering whether some sort of virtualized desktop setup may be easier to manage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Customers are thinking about how they will approach the management of their desktop and applications more broadly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is taking a number of steps to entice users to try virtual desktops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the company will simplify licensing, in particular its Virtual Enterprise Centralized Desktop (VECD) licensing, which was introduced in 2007 for licensing desktops that are run from a data center.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the license was "access device-based," Vu said. For example, if the OS were accessed from three different client devices, then the customer would need three licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Windows Software Assurance customers can access desktops hosted at data centers from multiple locations with no additional licensing fees, Vu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, customers will be given "roaming rights," which will allow users to access their virtual desktops from airport kiosks, hotels, home PCs and other secondary points of access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the simplified licensing, Microsoft has also partnered with virtualization software provider Citrix to offer two introductory bundles of the companies' software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one package aimed at new users, current customers of the Microsoft client access license can get a deal on the two companies' products. For 250 users, they can get the Microsoft Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Suite, standard edition, and Citrix's XenDesktop VDI Edition at about half the typical annual license cost for the first year. That comes out to about US$7,000, or $28 per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can try it, let users experience it, and then decide how they want to proceed with virtual desktops," said Sumit Dhawan, vice president of product marketing at Citrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other package was assembled to poach disgruntled VMware customers using VMware's View VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) software. Users can trade as many as 500 VMware View licenses for an equivalent number of licenses to the VDI Suite and XenDesktop, use of which will be free for one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these licensing changes, Microsoft is also upgrading some of the technology used with its virtual desktop offerings. Upgrades to RemoteFX and Dynamic Memory, both of which are components of the upcoming Windows Server 2008 RC 2 SP1 (Release Candidate 2, Service Pack 1), will increase performance of virtual desktops, Vu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using tools developed by Calista Technologies, which Microsoft purchased in 2008, RemoteFX acts as a virtual GPU, which can improve the quality of the display on the virtual desktop by using GPUs on the server to render the display graphics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping to attract partner companies to work with RemoteFX, Vu said. It aims to get thin-client device makers to offer RemoteFX-enabled hardware and VDI software makers to use RemoteFX as part of their own offerings. To this end, Microsoft has entered into a deal with Citrix that will allow Citrix's HDX (High Definition User Experience) remote display technology to use RemoteFX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dynamic Memory, the memory usage of each program running on a server (including each virtual machine) will be monitored, and unused memory will be carved off and returned to the server's pool of available memory. This will help servers run more virtual desktops, Vu said, especially because after booting the operating system, much of the working memory of a desktop machine remains unused and could be reclaimed for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new technologies will allow Microsoft to make some inroads into the VDI space, observers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RemoteFX, for example, can bring Microsoft's RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) up to par with other remote access protocols, in terms of visual rendering of the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RDP "has always had the ability to do basic [graphics] for things like drawing windows on a screen," said Eric Hanselman, who is the chief technology officer for VDI broker software provider Leostream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RemoteFX is exciting insofar as it allows RDP to do advanced displays, such as displaying Flash movies or DirectX images. "This brings RDP into the same class as a lot of the higher-end viewing environments, like Citrix's and VMware's," Hanselman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to reveal more details of these licensing and technology changes in a webcast on Thursday.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - It's been a bad month for Pfizer's (PFE.N) research labs but its head of RD says the world's biggest drugmaker is on track to hit earlier targets for new drug filings despite the setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have had some disappointments, there is no getting away from it," Martin Mackay told Reuters during a visit to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimebon's lack of efficacy in Alzheimer's disease was "extremely disappointing," although Mackay said it was "a wee bit early" to say the drug, which Pfizer has developed with Medivation (MDVN.O), was now dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has also seen failures this month with Sutent in breast cancer and figitumumab in lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have worried that these problems mean the company will no longer meet its goal of filing 15 to 20 new drugs or new indications for regulatory approval between 2010 and 2012 -- a target that was set in March 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackay denied this was the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we had the three failures I went straight to the data and looked at it again to make sure that we could still be on target. And clearly the 15 to 20 was already attrition-adjusted, so we are still within that range," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the goal was set before Pfizer bought Wyeth last year, Mackay stressed it still referred only to legacy Pfizer products and any filing contributions from Wyeth would be in addition to this total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$9 BILLION RD BUDGET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many major drugmakers, Pfizer has struggled in recent years to get a decent return out of its vast RD machine, which currently spends more than $9 billion a year in the hunt for new medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite disappointing productivity, Mackay said the science had never been better and he remains confident that Pfizer will have plenty more big drugs coming down the pipeline, even though cutbacks in the research budget are planned in the wake of the Wyeth merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (RD spending) will drop somewhat over the next two years in line with the commitments we've made to savings," he said. "But if we can't come up with great medicines with a budget of $8 billion or $9 billion, shame on us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain drug tanezumab, heart medicine apixaban -- which Pfizer is developing with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) -- and a JAK3 inhibitor for arthritis "all have potential to be significant blockbusters," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-house research at facilities around the world, including one at Sandwich in the south of England, will remain core to Pfizer's search for new medicines but Mackay said the group would also explore more alliances with rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For sure, you'll see us doing in-licensing, you'll see us doing more academic collaborations and biotech collaborations -- and I think you'll also see more of us working with folks like Glaxo and Bristol-Myers around more creative partnerships," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Pfizer struck an unusual alliance last year to create a joint venture in HIV medicine, called ViiV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades, assigns Rating Outlooks and Loss Severity (LS) Ratings
to J. P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2003-CIBC6,
as follows: 

--$15.6 million class H to 'BB/LS5' from 'BBB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$5.2 million class J to 'BB/LS5' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$7.8 million class K to 'B/LS5' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$5.2 million class L to 'B-/LS5' from 'BB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$3.9 million class M to 'B-/LS5' from 'B+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$1.3 million class N to 'B-/LS5' from 'B'; Outlook Negative. 

In addition Fitch has affirmed, assigned Rating Outlooks and LS ratings as
follows: 

--$135.9 million class A-1 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$653.2 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only classes X-1 and X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$31.2 million class B at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$32.5 million class C at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$11.7 million class D at 'AA+/LS5'; Outlook Stable; 

--$14.3 million class E at 'AA-/LS5', Outlook Stable; 

--$10.4 million class F at 'A+/LS5'; Outlook Negative; 

--$13 million class G at 'A-/LS5'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch does not rate the $18.1 million class NR. 

The downgrades are due to an increase in Fitch expected losses upon the
disposition of specially serviced assets along with expected losses from Fitch's
prospective review of potential stresses. Rating Outlooks reflect the likely
direction of any changes to the ratings over the next one to two years. 

There are 126 of the original 129 loans remaining in the transaction, 23 of
which have defeased (27.0% of the current transaction balance. Three assets
(1.79%) are specially serviced. 

The largest specially serviced asset (0.97%) is an 82,100 square foot (sf)
retail center in Peoria, AZ. The loan transferred in February due to imminent
default. Bashas' (66.3% of net rentable area [NRA]), the largest tenant, filed
for bankruptcy in July 2009. Bashas' is still in occupancy but has asked for a
reduction in their rental rate. The potential exists for the Bashas' lease to be
rejected in bankruptcy court. 

The second largest specially serviced asset (0.80%) is a suburban office
property in Piscataway, NJ. The loan transferred to the special servicer July 8,
2009 for payment default. The special servicer is working with the borrower on a
discounted loan payoff. The property lost the largest tenant, dropping the
occupancy to 20%. The discounted payoff amount has been approved and the
servicer is awaiting the borrower to secure the funds for payoff. 

The third largest specially serviced asset (0.78%) is a 51,294 sf retail center
located in Southlake, TX. The loan transferred Sept. 9, 2009 for payment
default. Occupancy at the property fell to 35% after the loss of a large tenant.
The special servicer began the foreclosure process in January 2010. 

Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining non-defeased loans by applying a
10% reduction to 2008 fiscal year end net operating income and applying an
adjusted market cap rate between 7.5% and 10% to determine value. 

Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage commercial mortgage
backed securities (CMBS), each loan also underwent a refinance test by applying
an 8% interest rate and 30-year amortization schedule based on the stressed cash
flow. Loans that could refinance to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 times
or higher were considered to pay off at maturity. Of the non-defeased or
non-specially serviced loans, none incurred a loss when compared to Fitch's
stressed value.

U.S. CMBS is available in the July 7, 2009 report, 'Surveillance Methodology for
Recent Vintage U.S. CMBS,' which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' under

&lt;p&gt;  PITTSBURGH, PA, Mar 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today Japan's Anti-Phishing Council in cooperation with Japan's Computer
Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) launched a
Japanese version of Wombat Security Technologies' Anti-Phishing Phil game
to train the Japanese user community not to fall for phishing attacks.
The launch is part of a new public education campaign aimed at raising
awareness of phishing attacks and educating the public on how to best
protect themselves against such attacks. 

    Anti-Phishing Phil is an engaging online game that teaches people how to
avoid falling for increasingly prevalent phishing attacks by training
them to identify phishing URLs. Phil is a fun fish character that swims
through the ocean searching for worms affixed with a URL that he can
decide to eat or reject based on whether the worm is associated with a
legitimate web address or a fake phishing site. In contrast to more
traditional training solutions, the Phil game has been shown to be
significantly more effective in helping people recognize phishing
attacks. People who play the game tend to also better retain what they
have learned. 

    "This sale confirms the broad appeal of our training solutions and the
ease with which they can be translated into other languages. Given the
pre-eminent roles played by Japan's Anti-Phishing Council and JPCERT in
cyber security awareness and training in Japan, we are extremely pleased
to have been selected to help protect the Japanese public from phishing
attacks," said Dr. Norman Sadeh, Founder and CEO of Wombat Security
Technologies. 

    This version of Anti-Phishing Phil launched in Japan is a two-round
version of a more complete four-round game that Wombat Security offers to
organizations to train their employees and customers. Phil has been
licensed to both private sector and government organizations in the US,
Canada, Asia and Europe and is one of several highly effective
anti-phishing training solutions commercialized by Wombat Security
Technologies today.

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Eclipsys Corporation&#174; (NASDAQ: ECLP), The Outcomes Company&#174;, today announced
that Singapore General Hospital (SGH), Singapore`s oldest and largest acute
tertiary hospital and national referral center, has been recognized as a winner
of the Microsoft HUG (Microsoft Health Users Group) 2010 Innovation Awards in
the category of "Best Use of Clinical Records - Inpatient." Since implementing
Sunrise Patient Flow in May of 2009, SGH has successfully enhanced the workflows
and communications of its clinical, administrative and support staff, achieving
greater patient safety and significant improvements in both clinical and
operational outcomes. 

SGH employed a "big-bang" activation approach to complete the installation of
Sunrise Patient Flow in only five months, and has since seen improvements in
clinician and staff utilization, clinical workflow, and patient safety. Specific
benefits experienced at SGH since going live include:

* Greater than 50 percent reduction in inter-ward transfer/bed request phone
calls 
* Bed searches and placements reduced from 15 minutes to five minutes due to
rule-based algorithms 
* A 12.5 percent reduction in overflow holding areas

"On behalf of everyone at Eclipsys, I congratulate Singapore General Hospital
for this achievement," said Eric Rosow, vice president and general manager of
Sunrise Patient Flow solutions. "We`re proud to be associated with this
healthcare system, whose great success with Sunrise Patient Flow - along with
other integrated clinical solutions from Eclipsys - serves as an international
model for effectively using information technology to improve patient care and
outcomes." 

SGH selected Eclipsys` integrated and intuitive bed management, bed turnover and
patient flow system to achieve its goals of optimizing patient throughput and
efficient delivery of quality care. Using Sunrise Patient Flow, the healthcare
system coupled its workflow-based patient flow platform with CADI Scientific`s
radio frequency identification and a real-time location system to streamline
patient care from the point of admission to the point of discharge. 

"The bed management system improves patient flow with real-time information that
helps our staff anticipate and manage their workflow," said Benedict Tan,
director of information technology of Singapore General Hospital. "Together, we
can drive patient flow through the continuum of a patient's hospital stay with
greater efficiency. Ultimately this creates a safer and more satisfactory
experience for our patients as we can better coordinate the resources needed to
support their care." 

"Microsoft is pleased to recognize Singapore General Hospital as a Microsoft HUG
2010 Innovation Award Winner for its use of clinical records to transform the
quality of its patient care," said Steve Aylward, general manager, U.S. Health &amp;
Life Sciences, Microsoft. "Providing a safer and more satisfactory experience
for its patients, SGH is proving to be a truly innovative healthcare system
through their use of Microsoft technologies that utilize radio frequency
identification (RFID) and real time location services (RTLS) with their Eclipsys
Sunrise Patient Flow solution." 

Winners of the Microsoft HUG 2010 Innovation Awards were announced on March 2 at
the 2010 Annual Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)
Conference &amp; Exhibition in Atlanta. Award contestants are evaluated on how they
provide significant business benefits to healthcare organizations and improve
patient care. The Microsoft HUG 2010 Innovation Awards showcase organizations
that promote breakthroughs by enhancing the quality of patient care, reducing
costs, streamlining clinical and business processes, driving interoperability,
improving productivity and workflow, and enabling informed decisions.

combined with real-time clinical visibility, to help enable greater patient
safety, improved clinical workflow and enhanced clinician/staff utilization. The
Sunrise Patient Flow platform is built with Microsoft technologies, including
the latest .NET Framework, Windows Presentation Foundation, and Microsoft SQL
Server to facilitate rapid and flexible client deployments as well as
significant usability advantages. Sunrise Patient Flow, together with the

&lt;p&gt;  CHELMSFORD, MA, Mar 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Aspect, a global provider of unified communications (UC) and
collaboration services and software, today announced its one-year
anniversary of operating completely phone-free following its global
implementation of Microsoft(R) Office Communications Server 2007 R2.

    Following a pilot of the unified communications (UC) technology in
February of 2009, the company took its Massachusetts headquarters live on
Office Communications Server the next month, and subsequently deployed it
to every Aspect employee across the globe -- approximately 1,800
individuals at more than 20 sites. In its first full year of utilizing
UC, Aspect:


--  Completed more than 1.7 million calls, with nearly 12 million minutes
    of talk time
--  Participated in more than 2 million IM sessions
--  Held more than 138,000 conference calls, with 33 million minutes of
    participant time
--  Reduced conference calling expenditures by 97 percent, or by $100,000
    per month
--  Lowered telephony circuit costs by more than $350,000 with session
    initiation protocol (SIP) Trunking
--  Eliminated 16 PBXs and the associated $300,000 of annual maintenance
    costs

    

"The numbers are staggering. Microsoft unified communications has
literally changed the way we work at Aspect -- every call, every IM
session, every time we share a screen -- we are a different organization
because of UC," said Jim Foy, president and chief executive officer,
Aspect. "And, the ROI is tremendous. With nearly two million dollars
saved in just the first year, we intend to remain at the forefront of
using and deploying UC and collaboration technologies, as well as helping
our customers deploy and benefit from applying Microsoft capabilities to
address their own business requirements."

    As the company moves into 2010, Aspect is actively engaged in the
Microsoft Technology Adopter Program and will be involved in beta testing
of the next release of Office Communications Server, which is due to
become generally available in the fourth quarter. In addition, Aspect's
own global customer support centers will be expanding their use of "Ask
an Expert" capabilities utilizing the Seamless Customer Service(TM)
unified communications application for the contact center powered by the
Aspect(R) Unified IP(R) platform product and Office Communications
Server. This serves as a showcase for Aspect customers to see UC and
collaboration at work and the associated value it provides.

    "Our UC accomplishments have been significant, including that every
person in every Aspect site worldwide has fully embraced UC, to the point
that it's difficult to imagine working without it," said Jamie Ryan,
chief information officer, Aspect. "UC has helped Aspect become a more
efficient and more collaborative company, and we are proud to serve as an
example for companies considering how UC can positively impact their
organizations and their bottom lines." 

    About Aspect
 Aspect is a global software and IT services firm
specializing in applying Microsoft(R) unified communications and
collaboration to help customers achieve optimal results through enhanced
business processes across the enterprise and in the contact center.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) reported
the restart of a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracker at its
279,000-barrel per day El Segundo, California, refinery,
according to a late Wednesday environmental filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bringing the FCC plant back up and it started flaring
lightly ..." said the Chevron filing with the California
Emergency Management Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC plant's sulfur oxide flare alarm was activated when
the release reached 500 pounds, the filing added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, a company spokesman said Chevron expects
normal operations to return soon at its El Segundo refinery in
the Los Angeles-area which began flaring on Tuesday due to
issues with its instrument air system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron had warned of unplanned flaring at the refinery in a
notice filed with California pollution regulators on Wednesday.
The notice said the flaring could last through Thursday morning.

 (Adds JPMorgan response)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Narayanan Somasundaram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SYDNEY, March 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) lost a court
dispute over fees relating to a client's $1.2 billion
Australian takeover defence, in an unusual case that sheds
light on the often opaque world of investment banking fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Australian court dismissed the U.S. bank's claim for
A$50.8 million in fees from Consolidated Minerals which was
taken over by Ukrainian billionaire Gennadiy Bogolyubov's
Palmary Enterprises in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The takeover, a three-way battle between Palmary,
commodities investment firm Pallinghurst and iron ore miner
Territory Resources, drove up Consolidated's market value by
A$840 million ($775.6 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case was closely followed by the investment banking
industry, which keeps details of fees close to its chest and
usually resolves such disputes privately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which advised Consolidated, was paid A$20 million
but it claimed the higher amount for retainer services, base
defence fees, incentive fees and expenses for its advisory role
in 2006 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justice David Hammerschlag, in a ruling on Thursday, said
Consolidated only owed A$19.25 million to the U.S. bank, but
said the two sides might want to work out the final price based
on his judgment.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 For full court judgement see:
 r.reuters.com/fyr34j
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said it might appeal the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe there are strong grounds for appeal and we are
currently assessing our response in that regard," the bank said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the agreement with Consolidated Minerals, JPMorgan
was entitled to an incentive fee equivalent to 3 percent of any
increase in offer price, up to 25 percent of the initial offer
and 5 percent of any increase in the offer price above that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge backed Consolidated's view that its fee payment
should be based on the difference between Palmary's first and
final takeover offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's view was that the incentive fee should be based
on the difference between the first takeover offer from
Pallinghurst and the final offer from Palmary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge said JPMorgan did not deserve any incentive fees
for defending the company against two other competing offers
which had helped to drive up the company's share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was no need for either of them to be repelled or
warded off," Hammerschlag said, referring to the two losing
bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judgment said JPMorgan was entitled to a base defence
fee of A$9.56 million, an incentive fee of A$9.53 million and
other minor fees, compared to its claims of a base defence fee
of A$10.25 million and incentive fee of A$35.79 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a great decision," said Consolidated Minerals. "We
can now concentrate on creating value and longevity at the
Woodie Woodie manganese mine."

&lt;p&gt;IBM and insurance provider Assurant Solutions have come up with a project that, in the manner of dating services like eHarmony, uses analytics to match up call center callers with the most appropriate representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Real-Time Analytics Matching Program (RAMP) is an attempt at improving the traditional call center experience, where calls are routed via few menu options, such as which language the caller speaks and the type of product involved, but don't necessarily end up getting handled by an agent capable of resolving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RAMP system's real-time analytics engine weights factors such as a caller's average wait time, payment history or spending patterns. It then looks for an ideal agent to take the call, based on their past performance and skill set. Prediction algorithms figure out when an optimal agent will be free, and the system sends them the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAMP's capabilities could also be expanded by adding more types of data, such as "psychographic" details of a caller's historical demeanor, said Toby Cook, practice leader, IBM Analytics Solutions Team, IBM Global Business Services. "If they're traditionally cranky, and [the company has] that data available as a score input, you could match that to optimal agents." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAMP helps a company determine which agents are the best, and also "takes this next tier of agent and tends to move them up to the top, because success garners success," he said. "Because you're matching them [with the most appropriate caller] they tend to do well. Even your lower performers tend to do better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although RAMP has clear kinship with certain IBM software products, such as its ILOG business rules engine and the predictive analytics capabilities it acquired by buying SPSS, as of now RAMP is "completely componentized and built as a standardized asset," Cook said. IBM intends to build integrations between RAMP and those software offerings over time, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAMP's roots lie at Assurant itself. The company's "decision science" team developed an initial version of the system in-house about seven years ago, said Mike Politz, vice president. The project increased sales revenue by 29 percent in the first year after completion, according to a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assurant began working with IBM more recently in an effort to improve the system's performance, he said. The company will maintain ownership of certain intellectual property in RAMP as IBM takes it to other clients, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While RAMP has been optimized for IBM hardware and software platforms, it can be made to work with rival systems, Cook said. Currently it is supported on UNIX, with Linux next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, Mar 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Snoop Dogg has finally won a long-running court battle to enable him to
apply for a UK visa, opening the way for a possible appearance at
Glastonbury this summer. The rap star, whose real name is Cordozar Calvin
Broads Jr, was originally refused a UK visa in March 2007 for his
European tour with fellow hip-hop star P Diddy. His problems with the UK
immigration authorities began when his entourage got into a tussle over
entry to the British Airways First Class Lounge at Heathrow in 2006,
which resulted in the hip-hop star being cautioned by police.

    When the controversial rapper challenged his 2007 visa application
refusal two judges ruled in 2008 that the authorities were wrong to
reject his request. The UK Borders Agency eventually lost its appeal
earlier this month, leaving Snoop Dogg free to apply once again for a UK
visa. There is, of course, no guarantee that his application will
actually be approved next time around, but with a court ruling in his
favour, the authorities will need to find good reasons to refuse him a UK
visa again.

    The Sun newspaper has reported that Michael Eavis, organiser of the
Glastonbury Festival, is working to bring the 39-year-old rapper to this
summer's festival. He reportedly told the newspaper that his daughter
Emily, who is now taking a greater role in booking headline artists,
wants Snoop Dogg to appear at this year's festival. Eavis also confirmed
that he is in discussions with the rap star's manager about bringing him
to Glastonbury. Last year, the appearance of another hip-hop star, Jay-Z,
was controversial, upsetting Noel Gallagher who forthrightly voiced his
disapproval of having hip-hop at Glastonbury. The Jay-Z appearance was
also the brainchild of Emily Eavis.

    Snoop Dogg is nothing if not versatile. In addition to rapping, he has
acted in movies, done voice-overs for animated films, presented
television programmes, and coached a football team. Whether he does
actually make it to Glastonbury depends on bringing all his talents to
bear on ensuring that his UK visa application actually gets approved this
time. How his entourage behaves in the airline lounge could also have a
bearing on matters.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to start a small-scale pilot of a microblogging service aimed at business users that it has been experimenting with in Office Labs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn't reveal many details of the service but said it has been testing it internally and the company is now looking for customers willing to participate in a pilot test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called OfficeTalk, the service is designed to let employees share brief bits of information, similar to the way that people use Twitter. "This concept test applies the base capabilities of microblogging to a business environment, enabling employees to post their thoughts, activities, and potentially valuable information to anyone who might be interested," according to a blog post on the Office Labs site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OfficeTalk was one of the most popular internal concept tests at Office Labs, the post says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not only was the obvious demonstrated, that people don't limit microblogging activity to the purely social, but that even an IT managed implementation focused on business productivity can spread quickly across informal networks and create unique collaboration efficiencies and experiences," it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft now wants to test OfficeTalk along with other social-networking experiments with a few customers. It hopes to study ways that businesses and people use the technologies, according to the blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is following other companies that are already offering microblogging software for enterprises. For instance, SocialText, StatusNet, Yammer, Socialcast and Salesforce's Chatter are all microblogging products used by enterprises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Labs researchers are always quick to point out that they work on experiments that may never become live products, and this blog post is no different. "OfficeTalk isn't a product -- it's a research project focused on learning how people might use social networking tools at work and in what ways both people and organizations realize their value," it reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog post is dated Wednesday, and ZDNet wrote about it on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new desktop virtualization initiatives announced yesterday are a long-anticipated move to make desktop and application virtualization easier and cheaper for enterprises. But it's also part of a broader Microsoft strategy to capture market share from virtualization arch-rival VMware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desktop virtualization is still a nascent technology, but it does offer the kind of flexibility and ROI that enterprises are looking for, especially ones that are migrating to Windows 7 and are worried about application incompatibility. Microsoft's desktop virtualization model, including VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure), promises to rein in desktop costs, improve security and management and speed up the delivery of new applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key part of the sweeping announcements, covered in an hour-long Webcast, is a simpler and cheaper model for licensing Windows in a virtual desktop environment. Specifically, on July 1, Software Assurance customers will no longer have to buy a separate license to access Windows via a VDI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, for customers that use devices that don't qualify for Software Assurance, such as thin clients and PCs used by contractors, there will be a new license called Windows VDA (virtual desktop access) available for $100 per device per year. This license will allow users to still have access to their complete virtual desktop outside the corporate network on devices such a personal laptops and airport kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But from an industry perspective, the most noteworthy aspect of Microsoft's virtualization announcements is the company's tighter bonding with partner Citrix to bundle each other's virtualization software, in an effort to gang-tackle virtualization market leader VMware. While well ahead of Microsoft on the server management side of virtualization, VMware is now scrambling to stay ahead in the desktop space, says Chris Wolf, senior analyst at Burton Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vmware had a two-year lead in desktop virtualization, but it is only beginning to take it seriously," says Wolf. "Citrix and Microsoft want to take on VMware in this space, and they're closing the gap here. Vmware needs to step up its game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, VMware recently released a new version of the ThinApp application virtualization software to ease migration to Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Citrix are merging technologies, but they are also giving customers bargain deals. In addition to merging Microsoft's 3-D graphics technology for virtual desktops, called RemoteFX, with Citrix's high-definition HDX technology, the two companies will offer a price-cutting promotion called "VDI Kick Start" from March 18 until Dec. 31, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VDI Kick Start allows existing Microsoft customers with CALs (client access licenses) to pay $28 per desktop for up to 250 users to get the Microsoft Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Suite, standard edition, and Citrix's XenDesktop VDI Edition for one year. This comes out to be approximately half the typical annual license cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other offer from Microsoft and Citrix is a more direct confrontation with VMware. Called "Rescue for Vmware VDI", it's a promotion that lets SA licensed Microsoft customers replace their VMware View licenses for free. VMware View customers will get up to 500 XenDesktop VDI Edition device licenses and up to 500 Microsoft VDI Standard Suite device licenses for no charge for a full year in exchange for their VMware View licenses. Like the "VDI Kick Start" promotion, "Rescue for VMware VDI" is available from March 18 through December 31, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is for customers we've spoken to who maybe had a great experience with VMware with servers and then rushed out to do the same thing on the desktop and ran into a brick wall with poor user experience and scalability and ROI problems," says Wes Wasson, chief marketing officer at Citrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's too early to declare a winner in desktop virtualization - because the market is so raw, says Burton Group's Wolf. But he thinks VMware executives should be on high alert over this new assault from Microsoft and Citrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VMware should be worried about this," he says. "If they're not, they're doing something wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com. Follow him on Twitter at twitter.com/smoneill.

&lt;p&gt; * Lee Scott nominated to join Goldman board&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Rajat Gupta will not stand for reelection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Recasts lead, adds details on Wal-Mart and comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - H. Lee Scott Jr, the former
chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), a company
chided by critics for underpaying employees, is primed to join
the board of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which has faced a
backlash for paying too well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street's dominant firm said on Friday Scott will be up
for election at the bank's annual shareholder meeting. Rajat
Gupat, who has served on the board since 2006, will not seek
reelection, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If elected, Scott will join Goldman's board at a time when
the firm is facing scrutiny over its pay practices and has been
criticized by lawmakers for paying billions of dollars to
employees soon after taxpayers rescued the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott is chairman of the executive committee of Wal-Mart's
board. He served as Wal-Mart's president and CEO from 2000 to
2009 after joining the company in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wal-Mart's culture emphasizes frugality and stifles
unnecessary costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, Wal-Mart is known for asking traveling
executives to share rooms in inexpensive hotels. Founder Sam
Walton, whose fortune landed him at the top of the Forbes 400
list of richest Americans, drove a beat-up pickup truck and
chafed over the media attention that came with that wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, on the other hand, paid its employees $16.2
billion, an average of $498,000 per person in 2009. It's top
executives were paid $8.9 million all-stock bonuses for 2009,
which was considered a show of restraint by the firm's
standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wal-Mart has 2.1 million associates worldwide and pays an
average hourly wage of $11.75, according to its corporate web
site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As CEO, Scott helped Wal-Mart navigate public relations
woes stemming from the company's pay practices, environmental
concerns and concerns new Wal-Mart locations displaced
community businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The backlash has dissipated somewhat as the company has
encouraged suppliers to improve labor conditions and provided
disaster relief. It won plaudits when it was able to deliver
clean water and other emergency supplies to victims of
Hurricane Katrina faster than government rescue workers could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That image-related experience could be helpful to Goldman's
board as it deals with its own public relations woes, said
Michael Robinson, a financial and crisis public relations
consultant with Levick Strategic Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No one preaches like the converted," Robinson said. "It is
a good way of bringing some very practical experience to the
boardroom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gupta, who joined Goldman's board in November 2006, is a
former managing director of McKinsey  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McKinsey has faced scrutiny since Anil Kumar, a former
executive, plead guilty to charges stemming from his role in
the insider trading scandal centered on the Galleon hedge
fund.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Initial Jobless Claims Down Again

Extended claims are very helpful from a humanitarian point of view at a time
when there are five job seekers for every job opening. By the time people have
been out of work for six months, it is highly likely that they have already
drawn down their savings and run up their credit cards. That probably includes
drawing on 401-k accounts. When people do that, the money withdrawn is taxable,
and they have to pay a 10% penalty. 

With one out of four homeowners with mortgages now underwater and millions more
extremely close to "sea level," the option of drawing on home equity is not open
the way it had been in previous downturns. Thus without a paycheck, these people
are left with no financial resources at all. That is clearly a severe hardship
on the families involved. 

However, it is also very bad news for the economy overall. The money from
extended benefits tends to get spent quickly and spent on basic necessities.
This means they can buy their groceries and other basic goods at Wal-Mart (NYSE:
WMT) instead of having to rely on already overstretched food banks. That helps
keep people working at Wal-Mart. If they spend the money on toilet paper, it
helps keep people working at Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) or Procter &amp; Gamble
(NYSE: PG). 

Those people who are kept working in turn go out and spend money and keep other
people working. In fact, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
finds that, dollar for dollar, extended claims is among the most effective form
of fiscal stimulus in keeping of creating jobs. 

Boost for Bristol-Myers

Recently, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and AstraZeneca Plc (NYSE:
AZN) announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted
their application for reviewing the combination of a fixed dose of Onglyza
(saxagliptin) and metformin for treating patients suffering from type II
diabetes. While Onglyza is already available for the treatment of diabetes,
metformin is a widely-used generic diabetes pill. 

Onglyza is co-developed by Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca. The partners submitted
a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. regulatory authority for
saxagliptin/metformin HCl extended-release tablets on Dec 29, 2009. 

The NDA is based on bioequivalence data and data from the Onglyza late-stage
clinical trial program. The data included studies on the co-administration of
Onglyza and immediate release metformin, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, in
adult patients suffering from type II diabetes. The subjects in the program were
either treatment-na&#239;ve or their disease was inadequately controlled by metformin
alone. 

As a reminder, Onglyza, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP IV) inhibitor, contributed
approximately $4 million to sales in the most recent quarter (ended Dec 31,
2009). The drug has been submitted to regulatory authorities in more than 50
countries, and is approved in 38 countries and launched in the United States
(the FDA approved Onglyza in July 2009), Canada , Mexico , Germany , UK and
Denmark.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY--(Business Wire)--
Walton International Group Inc. and Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the
"Partnership") are pleased to announce that the Partnership will commence a
private placement offering. 

The offering will consist of a non-brokered private placement offering of up to
1,724,450 units at a subscription price of $10.00 per unit for gross proceeds of
up to $17,244,500. The private placement will be conducted on similar terms as
the offering that the Partnership completed on February 25, 2010 under its
prospectus dated January 28, 2010. 

On completion of the private placement, the net proceeds from both the private
placement and the prospectus offering will be used to purchase and manage
parcels of land comprised of 155 acres of land located near Toronto in Alliston,
Ontario, and 300 acres of land located in the southwest quadrant of the City of
Ottawa. The Partnership`s investment objective is to maximize returns to limited
partners through the acquisition, management, concept planning and eventual sale
of these two properties. 

The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc., which is part of
the Walton Group of Companies. Walton seeks to acquire and syndicate undeveloped
land that is strategically located in the path of major North American urban
growth corridors. These lands are syndicated to investors, without the use of
leverage, made development-ready through concept planning, and then sold for a
profit when it is commercially opportune to do so. Walton has completed 36
projects, providing returns to investors from the profit made on the sale of the
lands. In business for 30 years, the Walton group currently manages
approximately $2.5 billion of real estate assets, comprised of approximately
47,000 acres of land, on behalf of itself and investors in North America, Europe
and Asia.

&lt;p&gt;  BURLINGTON, VT, Mar 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The EB-5 Visa program allows international investors to obtain permanent
residency in the United States (green cards) for themselves and their
immediate family by investing in a new or struggling business venture in
the United States. With the current challenges in the U.S. economy, U.S.
business interests are looking to EB-5 investors from outside the United
States as a source of capital, and international investors are
responding. The number of approved EB-5 Regional Centers has grown
dramatically over the past year. In the Vermont Regional Center, the
minimum EB-5 investment is $500,000 (except in the greater
Burlington/South Burlington, Vermont area), rather than $1 million, and
other favorable EB-5 program eligibility criteria apply. Several years
ago, the State of Vermont approved and continues to administer one of the
first EB-5 Regional Centers making it unique among EB-5 Regional Centers
most of which are administered by private organizations. Jay Peak Resort
was the only EB-5 project in the State of Vermont Regional Center for
years, then Sugarbush Resort launched an EB-5 program a couple of years
ago and now there are several other EB-5 programs in development in
Vermont.

    There are a number of compliance obligations and legal issues surrounding
EB-5 programs. First, formation of an appropriate business entity and the
preparation of investment agreements and protocols that qualify under
EB-5 program regulations (Corporate law and Immigration law). Second,
marketing and selling the EB-5 investment to potential investors
(Securities law). Third, development of an immigration case to explain
and document that the investor and the EB-5 investment qualify for
permanent residency approval under EB-5 program eligibility criteria
(Immigration law). The Corporate law and Immigration law aspects of an
EB-5 project are often quite apparent. However, the Securities law
aspects of projects that fall under the EB-5 program are not necessarily
clear to lawyers practicing outside the Securities field or to developers
and investors involved in EB-5 projects.

    Many EB-5 projects offer a finder's fee to lawyers who refer
international investors to the project. However, for a lawyer to accept a
referral fee without providing legal services may violate attorney
ethical rules. A finder's fee also can look like a commission paid to an
investment broker-dealer which may trigger broker-dealer compliance
obligations and liabilities under U.S. Securities law. As a result, our
Vermont law firm, Dinse, Knapp &amp; McAndrew, does not accept finder's fees. 

    As in any Securities offering, most of the marketing materials for EB-5
programs state "this is not an offering of securities" because,
technically, only the Offering Memorandum is an "Offer of Securities" and
only the Offering Memorandum can be relied upon by the investor in
purchasing the security. By their very nature, EB-5 projects involve
offering to sell ownership interests in a business organization (offering
securities) to the international community (the public). Securities laws
apply whenever there is an offer of securities to the public, so
Securities laws apply to EB-5 transactions. Everyone involved in an EB-5
project must comply with federal and state Securities laws, including the
project developer who solicits investments, the investor, and the
attorneys who advise the investor and the project developer. A detailed
explanation of applicable Securities laws and compliance obligations is
beyond the scope of this article, but summary information is available to
the public at the web site of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
www.sec.gov, and other online resources.

    International investors considering applying for an EB-5 Visa, or
immigration lawyers with a client interested in starting an EB-5 Program,
should engage one of the many firms with expertise in Corporate law,
Immigration law, and federal and state Securities laws.

immigration, securities compliance, employment law, education law,
litigation and other. Learn more about Vermont law firm Dinse, Knapp &amp;

&lt;p&gt; * Company expects formal approval by the end of May&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Lipitor is world's biggest-selling drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N) said it expects
a positive decision by the end of May on the inclusion of new
paediatric data on labelling in Europe for its cholesterol drug
Lipitor after European drug regulators recommended the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recommendations by the European Medicines Agency's Committee
for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally swiftly
endorsed by the European Commission, and Pfizer said in a
statement it expected a decision by the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The medicines agency's expert panel on Friday recommended a
line extension to add chewable Lipitor tablets, a formulation
developed for treatment of high cholesterol in adolescents and
children aged 10 years or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The CHMP also recommended that this indication be approved
for the currently available presentations," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once the decision has been confirmed, Pfizer will be able to
market Lipitor, which is known generically as atorvastatin and
sold under the name Sortis in some parts of Europe, with the new
formulation and indication "in all EU member States where the
medicine is authorised", the regulator said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lipitor, which lowers "bad" LDL cholesterol, is the world's
biggest-selling drug, with annual sales of around $12 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said the EU drugs agency's recommendation was based
on data generated with a so-called paediatric investigation plan
(PIP) that was filed in November 2009.

Preparing to Assist You to Recover Alleged Losses</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;CLEVELAND--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Scarlato &amp; Karon, P.C., a law firm with offices in Cleveland, OH and
Conshohocken, PA, is preparing to assist investors who believe they lost money
in Kevin Miller`s fraudulent real-estate-investment scheme. On November 24,
2009, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a "Criminal Information" against
Miller, of Fairfield, Ohio, alleging that he had run a Ponzi-type
real-estate-investment scheme between 2005 and 2008. On this same day, Miller
pleaded guilty in Cincinnati federal court to the charges described in the
Government`s Criminal Information. 

According to the Criminal Information, Miller, a salesperson for Capital
Investments, convinced many of his clients to invest their money in real-estate
properties in Hamilton, Middlefield, and Fairfield, Ohio and in Florida through
false promises that their investments were secured by the equity in those
properties. Instead, Miller converted client funds for his own use. He then made
interest payments to earlier investors to make it appear that their investments
were profitable. As a result of Miller`s scheme, more than 80 victims lost their
investments, valued at over $7.3 million. 

If you believe you lost money with Kevin Miller, please email Daniel Karon at
karon@gsk-law.com or call him at (216) 622-1851 for a free case evaluation. Mr.
Karon (http://www.gsk-law.com/attorney_bio.aspx?a_id=1) is an attorney whose
practice includes representing investors in class-action cases. He also teaches
class-action law as an adjunct professor of law at Cleveland State University`s
Cleveland-Marshall College of Law; lectures on class-action law at the Ohio
State University College of Law; and has published many scholarly articles on
class-action law.

&lt;p&gt; * Telefonica, Megacable join Televisa in fiber optic bid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Government auction of fiber seen boosting competition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Slim's Telmex targeted for more competition
 (Adds background on auction, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Robert Campbell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, March 19 (Reuters) - Mexican media group
Televisa (TLVACPO.MX), Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Mexican
cable television company Megacable (MEGACPO.MX) plan to jointly
bid for fiber optic cable capacity to be auctioned off by
Mexico's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa said on Friday the three companies would hold
equal stakes in the joint venture bidding for two fiber optic
strands being tendered by Mexico's state power monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The auction is designed to improve competition in Mexico's
fixed-line telecommunications sector, which is dominated by
tycoon Carlos Slim's Telmex TELMEXL.MX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Telmex owns nearly all Mexico's telephone cables and even
the copper wire leading into homes, giving it a powerful hand
against smaller companies offering phone or Internet services,
but which need access to infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This new fiber optic network will represent for Televisa,
Telefonica and Megacable, and also for third parties, an
alternative to access data transportation services, increasing
competition in the Mexican telecommunications market,"
Megacable said in a separate statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A senior Telefonica executive said earlier this month that
the company was considering a joint bid with Televisa.
[ID:nN08200975]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Mexico's government said it was taking steps to
fine Telmex, which has a market share of about 80 percent in
Mexico's fixed-line market, for impeding smaller competitors
from connecting to its network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa, Mexico's top broadcaster, is best known for its
soap operas, but has been expanding into telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company announced in February that it had agreed to pay
$1.44 billion for a 30 percent stake in mobile phone operator
Nextel Mexico, a unit of NII Holdings Inc NIHD.O.

&lt;p&gt;The HTML5 specification could be a game-changer in the rich Internet application realm, but representatives of Microsoft and Adobe Systems, both of which have proprietary plug-ins for Web applications, remained confident Thursday in their companies' Web strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives from the two companies served on a panel during a session entitled, "The Web is the Platform," at the Open Source Business Conference (OSBC) in San Francisco. Panelists were asked what would be the roles for their companies with standard technologies such as HTML5 on the horizon for Web presentation and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Check out InfoWorld's report that asks could HTML5  kill Flash and Silverlight?&#160; | Also at OSBC: Microsoft says its contentious relationship with open source is  changing.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, for its part, has its own Silverlight plug-in technology and also made a big endorsement of HTML5 this week. "What's unique about Microsoft's position here is we actually provide value across both of these [technologies]," said panelist Brian Goldfarb, Microsoft lead product manager for Web Platform and Tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing comments a colleague made earlier this week, Goldfarb stressed there would be a symbiotic relationship between the standard and Microsoft technologies. Plug-ins have provided bleeding-edge technology and driven innovation subsequently codified in standards, Goldfarb said in an interview after the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's absolutely room for both," Goldfarb said. Some scenarios can use standards-based technologies while Silverlight and Adobe's Flash still can "push the bleeding edge," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panelist Dave McAllister, director of open source and standards at Adobe, stressed there are also other standards such as CSS3 to ponder. He cited Adobe's own strategy in the Web tools space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Very honestly, Adobe's an arms dealer. We build the best tooling environment delivered for the Web," McAllister said.&#160; Whatever the Web platform becomes, Adobe will build tools for it, he said. Adobe will not stop building tools, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panelists also recognized the continued trend of open source. "We're finding that open source can be a very efficient way to deliver software," said panelist Dion Almaer, director of developer relations at Palm. Open source, however, is "not a silver bullet to anything," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussing the "open data" trend, McAllister questioned whether companies can make money off the concept. "Sooner or later, a lot of us are in the business of trying to put their sons through college," McAllister said. There needs to be a way to make money in the data, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldfarb pointed out Microsoft's backing of the Open Data Protocol, or OData, which serves as an extension of the Atom Publishing Protocol. The trend around data is all about the consumer and consumption experience, he said. Microsoft's "Dallas" project, Goldfarb said, features large data sets for use in applications.&#160; Data could be delivered to consumers and businesses built around data services, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft, Adobe confident there is room for Silverlight, Flash," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Mar 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: There are four photos and one video associated with this
Press Release.

    Microsoft Canada Inc. announced today it is working with local open
government experts and Vancouver-based developer Nitobi, to help make
government data more easily accessible and useful for citizens.
Leveraging the City of Vancouver's Open Data catalogue and Microsoft's
Open Government Data Initiative (OGDI) platform, Nitobi has developed
VanGuide, a web and mobile based social mapping application that enables
citizens to tag, rate and comment on Vancouver landmarks and locations.
The codebase for the project has been released as an Open Source
framework, to enable the creation of new community driven "mash ups",
presenting new opportunities to increase citizen participation and
collaboration.

    VanGuide is just one example of how Microsoft is working to build a
vibrant application ecosystem around Open Data catalogues in Canada and
around the world by leveraging the power of technology. 

    Microsoft's Open Government Efforts Felt Across Canada:

    - Since the launch of Vancouver's Open Data Catalogue, local programmers
have been working on applications to make the data useful for the
citizens of Vancouver. Apps like Vancouver Parking, MapWay and
FreeFinders are the result of a Microsoft sponsored competition to
encourage the development of open government apps.

    - Edmonton is the first North American city to use the Open Government
Data Initiative (OGDI) cloud-based solution from Microsoft for its Open
Data Catalogue. The catalogue was implemented at minimal cost to the City
using open source components and Microsoft's newest cloud operating
system, Windows Azure (TM). Using open standards and application
interfaces (API), local developers and municipal IT staff can easily
retrieve data for use in innovative online applications that can help
improve citizen services, enhance collaboration between public and
private organizations and increase City transparency.

    - In November 2009, Microsoft Canada held an Open Government Roundtable
in Vancouver which brought together various Western government
organizations planning open government initiatives. The event facilitated
the sharing of best practices amongst the cities of Vancouver, Calgary,
Edmonton, North Vancouver and Nanaimo and served as a discussion hub on
how technology can assist with the challenges around deployment.
Currently, Microsoft is working with the cities of Nanaimo and Calgary on
new Gov 2.0 projects.

    - Microsoft continues to contribute and drive innovation through its Open
Source initiatives such as Microsoft's CodePlex.com, Port25 and Open
Source Technology Center (OTC). A deep engagement with local Open Source
and application communities is also maintained through a series of events
including WordCamp, DemoCamp and most recently ConFoo conference.
Microsoft's open source efforts also include Web Application Gallery, PHP
on Windows and the FTW! Coding Competition at the Make Web, Not War event
in Montreal on May 27th, 2010.

    Supporting Quotes:

    Nik Garkusha, Platform Strategy Manager, Microsoft Canada Inc.

    "Microsoft is open to Open Source. We actively foster application
development using Open Data catalogues on a variety of application
platforms to help government organizations meet their transparency,
citizen participation and agency collaboration goals. By helping Canadian
cities transform how they deliver services, our continued focus is on
interoperability and helping close the digital divide." 

    Andre Charland, CEO, Nitobi.

    "We're presently using open source components with Microsoft technologies
to quickly respond to business needs and create innovative mobile and Web
applications. Our VanGuide application and the underlying Open Data
Application Framework are clear examples of the power of open standards
on the Microsoft platform, enabled by open source to make information
available for all citizens."

JOHANNESBURG--(Business Wire)--
Special Olympics athletes, playing alongside football legends and other
celebrities, will compete in the inaugural match of the "Unity Cup" presented by
Coca-Cola, on the same pitch that just hours later will host a FIFA World Cup
match. The Coca-Cola Company, in partnership with Special Olympics, today
announced details of the event which will take place at Green Point Stadium in
Cape Town, South Africa, on July 3, prior to a quarterfinal match of the 2010
FIFA World Cup. 

The goal of the Unity Cup is to support the movement of inclusion and acceptance
for people with intellectual disabilities and is an extension of the Special
Olympics Unified Sports program. The Unified Sports program brings Special

teams for friendly athletic competition. Participants in the Unity Cup will
include South African President Jacob Zuma, former South African national team

team Desiree Ellis, and Clarence Seedorf of A.C. Milan. 

"We have a long and unique association with sport, especially football, and have
witnessed over the decades how it can unite people," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, The Coca-Cola Company and a member of the Special
Olympics International Board of Directors. "The Unity Cup is a testament to that
power as we have brought together our partners at Special Olympics and FIFA to
shine a spotlight on the important values of understanding, acceptance and
inclusion that we all share." 

Since the establishment of Special Olympics in 1968, The Coca-Cola Company has
been an Official Global Partner. Coca-Cola supports the movement through
financial and in-kind support, marketing expertise and hands-on volunteer work
in an effort to showcase the dignity and capacity of people with intellectual
disabilities on a global stage. 

"The Unity Cup is an incredible opportunity to showcase the abilities of our
Special Olympics athletes on a world stage," said Special Olympics Chairman and
CEO Timothy Shriver. "The Unified Sports experience benefits not only our
athletes but also the partners involved without disabilities as we promote a
global community of inclusion and acceptance. Thanks to our global partner
Coca-Cola, while the world`s attention is focused on football, we can continue
to share the message that sport is a powerful agent to bring together people
from all walks of life." 

Special Olympics South Africa, accredited by Special Olympics, Inc. in 1991,
conducts more than 700 local competitions annually with more than 22,000
athletes participating. The South African organization has sent athletes to

Competition for 10 teams from five provinces.

&lt;p&gt;Devon IT`s investments in RemoteFX designed for future compatibility with rich
media enhancements in Windows Server 2008 R2
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Devon IT, Inc., a provider of thin client hardware and software solutions ,
today announced plans to support Microsoft RemoteFX, a feature being developed
for Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, in a future version of Devon IT
products. 

Devon IT is developing a Microsoft RemoteFX software client that will be
integrated into its Devon Terminal System (DeTOS) and VDI Blaster products. The
RemoteFX client will allow users to take advantage of rich media features such
as 3D user interface, video, animations, and portable graphics stacks like
Microsoft Silverlight and Flash, and a diverse array of client-side devices.
This means that customers who purchase a Devon IT thin client such as the TC5
today will be able to upgrade DeTOS and take advantage of Microsoft RemoteFX
when it becomes available. 

"Devon IT has been a recognized innovator in developing cutting-edge alternative
desktop technologies for the last five years," explained Joe Makoid, President,
Devon IT. "When an iconic company like Microsoft, which has built the modern
desktop computer industry into what it is today, announces technology like
Microsoft RemoteFX it is a market setting and industry changing event. It is
exciting for us to announce our full support of Microsoft RemoteFX. The VDI
Blaster, the Devon TC5, the E5400X SafeBook and the new Devon RemoteFX Zero
client will provide our customers and business partners with powerful ,
graphically rich and energy efficient solutions for their desktop deployments.
The RemoteFX-based products and technologies from Devon IT will fundamentally
help our customers increase their desktop computing productivity and reduce
their costs." 

Historically the end-user experience has been a factor limiting the usability in
some remote desktops. Microsoft RemoteFX gives an enhanced user experience
regardless of the type of application (3D, web based video streaming, etc).
Since RemoteFX relies on server-side rendering, it enables Devon IT to build
simplified thin clients that do not need to be upgraded as new multimedia
players or codecs are created. This allows customers to deploy low cost, highly
secure, highly reliable and centrally manageable thin clients even to their most
demanding users. 

"As organizations plan to deploy a centralized computing architecture with
virtualized or session-based desktops, IT professionals want to deliver a
premium user experience to connected workers," said Mike Schutz, director of
product management at Microsoft Corp. "The Microsoft RemoteFX feature in Windows
Server will allow remote workers to access any type of application or screen
content, including rich media and 3D applications. Companies such as Devon IT
are offering a path to the future by investing in solutions today that will
increase the flexibility and performance of a centralized desktop environment."

&lt;p&gt;Quest Software`s Investments in RemoteFX Designed for Future Compatibility with
Rich Media Enhancements in Windows Server 2008 R2
ALISO VIEJO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Quest Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: QSFT), provider of vWorkspace, a single
virtualization solution for application delivery and desktop deployments, today
announced plans to support Microsoft RemoteFX, a Windows Server 2008 R2 Service
Pack 1 feature currently under development, in future versions of Quest
products. 

Quest vWorkspace supports multiple centralized desktop platforms, including
Microsoft Hyper-V-based virtual desktops, Remote Desktop Session hosts (formerly
known as Terminal Servers) and physical/blade PCs. vWorkspace delivers advanced
management capabilities including connection brokering, desktop provisioning and
user experience optimizations, and provides support for Microsoft Hyper-V Server
R2, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. 

"We`re delighted to see this exciting new capability coming to the Remote
Desktop Services platform," said Jon Rolls, division vice president of product
management for Quest Software`s Desktop Virtualization Group. "Microsoft
RemoteFX increases the range of applications and user workloads that can be
delivered remotely, and delivers a higher level of user experience for
graphically intense applications." 

Added Rolls, "With our vWorkspace product, we will continue to enhance and
extend the Remote Desktop Services platform to deliver user experience
optimizations, especially for remote workers with WAN or Internet connections.
We believe these optimizations will be especially important for customers using
RemoteFX, and currently plan to extend our support to include RemoteFX within 30
days of its availability." 

Quest vWorkspace brings numerous benefits to customers centralizing desktops
using Remote Desktop Virtualization Hosts with Microsoft Hyper-V and Remote
Desktop Session hosts, including greater reductions in total cost of ownership,
increased levels of user acceptance and faster rollouts of desktop
virtualization projects. The addition of Microsoft RemoteFX into this technology
stack raises these benefits to a higher level, increasing the adoption of
desktop virtualization on the Windows platform. 

"As organizations plan deployment of a centralized computing architecture with
virtualized or session-based desktops, IT professionals want to deliver a
premium user experience to connected workers," said Mike Schutz, director of
product management, Microsoft Corp. "The Microsoft RemoteFX feature in Windows

SEBRING, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Continuing a motorsports alliance showcasing the performance benefits of
world-class synthetic motor oil technology, ExxonMobil and Corvette Racing have
extended their partnership in which ExxonMobil provides its Mobil 1 lubricant
technology and engineering support to the Corvette Racing team. 

Formally announced before the debut of the 2010 American LeMans Series (ALMS)
season at the 58th Annual Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring, the renewed
collaboration will mark the 14th consecutive year in which the Mobil 1 brand has
been a major associate sponsor for Corvette Racing and the "Official Lubricant
of Corvette Racing." In this multi-year agreement, Mobil 1 branding will
continue to appear on Corvette Racing`s C6.R cars, uniforms and vehicles. 

"Partnering with such a globally respected racing team gives us an excellent
platform to fully demonstrate the technological benefits of our products," said
David Tsurusaki, Strategic Global Alliance Manager, ExxonMobil Lubricants &amp;
Petroleum Specialties. "This agreement with Corvette Racing, along with the 17
straight years of Mobil 1 being the Corvette factory fill motor oil, underscores
the engine performance and protection that Mobil 1 technology delivers on the
track and on the road. ExxonMobil engineers work closely with Pratt &amp; Miller and
Corvette Racing to develop and test new technologies to optimize power-train
performance, improve fuel economy benefits and increase horsepower output
without sacrificing engine durability. This collaboration has advanced Mobil 1
motor oils, gear oils and greases that have and may be used in future Corvette
and GM vehicles." 

The relationship with Mobil 1 has helped Corvette drive to the winner`s circle
on the international race circuit again and again. At the conclusion of the
Corvette team's participation in the GT1 category in June 2009, Corvette Racing
had won 77 races, eight consecutive American Le Mans Series GT1 manufacturers
and team championships, and seven straight drivers championships. Last year,
Corvette Racing scored three victories in the American Le Mans Series Michelin
GREEN X Challenge based on energy used, greenhouse gases emitted and petroleum
fuels displaced. Lastly, Corvette Racing has enjoyed international success in
the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's biggest sports car race, with six class
victories since 2001, the latest in 2009. 

"As America's premier production sports car racing team, Corvette Racing is
excited to continue to partner with such a well known and esteemed racing
technology like Mobil 1 motor oil, particularly with 2010 being such a huge year
for Corvette Racing as we fully transition to a single GT class in ALMS," said
Doug Fehan, Program Manager, Corvette Racing. "With its signature high
performance engine, our C6.R Corvettes, which are based on the production
Corvette ZR1, require a lubricant that can withstand extremely high operating
temperatures and provide engine durability. For more than a decade, Mobil 1
technology advisors have helped ensure that Corvette Racing`s engines are
operating at peak performance, helping us win races year after year." 

At Sebring, Corvette Racing will take the green flag at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday,
March 20, competing in the American LeMans Series GT2 class against entries
representing Porsche, Ferrari, BMW, Jaguar, and Ford. Corvette Racing drivers
Johnny O'Connell, Jan Magnussen, and Antonio Garcia will drive the No. 3
Compuware Corvette C6.R. Oliver Gavin, Olivier Beretta, and Emmanuel Collard
will drive the No. 4 Compuware Corvette C6.R.

A Long History of Performance: Mobil 1 in Motorsports

Mobil 1, the world`s leading synthetic motor oil brand, has long been the
lubricant of choice for race teams competing in the most demanding and popular
motorsports series across the globe. 

Mobil 1`s history in motorsports officially began in 1978 with a sponsorship of
the Williams Formula One Racing Team. From that time, Mobil 1's presence on race
tracks and circuits has grown by grand proportions. Today, Mobil 1 synthetic oil
is relied on for its ability to deliver exceptional engine performance and
protection even under some of the most extreme conditions by automotive
technicians, race car drivers, team owners and the world`s leading automotive
manufacturers. Currently, more than half of all NASCAR teams rely on Mobil 1
technology. 

Along with its status as the Official Motor Oil of NASCAR, Mobil 1 enjoys a long
association with many of world's most popular and successful race teams,
including Vodafone McLaren Mercedes` Formula One team, Corvette Racing`s
American LeMans Series team, the official AMG-Mercedes factory teams in the
European-based DTM championship, Alex Job Racing Le Mans GT2 team, Penske
Racing's NASCAR and IndyCar Series teams, as well as the Porsche Mobil 1
Supercup-the world`s fastest international one-make series. 

About Corvette Racing's C6.R

&lt;p&gt;Wyse's Support for RemoteFX Designed to be the Best Rich Media Experience for
VDI Environments Across All Endpoints Accessing Windows Server 2008 R2
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Wyse Technology, the global leader in thin computing and client virtualization,
today announced plans to support Microsoft RemoteFX technology, enabling rich
media experience across all Wyse client platforms. 

Microsoft RemoteFX, a feature being developed for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1,
will integrate with any and all Wyse devices and both companies expect today's
announcements to accelerate desktop virtualization deployments. 

"With the Wyse support for RemoteFX, users will benefit from a full, rich media
experience while maintaining the energy (Green IT), TCO and security benefits of
a VDI environment across multiple client solutions," said Curt Schwebke, Chief
Technology Officer, at Wyse. "The combination of these benefits is yet another
reason that we see thin clients paired with cloud computing and virtual desktops
becoming the standard for business large and small." 

As desktop virtualization adoption continues to grow, end users and IT
administrators are seeing the benefits of being able to experience a complete
desktop experience on any device, and not be limited to a PC. For IT users, this
enables the acceleration of desktop and application deployment; for end users
they benefit from flexible work scenarios such as the ability to work from home.
In addition, information and applications are kept safe in the datacenter,
reducing the risk of laptop data and simplifying the burden of regulatory
compliance through central management. Finally, the integration of Microsoft
RemoteFX with Wyse devices helps to increase remote worker efficiency, by
quickly and securely connecting remote workers with the applications they need
through a simple Web connection. These remote workers will have the equivalent
of a PC experience, but with none of the management or security liabilities
inherent in personal computers. 

"As organizations plan to deploy a centralized computing architecture with
virtualized or session-based desktops, IT professionals want to deliver a
premium user experience to connected workers," said Mike Schutz, director of
product management at Microsoft Corp. "The Microsoft RemoteFX feature in Windows
Server will allow remote workers to access any type of application or screen
content, including rich media and 3D applications. Companies such as Wyse are
offering a path to the future by investing in solutions today that will increase
the flexibility and performance of a centralized desktop environment." 

According to Forrester Research, Inc.: "Beginning in 2010 but flourishing over
the long term, the 'corporate desktop' will no longer be a physical machine but
a virtual image that users will access from whatever device is most convenient
at that time in that particular location. And users will be able to complete all
of their activities (work and personal) from the same device without security
compromises&#8230;Looking ahead, Forrester predicts broader, industrywide adoption in
2010 as IT managers increasingly view client virtualization as the future of the
corporate PC."1

Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 is expected to be released at a later date. To

&lt;p&gt;Investments in RemoteFX Designed for Compatibility of Thin Client Systems With
Rich Media Enhancements in Windows Server 2008 R2
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
AppliedMicro (Nasdaq:AMCC), a global leader in energy conscious computing and
communications solutions and a provider of thin clients, today announced plans
to support Microsoft RemoteFX, a feature being developed for Windows Server 2008
R2 Service Pack 1, in future versions of the AppliedMicro application
processors. 

AppliedMicro advanced application processors for multimedia thin clients with
desktop, applications and storage virtualized in the cloud, is designed to be
fully compliant to Microsoft RemoteFX. The company has been working closely with
Microsoft to enhance cloud-based remote services enablement and user experience
using hardware algorithm-based implementations. The compliance ensures that
application processors on the client side will be fully interoperable with the
Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 and interoperable with the ecosystem of
Microsoft RemoteFX alliances. 

"Hardware-based desktop virtualization has been the missing link in increased
deployments of multimedia capable thin clients," said Raghu Kondapalli Senior
Director of Technology at AppliedMicro. "Traditionally, the high bandwidth and
processing requirements of thin clients have kept costs higher relative to
personal computers. With RemoteFX technology adoption, cloud-based service
deployment becomes economically viable leading to increased adoption of thin
clients in consumer and small and medium business environments." 

"As organizations plan to deploy a centralized computing architecture with
virtualized or session-based desktops, IT professionals want to deliver a
premium user experience to connected workers," said Mike Schutz, Director of
Product Management at Microsoft Corporation. "The Microsoft RemoteFX feature in
Windows Server will allow remote workers to access any type of application or
screen content, including rich media and 3D applications, and companies such as
AppliedMicro are offering a path to the future by investing in solutions today
that will increase the flexibility and performance of a centralized desktop
environment."

which caused Tuesday's safety flare event were corrected quickly
and the facility is operating normally," company spokesman Rod
Spackman said in an email late Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, the spokesman had said the refinery began
flaring Tuesday due to issues with its instrument air system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron had warned of unplanned flaring at the refinery in a
notice filed with California pollution regulators on Wednesday.
The notice said the flaring could last through Thursday morning.

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, Mar 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Following recommendations from the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC),
the UK Government has today announced a number of changes to the
requirements for migrants seeking Tier 1 and Tier 2 visas. The Tier 1
visa is for highly skilled and qualified migrants who are taking up
senior roles in the UK, whereas the Tier 2 visa is intended for skilled
migrants holding a job offer from a UK company licensed to sponsor
migrants. In 2008 the Government introduced a points-based system for
both these categories, and the announcement modifies the points tables
for both visa types. 

    Phil Woolas, the Minister of State for borders and immigration at the
Home Office, issued a written ministerial statement today setting out the
changes to both Tier 1 visa and Tier 2 visa points tables. The changes
will take effect from 6th April 2010. The minister's statement claims
that the changes will simplify the immigration process for highly skilled
workers seeking a Tier 1 visa who do not have a Master's degree, and make
it more straightforward for multinational companies to arrange short-term
transfers while protecting against companies using these transfers to
fill vacancies that should go to resident workers. The Minister has not
accepted the MAC's recommendation that certain professional
qualifications should be included on the points table, saying that it
would be too complex to administer. 

    The points table for Tier 2 visa applicants has been modified to align it
more closely to the salary bandings for resident skilled workers. Other
changes include a requirement for intra-company transferees to have a
minimum of twelve months' company experience before transferring into the
UK, and changes to the provisions for doctors in training. These changes
will improve flexibility for companies, as well as making it more
straightforward for highly-qualified workers coming into the UK to seek
work on a Tier 1 visa. 

    Commenting on the changes, Liam Clifford of world-leading visa company
Global Visas said, "We have been asking for this for some time. This is
fantastic news long overdue. UK employers have been fighting during the
past recession with one hand behind their back. Hopefully UK Plc can now
get back to securing the skills in desperate demand."

&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, a major comparative review comes together at exactly the right time, where tests of actual shipping products reveal the impact of just-released technology in no uncertain terms. This review is one of those times. Blade servers from Dell, HP, and IBM --&#160;all&#160;three sporting&#160;the latest Xeon 5600 (aka Westmere) CPU --&#160;arrived&#160;at our test&#160;facility&#160;at the University of&#160;Hawaii before&#160;Intel&#160;had even officially introduced the chip. As it turns out, our benchmarks reveal that Westmere&#160;carries blades&#160;to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the start of&#160;the InfoWorld blade server shoot-out of 2010&#160;was marked by a natural disaster and hampered by Murphy's Law, we persevered and spent two weeks beating up the best blade systems on the market to find their highs and lows. We built custom power monitoring loops, drank way too many lattes, and worked long into the Hawaiian nights as we ran the Dell, HP, and IBM blade solutions through a gauntlet of tests. They didn't flinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also managed to add a budget-friendly Supermicro blade chassis into the mix. Where a Dell, HP, or IBM chassis with four blades starts upward of $40,000, the Supermicro solution costs a mere fraction of that. It is not in the same class as the big three blade systems, but it's an interesting option for shops that may not need the latest features or maximum performance. Since it was available in the lab, we put it through the same paces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Fast AES encryption, better scalability, and consistent per-core performance make the new six-core Xeon a worthy successor to Nehalem. See "InfoWorld review: Intel's Westmere struts its stuff." ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with our previous blades shoot-out, all the testing was conducted at the University of Hawaii ANCL (Advanced Network Computing Lab) facilities on Oahu, facilitated by lab director, networking guru, and fellow InfoWorld contributor Brian Chee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blade server triathlonThe test plan this time around was quite different from the blade server shoot-out we ran in 2007. Gone are the HPC benchmarks, as we opted for a suite of custom VMware tests and an array of real-world performance metrics. The VMware tests were composed of a single large-scale custom LAMP application -- a load-balancer running Nginx, four Apache Web servers, and two MySQL servers -- laid out with sufficient vCPU and RAM resources to oversubscribe the physical and logical CPUs in each blade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workload was designed to mimic a real-world Web app usage model, with a weighted mix of static and dynamic content and randomized database updates, inserts, and deletes. This load was generated at specific concurrency levels, starting at 50 concurrent connections and ramping up to 200. The sweet spot on all the blades was the 150 concurrent connections mark, so we used those numbers for the published results. These VMware tests were run first on one, then across two blades. The blades were running VMware ESX 4 and controlled by a dedicated vCenter instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other real-world tests were an array of common single-threaded tasks run simultaneously at levels that met and eclipsed the logical CPU count on each blade, running all the way up to an 8x oversubscription of physical cores. These tests included LAME MP3 conversions of 155MB WAV files, MP4-to-FLV video conversions of 155MB video files, gzip and bzip2 compression tests, and MD5 sum tests -- the same benchmarks we used last week to compare the new Intel Westmere-EP and prior generation Nehalem-EP CPUs. They represent a good cross-section of actual workloads and proved to be consistent markers of overall blade performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to those tests, we rounded out the benchmarks by using Ixia's IxChariot tools to gauge network throughput between blades in the same chassis. Those tests were based on a few common loads, including iSCSI 32K and 256K read tests, a packet blaster load, and a BitTorrent P2P load that gauged connection rates.&#160;We also used Ixia's IxLoad testing tool to generate load on the LAMP application for preliminary testing, prior to using the benchmark's built-in client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westmere vs. WestmereAlthough Dell, HP, and IBM were free to choose whichever CPU they liked for the test, all arrived with Intel Westmere-EP X5670 2.93GHz CPUs and at least 24GB of RAM in each blade. The reason for the Westmeres is clear: Six cores beats four, and with the Westmeres also edging Nehalem in per-core performance, they're the fastest thing going in the x64 world right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell also brought along one set of X5680 3.33GHz CPUs, which allowed us to see what the X5680 CPUs could do. For the sake of apples-to-apples comparisons, however, we evaluated the Dell blade's performance based on the X5670 chips. Our low-budget Supermicro blades were outfitted with slower (and far cheaper) AMD Opteron 2378s, quad-core Shanghai CPUs running at 2.4GHz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also allowed each vendor to choose which type of storage to bring. Dell showed up with a Dell EqualLogic PS6010XV 10G iSCSI SAN array, HP brought an EVA 2124 Fibre Channel array, and IBM also went the Fibre Channel route with a System Storage DS5020. Due to time constraints and the relative disparity between the storage mediums, SAN array throughput tests were not conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blade performance test results were quite interesting in that they were basically identical. Running the Westmere X5670s, the Dell, HP, and IBM blade solutions performed within the margin of error across all tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threading concurrency tests showed that by and large, the Dell, HP, and IBM blades ran neck and neck, with IBM taking the slightest of leads near the upper end of the accuracy margin. The VMware LAMP application tests also resulted in a statistical draw, with IBM topping out at 2,125, HP at 2,110, and Dell at 2,104 requests per second, giving IBM a "lead" of around 0.7 percent. Suffice it to say, there's no significant performance difference among the three Westmere-equipped blade systems in the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our low-budget Supermicro entry pulled in last, as expected. With four cores per CPU instead of six, a lower clock rate, only 8GB of RAM, and a chip that's several generations behind, the Supermicro performed quite well for its cost, but was nowhere near comparable to the Intel Westmere blades -- no surprises there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Dell also brought a set of 3.33GHz Intel Westmere X5680 CPUs, we swapped those processors into one of the Dell blades and reran the threading concurrency tests. The results were around 12 percent faster than the X5670-based tests, reflecting the 400MHz increase in clock speed per core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Dell, HP, and IBM blades all performed equally well in the Ixia IxChariot throughput tests too. This shows that at this point in time, the major vendors have stabilized on Intel Westmere, and the internal 10G switching fabrics have matured. The Supermicro entry did not have 10G, but performed up to spec with the 1G interfaces present on the test blades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrap it upOn the last day of testing, we were faced with the daunting challenge of preparing well over a ton of blade server hardware for shipping back to their respective companies. It's never a good time, but we managed to get all the crates back on their pallets and ready for the freight companies to drive them to the airport. It was an impressively long few weeks of deep dives into what makes modern blade servers tick, and we came away with some basic facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measured on an &#160;apples-to-apples basis, the Dell, HP, and IBM blade systems will all hit their performance marks. There is no significant difference in blade performance in similarly equipped blades from any of these vendors. Thus, without meaningful differences in performance to go on, our evaluations of this batch of blades come down to features, options, price, and management tools. Please refer to the separate write-ups on the Dell PowerEdge M1000e, HP BladeSystem c7000, IBM BladeCenter H, and the Supermicro SuperBlade for the full details, but we'll offer some brief observations here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since our last look, Dell has certainly been busy streamlining its blades management interface, and the company has introduced some extremely compelling features such as the global BIOS and firmware update tools. HP's management is also well rounded, but is inexplicably missing a few features that the other vendors offer, such as those BIOS and firmware updates and the ability to map local shares for virtual drive and ISO image mounting. IBM is no slouch, with a spartan yet navigable management GUI. Of course, all three vendors also offer external global management tools to take blade and server management to the next level, but these tools were beyond the scope of our review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a middle-of-the-road use case, you'll do well with any of these solutions. If you want a solid blade server platform on the lower end of the pricing scale and don't need extras like storage blades, then the Dell M1000e is a good fit. If you need internal storage, such as for a branch office deployment, or any of a wide array of blade types, then the HP c7000 is right up your alley. If you don't mind losing two blade slots per chassis but need some extra redundancy, then the IBM BladeCenter H might be just the ticket. If you're worried about the bottom dollar and don't mind adding elbow grease and sacrificing some performance and options, then the Supermicro SuperBlade is an extremely affordable way to add blades to your data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the choice, it's obvious that the current crop of blade servers is more than ready to ride the virtualization wave and meet just about any other challenge. By choosing one of these blade systems over ordinary 1U servers, you can expect not only stellar performance, but also greater availability, comprehensive management, and lower power and cooling costs. The advanced power and cooling management in some of these solutions can enhance the overall cost savings as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Blade server shoot-out: Dell, HP, and IBM battle for the virtual data center," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;Everything about the IBM BladeCenter H just screams IBM, from the mainframe-like aesthetics to the spartan management interface -- even the "H" model name. Severe-looking matte-black chassis notwithstanding, the BladeCenter H matches most of the major features of the&#160;Dell and&#160;HP blade systems but at a higher price. The BladeCenter also comes in smaller portions:&#160;IBM's slightly shorter chassis holds fewer blades than the Dell and HP enclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With features like the Virtual Fabric virtualized network I/O, the HS22V blades specifically designed for virtualization, and reasonably complete embedded management tools, the BladeCenter H is a solid solution. But the higher price, lower density, and lack of advanced embedded management capabilities are drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld compares the leading blade server solutions: "Blade server shoot-out: Dell, HP, and IBM battle for the virtual data center." ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chassis and blades The IBM BladeCenter H is a 9U chassis that holds 14 blades -- again, 2 fewer than the HP and Dell blade units. Each blade is surprisingly slim, but they're otherwise nearly identical to the others' blade offerings. There's no heads-up LCD, and several of the status lights are small enough to be difficult to see at a glance. The H chassis is also unique in having a vertical DVD-ROM drive set into the bezel on the right-hand side; each blade has a Media Tray button that maps the contents of that drive (or an image via the management console) to that particular blade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the rear, there are eight I/O slots, split into two groups of four. The four traditional modules support lower-bandwidth I/O, including gigabit Ethernet and 1x InfiniBand or Myrinet fabrics. The other four modules are tasked for high-bandwidth I/O, including 10G Ethernet and 4x InfiniBand. As with the others, they're mapped 1-to-1 to the blade I/O ports, so you'll need a matched set of I/O modules in the rear to fully support the internal I/O in each blade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internal I/O of each blade is more like Dell's than HP's: The gigabit Ethernet interfaces are embedded on each blade, and 10G interfaces are supplied on a mezzanine card. However, like HP, IBM includes a virtual interconnect: IBM's Virtual Fabric for 10G interfaces represents a 10G pipe to a blade as four Ethernet ports that can each be tuned for specific functions or bandwidth caps. Like the HP equivalent, configuring the Virtual Fabric modules is nothing like configuring normal switches, and the IBM techs didn't really know how it worked. We couldn't even get into the configuration for those modules to poke around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main blade models: the HS22 and the HS22V. The HS22 is built on the model of a traditional blade, with two 2.5-inch SAS hot-swap drive bays, two CPU sockets, and 12 DIMM slots. The HS22V is a different unit altogether, adding 6 more DIMM slots and deleting the 2.5-inch SAS drive bays in favor of two 1.8-inch SSD non-hot-swap bays internal to the blade. This is a blade designed for virtualization with the expectation that a hypervisor will be loaded on the mirrored SSDs and all storage will come from an attached SAN. The HS22V is a great way to expand the RAM footprint of each blade without sacrificing space or additional power required to run SAS drives. HP offers a similar blade, the HP BL490c, but did not bring it to the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also notable that IBM had the only redundant internal power and I/O connectors on each blade. The midplane is not redundant, but the connections to each blade are, which offers some protection against connector and interface failure at the blade level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management tools IBM's Web-based management console, called Advanced Management Module (AMM), is clean and sparse. There's no graphical representation of the chassis; in fact, there aren't any images at all. The left-hand frame offers a hierarchical view of the configuration, status, and management options, and the main frame holds the focus of the current selection. While the GUI is very plain, it's also reasonably simple to find what you're looking for. As a stand-alone management console, the AMM is sufficient but not particularly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Dell manager, the AMM provides links to the dedicated management tools for the I/O modules. However, we were not able to log into anything but the Fibre Channel switch, as there was a problem gaining access to the Virtual Fabric switches directly. As with HP's Virtual Connect, dealing with the Virtual Fabric configuration is not nearly as simple and straightforward as configuring standard Ethernet switches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were some other oddities in the AMM, such as the fact that when you bring up a listing of the I/O modules, the table view doesn't list the IP addresses of the modules. Instead, it shows a View link, requiring you to click the link to pop up a window that displays the IP address. Such extra steps quickly become bothersome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's remote KVM tool is functional, but somewhat difficult to use for certain tasks. For instance, mounting CD/DVD and floppy images is odd in that you can select an image for mounting, and then move it between blades, but you can't easily mount different images to different blades in the same session. However, it is relatively simple to move between blade consoles within one remote KVM console window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is rather more impressive is the marriage of the BladeCenter H and IBM Director, IBM's global mastermind tool. Director is a dedicated server monitoring and management tool that provides problem alerting and handy global management capabilities such as automated actions when failures occur. It's free with any IBM hardware, though some advanced capabilities are provided through for-fee plug-ins. Global management tools are available in various forms from Dell and HP as well. They are largely outside the scope of this review, but they warrant a mention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Dell and HP chassis, the IBM BladeCenter H lacks dynamic power and cooling capabilities. Instead of a bevy of smaller fans, the chassis has two large fans that ramp up and down as load dictates. The power supplies are also not as adaptable as those in the Dell and HP chassis. This is a box meant to work long and hard, at the expense of some power savings. There are facilities to implement power capping, as in the HP c7000, though this capability comes at an extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the dynamic power and cooling features found on the other chassis, the IBM solution drew more power during our power measurement tests, topping off at around 1.4kW with two blades pushing a full load and maintaining a 1kW average at idle with two blades inserted and running without load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Return to "Blade server shoot-out: Dell, HP, and IBM battle for the virtual data center" | Read the review of the Dell PowerEdge M1000e, HP BladeSystem c7000, IBM BladeCenter H, or Supermicro SuperBlade. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related stories: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  WHISTLER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Mar 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: There are three photos and five videos associated with this
Press Release

    Less than an hour after the Paralympic torch was extinguished in Whistler
Medal Plaza, the Canadian Paralympic Team received a celebratory flame of
corporate support from one of its longest-standing corporate partners,
Pfizer Canada.

    Although Pfizer Canada's sponsorship agreement does not expire until
2012, the company publicly renewed its support in an announcement. The
news was shared in front of a cheering crowd of athletes, family members,
dignitaries and fans during an upbeat celebration held at Whistler Canada
Paralympic House on March 21, 2010.

    Today, the company officially confirmed it is pledging five more years of
support to the Team under a $1 million partnership agreement that runs
until 2017.

    "This means so much. Pfizer is signaling to the world that Canada is
feeling the rush of Paralympic sport. It's a sign our nation is excited
about Paralympic sport, even beyond Vancouver," says Paralympian and
sledge hockey star Benoit St-Amand. "It's a vote of confidence for future
Teams - and it feels great," he says.

    Keeping the promise burning bright for future generations

    "Pfizer is a health care company that strives to help Canadians live
inspired, healthy lives. For the past nine days, Canada's Paralympic Team
pushed the limits of athletic accomplishment and showed our entire
nation, and the world, the power of believing in yourself and your
dreams," explains Ghislain Boudreau, Vice-President Public Affairs and
Stakeholder Relations, Pfizer Canada. Boudreau says the legacy of the
2010 Paralympic Team is inspiring Canada's children and youth to get
involved in sport, which he calls a great gift to the future health of
the nation.

    "We believe Vancouver 2010 can create momentum for a new era of
inclusiveness, awareness and access for Canadians who live with
disabilities. As a leading health care company, Pfizer feels a
responsibility to help keep that promise alive and burning bright so that
it doesn't fade out in a few months," says Boudreau. "By renewing our
commitment now, we're letting the Team know that we're here for them
through to 2017, which will represent 21 consecutive years of Pfizer
support," he says.

    Powerful statement about partnership

    "Pfizer's early renewal is a powerful example of true partnership," says
Henry Storgaard, Chief Executive Officer, Canadian Paralympic Committee.
"By stepping up to the plate now, they are helping us continue the
momentum created by hosting a Paralympic Games on home soil and to focus
on what's truly important: supporting our athletes. It's a boost of
support and encouragement. And it's coming at a very meaningful time for
CPC as we continue to build for the future."

    "The Canadian Government is committed to supporting amateur sport because
we believe sport can help teach young generations of Canadians important
lessons about living a healthy, active life, discipline and teamwork. In
our last Budget, the Federal Government announced its intent to commit an
additional $10 million to fund Paralympic sport over the next two years
to help our team prepare for 2012 and to open more opportunities for
children and youth to get involved in Paralympic sport. Our commitment is
strong, but we need private sector partnership to maintain and build on
the momentum gained during these remarkable Games. We commend Pfizer
Canada for their commitment, and for demonstrating that the public and
private sectors can work together for the benefit of our great nation,"
says Minister of State (Sports) the Honourable Gary Lunn.

    Earlier this month, Pfizer and the Canadian Paralympic Committee joined
forces to release an online film called Believing in Yourself. Every time
the film is viewed and shared at morethanmedication.ca, the company
donates $5 to the Team.

    Kids of Courage, a free e-book for Canadian families is also available
online at morethanmedication.ca. Families can view the e-book online;
download a free PDF and listen to audio recordings. 40,000 printed copies
of the book were donated to Canadian libraries. Braille and audio
versions are also available for educators.

The new offerings help clients improve productivity and lower costs by
consolidating infrastructure, devices and management tools. 

Communication modes, technologies and devices are multiplying within
organizations, often in isolation from each other and critical business
operations. This creates a communications environment that slows
decision-making, spends valuable IT resources on maintenance and drives up
operations costs. The new HP offerings enable clients to improve business output
and reduce travel, telecom and IT operating costs by integrating with Microsoft
Communications Server "14." 

Building on the unified communications and collaboration initiative between HP
and Microsoft announced in May 2009, the offerings include:

* The HP Survivable Branch Communication zl Module reduces IT infrastructure at
remote branch offices and extends the business productivity and reliability of
Communications Server "14." It combines Microsoft Communications Server "14" and
HP ProCurve software within HP ProCurve Switch 8200zl and 5400zl series
products. 
* Four existing PC models designed to provide a rich business-grade voice and
video user experience at a lower total cost of ownership are now tested and
qualified as optimized for Microsoft Office Communicator.

"Organizations face growing challenges with a mobile workforce, increasing
complexity and business performance pressure," said Meg Shea-Chiles, vice
president, Microsoft Strategic Alliance, HP. "With these new offerings, we are
enhancing how people interact, shorten business decision cycle times and connect
remote employees to company culture." 

Reliable voice infrastructure for branch offices

The HP Survivable Branch Communication zl Module, expected to be available later
this year, delivers:

* Survivability: Branch offices can now better maintain network availability in
a Communications Server "14" environment with a reliable distributed public
switched telephone network backup in case of wide area network failure. 
* Simplicity: Organizations can increase efficiency and scalability by rapidly
installing, deploying and migrating from legacy PBX and key systems with
centralized remote management, across branch offices for Microsoft
Communications Server "14" environments. 
* Cost efficiency: Organizations can reduce costs by eliminating specialized
technology infrastructure, expertise and management tasks required at branch
locations.

PCs provide high-quality user experience, lower total cost of ownership

HP PCs qualified for Microsoft Communicator "14" eliminate the need for
additional devices to place and receive voice or video calls. The models
include:

* HP TouchSmart 9100 Business PC - For businesses in hospitality, retail,
healthcare and government verticals looking to engage their customers with
immersive, interactive content through a multitouch user interface. It is an
ideal device for businesses seeking to extend their customer communications. 
* HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC - Sets a new standard for on-the-move
productivity with all-day battery life(1) and business-rugged features. The

* HP EliteBook 8530w and 8730w Mobile Workstations - Features
workstation-caliber graphics that are tested, optimized and certified to run the
most demanding professional applications for mobile power users.

"Today`s increasingly mobile workforce introduces technology and support
challenges requiring end-users to become more self-sufficient," said Gurdeep
Singh Pall, corporate vice president, Office Communications Group, Microsoft
Corp. "Communications Server `14` combined with HP`s Survivable Branch
Communication zl Module and UC qualified PCs delivers reliable voice
infrastructure for branch offices as well as a high-quality user experience."

&lt;p&gt;Former Bakersfield Refinery Converted to Next-Generation Solar Demonstration
Facility
BAKERSFIELD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced the start of Project
Brightfield, a demonstration of next-generation solar energy technologies in
Bakersfield, California. The project, created on the site of a former Chevron
refinery, will evaluate seven emerging photovoltaic technologies to help
determine the potential application of renewable power at other company-owned
facilities. 

The former refinery site has been repurposed to test the performance of six
emerging thin-film technologies and one emerging crystalline-silicon
photovoltaic technology, which were provided by independent solar companies. 

"By bringing together seven emerging solar technologies, Project Brightfield
represents one of the most comprehensive solar energy tests of its kind and is
an innovative approach to evaluating new technologies," said Des King, president
of Chevron Technology Ventures, the division of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. that
identifies, evaluates and demonstrates emerging technologies. "Testing competing
technologies side by side means that we can better understand their potential
application at other Chevron facilities." 

The 7,700 solar panels on the 8-acre site will generate approximately 740 kW of
electricity. The produced power will be directed to the local utility grid as
well as to Chevron`s oil production operations at the Kern River Field. 

"Chevron has operated in the San Joaquin Valley for more than a century.
Throughout this time, our engineers have developed breakthrough technologies
that have helped make us the leading oil and gas producer in the state," said
Bruce Johnson, vice president of Chevron`s San Joaquin Valley Business Unit.
"The Brightfield solar demonstration facility is a clear example of Chevron`s
efforts to find ways to integrate innovative technologies into our business." 

The companies demonstrating thin-film technologies are Abound Solar, MiaSol&#233;,
Sch&#252;co, Solar Frontier, Sharp, and Solibro, while the crystalline-silicon
photovoltaic technology is provided by Innovalight. Each solar company can
access data about its technology, find out how well it performs in various
conditions and compare it against a benchmark solar technology - a brand of
commercially available solar photovoltaic technology - that has also been
installed on the site. 

Project Brightfield is Chevron`s second completed project that repurposes an
existing asset to integrate renewable power. The first was a wind farm on a
former Texaco refinery site near Casper, Wyoming, where 11 wind turbines
generate 16.5 megawatts of power. A third project - a concentrating solar
photovoltaic installation at a Chevron Mining Inc. facility near Questa, New
Mexico - is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2010. 

Video of Project Brightfield can be found on YouTube. 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is driven by
the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their application of the most
innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is involved in virtually every
facet of the energy industry. The company explores for, produces and transports
crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels
and other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy efficiency
solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future. Chevron is based in
San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is available at

&lt;p&gt;AudioCodes Announces Survivable Branch Appliances for Microsoft Communications
Server "14"

LOD, Israel, March 22, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AudioCodes (Nasdaq:AUDC), a
leading provider of Voice over IP (VoIP) technologies and Voice Network products
and a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, has taken its next step in enabling
customers the migration to Microsoft unified communications (UC) solutions, by
expanding its line of gateways to support Microsoft's Survivable Branch
Appliance functionality.

Fortune 500 companies have been using AudioCodes' Mediant 1000 and Mediant 2000
Gateways with both Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 and Microsoft
Office Communications Server 2007 R2. With the introduction of Microsoft

&lt;p&gt;New Models Provide Additional Unified Communications Choices and Ease of
Deployment for Enterprises 


ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Aastra, a leading company at the forefront of the enterprise communication
market, adds to its award-winning line of IP phones two new models optimized for
Microsoft Communicator "14." Both phones were announced today at VoiceCon in
Orlando, FL, a leading conference on enterprise communications.

With exceptional voice quality and stylish design, the Aastra 6721ip and 6725ip
phones tightly integrate with Microsoft Communications Server "14" and offer
user-friendly access to its features, making them powerful unified
communications (UC) devices. These phones can operate independently from a PC so
they can be easily and widely deployed. The Aastra 6725ip offers the additional
benefits of PC connection via USB cable for a tight integration with Microsoft
Communications Server "14": click-to-dial is enriched with presence status
ensuring a more efficient call management for business users and team
collaboration.

"Software clients and mobile devices will certainly meet the needs for some
workers, but others will demand more traditional handsets. Aastra`s 6721ip and
6725ip phones will help deliver Microsoft customers more choice in telephony end
points than previously made available to them. It`s also a positive development
for Aastra that will open new opportunities on the unified communications market
and for Microsoft by adding a partner with strong expertise in unified
communications and end points," said Brian Riggs, Research Director at Current
Analysis.

The Aastra 6721ip and 6725ip phones were designed with a focus on providing a
superior user experience to facilitate the adoption of unified communications
including:

* an intuitive interface clearly displayed on a full color 3.5" LCD screen;
* easy access to the most essential calling features through navigation keys;
and
* wideband audio which enhances the clarity of all calls, a particular benefit
for companies doing business internationally.

The 6721ip phone offers users choice of functionality at a cost effective price
point providing an entry level phone appropriate for most users or common areas
as an alternative to the mid-range, feature-rich 6725ip phone. Both models enjoy
the same proven Aastra reliability and quality.

"The introduction of the 6721ip and 6725ip continues Aastra`s strategy of
providing great choice, high quality and value to the enterprise communications
market," said Simon Beebe, Vice President of Product Management, responsible for
IP phones at Aastra. "We`re excited about this opportunity to work together with
Microsoft to deliver compelling UC solutions to meet the demanding needs of
today`s workers to communicate in a variety of ways."

"Combining Microsoft Communications Server '14' software with Aastra`s latest IP
Phones offers customers a more connected experience," said Kirk Gregersen,
senior director of Communications Server Marketing at Microsoft Corp. "By
working with Microsoft, Aastra provides customers richer connectivity,
transforming every communication into an interaction that is more collaborative,
engaging and accessible."

These new phones also support the imperatives of IT decision makers for
simplified and cost-effective deployment of unified communications combined with
interoperability with Microsoft Communications Server "14."

The 6721ip and 6725ip will be available for sale in conjunction with the release
of Microsoft Communications Server "14." To learn more about the 6721ip or
6725ip visit Aastra in Booth #1017 at VoiceCon or www.aastra.com/mcsphones.

&lt;p&gt;Press kit materials are available online at:
http://www.virtualpressoffice.com/public/kit/YapCTIA2010
CHARLOTTE, N.C. &amp;&#160;LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Yap, the leading provider of cloud-based speech recognition services, announced
today its selection by Microsoft for providing speech-to-text capabilities in
its Talk to Text mobile application. Microsoft developed Talk to Text for
Sprint, allowing users to speak their text messages and emails. Talk to Text is
available immediately for all Blackberry devices running on the Sprint network. 

Composing text messages and emails can be awkward and tedious. A simple message
like `I am running thirty minutes late - start the meeting without me` can take
more than fifty keystrokes. Using Microsoft`s Talk to Text application, Sprint
subscribers can conveniently speak their messages -- drastically reducing the
keystrokes and time needed to compose an email or text message. 

"We are pleased to work with Yap to provide a useful and engaging mobile service
to consumers," says Vic Bondi, Senior Director for Sales and Channels
Engineering, MSN. 

The Yap speech cloud provides fully automated, high accuracy speech recognition
via a simple web services interface. Using this simple interface, Microsoft was
able to quickly integrate Yap`s speech recognition into its Talk to Text
application with just a few lines of code. 

"Yap`s speech cloud empowers partners like Microsoft and Sprint to access very
high accuracy speech recognition with little effort and expense," says Igor
Jablokov, CEO at Yap. "Our speech cloud methodology eliminates complex
integration efforts and tedious tuning processes common to traditional speech
recognition solutions."

&lt;p&gt;Seventy-Five Local Nonprofits Selected to Participate in Internship Program

* The ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program celebrates its 20th year in
Dallas 
* Seventy-five nonprofits selected to receive college interns for eight weeks
this summer 
* ExxonMobil will contribute $270,000 this year to provide for interns' salaries
and administrative expenses

DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Seventy-five non-profit agencies in the Dallas area will receive summer interns
to increase their ability to serve the community, ExxonMobil announced today. 

The interns will be paid through the ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program,
which for 20 years has offered undergraduate college students paid summer
internships in nonprofit and community service sectors. 

Community Summer Jobs Program interns provide the agencies with much-needed
assistance while gaining knowledge of various aspects of a nonprofit
organization. The students benefit from hands-on experience, a group service
project and three professional development seminars. 

"It is more important than ever that college graduates enter the work force with
real experience and a competitive edge, and the Community Summer Jobs Program
gives students that opportunity," said Robert Lanyon, corporate citizenship and
community investments manager for ExxonMobil, which is based in nearby Irving,
Texas. 

"This program supports both student education and helps the agencies provide
more services to the community." 

ExxonMobil Foundation will contribute nearly $270,000 to this year's program to
provide for interns' salaries and administrative expenses. 

The Volunteer Center of North Texas administers the program and trains agencies
on the recruitment and intern selection processes. Each participating agency is
responsible for hiring its own full-time undergraduate intern. 

"For two decades, this program has enriched the professional development of
interns while making a real difference in our nonprofit community," said John
Withers, board chairman of the Volunteer Center of North Texas. "We are proud to
continue our partnership with ExxonMobil and look forward to being a part of the
many successes that lie ahead." 

Interested students may contact the selected agencies directly. For a list of
participating agencies, visit the Volunteer Center`s website at
www.volunteernorthtexas.org.

&lt;p&gt; * Bicudo rejoins Goldman from Citigroup: memo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pereira to head mergers, corporate finance in Brazil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Bank sees "significant opportunities" in Brazil
 (Recasts to add internal memo, comments, strategy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Elzio Barreto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAO PAULO, March 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N),
the world's most profitable securities firm, poached seven
bankers from rivals in Brazil to boost its local bond and stock
underwriting and securities trading business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fabio Bicudo, Citigroup's (C.N) head of investment in
Brazil, will rejoin Goldman Sachs as head of Brazil's
investment banking services, according to an internal memo
obtained by Reuters. Bankers Flavio Aidar, Joao Schmidt,
Eduardo Guimaraes and Cristiano Camargo will join the firm as
vice presidents, according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bicudo, who left Goldman for Citigroup in 2006, will also
join Kevin Kennedy, Valentino Carlotti, Daniel Wainstein and
Antonio Pereira as a member of Goldman's investment banking
operating committee in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pereira was named as sole head of mergers, acquisitions and
corporate finance in Brazil, the memo added. The bankers will
report to Daniel Wainstein, who is at the helm of the
investment banking unit in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hiring spree that brings bankers from rivals including
Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and HSBC (HSBA.L) underscores Goldman's
wish to regain its status as leader of investment banking
league tables in Latin America's largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was Brazil's largest mergers and acquisitions
adviser for years until 2006, when its then-head of investment
banking Ricardo Lacerda left for Citigroup, taking with him a
handful of bankers including Bicudo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since June 2009, the bank has participated in five share
sales totaling $7 billion and led $2.5 billion worth of bond
transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bruno Carvalho, a former BTG Pactual partner, was named
managing director and head of Goldman's futures business in
Brazil, said one source familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the hires were reported earlier on Monday by Sao
Paulo-based newspaper Valor Economico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cassius Leal, a former HSBC (HSBA.L) banker, will oversee
equity derivatives strategy in Brazil, Valor reported.

&lt;p&gt;  PLANO, TX, Mar 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Invensys Operations Management, a global provider of technology systems,
software solutions and consulting services to the process and
manufacturing industries, today announced that it has entered into an
agreement with ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company (EMRE) that
allows Invensys to sub-license a suite of EMRE's refinery process models
to third parties. The suite of models will be delivered through Invensys
Operations Management's market-leading SimSci-Esscor(R) optimization
software, using its ROMeo(R) solution to enable clients to model and
optimize process units.

    "With depressed demand, decreased margins and increased environmental
mandates, refiners no longer have the option to simply operate at maximum
throughput," said Sudipta Bhattacharya, president and chief executive of
Invensys Operations Management. "Over the course of the coming decade, we
will see a drastic shift in the oil industry as refiners constantly
optimize their operations in the face of changing feedstock and energy
costs, product specs and margins. Refiners will increasingly rely on
accurate modeling technologies to construct a refinery-wide picture and
assess the financial impact of different operating scenarios. Our
SimSci-Esscor optimization software and ROMeo solution, combined with
EMRE process models, enables refiners to make improved economic decisions
throughout the refinery, from crude feed to final product blending."

    While traditional modeling solutions can only simulate individual process
units or provide point solutions to solve a specific problem, Invensys
Operations Management's SimSci-Esscor solution provides a scalable
software environment that enables companies to optimize refinery-wide
performance, as well as other aspects of refinery profitability, such as
utilities and instrument/equipment health monitoring. Additional benefits
are derived from leveraging the data generated by rigorous models to
enhance planning and scheduling decisions, leading to increased refinery
margins. 

    "These modeling improvements allow refiners to better optimize their
operations," said Charles Darnell, global manager for optimization at
ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. "We use ROMeo technology in
our plants for multiple applications and continue to work with Invensys
to develop improvements in this technology."

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Mar 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. ("NET") (NASDAQ: NWK), a leader in
network and voice-over-IP solutions, today announced that it has signed a

support professionals for Microsoft environments, HP will accelerate the
adoption of Microsoft Communications Server, improving the effectiveness
of global enterprise collaboration and information sharing."

    Demand for unified communications and collaboration technologies is
growing rapidly. According to an independent report from Forrester

currently evaluating, piloting or implementing unified communications and
collaboration solutions, and the market is expected to grow at of rate of
35.9 percent through 2015.

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Mar 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
VOICECON -- Northern Michigan Substance Abuse Services, Inc. (NMSAS),
which coordinates and oversees the delivery of substance abuse services
for 30 counties in that state, has deployed SIP trunks from BBTelsys, a
nationwide provider of Internet telephony and multi-dwelling unit triple
play services, and enabled by Ingate(R) Systems, a leading provider of
Enterprise Session Border Controllers (E-SBCs) that enable SIP
communications such as SIP trunking and Unified Communications beyond the
protected enterprise network.

    The implementation provides the critical integration necessary for SIP
trunks to work with Microsoft(R) Office Communications Server (OCS),
which is being used by NMSAS to converge their voice and data. The
BBTelsys and Ingate solution also addresses the advanced dialing
requirements needed by NMSAS, to provide their clients with unparalleled
privacy and security for VoIP calls. 

    "This solution really saved the day for us," said Paul Mercier, Director
NMSAS. "We needed to leverage SIP trunks to reduce costs, and they had to
work with our existing Microsoft OCS investment. The BBTelsys-Ingate
implementation was able to make it all happen for us, very easily, and
delivered advanced features that help us serve our clients better."

    Making SIP Trunks Work with Microsoft OCS
 NMSAS was using Microsoft OCS
2007, which operates with the customer side facing TCP (Transmission
Control Protocol)/IP. TCP/IP is one of the core protocols used in Unified
Communications (UC) and allows for the reliable, ordered transmission of
data. 

    SIP trunks, however, use UDP. To provide a seamless format conversion of
TCP/IP to UDP, NMSAS deployed the Ingate SIParator(R) with the Ingate SIP
Trunk Software module, which works hand-in-hand with the BBTelsys service
and NMSAS' existing Microsoft OCS solution. 

    The SIParator is an E-SBC that enables SIP trunking by resolving Network
Address Translation (NAT) traversal of SIP traffic. Working with the SIP
Trunk Software module, it also normalizes the SIP signaling between the
IP-PBX, in this case the Microsoft OCS server, and the BBTelsys service,
solving interoperability issues. The SIParator also secures the
voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls made over the SIP trunk.

    "A world-class SIP trunking provider, BBTelsys works with leaders like
Ingate Systems to provide unique solutions to today's telecommunications
challenges," said Bill Zornow, Vice President, BBTelsys. "We provide
individual attention to customers, in this case, working with NMSAS for
several months to get them the right solution for their specific needs.
And Ingate was right there with us, with a flexible solution that could
adapt to any scenario." 

    Advanced Dialing Solutions, for Privacy
 As a substance abuse services
facility, NMSAS offers counseling for clients over the phone. These
clients are oftentimes at work; most require absolute privacy about their
relationship with NMSAS. NMSAS needed to make sure that, when they called
clients, the recipient's caller ID display would come up as "anonymous."
Additionally, NMSAS wanted the flexibility of making calls without this
"anonymous" option. 

    Ingate developed a simple dial plan solution harking back to the days of
traditional wireline telephony. When calling a client, NMSAS workers need
only dial "8" and then the phone number for the system to display an
anonymous caller ID. Regular business-related calls, where an anonymous
caller ID is not necessary, are preceded by a "9."

    "Integrating SIP trunks with the OCS server is becoming a common request
from customers who see the tremendous value SIP trunks add to the OCS
platform. The SIParator can provide this functionality easily, with OCS
as well as other SIP PBXs on the market today," said Steven Johnson,
President, Ingate Systems. "We are thrilled to be working with BBTelsys
in addressing these challenges with both proven and new, creative
solutions."

&lt;p&gt;Leading Edge IP Networking Technologies Drive IT Efficiencies and Increased
Workforce Collaboration through Delivery of Mission-Critical Communications
Applications
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Brocade&#174; (Nasdaq:BRCD) today announced that its IP networking technologies have
been validated for interoperability with Microsoft Office Communications Server
2007 R2. This validation helps provide customers with the assurance that
Brocade`s high-performance networking technologies can withstand the rigorous
networking demands required for the reliable delivery of business
communications, including presence, instant messaging, video, conferencing and
voice. In conjunction with this, Brocade has published a Deployment Guide to
help customers deploy Brocade networks with Office Communications Server 2007 R2
for optimal performance. Implemented as part of an Office Communications Server
2007 R2 deployment, Brocade`s networking technologies provide the critical
networking infrastructure to support both data and voice/video traffic for a
wide range of unified communications configurations. 

The world of business communication is increasingly migrating from private
branch exchange (PBX) systems towards Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
technologies and unified communications; as a result of this shift, an
organization`s networking infrastructure must be equipped to handle greater
volumes of voice, video and data traffic and be scalable to adapt to changing
business needs. In addition, as communication plays a critical role in any
business environment, enterprise customers have very specific requirements, such
as low-latency networks to ensure high-quality voice and video delivery,
auto-configuration capabilities for "plug and play" functionality, and
additional features that strengthen existing Office Communications Server 2007
R2 security mechanisms. 

Microsoft conducted testing processes to validate networking infrastructure
technologies that can maximize the performance of applications running on Office
Communications Server 2007 R2. The Brocade networking solution for Office
Communications Server 2007 R2 is comprised of core, access, and edge Ethernet
switches, wireless products, load balancing and application delivery
controllers, and network management capabilities and includes a rich set of
features to help ensure a high-quality UC deployment, specifically:

* Advanced Quality of Service (QoS) to ensure voice, video and messaging take
priority on the network if required by the customer 
* Full support of Power over Ethernet (PoE and PoE+) for dynamic power delivery
to phones, wireless access points, and other devices 
* High-availability of Office Communications Server 2007 R2 through the Brocade
ServerIron application delivery controllers, as well as redundant hot-swappable
power supplies

local area network (VLAN) as soon as it is plugged in, eliminating costly
configuration errors 
* Comprehensive network security capabilities that operate alongside existing
Office Communications Server 2007 R2 security features that help prevent data
breaches and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

"Enterprise customers deserve choice and flexibility in their IT buying
decisions especially when it comes to the network for mission critical
applications like UC implementations," said Patric Chang, director of Strategic
Alliances at Brocade. "Microsoft`s open architecture-based UC platform coupled
with Brocade`s multi-vendor ecosystem approach creates a compelling alternative
to proprietary solutions on the market today that force customers` hands and
eliminate the ability for customers to fully capitalize on their IT
investments." 

These solutions are available today through Brocade channel partners or through
your Brocade account representative.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, March 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N),
the world's most profitable securities firm, poached seven
bankers from rivals in Brazil in a drive to boost its local
business, Valor Economico said on Monday, citing the unit's
President Valentino Carlotti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Fabio Bicudo, a former Citigroup (C.N) banker in the
country, will head Goldman's investment banking services
division, Valor said, adding that Eduardo Guimaraes, lured from
Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) in Europe, will help increase client
coverage for the division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bankers will report to Daniel Wainstein, sole head of
the investment banking unit in Brazil, Valor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bruno Carvalho, a former BTG Pactual partner, will take
care of Goldman's unit for new business. Cassius Leal, a former
HSBC (HSBA.L) banker, will oversee equity derivatives strategy
in Brazil, the newspaper added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bicudo also brought from Citigroup Flavio Aidar, Joao
Schmidt and Cristiano Camargo for his division. All four had
been lured by Citigroup in 2006 to beef up the U.S. bank's
investment banking business division in Brazil, Valor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was Brazil's largest mergers and acquisitions
adviser for years until 2006, when its then-head of investment
banking Ricardo Lacerda left for Citigroup, taking with him a
handful of bankers.

Communications Server "14." 

Building on the unified communications and collaboration initiative between HP
and Microsoft announced in May 2009, the offerings include:

* The HP Survivable Branch Communication zl Module reduces IT infrastructure at
remote branch offices and extends the business productivity and reliability of
Communications Server "14." It combines Microsoft Communications Server "14" and
HP ProCurve software within HP ProCurve Switch 8200zl and 5400zl series
products. 
* Four existing PC models designed to provide a rich business-grade voice and
video user experience at a lower total cost of ownership are now tested and
qualified as optimized for unified communications by Microsoft.

"Organizations face growing challenges with a mobile workforce, increasing
complexity and business performance pressure," said Meg Shea-Chiles, vice
president, Microsoft Strategic Alliance, HP. "With these new offerings, we are
enhancing how people interact, shorten business decision cycle times and connect
remote employees to company culture." 

Reliable voice infrastructure for branch offices

The HP Survivable Branch Communication zl Module, expected to be available later
this year, delivers:

* Survivability: Branch offices can now better maintain network availability in
a Communications Server "14" environment with a reliable distributed public
switched telephone network backup in case of wide area network failure. 
* Simplicity: Organizations can increase efficiency and scalability by rapidly
installing, deploying and migrating from legacy PBX and key systems with
centralized remote management, across branch offices for Microsoft
Communications Server "14" environments. 
* Cost efficiency: Organizations can reduce costs by eliminating specialized
technology infrastructure, expertise and management tasks required at branch
locations.

PCs provide high-quality user experience, lower total cost of ownership

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Microsoft's Internet Explorer has lost market share in major European markets, such as France, Britain and Italy, after the U.S. software firm started to make it easier for European consumers to use competing browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's pledge to allow easier access to rival browsers in Windows by the middle of May, ended a long antitrust dispute with the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has started to send a choice screen, where consumers can easily click on rival browsers, to almost 200 million old and new computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to web statistics firm Statcounter, Internet Explorer's share of all Web surfing has in March dropped in France by 2.5 percentage points from February, in Britain by 1 percentage point and in Italy by 1.3 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norway's Opera Software, the fourth largest browser firm, has seen downloads more than double in Europe from normal levels due to the choice screen, with downloads in Italy, Spain and Poland more than tripling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also No 2 browser firm, Mozilla, says it has seen strong growth. "We have seen significant growth in the number of new Firefox users as a result of the Ballot Choice screen. We expect these numbers to increase as the Ballot Choice screen fully rolls out across all countries," said a spokeswoman for Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller Web browsers have urged the European Union to push Microsoft to provide them more visibility in its browser choice website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first sight, Microsoft's browser Choice Screen (www.browserchoice.eu) shows its own Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Apple Inc's Safari and Google Inc's Chrome.

This is also the case for the other browsers not on the main screen," Flock said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said the screen complies with the EU's decision. The five largest browsers show directly on the Choice Screen, but smaller vendors say there is nothing to show consumers that more options are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope that the changes recommended in our urgent petition to the European Commission are implemented so that all the browsers that have been placed to the right of the main screen will have a reasonable chance of being found and considered by European consumers," Flock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tarmo Virki; Editing by Louise Heavens)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MINNEAPOLIS, MN, Mar 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Jobs2web, the leading provider of interactive recruiting solutions, today
announced the successful launch of the Jobs2web Recruitment Marketing
Platform(TM) by Microsoft Corporation. All divisions at Microsoft are now
live and enabled with Jobs2web's interactive tools and strategies, which
are designed to help employers Recruit Better(TM).

    Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices (E) division initially piloted
Jobs2web's flagship product, the Recruitment Marketing Platform, in 2009.
Based on a successful experience using Jobs2web to enable web 2.0
strategies, Microsoft decided to roll out the solution globally across all
business units.

    Jobs2web's sophisticated recruiting tools enable companies to be more
strategic, more efficient and accountable as they launch interactive
recruiting initiatives in different channels. These recruiting strategies
require advanced technologies such as search engine optimization and
automated job marketing that help employers leverage new recruiting
outlets. Jobs2web also supports creating and nurturing private global 
talent communities, which provide employers with a ready supply chain of
talent that they can draw upon to fill future recruiting needs. Also,
Jobs2web's award winning Recruiting Dashboard(TM) gives employers total
visibility to all their online recruitment marketing activities so they
can track and manage exactly which sources are driving optimal results in
order to maximize their recruitment budgets.

    "We're excited about this partnership with Jobs2web and the capability
they bring to us, which enabled us to quickly transform Microsoft's
recruiting strategy across our company. Using the Jobs2web platform gives
us the ability to maximize our web 2.0 recruiting investments, achieving
new levels of candidate engagement and recruiting metrics," said John
Phillips, director of Global Talent Labs at Microsoft. "We knew that we
needed to test the limits of typical recruiting practices such as
utilizing job boards and other static post and apply processes. By
partnering with Jobs2web on advanced marketing strategies that leverage
the newer technologies, we will be able to source qualified talent at
lower costs. The Jobs2web Platform gives us more control over our
interactive recruiting channels with automation and visibility to measure
effectiveness."

    "Partnering with Microsoft helps drive Jobs2web to continually reach new
innovative frontiers," said Doug Berg Jobs2web founder and Chief
Recruiting Geek. "John and his team are among some of the smartest people
in recruiting today and they're always pushing the limits of technology to
bring new recruiting strategies to their business. They are a great
partner and we're very excited about building on our mutual success
together."

    John Phillips from Microsoft and Doug Berg from Jobs2web will co-present
at the upcoming 2010 Human Capital Summit at the JW Marriott Starr Pass
Resort in Tucson, Ariz. on Monday, March 22nd. The topic will be "Game
Changing Talent Acquisition: How Microsoft is Leveraging Web 2.0
Technologies."

    Microsoft will also be sharing their experiences at the Jobs2web annual
users' conference "Collaborate 2010,"on June 14th - 17th at the
Minneapolis Downtown Marriott. More information on the conference can be
found at www.jobs2web.com.

better what online channels are providing them with the best results.

&lt;p&gt;March 22 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
is set to announce on Monday the installation of 7,700 solar
power panels near Bakersfield in California, which is expected
to produce 740 kilowatts of electricity, the Los Angeles Times

&lt;p&gt; The sloping panels will be used to power the pumps and the

the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The panels represent latest photovoltaic technologies from
seven companies that Chevron is looking at as possible
candidates to power its operations worldwide, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Photovoltaic technology involves converting sunlight into
electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excess power will be re-routed to the local Pacific Gas

&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN--(Business Wire)--
Secunia, the world-leading provider of Vulnerability Intelligence and
Vulnerability Management tools, today announced that their renowned
authenticated internal vulnerability scanner, the Corporate Software Inspector
(CSI) 4.0, has been integrated with Microsoft Windows Server Update Service
(WSUS) and System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) providing simplified patch
management of Microsoft as well as third party programs. 

This novel end-to-end scanning and patching solution will enable companies
worldwide to come full circle in their security operations in a simple and
automated way, ending the days of time consuming, labor intensive, and
troublesome patching. 

"We are in a unique position for doing this, due to the comprehensiveness and
quality of our Vulnerability Intelligence and our unique scanning technology.
The value lies in the comprehensiveness, reliability, and action-ability,
provided by combining the best of two technologies from Microsoft and Secunia"
(Niels Henrik Rasmussen, CEO Secunia). 

Program vulnerabilities represent an increasing threat to companies'
IT-security, as all it takes is one vulnerability for a cyber criminal to gain
access to the internal network, allowing other security measures to be
circumvented. Due to the cumbersome scope of patching and the lack of network
visibility so far, companies have often overlooked third party programs in their
patching operations, while Microsoft programs have been automatically managed by
WSUS or SCCM. 

To solve this problem and aid companies deal with vulnerability threats, the
Secunia CSI 4.0 integrates directly with Microsoft WSUS and SCCM for simplified
patch management, facilitating the distribution of the latest security updates
for all programs, Microsoft and third party. 

The Microsoft WSUS/SCCM technology has a large coverage, with WSUS deployed in
virtually all corporate networks today due to its patching capabilities for
Microsoft products. This further complements the Secunia CSI 4.0, which provides
scanning, mapping, and security evaluation of all the installed programs. 

"WSUS, or SCCM, is practically installed in all companies worldwide today, and
now all these companies are given the opportunity to further ensure their
IT-security and end the threat posed by vulnerabilities, including those in 3rd
party programs. Further, companies can benefit from this without having to
radically change their existing infrastructure or invest in learning new tools,
as the Secunia CSI 4.0 integrates with WSUS and SCCM- so business as usual"
(Niels Henrik Rasmussen, CEO Secunia). 

About Secunia CSI 4.0

The Secunia CSI 4.0 is an authenticated internal vulnerability and patch scanner
that simplifies and automates the process of securing programs on the Windows
platform through accurate assessment and deployment of the latest security
patches. 

The Secunia CSI 4.0 will enable companies to scan and patch their whole
infrastructure with just a few clicks, following four steps; 1) Conduct a full
scan of all hosts, 2) Review missing security patches, 3) Automatically create,
approve, and deploy the patches, and 4) Re-scan hosts to verify that the patch
process has completed successfully. 

The Secunia CSI 4.0 is delivering detection and vulnerability assessment of
nearly all publicly known programs, plugins, and extensions in the market,
including Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash, Sun Java, Firefox, and practically all
other Windows based programs. With patch management, Secunia is bringing program
transparency, by a complete overview of ALL applications installed, and
technology transparency by recognizing and utilizing the widely used technology
of Microsoft WSUS and SCCM.

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Today, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and The Coca-Cola
Company announce an additional joint investment of US$12.7 million in their
global partnership, the Water and Development Alliance (WADA). Through this
investment, WADA will support eight new multi-year programs throughout
sub-Saharan Africa in Angola, Burundi, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Senegal, South
Africa, and Tanzania. These programs will begin as 3-year initiatives,
representing a shift toward longer-term efforts and exemplifying each
organization`s shared commitment to lasting, sustainable solutions to global
water challenges. With this new investment, USAID and The Coca-Cola Company will
have committed a total of $28.1 million since 2005 to support 32 projects in 22
countries worldwide in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast
Asia. 

Water scarcity, degraded water quality, and lack of basic water and sanitation
services present severe global challenges, especially to the world`s poor. More
than one billion people live without access to safe drinking water, and 2.6
billion people have no access to basic sanitation. The growing water shortage
impedes human needs for food and economic activity and threatens the
sustainability of communities and critical ecosystems. USAID and The Coca-Cola
Company established WADA to help tackle these enormous challenges. 

USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah emphasized the importance of the public-private
partnership: "As it enters its fifth year, USAID`s partnership with Coca-Cola
showcases the potential of the U.S. Government to partner with the private
sector to make a long-term impact on pressing global challenges. By matching
USAID`s development expertise with the resources, capacities, and commitment of
The Coca-Cola Company, we are making a positive impact on community water issues
throughout the developing world." 

Working with local partners in each country, WADA has addressed a myriad of
local water challenges, helping more than 300,000 people gain access to
sustainable sources of water for health and livelihoods. 

"We recognize that no single organization can solve the global water crisis, but
by partnering with organizations like USAID we can make a positive difference in
the lives of the people in need of safe water and sanitation," said William
Asiko, President of The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation. 

WADA focuses on four objectives: watershed management, water supply and
sanitation, hygiene promotion, and productive water use. The partnership
capitalizes on the strengths and experience of its partner institutions, USAID,
The Coca-Cola Company, and the Global Environment &amp; Technology Foundation, which
work collaboratively to demonstrate how government, business, and the
non-governmental community can innovatively engage to solve global water
challenges.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Novell Rejects Buyout Offer

Enterprise software maker, Novell, Inc. (Nasdaq: NOVL) announced that its Board
of Directors have rejected the unsolicited buyout offer of $2 billion or $5.75
per share in cash from Elliott Associates, L.P., the largest institutional
stockholder of Novell. 

Novell cited the offer to be inadequate and significantly below the company`s
value, thereby undervaluing the firm. Novell shares fell 1.4% and closed at
$5.64 yesterday. 

The shares had soared 25.89% (or $1.23) to $5.98 in after-hours trading, just
after the company made the offer public on March 4 that indicated positive
investor sentiments regarding the takeover as investors hoped for a higher bid. 

Elliott is an investment firm with over $16 billion in assets and holds
approximately 8.5% of NOVL`s common stock. 

The price represented a premium of 49% over the company's current enterprise
value, 77% over the company's 90-day volume-weighted average enterprise value
and a 115% premium over the company's enterprise value on January 4, 2010, when
Elliot planned to purchase Novell. 

The offer price also represented a 37% premium to Novell's closing stock price
on January 4, 2010 and a 20% premium over the company`s closing price on March
2. 

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) is serving as financial advisor and Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP is acting as legal counsel to Novell. 

The Blue Harbour Group, an investment firm that owns 4% of Novell`s shares
agreed with the company`s decision to reject Elliott`s bid as it believes that
the offer is much below the company worth. 

Novell said that it is considering other ways to increase shareholders value
through share repurchase, dividend payout, joint ventures and alliances with
other companies or via recapitalization. 

Novell also said that it may look for other alternatives to sell itself outright
to another entity. According to analysts, the deal may be subject to a
competitive bidding process as it appears that larger companies such as
Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ), International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM)
and SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) may bid for Novell.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

More Bank Failures, Tally Hits 37

The seven failed banks together would cost the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund
about $1.28 billion. 

The Advanta Bank is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund about $635.6
million, Appalachian Community Bank will cost about $419.3 million, Bank of
Hiawassee will cost about $137.7 million, First Lowndes Bank will cost about
$38.3 million, Century Security Bank will cost about $29.9 million, American
National Bank will cost about $17.1 million and State Bank of Aurora will cost
the insurance fund about $4.2 million. 

Luverne, Alabama-based First Citizens Bank will assume the deposits and assets
of First Lowndes Bank. 

Carrollton, Georgia-based Community &amp; Southern Bank will assume the deposits and
assets of Appalachian Community Bank. 

Citizens South Bank of Gastonia, N.C., will assume the deposits and assets of
Bank of Hiawassee. 

Thomaston, Georgia-based Bank of Upson has agreed to assume the assets and
deposits of Century Security Bank. 

Ashland, Wisconsin-based Northern State Bank has agreed to assume the deposits
and assets of State Bank of Aurora. 

Wilmington, Ohio-based National Bank and Trust Co. will assume the assets and
deposits of American National Bank. However, the FDIC was unable to find a buyer
for Advanta Bank. 

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 702 from 552 in the third quarter. This is the highest
since the savings and loan crisis in 1994. 

Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to cause hundreds
more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC anticipates bank failures to
cost about $100 billion over the next three years. 

The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). Other major acquirers of
failed institutions since 2008 include SunTrust Banks (NYSE: STI), PNC Financial
(NYSE: PNC), BB Corporation (NYSE: BBT) and Regions Financial (NYSE: RF). 

We expect loan losses on the commercial real estate portfolio to remain high for
banks that hold large amounts of high-risk loans.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Health Care Reform Passes

There are some losers in the bill as well as winners. The Medicare Advantage
program will be cut back, so some seniors will lose the extra benefits that
those provide. The Medicare Advantage program costs the government substantially
more per person than regular Medicare does. For the health insurance companies
that relied heavily on this area, such as Humana (NYSE: HUM) it is bad news. 

Not all the health insurance companies were big players in that arena, though.
For many, the prospect of more customers (and customers that are legally
required to buy the product) will outweigh the loss of the Medicare Advantage
subsidy program. On the other hand, all seniors will see the closing of the
"donut hole" in their drug coverage. 

Medicare taxes will for the first time include capital (or unearned) income for
high-income people. This will effectively raise dividend and capital gains tax
rates for high-income people, but only for high-income people. However, at the
margin, this might be a negative for stocks overall. Still there is a big
differential between capital income and income from paychecks, so I don`t think
the effect will be all that significant. 

The market is taking the news of passage in stride, and the health care sector
is leading the market higher today. Some of the biggest gainers are the hospital
companies like Tenet Health Care (NYSE: THC) and the drug companies like Pfizer
(NYSE: PFE), while the health insurance companies like Aetna (NYSE: AET) and
WellPoint (NYSE: WLP) are mixed.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Reality TV mom of eight Kate Gosselin, blonde bombshell Pamela Anderson and astronaut Buzz Aldrin helped "Dancing with the Stars" waltz to its highest ever season premiere, attracting 23.9 million viewers, early ratings showed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10th season opener of the ballroom dancing show was the most-watched television program of Monday night, broadcaster ABC said, fueled by a gossip-worthy cast of celebrities trying their hand at the Viennese waltz and the Cha-cha-cha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audiences for the five year-old competition slipped last year. But ABC said Monday's two-hour premiere gave the Walt Disney-owned network its biggest audience in the 8-10 pm timeslot for a regular entertainment show in nearly 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gosselin, the now divorced half of TV reality show "Jon  Kate Plus 8," was one of the most anticipated contestants. But her Viennese waltz routine scored an unimpressive 16 with the judges. Bruno Tonioli said it looked like Gosselin's dance partner was "pushing a shopping cart across the floor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former "Baywatch" star Anderson fared better with her flirty cha-cha-cha. But Aldrin, 80, the second person on the moon in July 1969 after Neil Armstrong, scored lowest with the judges despite adding a little moonwalking to his Cha-cha-cha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The celebrity line-up also includes Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Scherzinger, Olympic gold medal figure skater Evan Lysacek and ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pair will get one more dance on next week's show before eliminations begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dancing with the Stars" is the second-most watched TV show in the United States after "American Idol" on Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Bob Tourtellotte)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third antitrust complaint against IBM's mainframe business was filed with the European Commission Tuesday, compounding the firm's regulatory problems in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently created TurboHercules, a French firm active in the market for open-source mainframe computer software, said in a statement that IBM ties its operating system software to purchases of its mainframe hardware, thus freezing out smaller competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This conduct prevents TurboHercules from providing its product to mainframe customers desiring an open-source solution," said Roger Bowler, chairman of TurboHercules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM hit back, accusing TurboHercules of trying to get a free ride on the back of IBM investments in mainframes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TurboHercules is an 'emulation' company that seeks a free ride on IBM's massive investments in the mainframe by marketing systems that attempt to mimic the functionality of IBM mainframes," the company said in a statement.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It likened TurboHercules' behavior to that of firms that "seek to market cheap knock-offs of brand-name clothing or apparel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission wasn't immediately available to confirm receipt of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TurboHercules' move follows similar antitrust complaints with the European Commission from two other small IBM competitors, PSI and T3 Technologies. Microsoft, an arch-rival had a stake in PSI but the firm was subsequently bought out by IBM. Meanwhile, T3 ranks Microsoft among its shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice opened an antitrust probe into IBM's dominance of the mainframe market. That probe was sparked by a complaint from the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a trade group that ranks Microsoft among its members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having yet another complaint in Europe -- by an open-source company, no less -- points to a systemic pattern of behavior by IBM directed at anyone who threatens its mainframe monopoly," said Erika Mann, CCIA's executive vice president and head of its European office in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We and our industry sincerely hope that IBM reverses course and honors its previous commitments to both the public and the European government to license whatever patents that IBM claims are necessary to use Hercules on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said in its statement that it is "fully entitled to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect the investments that we have made in our technologies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 24 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will offer a total
1.6 trillion yen to financial institutions through two money
market operations providing the same three-month funding at a
fixed rate of 0.1 percent, the Nikkei reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Last Wednesday, the central bank decided to expand the
scale of a fund supply tool it adopted in December to 20
trillion yen ($222 billion) from 10 trillion yen, and the
duration of the fixed-rate loans was left at three months.
[ID:nTOE619091]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BOJ will keep unchanged the amount it provides in a
single operation, but it will conduct two separate operations a
week, the business daily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But "there may be times when we carry out the operations on
different days," said an official at the BOJ's Financial
Markets Department, as quoted by the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both operations were for funding starting Thursday, with
one unwinding on June 22 and the other on June 25, the Nikkei
said.

&lt;p&gt;COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka on Tuesday said it would deny a visa to singer Akon, whose planned April concert in the island nation sparked rock-throwing protests by Buddhists offended by one of his videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day earlier, hundreds of people stormed the head offices of the Maharaja Broadcasting and Television (MBC/MTV) Network, a sponsor of Akon's planned April concert. Four employees were injured and windows and parked cars were smashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akon's video for the song "Sexy Bitch" features scantily clad women dancing in front of a statue of the Buddha. Sri Lanka's ethnic majority Sinhalese are primarily Buddhists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Taking into consideration the allegations leveled against the singer Akon, the government had decided not to issue him a visa to conduct the concert in Sri Lanka," Anusha Palpita, the Government Information Department's director-general, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palpita said that the main allegation against Akon was that he was "defaming Buddhism in his music videos."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Akon could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka's Buddhist clergy are hugely influential in ordinary life and politics, and in the past hardline Sinhalese nationalists have become violent against those they see as offending Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack by an estimated 200 people on the pro-opposition network, which runs three TV and four radio stations from its headquarters in central Colombo, came as the campaign for parliamentary polls on April 8 heats up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2004, a hand grenade attack at a concert by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan killed two people and wounded 19, which was blamed on Sinhalese nationalists angry the concert fell on the first death anniversary of a renowned Buddhist monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bryson Hull)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * TurboHercules charges IBM with blocking users&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * IBM already faces EU antitrust complaint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * IBM says TurboHercules seeking "free ride"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, March 23 (Reuters) - French software group
TurboHercules asked EU antitrust regulators on Tuesday to look
into IBM's (IBM.N) business practices, alleging the U.S.-based
company was blocking customers from its open-source technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM is already the subject of an antitrust complaint by U.S.
group T3 Technologies filed last year with the European
Commission. [ID:nL9643496]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TurboHercules said it complained to the EU watchdog after
IBM refused to license its mainframe operating systems for use
with TurboHercules's mainframe emulator and accused the French
firm of violating IBM's intellectual property.
"IBM is preventing customers from using Hercules
(TurboHercules' open-source software) by tying IBM's mainframe
operating system with IBM hardware," Roger Bowler, TurboHercules
chairman, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This conduct prevents TurboHercules from providing its
product to mainframe customers desiring an open-source
solution," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM rejected the accusations, saying it was protecting its
intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "TurboHercules is an 'emulation' company that seeks a free
ride on IBM's massive investments in the mainframe by marketing
systems that attempt to mimic the functionality of IBM
mainframes," IBM said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is not really any different from those who seek to
market cheap knock-offs of brand-name clothing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said TurboHercules was a member of organisations funded
by rivals such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) "to attack the
mainframe", which is IBM's main business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TurboHercules, a privately-held company set up in 2009, is a
member of a non-profit trade group called the Computer and
Communications Industry Association (CCIA), which counts
Microsoft and Oracle Corp ORCL.O as members, but not IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating allegations
by the CCIA that IBM abused its dominance of the mainframe
business to squeeze rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Customers, including nearly all the world's major
businesses and governments, would literally save billions of
dollars if competition was allowed to enter this strategic IT
market," said CCIA Chief Executive Ed Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its complaint, T3 accused IBM of preventing sales of
competing mainframes by tying the sale of its operating system
to its own such hardware and withholding patent licenses.

&lt;p&gt; * Left IBM following arrest and charges last October&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Would be 11th to plead guilty in sprawling probe
 (Adds details of charges against Moffat, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Grant McCool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Robert Moffat, a former
senior executive of International Business Machines Corp
(IBM.N), is expected to plead guilty to charges in the Galleon
hedge fund insider trading case, according to a court document
filed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moffat, who was arrested and charged with fraud last Oct.
16 along with principal defendants Galleon founder Raj
Rajaratnam and former New Castle Funds LLC trader Danielle
Chiesi, would be the 11th person to plead guilty in the case
prosecutors have described as the biggest hedge fund insider
trading probe in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moffat, 53, was the senior vice president of IBM's systems
and technology group and once seen as a possible candidate for
the IBM chief executive job. He was placed on leave on Oct. 19
and is no longer with the company, IBM said. [ID:nN3085727]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The United States Attorney's Office will file an
information upon the defendant's waiver of indictment," said
the filing in Manhattan federal court by prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An "information," or criminal information, is an
alternative charging document to an indictment and usually
indicates the defendant has agreed to plead guilty. Ten other
defendants in the case have so far waived indictment and
pleaded guilty to a criminal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moffat's attorney, Kerry Lawrence, confirmed that his
client was prepared to waive indictment but he declined any
further comment. No date has been scheduled yet for a court
appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Moffat was arrested last October, prosecutors alleged
that during phone calls intercepted by the FBI, Chiesi obtained
non-public information concerning Advanced Micro Devices
(AMD.N) from Moffat and Rajaratnam, and shared that information
with New Castle director Mark Kurland. Kurland has pleaded
guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prosecutors said that in August 2008, Chiesi and Moffat
discussed a confidential business transaction that AMD was
negotiating with investors from Abu Dhabi. Moffat allegedly
had access to inside information concerning the deal because as
part of the transaction, IBM would be granting a license to an
entity to be spun off by AMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toward the end of the call, according to the complaint,
Chiesi asked about the timing of the deal involving AMD, and
Moffat replied, "six to eight weeks from my meeting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked the chances that the deal would fall through,
Moffat replied, "Zero..., I see no way that it doesn't get
done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rajaratnam and Chiesi have pleaded not guilty and their
criminal trial is scheduled to start on Oct. 25, although both
have since requested separate trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of the evidence against 21 accused executives, traders
and lawyers was gathered using wiretaps and cooperators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eight people, some of them Rajaratnam's former friends and
business associates or onetime Galleon employees, have signed
cooperation agreements with federal prosecutors and may be
called upon to testify at criminal trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Tuesday, a U.S. appeals court in New York heard
arguments over wiretap evidence in the civil fraud case brought
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
[ID:nN23242019]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appellate panel expressed skepticism over whether
Rajaratnam must turn over recordings to the SEC until a court
decides on Rajaratnam's bid to suppress them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is USA v Robert Moffat, U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York, No. 09-mj-02307. The
appellate case is SEC v. Galleon Management et al, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit, No. 10-0462.

&lt;p&gt;New Expanded Deal Makes Coca-Cola a Madison Square Garden "Signature Partner"

New Agreement Builds Year-Round Presence for Coca-Cola Across All
Madison Square Garden Sports and Entertainment Properties in New York

Includes Exclusive Non-Alcoholic Beverage Rights and Branded Concessions
in Renovated Madison Square Garden 


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Madison Square Garden and The Coca-Cola Company announced today a new expanded
long-term marketing partnership that continues the 100 year relationship between
the two companies - believed to be one of the longest running marketing
partnerships in sports and entertainment. 

Coca-Cola will be the exclusive non-alcoholic beverage partner for all of
Madison Square Garden`s New York based venues, including The Garden, Theater at
Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and Beacon Theatre. The partnership
also includes an expanded presence for Coca-Cola into Madison Square Garden`s
entertainment platforms and makes Coca-Cola an MSG "Signature Partner" with a
significant presence across all its properties, including its iconic New York
venues, professional sports teams - New York Knicks, Rangers and Liberty,
television networks - MSG, MSG Plus and Fuse, as well as a strong presence in
the planned Madison Square Garden renovation. 

"For more than 100 years, Coca-Cola and Madison Square Garden have shared the
same passion to refresh and enhance entertainment and sports experiences for the
people who enjoy them," said Sandy Douglas, president, Coca-Cola North America.
"This expanded, landmark partnership combines the world`s greatest beverages
with some of the finest facilities, teams and properties in all of sports and
entertainment, and allows us to create even more programs designed to bring
people closer to the events and experiences they love." 

"Our partnership, bringing together one of the world`s most dynamic and diverse
sports and entertainment companies, Madison Square Garden, and the world`s
largest beverage company, Coca-Cola, is a perfect match," said Hank Ratner,
president and CEO, Madison Square Garden. "We are proud to significantly expand
our relationship by making Coca-Cola Madison Square Garden a `Signature Partner`
for our planned state-of-the-art Garden renovation, and look forward to seeing
the familiar presence of the Coca-Cola brand across our teams, entertainment
products, venues and networks." 

Added Scott O`Neil, president, MSG Sports: "Coca-Cola is a partner we cherish,
with beverages we love to drink and a brand as strong and powerful as the city
we call home. After 100 years of refreshing the fans of Madison Square Garden,
our storied brands continue to share a passion for creating lasting memories and
happiness for our customers. We are thrilled to have Coca-Cola continue
providing the world`s best beverages to our fans at `The World's Most Famous
Arena.`" 

Coca-Cola and MSG`s partnership will continue into the renovated Madison Square
Garden, where Coca-Cola will be the exclusive non-alcoholic beverage partner and
help design custom-branded concession stands throughout the building. The MSG
renovation is expected to be a comprehensive, top-to-bottom transformation of
the building that will enhance the experience for customers, athletes,
entertainers, fans, suite holders and marketing partners. The new
state-of-the-art facility is expected to include improved sightlines and more
comfortable seats, additional entertainment and dining options, a variety of new

each year, with Madison Square Garden alone accounting for 50%. 

Coca-Cola will continue as the "Official Soft Drink" of the Knicks, Rangers and
Liberty, and become an Official Partner of College Basketball at MSG, which

&lt;p&gt; * Will target one of biggest killers of children * Could save millions of lives * Glaxo, Pfizer each to supply 30 mln doses/year for 10 yrs * Firms will get $7/dose for first 20 pct, then $3.50/dose * Supply of pneumococcal shots could start as early as 2010   (Adds more detail, quotes from Pfizer's Read) By Kate Kelland, Health and Science Correspondent LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - Drugmakers Pfizer (PFE.N) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) signed a landmark 10-year deal on Tuesday to supply 60 million doses a year of cut-price pneumococcal vaccines to developing nations. The deal, brokered by the Geneva-based Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), is the first under a new scheme called an Advance Market Commitment (AMC) which guarantees a market for vaccines supplied to poor nations but sets a maximum price drugmakers can expect to receive. GAVI estimates that the introduction of new vaccines against pneumococcal disease -- which causes serious illnesses such as pneumonia and meningitis --- could save around 900,000 lives by 2015 and up to seven million lives by 2030. GAVI said it plans to introduce pneumococcal vaccines in 47 countries by 2015.  Reuters reported on March 11 that several leading drug firms had made long-term commitments in the agreement. [ID:nLDE62A1EB] Glaxo and Pfizer each committed to supply 30 million doses of their Synflorix and Prevnar 13 vaccines to GAVI over 10 years, at $7 per dose for the first 20 percent supplied, dropping to $3.50 for the remaining 80 percent.  By comparison, Glaxo and Pfizer charge between $54 and $108 per shot for their vaccines in rich nations.  KILLER DISEASES This is a landmark deal. It has been the result of four years of intense work and negotiation, and it means that this year, 2010, we can begin to roll out a better pneumococcal vaccine that can tackle one of the biggest killers of children in the poorest parts of the world, Julian Lob-Levyt, GAVI's chief executive, told Reuters in a telephone interview. Pneumococcal disease claims the lives of around 800,000 under fives a year. In total the disease kills 1.6 million people a year and 95 percent of deaths are in Africa and Asia. The pneumococcal deal will be partly funded by Britain, Italy, Canada, Russia, Norway and the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, who agreed in June last year to invest a total of $1.5 billion in the project.  Glaxo's Synflorix shot protects against 10 strains of the streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria which cause the disease, while Pfizer's Prevnar 13 shot protects against 13 strains. This AMC deal could pave the way for future deals on recently introduced vaccines against rotavirus, which causes severe diarrhoea, and an experimental treatment against malaria, which combined kill millions in poor countries each year.   HEALTH BOOST The AMC scheme was devised to try to encourage drug companies to make and supply medicines and vaccines to boost health in poorer countries, which are generally unable to afford the high prices paid in Western markets. Both Pfizer and Glaxo expressed interest in future AMC deals, saying they are committed to tiered pricing structures to ensure their drugs can get to the people who need them most. Pfizer's senior vice president in charge of global biopharmaceutical businesses Ian Read said the AMC deal was a major milestone in GAVI's plans to get effective drugs to the world's poor. Creating access is not just about having medicines, it's also about getting medicines to people who need them, he told reporters during a telephone briefing. GAVI said drug firms can still tender under the pneumococcal AMC as new calls for offers will be issued over time.  Besides Glaxo and Pfizer, Panacea Biotec (PNCA.BO) and the Serum Institute of India are among firms that have registered to the programme and other companies have expressed interest in the pilot, it said. As more firms take part, the long-term vaccine price could drop further. GAVI says it needs to raise a further $1.5 billion over the next 5 years to ensure the programme is fully funded.

&lt;p&gt;Board Comprised of IT and Business Leaders with Vast Knowledge of the Technology
Solutions Not-for-Profits Need to Be Successful in Tough Economic Environment
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Not for Profit Solution Center, a network of Microsoft Dynamics partners,
today announced that it has instituted a new customer advisory board to support
its growing efforts in the Not-for-Profit (NFP), NGO (Non-Governmental
Organization), membership and association markets for the company`s Microsoft
Dynamics ERP and CRM solutions in its East Region. Microsoft has supported
organizations in these markets throughout most of its history. 

The newly-formed board is comprised of leaders at NFPs as well as companies that
provide critical business services to executives at those organizations.
Employees at some of Microsoft`s top Dynamics partners in the NFP market are
also represented. 

The new board includes:

* Carol Clark; Chief Operating Officer; Association of Public Health
Laboratories

solutions to its East Region customers in this market segment. The board will
share its insight into the challenges and needs NFPs face to ensure that
Microsoft Dynamics solutions are closely aligned with the current and future
needs of its customers. The company has also recently created the Microsoft
Solution Center for NFPs to more effectively meet the needs of those entities. 

Establishing a customer advisory board is the beginning of a series of
customer-focused initiatives that Microsoft Dynamics partners will be doing to
provide more value to these organizations. In April in Washington, DC and May in
New York City, the Not for Profit Solution Center will host summits in
coordination with Microsoft`s Community Affairs team. The summits, entitled NGO
Connections Days, will feature industry-leading keynote speakers, breakout
sessions on NFP business and technology topics, and technology exhibits from
Microsoft channel partners who have expertise in the NFP industry. 

"The Microsoft NFP Customer Advisory Board was developed to ensure that we
continue to support our not-for-profit customers by providing affordable
technology solutions, networking opportunities, and a community forum for them
as needed," said Chris Sakalosky, Microsoft Dynamics East Region General
Manager. 

"The talented group we have assembled for this board has an amazing amount of
knowledge on the issues and concerns facing not-for-profits and NGOs today,"

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced it has signed a 10-year Provisional
Supply Agreement to supply Prevenar 13* (Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate
Vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]), the company`s 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine, for infants and young children in the world`s poorest countries under
the terms of the Advance Market Commitment (AMC) pilot project against
pneumococcal disease. The AMC is a novel public-private approach to public
health funding designed to create a sustainable marketplace, ensure a stable
supply of pneumococcal vaccines and stimulate the development and expansion of
manufacturing capacity of vaccines specifically for the world`s poorest
countries. 

"Pfizer is dedicated to broadening access around the world to our medicines, and
public-private partnerships such as the one involving the AMC are critical to
achieving true inroads on this front," says Jeffrey Kindler, chairman and chief
executive officer of Pfizer Inc. "Last year, working with GAVI, we contributed
the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine used in a national immunization program
in the developing world, and we are proud to extend our commitment even further
to young children in the world`s poorest countries by participating in the AMC."


The agreement is the final step in the AMC procurement process which is
administered by the United Nations Children`s Fund (UNICEF) and supported by
GAVI. The agreement is subject to prequalification by the World Health
Organization and AMC eligibility designation, which are both expected later this
year. 

Under the terms of the agreement, the price of the pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine under the AMC framework is $7.00 for the first several years. The
vaccine price will include a $3.50 subsidy to be paid by the AMC donor fund, and
$3.50 to be paid by GAVI with a co-financing contribution paid by the developing
country governments that introduce the vaccine. 

Importantly, under the current AMC framework, participating vaccine
manufacturers must make a binding commitment to supply vaccine for 10 years at a
maximum "tail" price of $3.50 per dose to meet long-term demand and ensure
affordability of the vaccine in developing countries even after the donor
contributions are exhausted. 

"I applaud the groundbreaking milestone achieved today by vaccine manufacturers,
developing country governments, donors, the World Bank, and the GAVI Alliance
that has made the most advanced pneumococcal conjugate vaccines available to the
world's neediest young children at affordable prices and faster than ever
before," says Orin Levine, executive director, International Vaccine Access
Center at Johns Hopkins University. "This year, the Advance Market Commitment
will begin helping to save lives and improve the health of infants and young
children in Africa." 

Pfizer Increasing Manufacturing Capability to Help Ensure Supply

Prevenar 13 has been approved for use in infants and young children in more than
40 countries. In addition, regulatory filings for Prevenar 13 for pediatric use
are in advanced stages of review in various countries. To meet the growing
global demand for Prevenar 13, Pfizer is increasing its manufacturing
capabilities to help ensure product supply through a combination of capital
investment, process improvements and efficiency measures throughout the supply
network. 

Prevenar 13 includes the seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in
Prevenar* (Pneumococcal Saccharide Conjugated Vaccine, Adsorbed) - the standard
in pneumococcal disease prevention in infants and young children - plus six
additional serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). Together, these serotypes
represent the most prevalent invasive disease-causing strains in young children
worldwide. Both Prevenar and Prevenar 13 use CRM197 - a carrier protein that has
been used in various approved pediatric conjugate vaccines for more than 20
years. 

About Advance Market Commitments (AMCs)

A new approach to public health funding, AMCs are designed to procure vaccines
specifically for least developed countries. The pilot AMC is for vaccines that
prevent pneumococcal disease. 

In the AMC pneumococcal disease pilot, the governments of Italy, the United
Kingdom, Canada, Russia and Norway as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, have committed US$1.5 billion, with GAVI promising to allocate
US$1.3 billion through 2015. Companies that wish to participate in the AMC must
make legally binding long-term commitments to supply these vaccines at
affordable and sustainable prices for certain GAVI-eligible countries after the
donor funds are spent. 

The GAVI Alliance hopes to assist up to 60 of the world`s poorest countries,
following required regulatory approvals, to introduce pneumococcal conjugate
vaccines that meet a target product profile by 2015. Early estimates suggest
this pilot project could prevent more than seven million childhood deaths by
2030. For more formation on AMCs, please go to www.vaccineamc.org. 

Pneumococcal Disease

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2002 estimate, pneumococcal
disease is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children
younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of
illnesses, all caused by the bacterium S. pneumoniae. It affects both children
and adults and includes invasive infections such as bacteremia/sepsis and
meningitis, as well as non-invasive disease including pneumonia and acute otitis
media. 

Indication for Prevenar 13 Outside the United States

Prevenar 13 is indicated for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia, and
otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B,
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F in infants and children from 6 weeks to 5
years of age. 

Prevenar 13 is marketed in the United States as Prevnar 13TM (Pneumococcal
13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]). 

In the United States, Prevnar 13 is a vaccine approved for use in children 6
weeks through 5 years of age (prior to the sixth birthday). Prevnar 13 is
indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease caused
by 13 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C,
19A, 19F, and 23F). 

Prevnar 13 is also indicated for the prevention of otitis media (ear infection)
caused by 7 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23
F). No efficacy data for ear infections are available for strains 1, 3, 5, 6A,
7F, and 19A. 

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR PREVNAR 13

Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a severe allergic reaction to any
component of Prevnar 13, Prevnar or any diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. 

Prevnar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine. Protection
against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive disease.
Children with weakened immune systems may have a reduced immune response to
Prevnar 13. A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been
observed in some infants born prematurely. 

The most common side effects are redness, swelling and tenderness at the
injection site, fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, and
decreased sleep. 

Indication for Prevnar&#174;

Prevnar&#174; is indicated for active immunization of infants and toddlers against
serious invasive disease caused by Streptococcuspneumoniae, including bacteremia
(bloodstream infection) and meningitis (infection of the membranes surrounding
the brain and spinal cord) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine. The
seven serotypes (strains) of S. pneumoniae included in the vaccine (4, 6B, 9V,
14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) were the strains that most commonly caused these serious
diseases in children prior to the introduction of the vaccine. The routine
schedule is 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. 

Prevnar&#174; is also indicated for immunization of infants and toddlers against
otitis media (ear infections) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine.
Protection against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive
disease. 

As with any vaccine, Prevnar&#174; may not protect all individuals receiving the
vaccine from serious invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae. This vaccine
should not be used for treatment of active infection. 

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR PREVNAR&#174;

In clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse events included
injection site reactions, fever (&#8805;38&#186;C/100.4&#186;F), irritability, drowsiness,
restless sleep, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevnar&#174;. Hypersensitivity to
any vaccine component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its
use. Prevnar&#174; does not protect 100% of children vaccinated. Immunization with
Prevnar&#174; does not substitute for routine diphtheria immunization.

had made long-term commitments in the agreement. [ID:nLDE62A1EB]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glaxo and Pfizer each committed to supply 30 million doses
of their Synfloriz and Prevnar vaccines to GAVI over 10 years,
at $7 per dose for the first 20 percent supplied, dropping to
$3.50 dollars for the remaining 80 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison, Glaxo and Pfizer charge between $54 and $108
per shot for their vaccines in rich nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a landmark deal. It has been the result of four
years of intense work and negotiation, and it means that this
year, 2010, we can begin to roll out a better pneumococcal
vaccine that can tackle one of the biggest killers of children
in the poorest parts of the world," Julian Lob-Levyt, GAVI's
chief executive, told Reuters in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pneumococcal disease claims the lives of around 800,000
under fives a year. In total the disease kills around 1.6
million people a year and 95 percent of those deaths occur in
Africa and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glaxo's Synflorix shot protects against 10 strains of the
streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria which cause the disease. It
was approved late last year by the World Health Organisation for
use in developing countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's Prevnar protects against 13 strains and won the
approval of U.S. regulators earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GAVI said drug firms can still make offers under the AMC as
new calls for supply offers will be issued over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides Glaxo and Pfizer, Panacea Biotec (PNCA.BO) and the
Serum Institute of India are among firms that have registered to
the programme and other companies have expressed interest in the
pilot, it said. As more companies participate, the long-term
vaccine price could drop further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pneumococcal deal will be partly funded by Britain,
Italy, Canada, Russia, Norway and the Bill  Melinda Gates
Foundation, who agreed in June last year to invest a total of
$1.5 billion in the project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GAVI said it would need to raise a further $1.5 billion over
the next 5 years to ensure the programme is fully funded.
 This AMC deal is likely to pave the way for future deals on
recently introduced vaccines against rotavirus, which causes
severe diarrhoea, and an experimental one against malaria, which
combined kill millions in poor countries each year.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY and OSLO, NORWAY, Mar 23 (MARKET WIRE) --

Today, TANDBERG(R) (OSLO: TAA) announced its groundbreaking Advanced
Media Gateway, the first and only solution that seamlessly enables
millions of Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2 users to connect and
collaborate in high-definition (HD) with other standards-based video and
telepresence users. When combined with the award-winning TANDBERG Video
Communication Server (VCS), the Advanced Media Gateway offers scalable
and resilient high-definition video access to the entire enterprise from
familiar business tools, exponentially increasing the value of existing
video and collaboration investments.

    "The Advanced Media Gateway is a significant step in delivering on our
vision to provide business-quality video access for everyone," said
Fredrik Halvorsen, TANDBERG CEO. "By enabling ubiquitous HD video between
Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2 and standards-based video, we are
helping companies leverage their existing collaboration infrastructure to
deliver an optimal video experience to everyone from familiar tools. This
is critical for creating an open video community where individuals and
teams can easily collaborate in high-definition." 

    The Advanced Media Gateway is a major milestone in the broader TANDBERG
collaboration strategy to enable organizations to increase the value of
their existing unified communications (UC) investments. It is the only
product in the industry that can transcode Microsoft's Real Time Video
(RTV) format to the industry standard H.264, essential for enabling HD
video and audio interoperability between Office Communicator 2007 R2 and
other standards-based systems. Used in combination with the TANDBERG VCS
and the TANDBERG PrecisionHD USB Camera -- optimized for Office
Communicator 2007 R2 to offer up to 720p30 high-definition -- companies
can quickly and easily realize the benefits of uncompromised visual
collaboration. 

    "As a top global law firm with talent dispersed around the world, easy
access to high-quality visual communication is critical for us to best
collaborate with each other and serve our clients," said TANDBERG
customer, Patrick Tisdale, CIO of Orrick. "Immediate client access to
Orrick's expertise is often critical to our ability to successfully
address our clients' legal challenges. By seamlessly integrating
high-definition video into our existing Microsoft platform, the Advanced
Media Gateway helps us significantly increase our lawyers and business
professionals face time with each other and clients, while reducing
travel and streamlining consultations. Giving our entire firm the ability
to connect inside and outside of our network in the best quality makes it
much easier to hire the best experts, regardless of location, and provide
clients with immediate face-to-face counsel and access to our vast pool
of dispersed specialists." 

    "TANDBERG clearly recognizes the power that unified communications has
for driving video throughout the enterprise. However, one of the
challenges enterprises face with mass video adoption is interoperability
between desktop video, and high-definition group video and telepresence
environments," said Brent Kelly, senior analyst and partner, Wainhouse
Research. "Tandberg's Advanced Media Gateway embodies a well-conceived
strategy and an innovative solution to instantly enable the millions of
desktops running Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2 to interoperate
with - and properly display on - high-definition video and telepresence
units. This solution by TANDBERG will inevitably drive greater video
usage in all sectors as people experience business-quality visual
collaboration between Microsoft desktops and group systems that was
previously not possible."

    To see a demonstration of the TANDBERG Advanced Media Gateway solution
and hear more about the TANDBERG collaboration strategy, visit booth #401
at VoiceCon 2010 from March 22 - March 25. The Advanced Media Gateway is
currently available for purchase.

&lt;p&gt;  SANTA CLARA, CA, Mar 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Ensim Corporation, the leading provider of user provisioning and change
management software, today announced it has renewed its Gold Certified
Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program with four critical,

&lt;p&gt;Abiquo 1.5 Delivers on Company`s Vision for IT to Manage Fully Interoperable,
Vendor-Neutral Public and Private Clouds and to End Virtualization Vendor
Lock-in
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Abiquo, a leading developer of infrastructure management software for Cloud
computing environments, today unveiled Abiquo 1.5. The new version of Abiquo`s
flagship product was announced in conjunction with the company`s re-launch as a
U.S.-based company (see news release, Abiquo Opens New U.S. Headquarters with
$5.1 Million in New Funding). Abiquo 1.5 changes the Cloud management market as
the first product to allow IT managers to automatically convert virtual machine
images built for one hypervisor technology to any other supported hypervisor
including the conversion from VMware to Microsoft Hyper-V, through a single
drag-and-drop operation. As the only product to support all five of the major
hypervisor types, this, along with other new features, brings Abiquo
significantly closer to its unique vision of delivering to IT organizations a
platform for managing fully interoperable, vendor-neutral public and private
Clouds. 

Abiquo is an open source product offered through the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL) Version 3. IT operations managers responsible for physical
hardware use Abiquo to create and manage pooled computing resources, or Resource
Clouds, from any server virtualized with any hypervisor. These providers can
then provision or sell the Resource Clouds to enterprise users (i.e. consumers)
of those resources. Consumers use Abiquo to create virtual datacenters through
which they can deploy instantly bundled virtual servers, storage and other
physical resources, and applications from public or private virtual image
libraries. This is done through a highly visual, drag-and-drop user interface. 

"While server virtualization technologies are relatively mature, they do not
provide the complete management infrastructure required to create a private
cloud service," said Cameron Haight, research vice president, Gartner. "A
production oriented private or on-premise cloud architecture should have four
key components: access management, service management, resource management and
the underlying resource tier." 

"The Cloud computing market is saturated with technology hype and incomplete
offerings that don`t deliver enterprises the practical Cloud management
solutions they desperately need," said Pete Malcolm, CEO, Abiquo. "In contrast
with other vendors, Abiquo includes all the required components to provide
immediate business benefits. For example, delegating virtual datacenter control
provides a significant reduction to an IT organization`s workload and immediate
user empowerment benefits, eliminating IT bottlenecks. In addition, Abiquo
allows IT to maintain management and control of their IT infrastructure, achieve
full elasticity of computing resources, and eliminate virtualization and Cloud
vendor lock-in. Abiquo has been extensively tested by both the open source
community and by early commercial adopters including Global 1000 enterprises." 

Abiquo`s Complete Solution

Key new features in Abiquo 1.5 include:

* Microsoft Hyper-V Support 
* Automatic "drag and drop" Virtual Machine (VM) conversion between all
supported hypervisor types 
* Auto-discovery of machine resources and managing existing live VMs 
* Capture and store of stateful VMs

"As enthusiastic users of the current Abiquo solution, we are excited to learn
of the new features in version 1.5," said Jordi Mas, CEO, Nexica, a leading
European hosted infrastructure provider (www.nexica.com). "We are particularly
impressed by the hypervisor conversion and automatic provisioning, which will
allow us to save significant time and resources." 

The new features build on the unique benefits Abiquo provides:

* Multi-tenancy with delegated provisioning and management of Virtual
Enterprises 
* Enforceable Resource Limits to ensure risk-free operation 
* Policy-based Workload Management with automatic VM assignment 
* Hypervisor agnostic, supporting VMware, Hyper-V, Xen, KVM and Virtual Box
hypervisors 
* Image Libraries (public, shared and private) for VM images and bundled
appliances 
* Web-based graphical user interface with role-based context 
* Fully support for open standards including OVF and Stream Optimized Format

Pricing and Availability

Abiquo 1.5 will be available within 45 days. Abiquo is making it easy for IT to
try and buy by providing a Community Edition for free download at
http://download.abiquo.com, and by publishing a complete set of pricing
information on its Web site at http://www.abiquo.com/resources/pricelist for the
Enterprise Edition.

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Mar 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
VoiceCon -- Aspect, a global provider of unified communications (UC) and
collaboration services and software, today announced that it has marked
the two-year anniversary of its global strategic alliance with Microsoft
Corp. During the past year of the strategic alliance, Aspect has achieved
many significant milestones, including completing its own global
deployment of Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2; growing its
unified communications (UC) services practice with more than 40 new
enterprise customers; releasing instant message (IM) routing capabilities
with Aspect(R) Unified IP(R); establishing a Microsoft SharePoint Server
practice with the acquisition of Quilogy, a Microsoft national systems
integrator; and training more than 250 individuals on deploying Microsoft
UC technologies. 

    Working closely with Microsoft, Aspect met a number of key milestones
throughout the year, including:


--  Completed its own global deployment of Office Communications Server
    2007 R2. Aspect deployed Office Communications Server 2007 R2 to 100
    percent of its employee base for all voice and voicemail services,
    audio and web conferencing, instant messaging (IM) and presence. Since
    the beginning of the company-wide rollout in the first quarter of
    2009, Aspect has seen a number of significant benefits, including $1
    million in savings on annual conferencing costs, $300,000 in savings
    on annual support of multiple PBXs that were eliminated, and $250,000
    in annual savings on telecommunication charges as a result of
    deploying SIP trunking.

    

--  Deployed Office Communications Server 2007 R2 for more than 40
    customers and has built a strong pipeline for the remainder of 2010.
    One current deployment includes the State of Arkansas' largest agency,
    the Department of Human Services (DHS), which offers hundreds of
    services to more than 700,000 people each year. The agency is
    leveraging Aspect UC Services to help ensure a quick, seamless rollout
    of Office Communications Server 2007 video conferencing and unified
    messaging to a select number of employees, and IM, presence, and audio
    conferencing to 7,500 of its workers. Three months after an initial
    deployment for more than 100 seats, the Arkansas DHS is already
    realizing a significant decrease in the cost of managing its
    communications infrastructure, and lower travel and conferencing
    expenses.

    

--  Introduced new instant messaging (IM) features and expanded presence
    functionality for its UC applications for the contact center. Working
    in alignment with the Microsoft UC roadmap, Aspect released these
    enhancements through the Aspect(R) Unified IP(R) 6.6.1 platform
    product to augment the capabilities available through Aspect's UC
    applications' core queuing, routing, and reporting functionality. New
    features include improved IM routing for enhanced customer
    interactions via Microsoft Office Communicator and through the Web
    with click-to-IM; and extended presence and IM communications within
    the contact center.

    

--  Acquired Microsoft National Systems Integrator, Quilogy, to expand the
    UC Services practice with collaboration expertise. The acquisition of
    Quilogy added collaboration capabilities to Aspect's UC services
    portfolio to help organizations improve business processes with the
    combined capabilities of these technologies. Aspect now provides
    strategic and technical knowledge around collaboration tools for key
    Microsoft platforms, including Microsoft SharePoint Server. Bringing
    together UC and collaboration software applications with systems
    integration (SI) capabilities helps customers achieve business
    objectives more effectively than through services or applications
    individually.

    

--  Completed significant training in Microsoft UC and collaboration
    capabilities. More than 250 Aspect employees completed training and
    certification on deploying Microsoft UC technologies, including a
    Microsoft Certified Master in Office Communications Server. Aspect
    invested significant resources in continuing to expand its knowledge
    and expertise around Microsoft UC technologies and deployment
    practices.

    

"Aspect has been an important partner for Microsoft. It is
instrumental in helping organizations strategically apply Microsoft
unified communications and collaboration capabilities to achieve business
objectives," said Gurdeep Singh Pall, corporate vice president of the
Office Communications Group at Microsoft. "The third year of the alliance
will be marked by a number of key joint efforts which will deliver even
greater value including helping enterprises and contact centers take
advantage of the significant release of Microsoft Communications Server
"14" and Microsoft SharePoint 2010. These upcoming releases will allow
companies to deploy unified communications very cost effectively, as well
as enhance collaboration across the organization and in customer
interactions." 

    As the alliance moves into its third year, Aspect will continue to
perform as a lead systems integrator for Microsoft in unified
communications, while expanding expertise and offerings around
collaboration. Aspect will focus on: 


--  Enhancing Aspect's UC applications for the contact center with new UC
    and collaboration functionality.
    --  Seamless Customer Service(TM) will feature a unified agent
        desktop with UC, collaboration, multiline and scripting; expert
        routing and expert search with Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010;
        and integration with Microsoft Communications Server "14."
    --  Streamlined Collections(TM) and Optimized Collections(TM)
        will feature unified agent desktop with UC, collaboration,
        multiline and scripting; outbound dialing over session initiation
        protocol (SIP); and short message service (SMS) support for
        outbound notification.
    --  Productive Workforce(TM) will feature "Click to Communicate"
        functionality between supervisors, agents and knowledge workers
        for faster resolution of scheduling issues; and the ability to
        publish schedules to Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange
        Server.
    --  Blended Interaction(TM) will also feature "Click to
        Communicate" for enhanced schedule resolution issues; unified
        agent desktop with UC, collaboration, multiline and scripting;
        outbound dialing over SIP and SMS support for outbound
        notifications.

    

--  Expanding Aspect's collaboration expertise and practice. Aspect will
    continue to grow the collaboration portion of its UC Services practice
    with additional training and through expansion led by the former
    Quilogy team. By coupling Aspect's UC capabilities with the newly
    acquired SharePoint Server, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, business
    intelligence, interactive/portal development, and .NET development
    capabilities, Aspect will be offering an even more comprehensive set
    of Microsoft-based IT services and corresponding value proposition to
    enterprise customers.

    

"Microsoft and Aspect have marked several impressive milestones in
the second year of the alliance, and we look forward to this year's
milestones -- which are significant -- as we work to achieve our shared
vision of enabling organizations to transform enterprise business
processes and offering contact centers unified solutions without
compromise," said Jim Foy, chief executive officer, Aspect. "Amidst this
past year's economic climate, we continued to see strong interest in our
UC applications and their ability to streamline companies' interactions
both internally and with customers and prospects. And, with the addition
of collaboration expertise to our domain expertise, our UC Services
practice has even more to offer companies that need to reduce costs and
streamline business processes, both critical keys to success now more
than ever."

&lt;p&gt;Text Message Alerts Offer Near Real-Time Warning of Potentially Fraudulent
Activity
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today announced the
rollout of Rapid Alerts for Wells Fargo Visa credit cardholders. The free
service allows consumers to better manage and track their spending while
providing them with near real-time1 detection of potentially fraudulent
activity. 

Rapid Alerts by Wells Fargo are enabled by Visa`s transaction alerts platform.
Alerts are sent on behalf of Wells Fargo directly from VisaNet, Visa`s global
processing network, typically within seconds of a transaction occurring. Rapid
Alerts are triggered when the transaction meets certain criteria previously
selected by the Wells Fargo Visa account holder and delivered via text message
or e-mail. Rapid Alerts let consumers monitor their Wells Fargo Visa credit card
account activity and take immediate action if they believe a potentially
fraudulent transaction is taking place. 

"We believe Rapid Alerts will give customers added peace of mind that they will
be notified almost immediately when transactions occur," said Peter Ho, product
manager for Wells Fargo Card Services and Consumer Lending. "We piloted Rapid
Alerts in 2009 and received an overwhelming positive response from participants
who said text alerts were an invaluable tool for monitoring their accounts. We
want to help our customers succeed financially, and this is just one more tool
to help them get there." 

Rapid Alert messages contain the amount, time and date of the transaction, as
well as currency conversion and information relating to the merchant, such as
name and location. Rapid Alert messages help customers track their spending and
better manage their finances. Customers also will be alerted to Wells Fargo Visa
credit card payments that are declined, which may also help remind customers of
recurring payments that they forgot to update due to a reissued, lost or stolen
card. 

"Visa is empowering cardholders to take an active role in managing and
protecting their Visa accounts," said Jim McCarthy, global head of product at
Visa Inc. "Visa`s ability to analyze transactions `in-flight` enables us to
provide our cardholders with near real-time transaction alerts. Participating
Visa cardholders can typically receive alerts before they walk out of the store,
rather than hours or even days later." 

Wells Fargo credit card customers can learn more and sign up for the service at
rapidalerts.wellsfargo.com. They will be able to choose the kinds of
transactions for which they wish to receive alerts. Criteria for transaction
alerts that cardholders may choose include:

* Transactions that exceed a dollar amount chosen by the cardholder 
* Transactions initiated internationally 
* Card-not-present transactions, such as purchases made online or by telephone 
* Cash withdrawals from an ATM machine 
* Declined transactions 
* Gasoline transactions

"The most effective financial alerts deliver the right information at the right
time - which typically is right away," said Mark Schwanhausser, senior analyst
for multichannel financial services for Javelin Strategy &amp; Research. "Consumers
hunger for real-time alerts and mobile banking features that give them the
confidence that they are in control of their money -- anytime, anywhere they
happen to roam." 

Wells Fargo has a tradition of helping consumers manage their finances and
protect themselves against fraud and, if necessary, resolve it. Wells Fargo is a
founding member of ITAC, the Identity Theft Assistance Center. In addition,
Wells Fargo along with Bank of America, BB and JP Morgan Chase formed Early
Warning Services, to help eliminate fraud in financial systems. Established as a
trusted source for strategic fraud management, Early Warning Services
facilitates the secure exchange of information and knowledge between
organizations for the sole purpose of preventing fraud. Wells Fargo also
partners with the Anti-Phishing Working Group, and law enforcement, as
necessary. 

"In addition to the alerts, customer can rest assured that their cards are also
protected by our WellsProtect program," add Ho. "It provides cardholders with
zero liability if their card is ever lost, stolen or used without authorization
and the cardholder provides us with prompt notification. This means that a
cardholder is automatically protected against any unauthorized transactions made
at merchants, over the phone, on the Internet or at the ATM." 

About Mobile Banking

In addition to receiving Rapid Alerts, Wells Fargo customers can access their
accounts with Wells Fargo Mobile Banking. Wells Fargo offers three easy ways to
bank on the go including its mobile web site at WF.com; an iPhone application
that can be accessed by searching for "Wells Fargo Mobile" from the iTunes App
Store; and text banking.

businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries

digital currency is one of the world`s most advanced processing

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI, March 23 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of
Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) has been asked to pay $47 million
compensation for causing environmental damage at its bottling
plant in the southern Indian state of Kerala, state officials
said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A state government panel, in a report late on Monday, said
Coca-Cola's subsidiary, Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt Ltd
(HCBPL), was responsible for depleting groundwater and dumping
toxic waste around its Palakkad plant between 1999 and 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protests by farmers, complaining against pollution, forced
HCBPL to close down the unit in 2005. The company operates 52
bottling plants in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The conflict between industry and farmers reflects a wider
battle in India, where efforts to modernise the densely
populated country have often met with protests from villagers
who make up more than half of the country's 1.1 billion plus
population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola said in a statement late on Monday that HCBPL was
not responsible for causing pollution in Palakkad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is unfortunate that the committee in Kerala was
appointed on the unproven assumption that damage was caused,
and that it was caused by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages," the
statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A final decision on the compensation will be taken by the
state government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But news of the committee's findings in Kerala spread to at
least two states where local villagers are protesting against
Coca-Cola, alleging similar depletion of water and
contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The water level in and around the bottling plant has gone
down by at least 40-50 feet," said Nandalal Master, a local
leader, spearheading a movement against Coca-Cola outside
Varanasi in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are organising huge protests and planning to move court
and seeking more support of people," Master said by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Environmentalists say similar protests against another
Coca-Cola bottling plant were being planned in Rajasthan, in
northwestern India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This decision will strengthen the resolve of people
against similar plants in other states and we foresee more
protests," said Amit Srivastava of the India Resource Center, a
pro-farmer campaign organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Farmers' protests in India have forced cancellation of
special economic zones and other projects in four other states.
A total of 230 tax-free export zones have already been put on
hold.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI, March 23 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) has been asked to pay $47 million compensation for causing environmental damage at its bottling plant in the southern Indian state of Kerala, state officials said on Tuesday. A state government panel, in a report late on Monday, said Coca-Cola's subsidiary, Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt Ltd (HCBPL), was responsible for depleting groundwater and dumping toxic waste around its Palakkad plant between 1999 and 2004. Protests by farmers, complaining against pollution, forced HCBPL to close down the unit in 2005. The company operates 52 bottling plants in India. The conflict between industry and farmers reflects a wider battle in India, where efforts to modernise the densely populated country have often met with protests from villagers who make up more than half of the country's 1.1 billion plus population. Coca-Cola said in a statement late on Monday that HCBPL was not responsible for causing pollution in Palakkad. It is unfortunate that the committee in Kerala was appointed on the unproven assumption that damage was caused, and that it was caused by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages, the statement said. A final decision on the compensation will be taken by the state government. But news of the committee's findings in Kerala spread to at least two states where local villagers are protesting against Coca-Cola, alleging similar depletion of water and contamination. The water level in and around the bottling plant has gone down by at least 40-50 feet, said Nandalal Master, a local leader, spearheading a movement against Coca-Cola outside Varanasi in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

&lt;p&gt;Accuses IBM of Blocking Open Source Mainframe Alternative
PARIS--(Business Wire)--
TurboHercules SAS filed a formal complaint today against International Business
Machines Corporation with the European Commission`s Directorate General for
Competition (DG COMP) in Brussels. 

TurboHercules' complaint alleges that IBM is preventing customers from using
Hercules --- an open-source mainframe emulator developed in Europe and
maintained by a global volunteer community over the past 10 years --- to run
customers' applications on inexpensive, non-mainframe computers utilising
multiple operating systems. 

"Hercules is an innovative open-source technology that could benefit many
mainframe customers," said Roger Bowler, the original developer of the Hercules
open-source project and the Chairman of TurboHercules. "But IBM is preventing
customers from using Hercules by tying IBM's mainframe operating system with IBM
hardware. This conduct prevents TurboHercules from providing its product to
mainframe customers desiring an open-source solution." 

TurboHercules decided to file its complaint after it became apparent to the
company that IBM's efforts to protect its mainframe monopolies extended to
open-source solutions. "TurboHercules is by no means anti-IBM," said Bowler. "We
originally wrote to IBM requesting that it license its mainframe operating
system to customers, on reasonable and fair terms, for use with Hercules in
certain circumstances. Not only did IBM deny our request, but it now suddenly
claims, after ten years, that the Hercules open-source emulator violates IBM
intellectual property that it has refused to identify. We then realized that our
only hope as a small company was to file a complaint with the European
Commission." 

About TurboHercules

TurboHercules is a privately held company headquartered in Paris, France. The
company was formed in 2009 to offer a commercial solution based on the Hercules
open-source project. For more information, please visitwww.turbohercules.com.

&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MILAN, March 23 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) has
hired JP Morgan (JPM.N) banking veteran Federico Imbert to lead
its Italian operations, the Swiss bank giant said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imbert made his mark in investment banking as he worked in
1999 on the $58 billion leveraged buy-out of telecoms company
Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI), the world's biggest hostile takeover
at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imbert, who has spent his whole 36-year career at JP Morgan,
will replace Luigi de Vecchi, who became co-head for Credit
Suisse's global investment banking in January 2010.

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters Life!) - Foreign sex workers in Malaysia are paying local men up to $1,500 a month to become their husbands so that they can stay on in the country to ply their trade, the New Straits Times newspaper said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under immigration laws, foreign spouses of Malaysians are initially given three-month visas before eventually obtaining year-long permits, which are renewed automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigration Department Director General Abdul Rahman Othman told the newspaper that the prostitutes had taken on husbands to become eligible for long-term visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although prostitution is illegal in Malaysia, the women cannot be prosecuted under immigration laws because their marriages are legal, Othman said. They can, however, be prosecuted under vice laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said foreign sex workers could make up to 20,000 ringgit ($6,000) a month and that 5,000 ringgit ($1,500) a month for "marriages of convenience" was nothing compared to what they would lose if they had to leave the country to renew visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said that recent raids by immigration officers on brothels revealed that only one of 25 foreign women rounded up had a genuine marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Checks reveal that they knew nothing about these so-called husbands and their husbands can't even recall the names of the wives off-hand," Othman said, adding that the department will conduct random checks on the couples to check whether their marriages were real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prostitution is illegal in Malaysia but many spas and karaoke bars double up as brothels. Local media reports the sex industry raked in more than 3.2 billion Malaysia ringgit ($963.8 million) in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Niluksi Koswanage, editing by Miral Fahmy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM's former server chief, Robert Moffat, is heading to court on Monday after he agreed to waive his right to a grand jury in a case related to the Galleon Group insider-training scandal, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waiver sets the stage for Moffat to enter a plea in the case relating to his involvement in an insider-trading scheme that netted some stock traders millions of dollars in illicit profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hearing about the waiver will be presented in front of a judge on Monday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, a  spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday. Typically when a defendant agrees to waive the right of grand-jury indictment, the next step is waiving the right in front of a judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat's lawyer, Kerry Lawrence, on Wednesday confirmed his client had waived his right for grand-jury indictment, but declined to comment on whether Moffat would plead guilty. The DOJ spokeswoman declined to comment further on the case before Monday's hearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ on Tuesday filed a notice of intent to bring criminal charges in the case. The charges being brought against Moffat include securities fraud and insider trading. Ten others involved in the case have already pleaded guilty for their involvement in the alleged scam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat, formerly senior vice president at IBM, was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in October with conspiracy to commit securities fraud along with other technology-company executives and traders. In the wake of the SEC investigation, the DOJ has taken over prosecution of the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat allegedly provided insider information when IBM was considering acquiring Sun Microsystems to Danielle Chiesi, a portfolio manager at New York-based New Castle Funds. Chiesi allegedly made trades on behalf of New Castle Funds based on the tips and generated about US$1 million in illegal profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC also filed charges in the case against Raj Rajaratnam, a portfolio manager with hedge fund Galleon Group, who gained close to $25 million in illegal profit. Chiesi and Rajaratnam allegedly committed securities fraud jointly, according to the SEC. Both of them tapped into a network of high-ranking corporate executives and insiders to obtain confidential details about quarterly earnings and takeover activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC also charged other technology executives including Rajiv Goel, who was Intel treasury's managing director of investments. Goel last month pled guilty in association with the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to release a new version of its Office Communications Server (OCS) by the latter half of 2010, according to Gurdeep Singh Pall, corporate vice president of Microsoft's Unified Communications Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new version of the software will include new features such as Enhanced 911 (e911), deeper integration with Microsoft SharePoint 2010 and Microsoft Exchange 2010, as well as enhanced voice recognition capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new software hasn't been officially given a name yet, though Microsoft's official working name is Communications Server '14.' Pall did not say what the 14 stands for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OCS is software that provides instant messaging, Internet telephony, video conferencing, presence notification and other communications capabilities to large organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When connected to a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunk or a PSTN (public switched telephone network), OCS can replace an office's PBX (private branch exchange) equipment. That can cut the costs of long-distance calls and telephony in general, Pall argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a complete VoIP [voice over Internet Protocol] solution," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One new feature is e911, which allows a user, no matter where they are located, to dial 911 and get local assistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another new feature is call parking, or the ability to put a call on hold and then resume the call from any other phone on the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Communicator client has been simplified and outfitted with new features as well, Pall said. When integrated with Microsoft SharePoint 2010 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, the client can offer a deeper level of search. Previously, users could search the internal directories for names, but now they can search for expertise and knowledge areas as well, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software uses the SharePoint directories to harvest this expertise data. Once you find an expert, you can call them directly from the desktop, using a USB headset. For the recipient of the call, the area of expertise serves as the subject line of the incoming call notification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using speech recognition software, the Communicator client can also transcribe voice mails so they can be read on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the VoiceCon2010 conference in Orlando on Wednesday, Pall expressed optimism for the growing adoption of unified communications, or the ability to intermingle multiple forms of communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft cites a February 2009 Forrester Research report that predicts that the software market for unified communications will grow to US$14.5 billion by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as its jet pilots need visibility, AirTran Airways needs visibility into its network for security and unexpected bumps. The airline company is finding the move to virtualization is bringing in yet more need for visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four trends shape the New Data Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AirTran's MPLS-based network reaches into data and call centers, remote offices, hangars and airport locations. When AirTran first deployed Lancope's StealthWatch a few years ago to monitor network traffic at a core switch inside its Atlanta data center, it was mainly to assist in complying with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security guidelines, says Michelle Stewart, chief information security officer there. "But we gained visibility about who was doing what on our network," Stewart says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, the StealthWatch appliance made it clear when individuals streaming football videos were saturating a link, or when security and patch updates were stressing network availability to remote offices with lower-speed links, especially when VoIP was in use for voice communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The StealthWatch appliance helped eliminate blind spots and became a tool that AirTran managers could use to establish acceptable-use policies that allowed employees some online flexibility but stopped network saturation, Stewart says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lancope this week also announced it's added a so-called "Data Loss Alarm" capability to StealthWatch. This capability flags suspicious traffic flows, mainly based on profiles related to volume, but doesn't block it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next challenge in network visibility is arriving with virtualization as more of AirTran's servers move from physical servers to VMware-based virtual machines sharing a single physical server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, from VM to VM, I don't see traffic," says Stewart about how traffic might move from one VM to another within the same physical server. Stewart is looking at how to address this by possibly deploying more monitoring capability into the VM environment to evaluate many factors, including latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AirTran is looking at using a software-based product from Lancope, called StealthWatch FlowSensor VE, which is a so-called "virtual appliance" that runs on the VMware ESX platform to export NetFlowv9 traffic information and application metrics on virtual machines to the StealthWatch management console. FlowSensor VE was tested by VMware and approved in its partner program last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lancope's CTO Adam Powers notes the company is working on yet more monitoring approaches for virtualization, including one specially designed to address situations where the VMware-based switch in VMware-based environments is basically swapped out for Cisco Nexus 1000v, Cisco's first virtual switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about wide area network in Network World's Wide Area Network section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc was sued for alleged bias by a former vice president, who said the Wall Street bank consigned her to a "mommy track" that led to her firing while she was on maternity leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court by Charlotte Hanna, who said she worked at Goldman Sachs University, an orientation program for new analysts, associates and summer interns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanna, a Manhattan resident, alleged that after her 2005 return from her first maternity leave, Goldman demoted her and made her feel unwelcome in what had become a "boys-only" club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she was fired in February 2009, a week before she was to return from a second maternity leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When Ms. Hanna decided to take the 'off-ramp' provided by the firm to devote time to her children, there was no 'on-ramp' that enabled her to return to full-time employment," the complaint said. "Essentially, the 'off-ramp' was a direct path to a mommy-track that ultimately derailed Ms. Hanna's career."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokeswoman Gia Morone declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major U.S. investment banks are regularly targets of lawsuits by former workers who allege some form of discrimination. Hanna's age was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Hanna joined Goldman in 1998 as an associate, was promoted to vice president two years later, and received strong praise for her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said she took advantage of a Goldman program letting her work part-time upon returning from her first maternity leave in February 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon her return, Hanna allegedly hit a "glass ceiling" with respect to pay and advancement, was demoted, and was systematically excluded from operations and social functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint said 75 percent of those "selected for termination" in her group had recently taken maternity leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that Goldman Sachs views working mothers as second-class citizens who should be at home with their children," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanna's lawyer is Douglas Wigdor, a partner at Thompson Wigdor  Gilly LLP. He said he also represents five women suing Citigroup Inc for alleged discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen more gender and pregnancy discrimination cases since the economy began its downturn," Wigdor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I attribute it to the fact that managers are typically men who have unfettered discretion about who to terminate," he went on. "They perceive that working mothers may not work as hard as men, and may not be with the firm as long so they can be with their children. That can make women seem more expendable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Hanna v. Goldman Sachs  Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-02637.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings takes various rating actions to JP Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corporation's commercial mortgage pass-through certificates,
series 2002-CIBC5, as follows: 

Fitch downgrades and assigns LS Ratings and Outlooks to the following classes: 

--$8.8 million class M to 'B-/LS5' from 'B+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$2.5 million class N to 'B-/LS5' from 'B'; Outlook Negative. 

In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes and assigns LS ratings and
Outlooks as indicated: 

--$52.6 million class A-1 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$487.2 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$36.4 million class B at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable; 

--$13.8 million class C at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$27.6 million class D at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable; 

--$13.8 million class E at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$28.8 million class F at 'AA+/LS3'; Outlook Stable; 

--$16.3 million class G at 'AA-/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$18.8 million class H at 'BBB+/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$12.6 million class J at 'BBB-/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$5 million class K at 'BB+/LS5'; Outlook Negative; 

--$5 million class L at 'BB/LS5'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch does not rate class NR. 

The downgrades are due to an increase in Fitch expected losses upon the
disposition of specially serviced assets along with expected losses from Fitch's
prospective review of potential stresses. Fitch expects losses of 2.1% of the
remaining transaction balance, or $15.7 million, from loans in special servicing
and loans that cannot refinance at maturity based on Fitch's refinance test.
Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any changes to the ratings over
the next one to two years. 

As of the March 2010 distribution date, the pool's certificate balance has paid
down 26% to $742.8 million from $1 billion at issuance. 

There are 97 of the original 116 loans remaining in transaction, 29 of which
have defeased (29.2% of the current transaction balance). Fitch identified 14
Loans of Concern (9.4%) within the pool, of which three (2.7%) are specially
serviced. 

The largest specially serviced loan (1.2%) is a 384-unit multifamily property in
Tallahassee, FL. The loan transferred in February 2009 for payment delinquency.
The property performance has suffered as a result of a decline in enrollment at
a nearby university as well as increased competition in the market. The servicer
reported year-end 2009 debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 0.22 times (x).
Losses are expected. 

The second largest specially serviced asset (0.9%) is a 62,542 square foot
retail property in Gilbert, AZ. The loan transferred in December 2009. There
servicer reported September 2009 occupancy was 54% and the DSCR was 0.82x. The
decrease in occupancy is a result of Bally's vacating approximately 40% of the
net rentable area. 

The third largest specially serviced asset (0.6%) is a 250 pad manufactured
housing community located in Grove City, OH. The loan transferred in October
2009 due to payment default. The borrower is in litigation with the county and
EPA over allegations that runoff from retention ponds and the water treatment
plant have dumped contaminants into a river adjacent to the property. 

Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining non defeased loans by applying a
10% reduction to 2008 fiscal year end net operating income and applying an
adjusted market cap rate between 7.5% and 10% to determine value. 

Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage CMBS, each loan also
underwent a refinance test by applying an 8% interest rate and 30-year
amortization schedule based on the stressed cash flow. Loans that could
refinance to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 times or higher were
considered to payoff at maturity. Seven loans did not pay off at maturity and
three loans incurred a minimal loss when compared to Fitch's stressed value. 

Additional information on Fitch's amended criteria for analyzing recent vintage
U.S. CMBS is available in the July 7, 2009 report, 'Surveillance Methodology for
Recent Vintage U.S. CMBS,' which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' under

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, Mar 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SalesFUSION(TM), the maker of SalesFUSION 360, an integrated sales and
marketing demand generation platform, today released Version 1.1 of its
Microsoft CRM Marketing Accelerator. The new version fully embeds demand
generation functionality into Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

    The suite of features offered in the SalesFUSION Dynamics Marketing
Accelerator includes a wide range of functionality required by savvy B2B
marketers. The application's standard features include:


--  Web visitor tracking and Web analytics
--  Advanced B2B e-mail marketing
--  The ability to build and display Web forms, landing pages, and surveys
--  Full multi-channel marketing campaign management functionality

    

"I'm fully confident our SalesFUSION Dynamics Marketing Accelerator
is the most feature-rich and comprehensive integration of any marketing
automation solution provider in the market," said Kevin Miller, EVP
Marketing and Sales for SalesFUSION. "We've made it our goal to be the
number-one demand generation solution for Microsoft Dynamics CRM and I
believe Version 1.1 cements that position for us in the market."

    While earlier releases of the SalesFUSION Dynamics Marketing Accelerator
were a huge success for both the firm and its clients, the Atlanta-based
company relied on feedback from its user base and from Microsoft directly
to identify several key areas where it could enhance the product. 

    According to Miller, the most significant change in Version 1.1 is the
embedded tab navigation provided at the lead and contact records in both
premise and online versions. This feature allows any sales user to access
the complete lead lifecycle history up to the point at which they make
initial sales contact. Sales users can also view Web visit history,
e-mail response history, and access responses to all questions answered
in forms or surveys. This depth of integration is unique in the Microsoft
CRM community.

    "We felt we had an opportunity to fill a market void and have done so
quite successfully thus far," says Miller. "Over 75% of our net new
customer growth since January has been with Microsoft Dynamics clients."

    SalesFUSION's Dynamics Marketing Accelerator works in premise, hosted,
and online environments with no functional gaps between each deployment
type. Used by U.S. and International companies of all sizes, the
application requires no software and no services to implement and can be
up and running in a matter of hours. SalesFUSION sells the solution in a
direct and re-seller model. Existing Microsoft resellers can sign up as
SalesFUSION resellers and earn a direct re-sale commission per month on
the SaaS fees.

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS -- Some users of Microsoft's Windows Phone Series 7 will face a major hurdle when the mobile OS appears in devices during the 2010 holiday season -- it isn't backwards compatible with Windows Mobile 6.5 and earlier versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may not view the lack of compatibility as a hurdle because it is looking for the new software to take it in a drastically new direction. However, enterprise adopters of earlier Windows Mobile might see things differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To its credit, Microsoft will allay some enterprise fears with its promise to support Windows Mobile 6.5 for a long time. Michael Chang, the senior product manager on Windows Phone 7, yesterday reiterated earlier vows made by CEO Steve Ballmer and others to keep on supporting Windows Mobile 6.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will continue to support, ship and sell 6.5, Chang said in an interview at the CTIA Wireless conference. Windows Phone 7 is a departure and a break at a code level. Doing so wasn't an easy decision. It's a tough decision to move away from a platform like Windows Mobile, but one we were willing to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer has said that Microsoft screwed up on Windows Mobile, and the company apparently hopes that the new Windows Phone 7 can help restore Microsoft's slipping share of the mobile operating systems market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Ballmer is pushing the Windows Phone 7 team to attain specific market share numbers, Chang said, not publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bradley, senior vice president of devices at ATT, said that his company is looking forward to having Windows Phone 7 devices use its network. Other major U.S. carriers have endorsed the Microsoft OS as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Mobile has become the enterprise standard OS for certain vertical segments," Bradley said in an interview. However, he added, "it has fallen back. But give Microsoft credit. They've taken 6.5 and made a break for something new. They've raised the bar substantially with Windows Phone 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradley noted that Micosoft's move to develop a Windows Phone 7 interface that's similar to its Zune digital media player likely won't be an allure to many users. Zune has not been widely adopted, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Bradley said he expects that Windows Phone 7 will have a browser that is very, very comparable to any smartphone on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang said that while Microsoft expects to offer a rich multimedia experience on Windows Phone 7 devices, the OS initially won't include Adobe Flash player. We won't support Flash at general availability, although we do have a very deep relationship with Adobe, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang said that adding consumer friendly features like multimedia support and rich browsing to its mobile operating system doesn't mean that Microsoft will abandon its place as a supplier of enterprise handhelds, including some rugged ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think of this OS as an extension  of our scope, Chang said. I wouldn't say we are building a consumer phone at the expense of our heritage [of supporting] work productivity. We are taking that and adding to it features that include entertainment and a focus on a new experience. Windows Mobile was all about productivity, but we had relied on someone else to deliver a great experience.

&lt;p&gt;  AUSTIN, TX, Mar 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Hospitality Financial and Technology Professionals (HFTP(R)) announced

guestroom featuring the hospitality industry's most innovative
technologies. The exhibit debuts at the 2010 Hospitality Industry

HFTP, is June 21-24 at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando,

    "With the pace of technology change, it is important to understand what

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has noted Google's recent move to stop censoring its search engine in China, but will continue to do business there, a senior company official said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Microsoft believes that it should be engaged in global markets and will continue to support free expression, transparency and the rule of law, said Cornelia Kutterer, senior manager for regulatory policy in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have done business in China for over 20 years, and we intend to continue our business in China," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kutterer gave a presentation on Wednesday at the Council of Europe's conference on cybercrime, an annual meeting of law enforcement, security experts and government officials discussing the Convention on Cybercrime treaty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology companies have come under periodic scrutiny for how their products may be used by the Chinese government to withhold information it deems sensitive. The companies have generally defended themselves by saying they must comply with Chinese laws in order to do business there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kutterer spoke about the Global Network Initiative (GNI), an organization which focuses on freedom and privacy issues on the Internet. The GNI was launched in October 2008 in part out of continuing concern for how technology companies were operating in countries such as China with strict censorship regimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Yahoo are among the members of the GNI. On Monday, Google said it would redirect users of its Chinese site Google.cn to an uncensored search engine based in Hong Kong after the Chinese government said it would not allow the company to run an unfiltered search engine on "google.cn." Users are now being redirected to "google.com.hk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's changes to its search engine came after it said in January it was targeted by hackers. More than 20 other technology, financial and software companies were targeted, with an aim to steal intellectual property and intelligence on human rights activists, Google said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  TAMPA, FL, Mar 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Ceelox, Inc. has begun development modifications of their biometric
authentication software product line to operate with the Microsoft
Windows 7 operating system. Ceelox is a majority-owned operating
subsidiary of Nicaragua Rising Inc. (OTCBB: NCRG) (the "Company" or
"Nicaragua"). 

    Ceelox, a biometric software security company offering identity
authentication, and data and email encryption, will work to ensure that
their entire product line will interoperate with the new Windows 7
operating system. "This will offer our customers a migration strategy
from XP and Vista to Windows 7, thus reducing their costs and allow them
to continue operating without fear of exposure to risk while migrating to
a platform offering less security," said Gerry Euston, Ceelox Chief
Executive Officer.

    The current Ceelox product line includes:

    Ceelox ID(R) biometric authentication software provides a definitive
real-time authentication tool. It significantly reduces or eliminates
fraud from compromised customer credentials through the swipe of a
finger. It is easy to administer and even easier to use. Deploy it, where
necessary, to meet two-factor authentication regulatory requirements.
Alternatively, it can eliminate passwords, the overhead related to
password policy and administration, and 40% of help desk calls for user
name and password resets. 

    Ceelox SecureMail(TM) is a simple, but powerful email encryption tool
that insures data security from desktop-to-desktop and eliminates email
exposure inherent in electronic communications. Email and attachments are
encrypted directly on the sender's compute and decrypted on the
recipient's computer. This eliminates Personally Identifiable Information
(PII) floating around on the email server or the desktop. Ceelox
SecureMail(TM) offers the added security of a patent pending exclusive
biometric digital signature. In addition, a free, downloadable,
decrypt-only version is available through the Ceelox website:
www.ceelox.com.

    Ceelox Vault(TM) is a secure data storage solution for data at rest or in
transit. Other encryption solutions use password access, which is easy to
copy or hack. Ceelox Vault(TM) combines a powerful encryption solution
with added fingerprint biometric security. Most encryption tools fail
because they are too complicated and take too long to use. Ceelox
Vault(TM) is as easy as drag and drop.

    Ceelox ID Online(TM) is a software portal that easily and quickly
integrates into online applications and web sites. Ceelox ID Online(TM)
provides an additional layer of security that sits on top of your
existing security. The two-factor authentication significantly enhances
the security of online banking, shopping, or payment applications. Any
ap-plication accessible today with user name and password benefits from
the addition of strong biometric security. Both business customers and
consumers will benefit from the robust form of identity access.

    About Nicaragua Rising, Inc.

    Nicaragua Rising, Inc., through its majority-owned operating subsidiary,
Ceelox, Inc., is a developer of biometric security and encryption
software solutions for financial institutions, healthcare companies,
utilities, government agencies and other organizations for whom
information access are key concerns. Its security and encryption tools
are easy to deploy, simple to use, cost-effective and affordable for
organizations of all sizes.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, Mar 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Ok. It's over. Obama went all in, getting the last minute support he
needed from key Democrats, and won. The Health Care Bill, one of the most
far-reaching and influential pieces of legislation to come out of
Washington in decades, is poised to become law. So now it's time to put
aside whatever personal opinions you may have and figure out how this
Bill is going to affect your money. Obama bet all his chips and won.
Let's find out how to make sure the next pot ends up in your pocket.

    We're seeing a small pullback in the health care sector today as
investors take a breather amidst a flat and uninspired day on the markets
all around. So it's a good time to think about where to put your money.
The sector woke up Monday morning to find a new market almost the size of
California to be served. 32 Million People without medical insurance will
be brought into the fold. No less than Bill Miller, the legendary money
manager from Legg Mason, has gone on the record saying that he likes
health care now that we've seen this legislation passed. And we would
have to agree.

    Today The Stock Alarm announces four health care related stocks: Pfizer
Inc.(PFE), Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX), American International
Group, Inc.(AIG),Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC)

    There are several ETF's that should be considered. The Healthcare Select
Spyder (XLV-N) is a great way to get overall exposure to the sector. It
also sees enough volume to satisfy anyone looking to daytrade the swings
that will inevitably arrive as new details and analysis are revealed.

    Next, there are several sub-sectors of the industry which can be targeted
by specific ETF's. The ishares Dow Jones U.S. Healthcare Providers Index
Fund (IHF-N) is a great way to invest in everything from the Health
Maintenance Companies to Nursing Homes to the Hospitals themselves. The
increased customer base should offset and margin pressure the insurers
will feel from tighter regulation. The hospitals are a no-brainer. The
increase in insured customers will result in revenue growth on the top
line while the decrease in bad debts (non-paying customers) will result
in profit growth on the bottom! For exposure to the drugmakers, look at
the SPDR S Pharmaceuticals ETF (XPH-N). Big Pharma will be a big
recipient of all the new money being thrown at the industry. They also
won out in their lobbying efforts preventing drug imports and price
controls.

    There are plenty of ways to look at playing Healthcare reform. There are
more ETF's, as well as plenty of individual stocks (AET-N, CI-N are a
couple of insurers; UHS-N, THC-N in the hospital arena; PFE-N, JNJ-N are
drugmakers). Keep watching for more tips at http://www.thestockalarm.com

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Mar 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Lanamark Inc., a global software provider of desktop and data center
optimization solutions across physical and virtual infrastructure, today
announced availability of Lanamark Suite 2010. The new release extends
desktop and data center analytics with Compatibility Pack for Microsoft
Windows 7, Application Analysis Pack and User Analysis Pack. The new
capabilities provide deep insight into compatibility of software and
hardware with Microsoft Windows 7, application usage patterns and
resource consumption, and user access and application requirements.

    "Lanamark Suite 2010 provides new levels of intelligence for optimizing
application and desktop delivery across physical and virtual
environments," said Nigel Woods, Technical Director at Intercept IT, a
Citrix Platinum Solution Advisor and a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner
in the UK. "Using Lanamark Suite, we can help customers lower
administration costs, minimize licensing expenses and execute on desktop
virtualization initiatives by helping customers migrate to Windows 7,
reduce application complexity and make applications available only to
those users who will actually use them."

    "Making optimal IT decisions requires a clear understanding of software
and hardware assets, who uses them and how effectively they are
utilized," said Oleg Grodzevich, CTO of Lanamark. "Lanamark Suite 2010
offers a holistic approach to desktop and data center optimization by
providing analytics spanning applications, users, workloads and the
underlying IT infrastructure."

    Lanamark Compatibility Pack for Microsoft Windows 7

    The Compatibility Pack for Microsoft Windows 7 provides detailed
information on applications and hardware compatible with Windows 7. Each
application is given a compatibility rating for 32- and 64-bit versions
of Windows 7. Information on whether a free or a paid application upgrade
is required is also provided. Similarly, all desktops and laptops are
checked for compatibility based on hardware configuration and device
driver availability.

    Lanamark Application Analysis Pack

    The Application Analysis Pack identifies and categorizes software
applications using the Lanamark Software Intelligence (LSI) recognition
engine and an up-to-date repository with thousands of unique application
fingerprints. It enables analysis of how applications are used, whether
applications are launched locally or on terminal servers and what
compute, storage and network resources are consumed. The Application
Analysis Pack also calculates the number of machines, processors and
cores available to each application. This information is critical for
computing licensing requirements, reducing licensing costs and ensuring
software compliance.

    Lanamark User Analysis Pack

    The User Analysis Pack helps determine user and licensing requirements
based on applications, desktops and laptops used by each user across
time. It also provides key user attributes such as organizational unit
and department from Active Directory, distinguishes between office-based

&lt;p&gt;The only researcher to "three-peat" at the Pwn2Own hacking contest said today that security is such a "broken record" that he won't hand over 20 vulnerabilities he's found in Apple's, Adobe's and Microsoft's software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead Charlie Miller will show the vendors how to find the bugs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller, who yesterday exploited Safari on a MacBook Pro notebook running Snow Leopard to win $10,000 in the hacking challenge, said he's tired of the lack of progress in security . "We find a bug, they patch it," said Miller. "We find another bug, they patch it. That doesn't improve the security of the product. True, [the software] gets incrementally better, but they actually need to make big improvements. But I can't make them do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using just a few lines of code, Miller crafted what he called a "dumb fuzzer," a tool that automatically searches for flaws in software by inserting data to see where the program fails. Fuzzing is a common technique used not only by outside researchers, but by developers to spot bugs before they release the software. Microsoft , for example, has long touted , and used, fuzzing as part of its Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), the term for its in-house process of baking security into products as they're created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller's fuzzer quickly uncovered 20 vulnerabilities across a range of applications as well vulnerabilities in Apple 's Mac OS X 10.6, aka Snow Leopard, and its Safari browser. He also found the flaws in Microsoft's PowerPoint presentation maker; in Adobe's popular PDF viewer, Reader; and in OpenOffice.org, the open-source productivity suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Miller was to take the floor at CanSecWest, the Vancouver, British Columbia-based security conference that also hosts Pwn2Own, to demonstrate how he found the vulnerabilities. He hoped Apple, Microsoft and other vendors would listen to what he has to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People will criticize me and say I'm a bad guy for not handing over [the vulnerabilities], but it actually makes more sense to me to not tell them," Miller said. "What I can do is tell them how to find these bugs, and do what I did. That might get them to do more fuzzing." That, Miller maintained, would mean more secure software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really disappointed Miller was how easy it was to find these bugs. "Maybe some will say I'm bragging about finding the bugs, that I can kick ass, but I wasn't that smart. I did the trivial work and I still found bugs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went into the project figuring that he wouldn't find any vulnerabilities with the dumb fuzzer. "But I found bugs, lots of bugs. That was both surprising and disappointing." And it also made him ask why vendors like Microsoft, Apple and Adobe, which have teams of security engineers and scores of machines running fuzzers looking for flaws, hadn't found these bugs long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One researcher with three computers shouldn't be able to do beat the efforts of entire teams, Miller argued. "It doesn't mean that they don't do [fuzzing], but that they don't do it very well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By refusing to hand over technical information about the vulnerabilities he uncovered, Miller is betting that Microsoft, Apple and others will duplicate his work, and maybe, just maybe, be motivated to do better. "I think they'll feel some pressure to find these bugs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller used one of the flaws he found by dumb fuzzing yesterday to exploit Safari on a MacBook Pro, walking off with the notebook, $10,000 and a free trip to Las Vegas this summer to the DefCon hacking conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller also won cash prizes at Pwn2Own in 2008 and 2009, each time by exploiting a Safari vulnerability on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Mar 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Following a month-long trial in United States District Court in Boston, a
federal jury awarded Plaintiffs Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. and
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals over $47 million in damages, before mandatory
trebling and interest. The jury found that Pfizer fraudulently marketed
Neurontin for unapproved uses -- including bipolar disorder, neuropathic
pain, and migraine -- for which Pfizer misrepresented the drug's
efficacy. Kaiser's lead attorney, Linda P. Nussbaum, called the result "a
clear vindication of Kaiser's claims that it was targeted by Pfizer with
misleading information about Neurontin's efficacy." The jury found that
Pfizer violated both the federal RICO statute and California's Unfair
Competition Law. Presiding Judge Patti B. Saris had previously described
the case as "a fabulous trial[.] . . . [I]t's the kind of thing that you
become a judge to sit on."

&lt;p&gt;This First-of-Its-Kind Team Will Be Introduced before the Sprint Cup Series Race
at the Phoenix International Raceway on April 10, 2010
CORNELIUS, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Best Western, The World`s Largest Hotel Chain, in conjunction with Michael
Waltrip Racing has developed stockcar racing`s first-ever "Tweet Crew Team,"
with three Twitter correspondents selected to cover the NASCAR race in Phoenix
on April 10, 2010. 

As part of a national "Tweet Crew Team" job search, fans were asked to submit an
application, which included a link to a creative video or picture, to become a
member of this historic team. Best Western and Michael Waltrip Racing received
hundreds of applications from excited racing fans hoping to be one of three
people chosen to travel to Phoenix and work as driver David Reutimann`s team of
Twitter correspondents. 

When Reutimann arrives at Phoenix International Raceway on Saturday, April 10,
he`ll be followed by the newly selected "Tweet Crew Team," which includes
Randall Martin, a father and longtime racing fan from Worcester, Mass., Rebecca
Kivak, copy editor and avid NASCAR Tweeter from Plains, Penn., and Nancy Mills,
an actress and contractor from Cordova, Tenn. 

The Tweet Crew Team will spend the afternoon Tweeting about every twist and turn
David makes on and off the track. Each "Tweet Crew Team" member will be provided
with a smartphone that has camera capabilities to enable "Twitpics." 

"While my pit crew team will keep me racing during the Subway Fresh Fit 600 in
Phoenix, our `Tweet Crew Team` will put NASCAR fans in the middle of the action
throughout the weekend," said Reutimann. "Fans will get a driver`s perspective
into everything that goes on behind-the-scenes at the racetrack, as well as a
never-before-seen play-by-play of the race - from start to finish - on Twitter."


The "Tweet Crew Team" will give racing fans a written play-by-play of the race
in 140 characters or less via Twitter from the team`s different vantage points
around the track. Fans can follow all the heart-pounding and intimate action by
logging onto www.twitter.com and following the team at @tweetcrewteam. 

Additionally, fans watching the race from home and following the "Tweet Crew
Team" on Twitter will be given the chance to win prizes, including official Best
Western Racing and Michael Waltrip Racing gear, as well as earn Best Western
Speed Rewards points that can be redeemed for future hotel stays and a wide
variety of merchandise. 

One lucky Best Western Speed Rewards member, Best Western`s loyalty program for
race fans, will also win a Best Western Travel Card valued at $500. 

As part of the promotional grand prize, the first-ever "Tweet Crew Team" will
receive roundtrip airfare to Phoenix, hotel accommodations, local
transportation, as well as a Best Western/Michael Waltrip Racing- branded team
uniform and VIP access to the track for the race. The winners will also have the
opportunity to join Michael Waltrip and David Reutimann in a race day press
conference for the unveiling of the Best Western and Michael Waltrip Racing
"Tweet Crew Team." 

"With our newly formed Tweet Crew Team, we`re once again giving fans a unique
opportunity to get closer to drivers Michael Waltrip and David Reutimann than
ever before," said Dorothy Dowling, Best Western`s senior vice president of
marketing and sales. "Our guests have come to count on Best Western to create

&lt;p&gt;Toledo Mud Hens Integrate Customer Database, Email Marketing For Targeted Sales
INDIANAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
Minor league baseball`s Toledo Mud Hens announced today its Microsoft Dynamics
CRM-integrated email campaign boosted season, group and single-game ticket sales
in 2009 and shortened the sales cycle for ticket sales and private events. 

Powered by an integration with global interactive marketing provider ExactTarget
and Microsoft Dynamics CRM, the team tracks fans` attendance to games and events
and sends emails to attendees of previous year`s games inviting them to purchase
tickets to similar games and promotions in the future. 

"Most of the teams in our league have to compile data across five different
databases to have a complete analysis of their fan base," said Scott Jeffer,
Toledo Mud Hens` assistant general manager of marketing and sales. "By
leveraging the power of ExactTarget`s integrations, we can use past purchase
behavior to send targeted email promotions, and track customer purchases from
the email, all from a single database." 

The integration, certified by the ExactTarget Extensions Network, also allows
the Mud Hens sales team to identify which Web links fans visited in previous
emails, providing data to create more relevant follow-up sales calls with
prospective ticketholders. The baseball team also uses the email integration to
provide fans with "Special Alerts," such as schedule changes resulting from
rainouts and subsequent doubleheaders, mitigating the attendance drop-off that
typically follows from such events. 

The Mud Hens have had similar success using the ExactTarget and Microsoft CRM
integration to cross market their database for the Toledo Walleye, the
organization`s new minor league hockey team in Downtown Toledo. 

"Sophisticated marketers are continuously looking to streamline processes and
boost overall marketing ROI," said Tim Kopp, ExactTarget`s chief marketing
officer. "The seamless integration between Microsoft Dynamics CRM and
ExactTarget allows organizations to power highly personalized email marketing by
building targeted messages based on customers preferences and previous brand
interactions." 

Designed to provide technology vendors and software developers a venue to build,
test and prove integrations with the ExactTarget platform, ExactTarget`s
Extensions Network has grown to one of the industry`s largest collection of
certified integrations between an email service provider and supporting
technologies including CRM, Web analytics, Web content management, on-site
search, surveys and product recommendations. 

The news of Toledo Mud Hens` success with ticket revenue through email comes
after Forrester Research named ExactTarget a "leader" in email marketing and
awarded the company a perfect 5 of 5 in the Customer Category of "The Forrester
WaveTM: Email Marketing Service Providers Q4 2009" (December 2009) report. The
independent research firm found ExactTarget to be the only email service
provider to score a perfect score in the Customers Category, noting "with high
satisfaction scores and online community, ExactTarget can successfully meet
marketers` complex business needs." To download the report, visit

&lt;p&gt;Company Demonstrates Continued Commitment to Action on Climate Change 
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company announced today that it will darken many of its iconic
signs as well as offices and bottling facilities across the world in support of
World Wildlife Fund`s Earth Hour on Saturday, March 27 at 8:30 p.m. local time.
The Company also is participating in awareness-raising events with its "Switch
Off" campaign encouraging Coca-Cola employees along with their families and
friends to participate in Earth Hour activities. 

Earth Hour is an event during which millions of people will turn out their
lights for one hour in support of action on climate change. This year marks the
fourth year of the event, which attracted more than 80 million participants in
the U.S. last year, and nearly a billion people around the world, as lights
dimmed on such global icons as the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Sydney`s Opera House,
the Great Pyramids of Gaza and New York`s Empire State Building. 

"As the most recognized brand in the world, The Coca-Cola Company lends its
weight to the most important issue facing our planet today," said Carter
Roberts, president &amp; CEO of World Wildlife Fund. "By helping to support Earth
Hour, Coca-Cola joins WWF and millions of people around the world to send a
clear message about the problem of climate change and the urgent need for
solutions." 

"Forging real progress toward a cleaner future will require behavioral changes
from consumers and business," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The
Coca-Cola Company. "Earth Hour is an important, symbolic event that demonstrates
that even small steps, when taken on a global scale, can make a difference in
addressing climate change." 

The Coca-Cola Company will darken iconic signs in Times Square in New York,
Piccadilly Circus in London, San Pedro Sula in Honduras and Kings Cross in
Sydney. In North America, 30 Coca-Cola Digital Network locations will go to
black screen during the event, and Earth Hour promotions will run on these
screens leading up to and following the event. More than $1 million worth of
cinema advertising was donated by Coca-Cola Canada for Earth Hour promotions in
Canada. Coca-Cola Great Britain has launched an integrated campaign to drive
awareness of the event with customized creative on its Piccadilly Circus sign,
estimated to be seen by 2.4 million viewers in the two weeks prior to the event.


In Atlanta, the Company`s worldwide headquarters, the World of Coca-Cola,
Coca-Cola Enterprises and Coca-Cola North America will go dark; Earth Hour
messages will be displayed on lobby monitors; and employees will be encouraged
to wear black the Friday prior to the event as additional promotion. 

The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners are working to lessen their
climate footprint by focusing efforts on four key areas where they can have the
greatest impact on climate protection: refrigeration equipment; packaging;
manufacturing; and fleet. Coca-Cola recently announced that all new vending
machines and coolers, the largest component of its climate footprint, will be
hydrofluorocarbon-free (HFC-free) by 2015, which will reduce the equipment's
direct greenhouse gas emissions by 99 percent.

&lt;p&gt;In producing a version of its iWork suite of apps for the iPad, Apple is sending a signal: The device won't just be for watching video, playing games and reading books -- although those are sure big reasons why many people will buy one next weekend. By announcing iWork for the iPad during the tablet's unveiling in January, Apple clearly wanted to plant the idea of the iPad as a business and productivity device squarely in the minds of would-be buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the questions that keeps coming up as the iPad's April 3 launch nears is whether it will be a good fit for office use. While some analysts have raised questions about security and management issues with corporate or education uses, others have wondered what business and productivity apps might emerge, and which ones could mean success for the nascent tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the iPad is to find a niche in the workplace, much will depend on whether its iWork apps are business-oriented and whether any compatibility issues are addressed -- for instance, can the iPad open Microsoft Office docs? Another big question: Will Microsoft produce some variation of Office for the iPad? And what about cloud-based applications like Google Docs or Microsoft's Office Web Apps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iWork for iPad -- will it be enough?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is clearly pitching iWork as a business and productivity suite for the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mac version of iWork offers most of the core features that a light business user would need from an office suite. It supports styled text, tracks changes and comments for collaborative work, and includes the vast majority of spreadsheet functions built into Excel. IWork '09 also includes support for importing and exporting documents in a variety of formats, including all recent versions of Office, and others like PDF and QuickTime movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While iWork on the Mac can deliver all this interpretability, it's by no means certain that iWork on the iPad can do the same. In fact, perusing the iWork-related features pages on Apple's iPad site raises doubts that iWork for iPad will measure up to the suite's Mac-based sibling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The page for Keynote (Apple's take on PowerPoint) allows users to import PowerPoint and Keynote files and create new presentations on the iPad. When it comes to sharing files, this page lists only the ability to export presentations as Keynote for Mac files or as PDFs. The implication: You can import (and presumably edit as well as view) PowerPoint presentations, but you may not be able to save to that format without using Keynote on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The page for Numbers contains similar language, indicating that Numbers for iPad can import both Numbers for Mac and Excel spreadsheets but can only export data as Numbers files or PDFs. Working with Numbers is considerably different from working with Excel. Because of the big differences between the layout and presentation of data, this may actually be a good thing: It'll be easier to see what the exported data will look like. See my previous reviews of iWork '09 and iWork '08 for details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pages, Apple's word processing program, seems to fare better than the other two iWork apps on the iPad and is the only one that Apple is describing as capable not only of importing Word documents, but also exporting documents as Word files (in addition to Pages for Mac files and PDFs). That makes a certain amount of sense: Word-processing documents of any stripe mostly stick to styled text and images, not things like tables, formulas and animations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's too early to tell for sure whether iWork for iPad will fit the bill for most users. But it's likely that if you need to work with Word documents or their equivalent, Pages will be a fine choice. For presentations and spreadsheets, the proposition is dicier: While iWork for iPad may allow you to create visually impressive documents, you may face interoperability issues with non-iWork users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Microsoft interested in being an iPad developer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If iWork isn't enough to satisfy business needs, the next logical question is whether Microsoft will deliver a solution. Microsoft has continued to update Office for Mac for decades. Typically, the Mac updates lag behind the updates to Office for Windows, but they do exist and offer both file and feature compatibility with Office for Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which produces few iPhone OS applications -- the Bing search utility is the only one that comes immediately to mind -- hasn't given a sign either way regarding developing for the iPad. Given that the company is busy redefining its own mobile lineup with Windows Phone 7 Series and pushing ahead with Office 2010 for both Windows and Mac (and Office 2010 Web, which I'll come back to later), it's unlikely that Microsoft wants to offer software for a new device from Apple that has UI features and guidelines that are vastly different from anything it has developed for before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, this isn't a priority for now. But if the iPad proves itself popular, Microsoft will have an incentive to develop a version of Office for it, and possibly other apps as well. For the time being, iPad users will have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other office suites for iPad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft out of contention, is there potential for an Office-compatible suite for the iPad beyond iWork? Yes. There are already several such suites and apps available for the iPhone and iPod touch. They let you create, open/import, edit and export documents using the Office and iWork for Mac formats, along with other, less application-specific, formats like plain and rich text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the handful of such offerings in the App Store, some, like MarinerCalc, provide one specific feature -- in this case, spreadsheet functionality. Two App Store suites, however, come close to being full featured Office replacements: Quickoffice Mobile Office Suite (which comes in two flavors, a basic suite that allows viewing and editing of documents for $9.99 and the premium QuickOffice Connect for $14.99) and Dataviz's Documents to Go (available in basic and premium editions for $9.99 and $14.99, respectively). Both allow you to view all major Office and iWork file formats and to create and edit (with formatted text) word processing documents and spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documents to Go Premium also offers support for creating and editing Powerpoint presentations. (QuickOffice plans to offer this capability in a free update later this year.) The premium versions of both tools allow you to copy files between an iPhone or iPod touch and a computer or transfer files and collaborate using Google Docs. Quickoffice Connect also allows transfer and sharing of files through other online/cloud based services including Apple's iDisk and Drop Box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There should be no doubt that both will be ported to the iPad fairly quickly. The iPhone version of these and other tools will already work on the iPad, but iPad-specific releases will likely add features, including the ability edit, create and view presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for pricing, Apple's $30 price tag for the combination of all three iWork apps for the iPad looks like the figure other companies will want to match or beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud options from Google, Microsoft and maybe even Apple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I noted earlier, cloud computing offers another area for Office alternatives for the iPad. Driven largely by Google Docs, Web-based office suites are becoming more mainstream. Companies and schools are adopting enterprise versions of Google Docs as a replacement for both desktop office apps and server-based collaborative tools like Microsoft Exchange. These types of offerings could migrate to mobile devices like the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are a number of cloud-based possibilities, the obvious ones to consider from an iPad perspective include Google Docs, Microsoft's Office 2010 Web and Apple's iWork.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Docs is the best established of the online/cloud office suites. Accessible from any computer, Google Docs offers document sharing and collaboration, and it can import/export the standard Office file formats and deliver basic formatting options for each of those formats. Google Docs can be accessed in a read-only format using mobile Safari on the iPhone, so it seems likely that an iPad-specific Web interface could allow editing features. If so, Google Docs has a good shot at being a popular, free option for iPad users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 Web is another possibility. So far, the details about how it will work on different devices and browsers remain unknown. Much of Office 2010 Web is built around Microsoft's Silverlight runtime environment, which is available for the major desktop computing platforms (including Mac OS X). However, given Apple's anti-Flash stance regarding the iPhone and the iPad, apps that use their own runtime environments like Silverlight might not make the cut. So much for Office 2010 Web as an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's iWork.com beta was introduced with iWork '09 for Mac over a year ago. It isn't a true cloud solution, since it's aimed at sharing iWork documents with other people through a robust Web interface. That interface allows multiple users to add comments and notes to shared documents and download a shared document in iWork, Office or PDF formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Apple modified iWork.com to offer easier sharing of documents through social networking or other Internet services. It also updated the interface for accessing shared documents from an iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch, a change that should make accessing shared documents easier from Apple's mobile devices. My sense is that the iWork apps on an iPad will allow for easy sharing of documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While iWork.com offers a simple way to share documents, and it allows other users to view and comment on your work, it isn't a true online office suite. So it will not be an office solution in itself. For the time being, that leaves Google Docs as the primary cloud-based Office alternative -- for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming Quickoffice, Documents To Go and other iPhone/iPad suites retain their interoperability with Google Docs, they could create an ecosystem very similar to what Apple seems to be aiming for with iWork.com. In fact, the added collaboration options could make the combination of these types of suites and Google Docs a compelling alternative to Office and even iWork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall thoughts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's too soon to know what Office-type suites will emerge as the best productivity options for the iPad, it seems clear that the device will, through one mechanism or another, be able to interoperate with Office and other productivity tools. That's true for individual users as well as for the broader business/enterprise environment. While iWork for the iPad may be the only option available when the iPad becomes available on April 3, other choices will become available in short order, and perhaps some may be better business choices than iWork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Faas is a freelance writer and technology consultant specializing in Mac and multiplatform network issues.

Featured Post

Nat Gas 101

Nat Gas, and associated companies like Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK)** is (are)
going to get better. 

Our Prez and Congress have their priorities all wrong. Now that the healthcare
debacle, is temporarily off to the side (I think the courts will make them FIX
parts of it ...) Congress and the Prez need to get their priorities straight ...
The USA has a HUGE trade deficit, yes, much of it with CHINA and its'
manipulated currency, but also with imported crude. 

To offset that huge trade deficit, the USA can now focus on its abundant
supplies of Nat Gas, and Coalbed Methane, to power MORE trucks, cars, buses, etc
... Doing a lot more NOW with Nat Gas will help with JOBS, the TRADE DEFICIT,
GLOBAL WARMING (Nat gas is a cleaner fuel than crude or coal) and even our
NATIONAL DEBT. 

Nat gas is a cleaner fuel than crude, yes it is ... and not just in, and for,
the environment. 

Take three identical vehicles, run one on gasoline, the second on diesel, and
the third on nat gas. After 100,000 miles .... disassemble the engines, and look
at the CRUD, except the nat gas engine is pretty clean ... wow!! Now, the CRUD
and CARBON in the other engines, AND the additional wear and tear, the
deterioration that ROBS each of us of performance and cleanliness of the
environment. That's what WE as consumers have to gain ... 

What are we waiting for? 

** Why CHK ...? 

Chesapeake Energy's CEO recently stated CHK could do one or two more joint
ventures AND is looking to grow FIFTY percent in the next three years. The joint
ventures partners are picking up the tabs (costs) for new wells resulting in
LOWER expenses for CHK. Stock prices and PE's DO change to reflect growth, or
lack thereof. 

Can Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), IBM (NYSE: IBM) or Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) say the same
... or even have a REMOTE chance to pull a quarter of that rate of growth off?
Hmmm!

&lt;p&gt;Car customizing shop for kids opens largest interactive experience, complete
with real-world show cars!
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Fun is about to shift into overdrive at Downtown Disney&#174; Westside at Walt Disney
World&#174; Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. RIDEMAKERZ&#174;, the first-ever car
customizing experience for kids and kids at heart, is opening this week for a
limited engagement at the 120-acre entertainment, shopping-dining complex. This
opening follows the October 2009 launch of a RIDEMAKERZ shop in Downtown Disney
in Anaheim, Calif. that won the company recognition by Chain Store Age magazine
as best worldwide "Pop-Up" store. 

The RIDEMAKERZ experience invites guests into the ultimate car customizing shop
where they can build a one-of-a-kind radio control car or "RIDE." Between
bodystyles and colors, tires and wheels, lights and sounds, accessories and
decals, RIDEMAKERZ estimates there are more than 649 million possible build
combinations, not including individual decal placement. 

"The RIDEMAKERZ experience is pure fun, and the process is designed to spark
creativity, encourage collaboration and build confidence," says RIDEMAKERZ ZEO
(CEO) Larry Andreini. 

In a nod to real-world car culture, RIDEMAKERZ has agreements with several
automotive manufacturers to offer versions of today`s most popular cars in its
line-up. Guests, or "Customizers," can choose from the Ford Mustang and F-250
Super Chief Alternative Fuel Concept Truck, Chevrolet Corvette C6.R and C6RS,
Dodge Ram, Challenger, and Viper, MINI Cooper S, and Scion xB. Retro hot rods,

are also available. 

Complete RIDEZ range in price from $10 to $32, depending on body and paint style
chosen. Radio remote control can be added for an additional $25, and custom
accessories range in price from $2 for grill guards, spoilers and hoods scoops
to $15 for themed kits that include a wide range of complementary accessories.
RIDEZ measure approximately 12 inches long, or 1:18 scale, and are easy to
assemble with snap-in, snap-on components that do not require glue. 

"RIDEMAKERZ delivers a high-octane experience and one-of-a kind fun," said
Downtown Disney Vice President Keith Bradford. "We`re excited to add RIDEMAKERZ
to our existing portfolio of unique offerings at Downtown Disney. It fills a
niche our guests have been looking for." 

RIDEMAKERZ` Orlando shop, which occupies the former home of Virgin Records,
delivers an even higher-octane experience to visitors by incorporating a
specially designated radio-control test track and real-world auto salon. Eight
world-class show cars are on display, including a Chevrolet C5.R racecar built
by Pratt &amp; Miller Engineering for General Motors. 

The display also features an F150 NASCAR Pace Truck and Dodge Ram from the
personal collection of legendary car customizer Chip Foose, as well as a MINI
Cooper from the private collection of famed movie car designer Fireball Tim
Lawrence. 

"The RIDEMAKERZ brand and this shop, in particular, are close to my heart," said
Foose during an autograph session at the grand opening on March 25th. "I learned
about car customizing from my Dad, and now I get to help pass that experience on
to fathers, sons and families across America." Foose also serves as an advisor
to RIDEMAKERZ.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

P Recalls Pringles Chips

Recently, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG - Analyst Report) voluntarily
recalled two flavors of Pringles Chips in response to the recommendation from
the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) to protect consumers from potential
salmonella exposure. The flavors were Pringles Restaurant Cravers Cheeseburger
potato crisps and Pringles Family Faves Taco Night potato crisps. However, the
company confirmed that there have been no reports of salmonella-related illness
in relation to these products. 

P also confirmed that no other Pringles varieties or flavors were affected by
this recall. These two products represent only 0.5% of Pringles' U.S. volume.
Management at PG also mentioned that the safety of its products is its top
priority and the company follows rigorous food safety and ingredient testing
standards. 

Salmonella is a common food-related pathogen that can cause severe illnesses,
including fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The company was notified by one
of its suppliers that a seasoning used in these two recalled products contained
hydrolyzed vegetable protein or HVP, manufactured by Basic Food Flavors, Inc.,
which could lead to potential salmonella exposure. 

Last week, McCormick (MKC - Snapshot Report), the manufacturer of spices, also
issued a recall. MKC pulled packages of French onion dip mix, vegetable dip mix,
onion gravy mix and corn stuffing mix; all of which contained hydrolyzed
vegetable protein manufactured by Basic Food Flavors. 

TiVo Beats on Higher Revenues

TiVo Inc. (TIVO - Analyst Report) reported a net loss of 9 cents per share for
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, 3 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of
a loss of 12 cents per share but fell from the prior-year quarter. The company
had reported a loss of 4 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. 

Although revenue growth was encouraging in the quarter driven by higher hardware
sales, growing costs and reduced subscriber additions led to lower
profitability. TiVo is not immune to the current challenging economic
environment and is facing erosion of its subscriber base. 

Moreover, intense competition from cable companies such as Comcast (CMCSA -
Analyst Report) and Cox is posing a threat to its DVR business. As a result,
TiVO has been increasing its R spending to stay ahead of the competition,
which is hurting its profitability. 

TiVo reported a net loss of $10.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010,
better than its guided range of a net loss of between $13 million and $15
million. Loss in the quarter was higher than the $3.6 million net loss in the
year-ago period due to higher R and litigation expenses. 

Net revenue for the reported quarter increased 15.7% year over year to $68.5
million, compared to $59.2 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Services
(the company's largest segment) witnessed a year-over-year decline of 13.9%,
offset by a rise in Technology revenue, which was up 56.7% in the quarter and
Hardware revenue, which was up 116.5%. Service and Technology revenue together
declined 6.6% to $45.3 million, but was in line with the company`s guidance of
$43 - $45 million. 

Gross margin dropped to 36.8% from 49.8% in the year-ago period. Operating
expenses rose 5.1% year over year in the quarter, leading to higher loss from
operations. While R expenses rose in the quarter, the company cut its sales
and marketing costs. 

Adjusted EBITDA of a negative $3.2 million was better than management`s guidance
of ($5) million to ($7) million. However, this was down from a positive adjusted
EDITDA of $2.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The decline in EBITDA
was driven by increased research &amp; development spending relating to new products
and higher distribution cost. 

TiVo-owned subscription gross additions for the quarter were 46,000, down 22%
from 59,000 gross additions in the year-ago quarter. Churn increased to 2.6% in
the quarter. On a net basis, TiVo-owned subscriptions decreased by 72,000 in the
fourth quarter and the TiVo-owned subscription base ended the quarter at
approximately 1.5 million subscriptions. 

TiVo exited the quarter with $244.5 million in cash and marketable securities
and no debt. 

In the quarter, TiVo unveiled TiVo Premiere DVR and a new high-definition user
interface. This is TiVo`s first new DVR in nearly three years and comes in
configurations of 320-gigabyte and 1-terabyte hard drives that seamlessly blend
broadcast TV, as well as the Internet and signals. The partnership with Best Buy
(BBY - Analyst Report) will help TiVo in the launch of the TiVo Premiere and
will help it improve brand visibility and marketing in 2010.

&lt;p&gt;March 26 (Reuters) - Central Japan Railway Co (9022.T)
plans to invest 308 billion yen ($3.32 billion), its highest
ever, in railway operations in fiscal 2010, the Nikkei business
daily reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JR Central will spend as much as 110 billion yen on

operator will also invest 95 billion yen in expansion of its
N700 shinkansen series and to improve Tokaido Shinkansen line,
the Nikkei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 49 billion yen will be spent on magnetic-levitation
operations, including extending the Yamanashi test line, the
Nikkei added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite falling revenue from its Shinkansen bullet train
business, the railway operator is spending 10 percent more this
fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nikkei said group capital spending, including the real
estate and rolling stock manufacturing businesses, will be
hiked 3 percent to 328 billion yen, the second-highest figure
to date.

&lt;p&gt;March 26 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities raised shares
of Urban Outfitters (URBN.O) and Coach Inc (COH.N) to
"overweight," citing growth opportunities at the companies,
sending Urban shares up 5 percent to their highest ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also upped Ann Taylor Stores Corp (ANN.N) a

it took up last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann Taylor shares touched $21.07, their highest in a year,
while Coach shares rose to $40.60, their highest in more than
two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Urban Outfitters, which sells apparel and home decor, and
Coach, known for its handbags other accessories, will benefit
from better margins and square footage growth, JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Urban has many of the attributes that growth investors in
our space look for: differentiated portfolio of brands,
double-digit square footage growth, and opportunity for
operating margins to expand," JP Morgan analysts said in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also said comparable quarter-to-date trends at Coach
have accelerated closer to being up 4 to 5 percent, and the
company's full-price stores could post their first positive
comparable sales since the first quarter of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the analysts downgraded shares of Buckle Inc

likely to underperform that of peers, turnaround efforts at
Coldwater is taking longer than expected, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coldwater has lagged behind rivals Chico's FAS Inc (CHS.N)
and Anntaylor Stores Corp (ANN.N) as they try to revamp their
businesses, with some analysts pegging the problem on
average-looking merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also downgraded off-price retailer Ross

&lt;p&gt;Latin GRAMMY-Winning Sensation David Bisbal and African Artist K`NAAN to
Conclude Houston Festivities


Coca-Cola Invites Consumers to Join the Global Celebration of the FIFA World Cup


HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
He cuts right. He cuts left. He kicks&#8230;He scores&#8230;Goooal! 

If you love soccer, but you can`t wait for the 2010 FIFA World Cup tournament
and you want to see the world`s most coveted trophy, you`re in luck. The FIFA
World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola is coming to Houston, TX on May 1-2, 2010.
The event is open to the public and admission is free when you bring any empty
Coca-Cola can. 

This press release has an accompanying Smart Marketing Page providing further
details about the organization, products and services introduced below. You can
access the Smart Marketing Page via the following link:
http://www.businesswire.com/smp/FIFAWorldCupTrophyTourbyCoca-Cola/. 

Additionally, to celebrate Houston as the final stop on the FIFA World Cup
Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola, a specially designed can has been created to help
promote and honor the trophy`s arrival. The limited-edition, FIFA World Cup
Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola can will be available throughout Texas during March and
April, while supplies last. 

"We want to invite all consumers to celebrate the thrill and passion of soccer
with an ice cold Coca-Cola," said Reinaldo Padua, assistant vice president,
Hispanic Marketing, Coca-Cola North America. "Houston is a unique city that is
home to a multitude of people with diverse backgrounds, nationalities, cultures
and languages. It`s a natural fit for the world`s most beloved beverage brand to
celebrate the world`s biggest sporting event by bringing the authentic FIFA
World Cup Trophy to its passionate fans." 

The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola is scheduled to arrive in Houston on
May 1 for a two-day visit. The Houston stop will feature a weekend filled with
activities, including a fabulous outdoor festival on May 2 at the University of
Houston, where the FIFA World Cup spirit will come to life. For admission to the
May 2 festival, fans must bring any Coca-Cola can, which may include the
collectible Trophy Tour can, or go online to www.mycokerewards.com/celebration
to print a free ticket. 

"Since the University of Houston has such a large international student body -
and we host a professional soccer team in our stadium - we are very excited to
be the last stop of the FIFA Trophy Tour," said Renu Khator, president of the
University of Houston. 

The festivities will commemorate the final stop of the FIFA World Cup Trophy
Tour by Coca-Cola through a series of exhibits and fun activities that allow
soccer fans to express their love of the sport. To showcase the rich history and
culture of South Africa, Coca-Cola has partnered with the South African Tourism
Board to bring to life the energy and culture of the first African country to
host an event of this magnitude. The festival will kick-off with a Celebration
Parade, festive dances and the introduction of Zakumi, the official 2010 FIFA
World Cup mascot. 

At the all-day event fans can enjoy an exclusive 3-D FIFA World Cup movie, ball
juggling acts and a Celebration Booth. They also will have an opportunity to
play EA SPORTS 2010 FIFA World Cup. The main event will be the FIFA Trophy
Viewing Experience, where fans will have the opportunity of a lifetime to have a
souvenir photo taken of themselves with the original FIFA World Cup Trophy. 

To top it off, Latin Grammy-winning international pop sensation David Bisbal
will perform at the event, as well as African artist K`NAAN, whose recording of
`Wavin` Flag is Coca-Cola`s official "celebration mix" and the anthem of the
brand`s FIFA World Cup marketing campaign. The Company also recently released
the official video and remix of K`NAAN`s `Wavin` Flag sound track featuring
David Bisbal. Other recording artists who will perform during the festivities
include Ana Isabelle, the winner of Univision`s &#161;Viva el Sue&#241;o!. 

"Like all soccer fans, I can`t wait for the action to begin in the 2010 FIFA
World Cup and I understand what the Trophy represents. This event is the
culmination of a worldwide phenomenon and it`s exciting to be part of the
conclusion of the Trophy`s incredible journey," said David Bisbal. 

In addition, Coca-Cola is partnering with Adidas to host a series of soccer
clinics with professional soccer players throughout the day. These soccer
clinics are part of Coca-Cola`s `Live Positively` philosophy of making positive
contributions to communities around the world. 

"`Live Positively` is ingrained in everything we do, from our global partnership
with FIFA to the communities that we serve," said Padua. "As part of this
commitment, we want to encourage fans to be physically active and lead healthy
lifestyles." 

Beyond The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour

&lt;p&gt;SIRTE, Libya (Reuters) - Libya lifted a visa ban on citizens of 25 European countries on Saturday after EU president Spain said a Swiss-instigated visa blacklist against 188 Libyans in those countries had been scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end to the visa ban and the Schengen zone blacklist will likely defuse a crisis that has threatened to damage growing business ties between Europe and oil exporter Libya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the interests of strengthening its cooperation with the European Union, Libya lifts the restrictions it earlier imposed on the citizens of the Schengen zone," Libya's Foreign Ministry said in a communique carried by JANA, the state news agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain's foreign ministry had earlier issued a statement announcing the visa blacklist had been torn up and expressed regret as part of a diplomatic drive by EU leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Libya expresses its appreciation at the European Union for this move," JANA quoted the Foreign Ministry statement as saying. "This is a defeat for Switzerland by means of collective European action. Libya accepts the EU decision..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya stopped issuing visas to citizens from the Schengen borderless travel zone in retaliation for Switzerland, a Schengen member, barring entry to 188 Libyan citizens including the country's leader Muammar Gaddafi and members of his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss move prevented the blacklisted Libyans from entering any of the other Schengen states because the terms of the Schengen agreement obligate all members to refuse visas to citizens of countries blacklisted by fellow Schengen nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Schengen area is a borderless travel zone grouping 22 EU nations plus Switzerland, Norway and Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GENEVA ARREST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spanish statement was issued after Spain's Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos arrived for talks in the Libyan town of Sirte, where Gaddafi is this weekend hosting a summit of the Arab League.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the names of the Libyan citizens included in the list of the Schengen information system have been removed," the ministry said in a statement which it said came from Spain's EU presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We regret and deplore the trouble and inconvenience caused to those Libyan citizens. We hope that this move will not be repeated in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi -- whose country has some of Europe's closest business ties to Libya and who has criticized the Swiss visa blacklist -- was also in Sirte on Saturday as Gaddafi's guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland has been locked in a diplomatic dispute with oil exporter Libya since July 2008, when police in Geneva arrested Hannibal Gaddafi, a son of the Libyan leader, on charges of mistreating two domestic employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February Gaddafi urged jihad against Switzerland and earlier this month Libya slapped a trade embargo against Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charges were swiftly dropped and Hannibal Gaddafi was released, but Libya stopped oil exports to Switzerland and withdrew millions of dollars from Swiss banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss government is pushing for the release from prison of Max Goeldi, a Swiss businessman who was barred from leaving Libya soon after Hannibal Gaddafi's arrest. He is serving a four-month sentence for breaking immigration rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libyan officials deny any connection between Goeldi's prosecution and Hannibal Gaddafi's arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Libyan official, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters on Friday that Goeldi would be freed "very soon." Goeldi's lawyer said if his client was to be released early it would happen after the summit ends on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tracy Rucinski in Madrid; Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Paul Casciato)&lt;/p&gt;

zone and said the blacklist had now been scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "All the names of the Libyan citizens included in the list
of the Schengen information system have been removed," the
ministry said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The visa row has unsettled European countries with
substantial business ties to oil exporter Libya, especially its
near-neighbours Italy and Malta.

&lt;p&gt; * FDIC has reversed stand on payout -WSJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Regulator still to sign off on WaMu reorg plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp is not yet on board with Washington Mutual Inc's
WAMUQ.PK bankruptcy reorganization plan, including a massive
tax refund to JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), according to the
company and a Wall Street Journal report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan stands to get a $1.4 billion tax benefit following
its 2008 acquisition of Washington Mutual's banking subsidiary,
but the FDIC has reversed its stand on supporting such a
payout, the Journal reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual, which is tied to the biggest bank
failure in U.S. history, said on March 12 it had agreed to
split two potential tax refunds worth a combined $5.6 billion
with JPMorgan and the FDIC. [ID:nN12152501]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A U.S. law that created the tax refund, however,
specifically forbids companies that received bailout funds,
which includes JPMorgan, from receiving such a payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tentative deal among JPMorgan, the FDIC and Washington
Mutual also would end their various legal fights over claims to
disputed bank deposits. The agreement was to be finalized and
included in the reorganization plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, late on Friday Washington Mutual said it filed a
plan of reorganization with the Delaware bankruptcy court that
implements the terms of the settlement agreement but does not
have everyone on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual said the FDIC had not agreed to all of
the provisions of the draft settlement agreement. It added that
discussions were ongoing among the parties and they were
hopeful that such agreement will be obtained in the near
future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An FDIC spokesman said the regulator was working with all
parties involved to reach agreement with respect to all terms
of the proposed settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The plan, disclosure statement, and settlement agreement
that were filed on Friday do not reflect the continuing
discussions among the parties," the FDIC said in an e-mailed
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan spokesman was not immediately available for
comment on Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seattle-based Washington Mutual filed for bankruptcy in
September 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual's jittery depositors yanked nearly 10
percent of the bank's $188 billion in deposits in a matter of
days, prompting regulators to seize the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After it was seized, the FDIC sold the bank to JPMorgan for
$1.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual also said on Friday that the
reorganization plan would see it distribute more than $7
billion to creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan also calls for the reorganized company to
undertake a rights offering, under which certain creditors will
receive a right to buy newly issued shares of the reorganized
company. The reorganized company will have interest in WMI
Investment Corp and WM Mortgage Reinsurance Co, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will cancel its current preferred and common shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is In re Washington Mutual Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington), No. 08-12229.

&lt;p&gt;Jason Geoscience Workbench 8.2 now supported on Windows 7, Windows Vista, and
Windows XP in addition to Linux 
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia--(Business Wire)--
PGCE Conference 

Fugro-Jason today announced Jason Geoscience Workbench 8.2, the latest version
of its flagship product Jason Geoscience Workbench (JGW). For the first time,
all Fugro-Jason products will be available for all current Microsoft Windows
operating environments. JGW 8.2 integrates geological, geophysical,
petrophysical and rock physics information into a single consistent model of the
earth. Fugro-Jason is a leader in reservoir characterization technology for the
oil and gas industry. 

"JGW 8.2 represents a strategic technology move on our part to expand the
platform options for our clients," said Brad Woods, Fugro-Jason General Manager
of Application Engineering. "Our development team leveraged the leading edge
tools available in the Microsoft platform to deliver a high performance
alternative to our well-regarded Linux version. In addition, clients can now use
all Fugro-Jason products in a single Windows-based operating environment if they
so choose." 

JGW is a seismic to simulation suite of applications that together enable users
to build a single consistent model of the earth that can be used to locate
hydrocarbons and drive drilling and production programs. With JGW, seismic, well
log and statistical data can be directly input and used to calculate a geologic
model or series of models. JGW 8.2 includes 3D seismic inversion, wavelet
estimation, geostatistical inversion, AVA simultaneous inversion, rock physics,
petrophysics, reservoir modeling and advanced analysis and 3D visualization. 

This version also introduces the Multi-Attribute Well Interpolator (MAWI)
application, which provides a new and better method for building low frequency
geologic models driven by seismic attributes. MAWI is a new JGW application that
makes it easier to make accurate low frequency models of JGW inversions.
Available as an add-on module, MAWI is used by petrophysicists and geologists as
part of the overall reservoir characterization workflow. 

"Fugro-Jason has always placed a heavy emphasis on research and development,
adding new capabilities and supporting new software architectures that will
bring more value to our clients," said Eric Adams, Fugro-Jason Managing
Director. "With JGW 8.2 we extend the platform options for our clients, provide
a unified platform for those that desire it, and add important new modeling
functionality." 

JGW 8.2 will be released to clients in July of 2010.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today announced it will issue an emergency security update for Internet Explorer (IE) tomorrow to patch a zero-day vulnerability that has been used to launch drive-by attacks for at least several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's update will be the second out-of-band update -- Microsoft's term for one outside its normal once-each-month Patch Tuesday -- in the last three months. Microsoft last shipped a rush IE update to customers in late January, to fix eight flaws, including one that had been used to attack several companies' networks , including Google's and Adobe's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bulletin is being released to address attacks against customers of Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7," said Microsoft in an updated advisory .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it did in January, Tuesday's out-of-band update will patch more than just the zero-day. It will, in fact, plug critical holes in every edition of IE, including the newest, IE8. "The out-of-band security bulletin is a cumulative security update for Internet Explorer and will also contain fixes for privately reported vulnerabilities rated Critical on all versions of Internet Explorer that are not related to this attack," said Microsoft today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft first warned users of the vulnerability in IE6 and IE7 on March 9, saying at the time that the bug didn't affect the browser's oldest and newest editions, IE 5.01 and IE8, respectively. At the time, Microsoft called the attacks "targeted," a term it uses to describe small-scale exploitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within two days, hackers were spotted using the vulnerability to conduct drive-by attacks from malicious sites, and an Israeli researcher had published exploit code on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's announcement caught researchers by surprise. "I thought it would take longer than this," said Wolfgang Kandek, the chief technology officer of security vendor Qualys. "The fact that it's coming out now tells me that Microsoft is seeing a real reason to patch before the next [Patch Tuesday]. They accelerated this update for a reason, so I think that they've seen the attacks increasing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, agreed. "I wasn't necessarily expecting it. It's been less than a month since Microsoft issued its advisory," he said. "But they wouldn't move the timeline unless there was a good reason."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Kandek, Storms assumed that Microsoft pushed up the release of its cumulative IE update because it has seen an increase in attacks exploiting the zero-day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may patch two other outstanding vulnerabilities in IE, Storms added, ticking off a pair of security advisories the company has issued this year. In February, Microsoft warned of a bug in IE running on Windows XP that could be used by hackers to access files on the PC; earlier this month, Microsoft told Windows XP users not to press the F1 key when prompted by a Web site, citing an unpatched vulnerability that attackers could exploit to hijack PCs running the browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow's update for IE will apply to all versions of the browser -- IE 5.01, IE6, IE7 and IE8 -- and affect all supported editions of Windows, including Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Server 2003, Server 2008, Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it follows it's usual timetable, Microsoft will issue the update sometime after 1 p.m. ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010: The Next Generation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten Things You Need to Know About SharePoint Server 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's SharePoint Server is one of those wildly popular products that defies categorization. It's not easy to pin down because SharePoint focuses on six diverse areas: collaboration, portal, search, enterprise content management, business process management and business intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010: Five New and Improved Features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not need all the features SharePoint 2010 has to offer, but advances in areas such as social media, offline access and better CRM and ERP integration make it worth a look. Here's a rundown of what's new and/or improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Look: Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Beta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This major upgrade to Microsoft's Web site, intranet, and collaboration platform offers wealth of improvements for end-users, IT professionals, and developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010: A Guide to the Many Versions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In true Microsoft fashion, Redmond will have a whole bunch of versions of SharePoint 2010. Eight so far have been revealed. Here's a breakdown of what each version will include.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Adoption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft SharePoint: Enterprises Get Boost by Integrating Social Tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More enterprises are seeing the benefits of layering social networking tools into SharePoint. How can you customize SharePoint and make it more social? Two large organizations share tales from the trenches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft SharePoint: Three Tips for Making It Behave&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Sharepoint 2010 debuts in a few months -- but many enterprises still haven't made the most of their current SharePoint implementations. Consider this advice to get a grip on this complex software and the forthcoming upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to Build a Business Case For SharePoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A business case for SharePoint should clearly articulate the hard ROI, soft ROI, and the risks that the system will mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010 Overkill for Some, Forrester Says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's SharePoint 2010 server is growing up, but may include too many capabilities for those users seeking to meet isolated or specific requirements, according to a study by Forrester Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2007 Demystified: How to Cash in on Collaboration Tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of Microsoft's collaboration tools lacked management prowess. SharePoint 2007 fixes that problem and packs in a sometimes confusing array of features from workflow to search. Here's how smart IT leaders are making this often-misunderstood product work for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint in the Cloud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Productivity Tools in the Cloud: Real World Best Practices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving applications to a cloud service is a disruption to any business, but in Ron Markezich's experience as Microsoft's VP of Online Services, a well executed cloud migration can redefine a company. Here are three best practices he's gleaned from Microsoft's largest BPOS customers, including Coca-Cola and GlaxoSmithKline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010: More Cloud-Friendly than Past Versions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint's many moving pieces have not traditionally fit neatly into the cloud. But SharePoint 2010 addresses that problem -- with three key changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QA: Inside Microsoft's Cloud Model for Productivity Apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate VP of Microsoft Online Services Ron Markezich discusses the joys and pitfalls of productivity apps in the cloud, how to mix your own data center with Microsoft's cloud model, and the rising tide of BPOS competitors. Hint: It's not just Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hosted E-mail's a Hit, But How Far Will Microsoft Go with Cloud?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft won't even use the term software-as-a-service: they say "software plus services." But the king of on-premise software and its customers are taking the plunge into hosted e-mail, with some early successes. As for how far into the cloud Microsoft will crawl with SharePoint, Office and other apps, that's still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to Determine the True Cost of Microsoft SharePoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list of the many costs involved in implementing and supporting Microsoft SharePoint, including ones you might never have expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to Build a Business Case For SharePoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A business case for SharePoint should clearly articulate the hard ROI, soft ROI, and the risks that the system will mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Targets Google Apps, Cuts Exchange, SharePoint Online Prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has cut in half its per user per month list price for Exchange Online services and cut by 33 percent the price of its Business Productivity Online Services suite of online productivity applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Competition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint: Is Microsoft's Biggest Recent Success At Risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, the user base of the collaboration tool is growing, but it might be shelfware whose hold on the enterprise could be threatened by easier-to-use offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft SharePoint: Three Sleek Social Networking Alternatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft SharePoint 2010 promises more enterprise social networking tools, but if you're still questioning the cost and complexity, here's a look at some lean and mean alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle's Beehive Takes Aim At Microsoft's Sharepoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle announced enhancements to its Beehive collaboration software as well as steep price cuts as it targets long-established offerings from Microsoft and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Sharepoint vs. Enterprise 2.0 Start-ups: Day of Reckoning Arrives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several years, Microsoft's SharePoint collaboration software has looked dysfunctional and pricey compared to innovative packages from start-ups. But in a new version en route, Microsoft has improved on some gripes, particularly its social software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Mar 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Cypress (www.cypressconsulting.net), a Seattle-based business consulting,
technology and creative services firm, today announced the debut of its
newly developed Major League Soccer (MLS) mobile application for
Microsoft's Windows (R) Phone 7 Series. The MLS application is a
rich-media mobile application specially designed for Microsoft's next
generation mobile platform and features real-time game scores and stats,
league standings, player stats, and video clips, as well as an advanced
notification system that enables users to receive scheduled alerts even
when the application is not running.

    "We've announced a number of new and exciting details about developing
for Windows Phone 7 Series, and as a result we have seen some great new
applications like Cypress' MLS application," said Charlie Kindel, partner
group program manager for the Windows Phone 7 Developer Experience
Microsoft. "Innovative applications like this one provide people with a
great experience and access to information that matters most to them."

    The Cypress MLS application offers fans a detailed 'push' notification
system that showcases four options for receiving updates when the
application is off. These include notifications for 'when my club
scores,' 'when my club wins,' 'when the match is complete,' and 'my club
news updates.' Once the notifications are set, the application is closed
and only triggered to report back to the user if a notification is
available. The application is also configured to provide a high level
summary in portrait mode, and upon switching to a horizontal orientation,
render a wider page with additional game details as well as information
on other games, links to stats and video clips.

    "As a trusted Microsoft resource, the opportunity to be part of the
Windows Phone 7 Series launch is incredible," said Nate Thompson, CEO of
Cypress. "We leveraged our deep experience in Silverlight and developing
interactive sites and tools for a variety of sports businesses to create
a brand new experience for mobile users. Now Major League Soccer fans can
have the information they want at their fingertips, wherever they are,
and customized to their preference for when and what information they
receive."

    Most recently, Cypress was recognized for its development of the New
Orleans Saints Website, which hosted more than 4 million users on Super
Bowl Sunday. The company has also played an instrumental role in enabling
other sports and team management companies to leverage technology for
improving the fan experience, integrating interactivity into their
brands, and ultimately increasing bottom line revenue. The MLS mobile
application will ship with the new Windows Phone 7 Series later this year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Robert Moffat, a former senior executive of International Business Machines Corp whose phone conversations were recorded by the FBI in the Galleon hedge fund insider trading probe, pleaded guilty on Monday to securities fraud and conspiracy charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moffat, 53, was arrested and charged last October 16 along with principal defendants, Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam and former New Castle Funds LLC trader Danielle Chiesi, in what U.S. prosecutors have described as the biggest hedge fund insider trading case in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former IBM executive admitted to the charges regarding confidential information he gave to Chiesi during a plea proceeding in Manhattan federal court in New York before magistrate judge Frank Maas. He is the 11th defendant to plead guilty in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said he had access to inside information regarding IBM's licensing of a deal involving Advanced Micro Devices Inc that he passed on to Chiesi, a friend, in August 2008. In court he also referred to earnings information about Lenovo Group Ltd, while he was a nonvoting member of that company's board and details of IBM server sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr Moffat accepted responsibility today for his conduct in improperly disclosing confidential information to Danielle Chiesi," Moffat's lawyer Kerry Lawrence said in a statement. "It is also important to understand that he never engaged in any trading in connection with the transactions involving AMD, Lenovo or IBM, and received no money or other financial benefit from anyone relating to those transactions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat was the senior vice president of IBM's systems and technology group and once seen as a possible candidate for the IBM chief executive job. He was placed on leave on October 19 and is no longer with the company, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His guilty plea was expected to be formalized by U.S. District Judge Naomi Buchwald at a later date. Sentencing was scheduled for July 26 when Moffat will face up to 6 months in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence said there was no loss caused by Moffat, who did not sign a cooperation agreement with prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I provided to Ms Chiesi information that was confidential and not public," Moffat said during the plea proceeding, his voice trembling at times. "I also knew I owed a duty to my employer, IBM. I knew that it was wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 21 traders, lawyers or executives were arrested or charged last October 16 and November 5, some of them Rajaratnam's friends and business associates or former Galleon employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight defendants have signed cooperation agreements with federal prosecutors and may be called upon to testify at Rajaratnam and Chiesi's criminal trial, which was scheduled to start on October 25. Both have since asked the judge for separate trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said that, in August 2008, Chiesi and Moffat discussed a confidential business transaction that AMD was negotiating with investors from Abu Dhabi. IBM would be granting a license to an entity to be spun off by AMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of a phone call, according to the complaint, Chiesi asked about the timing of the deal involving AMD and Moffat replied, "six to eight weeks from my meeting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked the chances that the deal would fall through, Moffat replied, "Zero ... I see no way that it doesn't get done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are USA v Rajaratnam and Chiesi, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184 and USA v Robert Moffat, No 09-mj-02307.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool; additional reporting by Edith Honan and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM's former server chief, Robert Moffat, on Monday pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in a case connected to an insider-trading scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentencing in the case has been scheduled for July 26. The conspiracy charge carries a potential penalty of five years in prison, while the insider-trading charge has a maximum of 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat is the latest technology executive to plead guilty in a case involving illegal trades that generated millions of dollars in illicit profits. Ten others have already pleaded guilty in connection with the case, including Rajiv Goel, formerly Intel treasury's managing director of investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat entered a guilty plea in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Moffat was arrested and charged in October along with Goel and three Wall Street traders including Raj Rajaratnam, founder of Galleon Group and Danielle Chiesi, a portfolio manager at New York-based New Castle Funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chiesi and Rajaratnam allegedly tapped into a network of high-ranking corporate executives and insiders, including Moffat, to obtain confidential details about quarterly earnings and takeover activity of companies like Intel, Google, Sun Microsystems, Akamai Technologies, Sprint Nextel and Advanced Micro Devices, according to a court document filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in October. In the wake of the SEC investigation, the DOJ has taken over prosecution of the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat last week waived his right for grand-jury indictment, and the DOJ filed a notice of intent to bring criminal charges in the case. Ten others involved in the case have already pleaded guilty for their involvement in the alleged scam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat, formerly senior vice president of IBM's Systems and Technology Group, allegedly leaked insider information about IBM considering acquiring Sun to Chiesi. Chiesi allegedly made trades on behalf of New Castle Funds based on the tips and generated about US$1 million in illegal profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chiesi worked along with Rajaratnam, who raked in close to $25 million in illegal profits, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat was placed on a leave of absence shortly after he was arrested in October. His leave became permanent soon after, and it wasn't clear if he resigned or was fired by IBM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Dykstra drops lawsuit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Trustee, JPMorgan in agreement to allow home foreclosure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Lenny Dykstra has dropped
his $100 million predatory lending lawsuit against JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N), and the bank has reached an agreement with
a bankruptcy trustee to let it foreclose on the former baseball
center fielder's California mansion, court filings show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dykstra had alleged that Washington Mutual Inc, now owned
by JPMorgan, fraudulently induced him to borrow more than he
could afford to buy the $17.4 million Thousand Oaks home from
hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, only to renege on a promise to let
him refinance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement with JPMorgan calls for the bank to pay
$400,000 to Dykstra's estate and give up its interest in a
possible $500,000 insurance settlement claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In exchange, the trustee liquidating Dykstra's estate
agreed to let JPMorgan "proceed with its applicable remedies
under state law to foreclose" on the six-bedroom, eight-bath
home, and to pay the bank $92,000 from insurance proceeds to
clean up the trash-strewn property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The trustee and the lender believe that any litigation
concerning the loan and/or the property would likely be
time-consuming, factually complex and expensive," a lawyer for
the trustee Arturo Cisneros wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is owed at least $13 million on its home loan,
court records show. The home is up for sale for $14.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is unclear why Dykstra dropped the lawsuit after just
nine days. The dismissal was disclosed in a Friday filing in
Manhattan federal court. The JPMorgan agreement was disclosed
in a March 23 filing in a California bankruptcy court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined to comment. A New
York lawyer representing Dykstra did not immediately return a
request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisneros separately urged the California court to reject
Dykstra's bid to dismiss his Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, saying
"there is no evidence" that the debtor has the ability to repay
the $43.7 million owed creditors outside of bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trustee contended that Dykstra has failed to act "in
the best interest" of creditors, pointing to Dykstra's having
allegedly pawned World Series and All-Star rings and trophies
just before his bankruptcy for much less than their worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dykstra has alleged that Cisneros is "only interested in
dumping assets as quickly as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The former New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies player
retired from baseball in 1996 after a 12-year career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hearings on Dykstra's motion to dismiss his bankruptcy case
and on the JPMorgan agreement are set for April 6 and April 13,
respectively, California court records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bankruptcy case is: In re Lenny Kyle Dykstra, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California, No. 09-18409.
The JPMorgan case is Dykstra v. JPMorgan Chase  Co, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-02413.

&lt;p&gt; * 11th to plead guilty in broad insider-trading case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Much of the evidence gathered using wiretaps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Moffat did not trade on information -- lawyer
 (Adds Moffat quote from court hearing, lawyer statement,
details of case, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Grant McCool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Robert Moffat, a former
senior executive of International Business Machines Corp
(IBM.N) whose phone conversations were recorded by the FBI in
the Galleon hedge fund insider trading probe, pleaded guilty on
Monday to securities fraud and conspiracy charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moffat, 53, was arrested and charged last Oct. 16 along
with principal defendants, Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam and
former New Castle Funds LLC trader Danielle Chiesi, in what
U.S. prosecutors have described as the biggest hedge fund
insider trading case in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The former IBM executive admitted to the charges regarding
confidential information he gave to Chiesi during a plea
proceeding in Manhattan federal court in New York before
magistrate judge Frank Maas. He is the 11th defendant to plead
guilty in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prosecutors said he had access to inside information
regarding IBM's licencing of a deal involving Advanced Micro
Devices Inc (AMD.N) that he passed on to Chiesi, a friend, in
August 2008. In court he also referred to earnings information
about Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK), while he was a nonvoting member of that company's board and details of IBM server
sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mr Moffat accepted responsibility today for his conduct in
improperly disclosing confidential information to Danielle
Chiesi," Moffat's lawyer Kerry Lawrence said in a statement.
"It is also important to understand that he never engaged in
any trading in connection with the transactions involving AMD,
Lenovo or IBM, and received no money or other financial benefit
from anyone relating to those transactions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moffat was the senior vice president of IBM's systems and
technology group and once seen as a possible candidate for the
IBM chief executive job. He was placed on leave on Oct. 19 and
is no longer with the company, IBM said. [ID:nN3085727]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His guilty plea was expected to be formalized by U.S.
District Judge Naomi Buchwald at a later date. Sentencing was
scheduled for July 26 when Moffat will face up to 6 months in
prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawrence said there was no loss caused by Moffat, who did
not sign a cooperation agreement with prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I provided to Ms Chiesi information that was confidential
and not public," Moffat said during the plea proceeding, his
voice trembling at times. "I also knew I owed a duty to my
employer, IBM. I knew that it was wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 21 traders, lawyers or executives were arrested or
charged last Oct. 16 and Nov. 5, some of them Rajaratnam's
friends and business associates or former Galleon employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eight defendants have signed cooperation agreements with
federal prosecutors and may be called upon to testify at
Rajaratnam and Chiesi's criminal trial, which was scheduled to
start on Oct. 25. Both have since asked the judge for separate
trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prosecutors said that, in August 2008, Chiesi and Moffat
discussed a confidential business transaction that AMD was
negotiating with investors from Abu Dhabi. IBM would be
granting a license to an entity to be spun off by AMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toward the end of a phone call, according to the complaint,
Chiesi asked about the timing of the deal involving AMD and
Moffat replied, "six to eight weeks from my meeting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked the chances that the deal would fall through,
Moffat replied, "Zero ... I see no way that it doesn't get
done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cases are USA v Rajaratnam and Chiesi, U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184 and
USA v Robert Moffat, No 09-mj-02307.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola North America Executive Brian Kelley to Lead Integration Team
 Steering Committee Named
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today announced that Brian P. Kelley, currently president
and general manager, Still Beverages and Supply Chain, Coca-Cola North America,
has been appointed to lead the integration of The Coca-Cola Company`s and
Coca-Cola Enterprises` (CCE) North American operations. 

The two companies recently announced that they entered into definitive
agreements enabling The Coca-Cola Company to acquire CCE`s North American
bottling business, and for CCE to acquire The Coca-Cola Company`s bottling
operations in Norway and Sweden. In addition, CCE has the right to acquire The
Coca-Cola Company`s interest in its German bottler. 

The closing of the transactions is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of
this year and is subject to, among other things, regulatory and CCE shareholder
approvals. 

"Upon completion of our acquisition of CCE North America, we will create a North
American business system that will best serve the unique needs of our flagship
market and usher in a new era of winning for us and all of our partners," said
Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company. "To realize this goal, we
will need a disciplined, orderly and efficient approach to the integration and a
comprehensive plan that can be implemented immediately once the acquisition is
approved and closed." 

To lead this work, Mr. Kelley has been appointed president, North America
Business Integration (NABI). Over the next few months, Mr. Kelley and his team
will develop a detailed plan of action to effectively integrate four business
components in both the U.S. and Canada: (1) CCE North America; (2) CCNA
Foodservice; (3) the Minute-Maid/Odwalla Juice business; and (4) CCNA Supply
Chain Operations. 

Upon closing, the combined business in the U.S. will be called Coca-Cola
Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR). The combined business in Canada will be conducted
through its subsidiary, Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCRC). The
president and chief executive officer of CCR will be announced in the near
future and will report directly to Mr. Kent. 

In addition to planning for the post-closing creation of CCR, Mr. Kelley and his
team will also develop a plan for the appropriate reshaping of The Coca-Cola
Company`s remaining North America business components, primarily consisting of
Consumer Marketing plus Franchise Leadership for its independent bottlers. This
plan will be implemented after closing. 

Mr. Kelley will report to the North America Business Integration Team Steering
Committee, which will be chaired by Mr. Kent and include the following
executives:

* Steve Cahillane, president, CCE North America 
* Alex Cummings, chief administrative officer, The Coca-Cola Company 
* Sandy Douglas, president, Coca-Cola North America 
* Gary Fayard, chief financial officer, The Coca-Cola Company 
* Irial Finan, president, Bottling Investment Group, The Coca-Cola Company 
* Clyde Tuggle, senior vice president, Global Public Affairs and Communications,
The Coca-Cola Company

The Steering Committee will set overall direction, approve staffing of the NABI
team, monitor progress against targets and approve major decisions. 

Mr. Kelley will assemble immediately a full-time, dedicated integration team
consisting of executives of The Coca-Cola Company and CCE. These appointments
will be announced shortly. 

"An integration of this magnitude requires a very thoughtful, planned and
disciplined approach," said Mr. Kent. "Brian is the ideal leader for this work.
Over his 27-year career, he has consistently led and grown businesses, executed
large transactions, redefined corporate strategy and led large, winning
organizations. I have every confidence he and his team will drive a smooth and
seamless integration." 

Since 2007, Mr. Kelley has successfully led Coca-Cola North America`s $6 billion
Still Beverages business unit. He has also been responsible for the CCNA Supply
Chain, which includes 23 company-owned plants, 30 co-packer facilities and more
than 60 logistics warehouses.

&lt;p&gt;Just days after a pair of researchers outwitted major Windows 7 defenses to exploit Internet Explorer (IE) and Firefox, Microsoft said the measures aren't meant to "prevent every attack forever."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it defended the security measures, saying they remained an effective way to hinder exploits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete LePage, a product manager with IE's developer division, stood up for DEP (data execution) and ASLR (address space layout randomization), the security features that two hackers sidestepped to win $10,000 each at the high-profile Pwn2Own hacking contest last Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Defense in depth techniques aren't designed to prevent every attack forever, but to instead make it significantly harder to exploit a vulnerability ," LePage said, referring to DEP, ASLR and another feature specific to IE, called Protected Mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEP, which Microsoft introduced in 2004 with Windows XP SP2, is designed to prevent attack code from executing in memory not intended for code execution. ASLR, a feature that debuted with Windows Vista three years ago, randomly shuffles the positions of key memory areas, such as the stack, to make it more difficult for hackers to predict whether their attack code will run. Protected Mode, a sandbox-like technology in which IE runs with restricted rights, is designed to reduce the ability of attack code to "escape" from the browser to write, alter or delete data elsewhere on the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three anti-exploit features are also found in Windows 7, Microsoft's newest operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Vreugdenhil, a freelance vulnerability researcher from the Netherlands, and a German researcher who only goes by his first name of Nils, each bypassed Windows 7's DEP and ASLR when they successfully attacked IE8 and Firefox 3.6 , respectively, at the Pwn2Own hacking challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LePage's comments Friday were the first from Microsoft on the DEP and ASLR circumventions since Pwn2Own concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post to the Windows Security blog LePage used the analogy of a fire-proof safe, equating its ability to withstand fire and heat with Windows' security. "Without defense in depth techniques, a fire-proof safe may only protect its contents for an hour or two," LePage said. "A stronger fire-proof safe with several defense in depth features still won't guarantee the valuables forever, but adds significant time and protection to how long the contents will last."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has made the point before that DEP, ASLR and other defensive measures don't guarantee that Windows can withstand attack. Last summer, for example, Robert Hensing, an engineer in the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), said, "DEP by itself is generally not a robust mitigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the same post to Microsoft's Security Research  Defense blog , Hensing also said, "DEP and ASLR used together are very difficult to bypass."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's LePage said much the same last Friday. "Defense in depth features, including DEP and ASLR, continue to be highly effective protection mechanisms," he claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vreugdenhil, who exploited IE8 on Windows 7, didn't seem to think they were that difficult to elude. "It took me six or seven days to get everything to work," he said last week in an interview after his Pwn2Own victory. Although he didn't reveal the two exploits he used to bypass DEP and ASLR, then hack Microsoft's browser -- by the rules of the contest, he's not allowed to talk in detail until the flaws are fixed -- Vreugdenhil posted a paper ( download PDF ) where he explained how he evaded Windows 7's protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie Miller, another Pwn2Own winner who bypassed DEP and ASLR defenses in Apple 's Snow Leopard operating system to hack Safari last week, sided with Microsoft on the measures' anti-exploit skills. "It's more difficult [to exploit vulnerabilities] than it was before," Miller said. "Before, any of the 20 bugs I found would have been fine for winning," he continued, referring to his recent discovery of 20 vulnerabilities in Mac OS X, Safari, Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader. "But this year, it took a better bug, a best of breed bug. Now you really need a very special, well-behaved vulnerability [to win]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller is the only researcher to "three-peat" at Pwn2Own, having won prizes in 2008, 2009 and again this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason why it's more difficult now, Miller said, is because of DEP and ASLR, both of which Mac OS X also uses, though the latter is only partially implemented by Apple's operating system. But he also argued that their presence is a double-edged sword, and a dull one at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With ASLR, exploiting was supposed to be harder, but I still win [at Pwn2Own]," Miller said. "Then they added DEP and I still win. People don't think we need to find bugs now that there's mitigation. But that's not the case. [DEP and ASLR] are just one piece to security, and they don't work as well as people think they will."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, earlier this month, a Google engineer and a former Microsoft security engineer, posted proof-of-concept code for bypassing DEP. At the time, a Microsoft spokesman declined to commit to a revamping of the security feature, instead asserting that any skirting of DEP could not compromise a computer by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers were confident that the code's publication meant DEP circumvention would increase. "This can be used to further enhance exploits, and I expect that we'll start seeing it being used within exploits fairly soon," said David Sancho, a senior threat researcher at Trend Micro, in an interview four weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even as security improves, researchers end up winning," Miller said. "We're obviously in better shape [in terms of security], but it's still true that you can't feel totally confident in a full-patched computer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp is not yet on board with Washington Mutual Inc's bankruptcy reorganization plan, including a massive tax refund to JPMorgan Chase  Co, according to the company and a Wall Street Journal report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan stands to get a $1.4 billion tax benefit following its 2008 acquisition of Washington Mutual's banking subsidiary, but the FDIC has reversed its stand on supporting such a payout, the Journal reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual, which is tied to the biggest bank failure in U.S. history, said on March 12 it had agreed to split two potential tax refunds worth a combined $5.6 billion with JPMorgan and the FDIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. law that created the tax refund, however, specifically forbids companies that received bailout funds, which includes JPMorgan, from receiving such a payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tentative deal among JPMorgan, the FDIC and Washington Mutual also would end their various legal fights over claims to disputed bank deposits. The agreement was to be finalized and included in the reorganization plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, late on Friday Washington Mutual said it filed a plan of reorganization with the Delaware bankruptcy court that implements the terms of the settlement agreement but does not have everyone on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual said the FDIC had not agreed to all of the provisions of the draft settlement agreement. It added that discussions were ongoing among the parties and they were hopeful that such agreement will be obtained in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An FDIC spokesman said the regulator was working with all parties involved to reach agreement with respect to all terms of the proposed settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The plan, disclosure statement, and settlement agreement that were filed on Friday do not reflect the continuing discussions among the parties," the FDIC said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman was not immediately available for comment on Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle-based Washington Mutual filed for bankruptcy in September 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual's jittery depositors yanked nearly 10 percent of the bank's $188 billion in deposits in a matter of days, prompting regulators to seize the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After it was seized, the FDIC sold the bank to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual also said on Friday that the reorganization plan would see it distribute more than $7 billion to creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan also calls for the reorganized company to undertake a rights offering, under which certain creditors will receive a right to buy newly issued shares of the reorganized company. The reorganized company will have interest in WMI Investment Corp and WM Mortgage Reinsurance Co, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will cancel its current preferred and common shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Washington Mutual Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington), No. 08-12229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal in New York, Tom Hals in Wilmington, Del., and Karey Wutkowski in Washington; Editing by Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

site for moms*) to launch, in the spring, a new destination for women that will
be innovative and empowering and provide, with humor, insight and vulnerability,

Teri Hatcher

Teri Hatcher has delivered memorable performances in movies, television and on
stage, since 1990. Having starred as Lois in the ABC series "Lois and Clark,"
Teri often finds herself a role model to young women in journalism and carries a
Superman fan base that is nothing short of global. Her first movie role in
Christopher Guest`s "The Big Picture" remains one of her career highlights along
with movie roles in "Soapdish," "Spy Kids," "Tomorrow Never Dies" and most
recently, when Teri voiced ALL THREE mothers in Henry Selick`s Oscar-nominated
animated film "Coraline." 

Her fearless desire to challenge herself and experience the world led her to
star as Sally Bowles in the Sam Mendes directed touring company of "Caberet" in
1999, receiving critical acclaim and standing ovations from Los Angeles to
Boston. Her comedic expertise was wildly noted when she hosted SNL in 1995,
landing at least 2 of her sketches in the Best of SNL highlights series. In 2005
she was awarded a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award for Best Actress
in a Comedy for her legendary portrayal of Susan Mayer on "Desperate
Housewives." 

In 2006 she wrote her first book, a funny and inspirational look at a woman
finding balance between family, career and self, titled "Burnt Toast and Other
Philosophies of Life." It remained on the New York Times best seller list for 4
weeks. Teri currently is in the 6th season of filming "Desperate Housewives,"
which she still has fun at every day. She has been writing and blogging articles
for Glamour UK magazine, Newsweek and Modernmom.com. She is raising her
twelve-year-old daughter, who is still her highest priority, and 7 rescued
animals, participating in triathlons and charitable fundraisers, and with the
left over minutes, looking for love. She has traveled to 5 of the 7 continents,
both for personal and philanthropic ventures, and looks forward to conquering
the other 2 soon.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is readying an aggressive push into cloud-based productivity applications with the upcoming release of Office Web Apps and other products, but the company is moving more cautiously when it comes to creating mobile versions of these products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office Web Apps is part of Office 2010, which is scheduled for release to corporate customers on May 12, with general availability expected sometime in June. The online productivity suite includes free, Web-based versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and Microsoft hopes the release will counter inroads into the productivity market made by Google and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to be the leaders. We have to be the ones who make the tough decisions, drive the disruption and lead the industry in what we're doing," said Stephen Elop, the president of Microsoft's Business Division, during an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Microsoft is still a follower when it comes to online productivity applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2009 survey by market research firm IDC found growing usage of Google Docs with 20 percent of respondents saying that Google Docs was widely used within their organizations. By comparison, a similar survey done in 2007 found that Google Docs was widely used by 6 percent of organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But coming late to the market with its own online productivity suite hasn't hurt Microsoft. The same 2009 IDC survey that found rising usage of Google Docs among companies also showed there was no negative effect on the market share of Office, suggesting the Web-based applications may be acting as complements, rather than substitutes, for client productivity suites -- at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of Web-based productivity applications could change over time as companies become more comfortable with them, eventually turning to them into replacements for desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop described the impact of cloud computing -- a catch-all term that describes hosted computing services offered over the Internet -- on the corporate IT market as an example of "constructive disruption," and said Microsoft has to walk a fine line when it rethinks how applications are deployed and used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I think about those moves, I have to do so in a way that brings along for the ride 500 million customers of Microsoft Office, for example. That's how many people are out there using that product on a daily basis or with some degree of frequency," Elop said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large installed base of users makes Office a critical source of revenue for Microsoft. During 2009, Office sales exceeded US$17 billion, representing nearly 30 percent of the company's overall revenue. As a result, Microsoft wants to be sure that new versions of Office that can be accessed online or using mobile phones enhance, and don't jeopardize, this business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The quality of the experience has to be unquestionably consistent with, as good as, and aligned with everything that people already know," Elop said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft's vision for how productivity applications evolve, users will edit and move documents between their personal computers, the Internet and mobile devices, without losing any of the formatting or structure of the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We talk about the best productivity experiences being those that are a combination of the PC, the phone, and the browser," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile versions of Office will be available for Windows Phone handsets, due later this year, as well as for Nokia smartphones running Symbian, and eventually MeeGo, Elop said, predicting that 200 million to 300 million Nokia handsets will be shipped with a mobile version of Office installed in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft has no immediate plans to offer mobile versions of Office for Research In Motion's BlackBerry handsets or Apple's iPhone. "We think hard about which scenarios need to be enabled on what devices, and at what point in time, because we have limited resources," Elop said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll consider other environments as we proceed, but there's no ambiguity that there's a requirement to consider each of these different platforms as our customers guide us," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Mar 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the IT performance company, announced
today the company is expanding its position within the Microsoft(TM)
Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP) by obtaining validation
of its Riverbed(R) Steelhead(R) appliance to run Windows Server 2008
R2(TM). Riverbed is the first WAN optimization vendor to obtain SVVP
validation for Windows Server 2008 R2. With the combination of Windows
Server 2008 R2 infrastructure services and the Riverbed Steelhead
appliances, mutual customers can simplify their branch office
infrastructure, while at the same time ensuring application performance
for end users. 

    SVVP is open to any vendor that delivers a machine virtualization
solution that hosts Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows
Server 2003 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and subsequent service packs. Riverbed
customers are already running Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Windows
Server 2008 and branch services such as Active Directory, DNS/DHCP, Media
Streaming and Print Services on the Riverbed Services Platform (RSP), a
virtualized partition within the Steelhead appliance. As the next step in
its strategic partnership with Microsoft, Riverbed announces today it
will also support Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 on the RSP.

    "Our two companies have worked to ensure the growth of our partnership.
The expansion of our relationship -- to include the SVVP validation --
seems only natural as enterprises look to take advantage of our next
generation platforms, but at the same time need to ensure performance
while consolidating costs and infrastructure," said Eric Jewett, director
of server marketing at Microsoft. "Riverbed is working closely with
Microsoft to ensure that our joint efforts are focused on providing
enterprises with solutions that accelerate the performance of Microsoft
environments." 

    Riverbed offers the option to have Windows Server 2008 R2 operating
system pre-installed on the RSP, allowing customers to leverage this
platform to run Windows server. In addition, Riverbed is promoting
awareness of the integrated solution among its channel resellers and
customers through its partnership with Microsoft. 

    "As our customers begin to bring IT consolidation initiatives to
fruition, branch services are an obvious starting point. Many of our
customers are Windows Server users and we anticipate they will migrate to
Windows Server 2008 R2," said Eric Wolford, senior vice president of
marketing and business development at Riverbed. "Our customer base, which
is over 7,000 enterprises and government agencies, is finding that WAN
optimization is a key component to ensure performance of their
consolidated infrastructures. By leveraging our WAN optimization solution
these enterprises are getting the best of both worlds -- further
consolidation and increased performance."

&lt;p&gt;BeyondTrust Analysis of 15 Months of Microsoft Security Bulletins Finds the Vast
Majority of Vulnerabilities can be Diminished by Configuring End Users as
Standard Users
AGOURA HILLS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
BeyondTrust, the leading provider of Privileged Access Lifecycle Management
solutions, today published research findings that found the removal of
administrator rights from Windows users is a mitigating factor for 90% of
Critical Windows 7 Vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate that as companies
migrate to Windows 7 they`ll need to implement a desktop Privileged Identity
Management solution, to reduce the risks from un-patched Microsoft
vulnerabilities without inhibiting their users` ability to operate effectively. 

Key findings from this report show that removing administrator rights will
better protect companies against the exploitation of:

* 90% of critical Windows 7 vulnerabilities reported to date 
* 100% of Microsoft Office vulnerabilities reported in 2009 
* 94% of Internet Explorer and 100% of Internet Explorer 8 vulnerabilities
reported in 2009 
* 64% of all Microsoft vulnerabilities reported in 2009

"Enterprises continue to face imminent danger from zero-day attacks as new
vulnerabilities are exploited before patches can ever be developed and
deployed," said Steve Kelley, EVP of corporate development. "Our findings
reflect the critical role that restricting administrator rights, plays in
protecting against these types of threats. As companies migrate to Windows 7
they need to be aware that despite enhanced security features on the new
operating systems, better controls for administrative rights are still needed to
provide adequate protection." 

BeyondTrust`s new report examines all of the published Microsoft vulnerabilities
in 2009 and all of the published Windows 7 vulnerabilities to date to quantify
the effectiveness of removing administrator rights for mitigating Microsoft
vulnerabilities. The report shows that the vast majority of vulnerabilities
share the same best practice advice in the "Mitigating Factors" portion of
Microsoft`s security bulletins: "Users whose accounts are configured to have
fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate
with administrative user rights." Complete findings and methodology can be found
online in the report.

About BeyondTrust Privilege Manager

BeyondTrust Privilege Manager, initially released in 2004, is the first desktop
Privileged Identity Management solution for Windows. Privilege Manager allows
end-users to run all required applications, processes and ActiveX controls
without administrative privileges. Privilege Manager allows network
administrators to attach permission levels to Windows applications to enforce
enterprise security policy while still enabling users to perform approved
activities. By removing the need to grant administrative rights to end-users, IT
departments eliminate what is otherwise the Achilles heel of the desktop -
end-users with administrative power that can be exploited by malware and
malicious intent to change security settings and disable other security
solutions. Privilege Manager is easy to implement. It plugs directly into Group
Policy, the existing Windows security infrastructure. It is transparent to the
end-user, without pop-ups or dialogue boxes, and supports Windows 2000, XP,
Server 2003, Server 2008, Vista and Windows 7.

&lt;p&gt;So far 2010 hasn't been kind to the Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser. It is only March, and Microsoft is releasing the second emergency out-of-band patch to respond to a zero-day exploit in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released security bulletin MS10-018 today--an update rated as Critical which includes 10 patches affecting all versions of Internet Explorer, including the current zero-day exploit being used to attack IE6 and IE7 browsers. Exploit code for the IE zero-day, dubbed "iepeers", is circulating on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualys CTO Wolfgang Kandek wrote a blog post stating "Microsoft's decision to accelerate the release rather than waiting until next Patch Tuesday on April 13th is an indication that attacks against the "iepeers" vulnerability are on the rise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Storms, Director of Security Operations for nCircle, stresses "Microsoft has a strong commitment to their regular monthly patch cycle, so issuing this patch clearly shows the elevated threat levels related to this zero-day bug. Users that are slow to patch risk remote code execution attacks that can take over a computer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Symantec has also observed a recent spike in attempted infections via this security hole. The typical attempted infection process seems to involve compromising a legitimate Web site, then inserting an iframe which redirects users to a malicious site," explains Joshua Talbot, security intelligence manager, Symantec Security Response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nCircle's Storms declares "All users should install this new patch immediately, and if you haven't already upgraded to IE8, now is a very good time to seriously consider it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kandek concurs with that assessment, stating "All users of Internet Explorer 6 and 7 should patch immediately, as the exploit for these versions in known and becoming more popular."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that IE8 is not affected by the zero-day exploit that drove the urgency for this out-of-band update. However, the security bulletin addresses a range of Internet Explorer flaws, including two other critical vulnerabilities that do affect Internet Explorer 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kandek cautions "IT Admins will have to decide whether they can take the risk of patching IE8 only during next Patch Tuesday--two weeks out--or whether to patch sooner and incur the cost of having two separate patch days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft responded with unusual expediency to this zero-day exploit, leading many to question how Microsoft was able to develop a patch so quickly. The answer, according to Storms, is "the bug was responsibly disclosed to them before it became public." Basically--it was a zero-day to the general public, but Microsoft was already aware of it and actively researching the fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another known zero-day vulnerability for Internet Explorer that is not addressed in this update, and Microsoft is still investigating the flaw used to hack Internet Explorer 8 and compromise a fully-patched Windows 7 system at the recent Pwn2Own competition, so Microsoft will still be hard at working patching Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing is increasingly clear with each passing exploit--organizations need to abandon Internet Explorer 6 as soon as possible, and make the switch from Windows XP to Windows 7. Windows 7 and IE* are not impervious--as illustrated by the Pwn2Own contest, but attacking IE6--especially when its running on Windows XP--is just trivial at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bradley is co-author of Unified Communications for Dummies .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today shipped 2010's second rush update for Internet Explorer (IE), patching 10 vulnerabilities -- including one hackers have been exploiting for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bug had been reported to Microsoft by a Beijing security company before news broke that it was being used by attackers. In fact, Microsoft wrapped up work on the fix for IE6 by Feb. 26, according to date stamps on the affected file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update, tagged MS10-018 , was released two weeks early because Microsoft had tracked a growing number of attacks against IE6 and IE7. The bug has been used by malicious sites to launch drive-by attacks for much of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last emergency IE update was issued January 21 to fix eight flaws, including one that had been exploited to attack Google , Adobe and scores of other companies. Google blamed China for the attacks, a move that led to its decision to relocate its Chinese-language search engine to Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 10 vulnerabilities patched in today's update -- which was originally slated for release April 13, the next regularly-scheduled Patch Tuesday -- were rated "critical," the highest level threat in Microsoft's four-step scoring system. But there were clear differences in the risk profiles of different versions of IE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE6, the 2001 browser that many want to see dead and buried , was affected by eight of the 10 bugs, with seven of those eight marked critical. IE7, which debuted in 2006 prior to the release of Windows Vista, contained seven out of the possible 10, with five vulnerabilities tagged critical. IE8, on the other hand, was touched by just three of the 10, with only two critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The message today should be to get onto IE8," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "Not just ditch IE6, but dump IE6 and IE7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, Storms saw the 10 vulnerabilities as "pretty typical IE bugs. Except for [CVE-2010-0806], none of them are particularly troublesome, or no more than we've come to expect." CVE-2010-0806 is the Common Vulnerabilities  Exposure ID for the vulnerability that prompted the rush, or "out-of-band," update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that vulnerability received most of the attention today from Storms and other researchers, including HD Moore, the creator of the Metasploit framework and chief security officer at security company Rapid7, which manages the open-source Metasploit project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Moore, Microsoft's out-of-band hand was forced when a Taiwanese researcher nicknamed "Nanika" revamped public exploit code so that it worked reliably against not only IE6, but also the newer IE7. "Before, Microsoft said, 'Not that big a deal,' but then the facts changed and they say, 'Sorry, this does affect IE7 reliably.' They changed their mind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft first warned customers of the memory corruption flaw in the "iepeers.dll" file, it said that attacks were aimed only at IE6 users, and that Protected Mode in IE7 would help protect users of that version. Protected Mode is a pseudo-sandbox that tries to keep attack code from escaping the browser to modify, add or delete data elsewhere on the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said nothing of that protection today, and rated the vulnerability as critical for both IE6 and IE7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bug had been reported to Microsoft by ADLab of VenusTech, a Chinese security firm based in Beijing, probably in January or early February, said nCircle's Storms. According to the date stamps on the iepeers.dll files for the various browsers, Microsoft had completed the fix -- and passed it on to internal testing -- no later than Feb. 26 for IE6 and March 12 for IE7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft said both today and earlier, the iepeers.dll vulnerability does not affect IE8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not surprised that Microsoft released the update," said Moore. "Working exploit code has consistently accelerated Microsoft's update process." As late as yesterday, other researchers had expressed surprise that Microsoft was able to craft a fix so quickly. "They focus on IE bugs more than anything else, because they are so high profile," said Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And Microsoft can actually fix things pretty quickly, within a week or two or three," he continued. "They generally address [bugs] quickly, but then hold off until its widely exploited. Otherwise, they wait until the next release."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS10-018 can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt; * Separate from arbitration claim on environmental damages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron wins $700 mln in ruling by arbitration panel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares up more than 0.5 pct in after-hours trading
 (Adds detail on ruling, quote, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, March 30 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
won a three-year-old arbitration fight against Ecuador over a
commercial dispute as it battles the country separately over an
environmental claim that may result in $27 billion in damages
against the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An arbitration panel ruled on Tuesday that Ecuador's courts
violated international law by delaying rulings on commercial
disputes between the U.S. oil company and Ecuador's government,
and awarded Chevron $700 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The arbitration panel partially resolved seven claims that
Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, filed in Ecuador from 1991
to 1993, Chevron said. The panel found that the courts had
breached a U.S.-Ecuador treaty by not ruling on the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the same treaty that Chevron is citing in its
arbitration claim filed in September over alleged interference
by the government in a blockbuster case brought by indigenous
Ecuadoreans who accuse Texaco of damaging the environment and
their health through its operations there. [ID:nN23418073]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a ruling by the Ecuadorean judge on that case expected
at some point this year, lawyers for the plaintiffs accused
Chevron of forum shopping by bringing in the arbitrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has spent 17 years battling that claim, which a
court expert has said could result in damages of up to $27
billion against the San Ramon, California-based company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both the plaintiffs and Chevron expect the court will rule
against the company. Chevron vows to appeal any ruling that
goes against it, arguing in part that Ecuador's courts are
biased against the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its ruling, the tribunal found that Ecuador violated the
Bilateral Investment Treaty by not providing an effective means
of asserting claims and enforcing rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have maintained for some time that Ecuador's courts are
failing to administer justice when it comes to Chevron and its
affiliates, and an international tribunal has now agreed,"
Chevron general counsel Hewitt Pate said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron filed the arbitration claim in December 2006, and
the $700 million in damages is pending further proceedings to
determine taxes, compound interest and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares rose more than 40 cents, or 0.5 percent, in
extended trading in response to the ruling, after closing
largely unchanged at $75.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;International Tribunal Awards Chevron Approximately $700 Million
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
An international arbitration tribunal has ruled in favor of Chevron (NYSE:CVX)
in a claim against Ecuador related to past oil operations by Chevron`s
subsidiary, Texaco Petroleum Company. The tribunal, administered by the
Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, found that Ecuador`s courts
violated international law through their delays in ruling on certain commercial
disputes between Texaco Petroleum Company and the Ecuadorian government. 

Today`s ruling is distinct from arbitral claims Chevron and Texaco Petroleum
filed against Ecuador in 2009 in connection with the Lago Agrio litigation. 

In its decision, the tribunal found that Ecuador had violated the United
States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty by failing to provide effective means
of asserting claims and enforcing rights. As a result, the tribunal awarded
Chevron and Texaco Petroleum Company approximately US$700 million in principal
damages and interest as of December 22, 2006, pending further proceedings to
determine applicable taxes, compound interest, and costs. 

"This ruling demonstrates that the government of Ecuador is not above the law,"
said Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice president and general counsel. "We have
maintained for some time that Ecuador`s courts are failing to administer justice
when it comes to Chevron and its affiliates, and an international tribunal has
now agreed. We hope this ruling will help move Ecuador towards proper treatment
of foreign investors and respect for the rule of law." 

The arbitral award partially resolves seven commercial claims that Texaco
Petroleum Company, now a Chevron subsidiary, filed in Ecuador between 1991 and
1993. Ecuadorian courts continually delayed and refused to rule on Texaco
Petroleum`s cases, which has been found to constitute a breach of Ecuador`s
treaty with the United States. 

Chevron and Texaco Petroleum Company filed the arbitration in December 2006
under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL). The Permanent Court of Arbitration is an intergovernmental
organization with over one hundred member countries established by international
convention in 1899 to facilitate arbitration and other forms of dispute
resolution. The United States acceded to the Court`s founding convention in 1900
and Ecuador acceded in 1907. 

The tribunal is not alone in highlighting the Ecuadorian courts` failure to
provide justice to foreign investors. In February 2009, the United States
Department of State released its Investment Climate Statement for Ecuador, which
stated, "Systemic weakness and susceptibility to political or economic pressures
in the rule of law constitute the most important problem faced by U.S. companies
investing in or trading with Ecuador." The report went on to state, "corruption
is a serious problem in Ecuador," and that, "the courts are often susceptible to
outside pressure and bribes." 

Ecuador is defending the second largest arbitration docket in the world with
more than 11 claims seeking more than US$6.5 billion in damages. Ecuador has
withdrawn from the World Bank`s arbitration program, making it the second
country ever to do so, and has indicated its intention to cancel scores of
bilateral investment treaties that provide for international arbitration of
investment disputes. The country has also fallen out of favor with international
financial markets since defaulting on more than $3 billion of foreign debt after
a government-appointed panel declared the debt to be "illegitimate." 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is driven by
the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their application of the most
innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is involved in virtually every
facet of the energy industry. The company explores for, produces and transports
crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels
and other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy efficiency
solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future, including biofuels.
Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Unified TelData Inc. (UTDi), a leader in providing Intelligent Solutions for
world-class communications, is excited to announce it is now a Microsoft SBS
Partner. UTDi`s participation in a community designed to serve the needs of its
partners ensures the company can deliver the full Microsoft advantage for all
customers. 

With its membership in the Microsoft Partner Network, UTDi will be able to
create and enter new markets as a result of early access to the latest
technologies; expand its sales and marketing skills; and deepen its business and
technical expertise through clear learning paths. 

Access to other Microsoft partners and to the global company itself ensures UTDi
will be able to attain competencies aligned to how customers make purchases;
extend conversations with customers through digital marketing and social media;
drive product innovation to create customer demand; and optimize the online
marketplace to connect with customers and other partners. 

One of the benefits of the Microsoft Partner Network is the flexibility it
provides to its members. UTDi and other Microsoft SBS partners are able to
choose the relationship with Microsoft that best fits its needs and the needs of
its customers. The partner environment allows for collaboration to drive
opportunities, as well as share and exchange ideas in real-time. 

To qualify as a member of the Microsoft SBS Partner, UTDi needed to demonstrate
a commitment to sell, service, support or build solutions on the Microsoft
platform, and that it provides solutions based on Microsoft products and
technologies to independent third-party customers. As a qualifying business,
UTDi must sell 75 percent of its IT solutions and services outside of its own
company. 

With its designation as a Microsoft SBS Partner, UTDi has not only met these
qualifications, the company has also positioned itself to test for Microsoft
competencies. In achieving such competencies, UTDi will be able to develop
end-to-end desktop solutions, Window Server solutions, configuration management,
server business continuity and more. 

UTDi will now be able to position this partnership in the Microsoft Partner
Network to further promote its value in the marketplace as this designation
proves the company delivers solutions that perform according to Microsoft
expectations in a Microsoft environment. 

"UTDi has built a solid reputation in the industry as delivering solutions that
perform above and beyond customer expectations," said Lyhn Haller, UTDi CEO.
"This latest acceptance as a Microsoft SBS Partner demonstrates our latest
efforts to communicate to our client base our dedication to quality performance
of all our solutions. It not only promotes our value, it also delivers peace of
mind."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A drug being developed by Pfizer and Onyx and already in clinical trials against a range of cancers has shown in laboratory tests "a remarkable ability" to halt growth of a deadly type of brain tumor, U.S. scientists said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and the University of California said the experimental drug, called PD-0332991, may become a new treatment option for glioblastoma, the commonest and deadliest form of brain cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials to test the drug in patients with recurrent brain cancer are under development, they said in a study published in the journal Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know how well this agent will perform in patients with glioblastoma but in the mice we studied we saw very impressive, durable effect," said David James, a professor of neurological surgery at UCSF, who worked on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is especially encouraging about this agent is that we found it can easily pass through the blood-brain barrier and access glioblastoma, and that there is already a simple test available for screening glioblastoma patients in advance to see whether or not they should be responsive to this therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from a recently-published study by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, suggests about 90 percent of glioblastoma patients would be suitable candidates for the drug, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PD-0332991, which Pfizer is developing under license from Onyx, is being tested in human trials for other cancers such as multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. It is a pill designed to shut down activity of molecules called cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (cdk4 and cdk6) that drive cell division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In normal cells these kinases are kept under exquisite control by a gene known as p16," said Todd Waldman of Lombardi, who worked on the study with James.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But in glioblastoma and other cancers, p16 is frequently deleted, and these two kinases are uncontrollably activated, which drives the cell to divide and form cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the drug does not work if the cancer is missing a protein known as retinoblastoma (Rb). A test for Rb is already being used to screen patients for use of PD-0332991 in the ongoing clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study James's team implanted three different kinds of human glioblastoma directly into the brains of mice and then treated them with PD-0332991. They found the drug was able to get to the tumors and halt the cancer's growth as long as the mice stayed on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because PD-0332991 itself does not kill cancer cells -- just halts their growth -- the researchers then combined the drug with radiation and found the combination worked better than PD-0332991 alone. They also successfully tested the drug in mice in which glioblastoma had come back after treatment with temozolomide, a chemotherapy used in many cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivers on Promise of Bringing Affordable, Enterprise-Class Solutions Down
Market
DENVER--(Business Wire)--
Qwest Communications (NYSE: Q) today announced the launch of two new managed
solutions: Qwest iQTM Managed Security Service (MSS) and Qwest iQTM Network
Management Service (NMS). The new offerings deliver on a relationship Qwest and
IBM (NYSE: IBM) previously announced to provide a powerful yet easy-to-use
technology ecosystem specifically designed for businesses with 15,000 employees
or fewer yet robust enough for the Fortune 100. 

Qwest pilot customer TEAM Industries, Inc.-a designer and manufacturer of
transmission assemblies, components and CVTs for a variety of on and off-highway
markets-is already experiencing the benefits. Qwest worked with TEAM Industries
to: implement a scalable and cost-effective solution to provide more
capabilities to offload router and existing web filtering; increase security to
mitigate viruses and spam; eliminate traffic going through TEAM Industries` six
locations and interconnect those locations with resilient technology. 

KEY FACTS

Qwest iQTM Managed Security Service

* Reduces the costs and complexities associated with managing security needs,
while mitigating the impact of liability and security threats from malware, SPAM
e-mail, unauthorized network access, and Internet resource misuse. 
* Enables customers to leverage Qwest expert tools, skills and processes to
improve their system uptime and performance, optimize security investments,
improve employee productivity and demonstrate compliance. 
* Supported by IBM Internet Security Systems (ISS), a recognized industry leader
of managed security service with world-wide redundant security operation
centers, security research within the X-Force organization, and certified
engineers and security analysts to provide 24x7x365 support.

Qwest iQTM Network Management Service

* A network monitoring and management product suite that provides complete
out-tasking of all or part of customer`s data network. It is a comprehensive,
integrated package of products and services for building and proactively
overseeing networks. 
* Enables customers to control operational costs, while improving network uptime
and performance, regulatory compliance and to optimize their security
investments.

IBM`s skilled operations analysts using automated surveillance tools. Customers
can view network performance statistics, alerts and create and manage trouble
tickets, all from Qwest`s QControl&#174; Portal.

SUPPORTING QUOTES

Krysten Westrum, IT Manager, TEAM Industries, Inc.
"Our smaller manufacturing firm`s needs mimic that of a larger enterprise. We
found that Qwest and IBM`s solution addresses those needs and provides us with
access to security and network experts. Although two companies are involved, our
experience with support and visibility into service information has been
seamless. We are confident that as we grow, Qwest and IBM are there to provide
us with scalable solutions to meet our needs." 

Eric Bozich, vice president of Qwest Business Markets Group Product Management
"When we announced our relationship with IBM, we showcased that Qwest would
design and deliver new solutions that let customers redirect their operational
dollars to strategic initiatives and make IT a competitive differentiator rather
than a cost center. Qwest is now delivering new mid-size business solutions that
customers like TEAM Industries can leverage for success." 

Scott Stainken, general manager of IBM`s Telecommunications Industry
"Together IBM and Qwest have moved swiftly to offer mid-market customers a
comprehensive set of network infrastructure requirements. Users will appreciate

Morgan Chase Underwriters</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Attorney Kelly M. Dermody of Lieff Cabraser Heimann &amp; Bernstein, LLP, announced
the filing of a class action lawsuit charging that J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.
("Chase") had a common practice of misclassifying its loan underwriters as
exempt and failing to pay them for all overtime hours worked in violation of
federal overtime pay laws. Chase, one of the country`s largest commercial banks,
performs a significant amount of real estate loan origination and underwriting.
Chase employs roughly 500-1,000 underwriters nationwide. 

"All of us underwriters worked long days and on weekends processing loan
applications. We gave our all to bring in billions of dollars of revenue for
Chase," stated plaintiff Gayla Pickle. "It`s only fair that they should pay us
for all that overtime." 

Plaintiff`s counsel Kelly M. Dermody added, "This lawsuit seeks fair
compensation for the underwriters employed by Chase who tirelessly worked late
nights and long weekends processing loans, which helped fuel Chase`s success in
the mortgage sector." 

The lawsuit alleges that these workers were unlawfully denied overtime pay. In
fact, Chase reclassified its underwriters to nonexempt status in February 2009,
but failed to provide them backpay for the overtime hours they had worked while
classified as exempt. Additionally, a federal appellate court recently ruled
against Chase on the issue of whether Chase underwriters are exempt from federal
overtime laws. 

Current and former Chase underwriters who wish to report their work experiences
or learn more about the lawsuit should visit www.jpmcovertime.com. The web site
allows witnesses and claimants to contact plaintiffs` counsel. 

The lawsuit, entitled Pickle v. J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., was filed late
yesterday afternoon in United States District Court in New York, New York.

&lt;p&gt;Verizon and IBM today unveiled Managed Data Vault, a cloud backup service that uses a software-based technology that replicates redundant copies of data offsite through software agents on application servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Sirota, strategy and program development executive at IBM, said the base service, to be offered by both Verizon and IBM, provides remote electronic storage at an offsite data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optional upgrades can include an on-site storage appliance, the ability to replicate data to an alternate vault and data backup tapes for long-term retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The combination of Verizon's secure networking expertise and data center capabilities and IBM's long history of providing electronic data management and protection solutions yields a unique end-to-end backup and recovery solution that is integrated with an enterprise's existing wide-area network environment and fully managed in the cloud," said IDC analyst Melanie Posey in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial iteration of Managed Data Vault is aimed at users in the New York metropolitan region, with the primary data center located at IBM's Sterling Forest recovery center. The companies expect to expand the service later this year using both IBM and Verizon data centers, Sirota said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Managed Data Vault service's disk-based backup offers set recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managed Data Vault also enhances RPO of database applications: the online database backup ability enhances database and application availability by allowing backups to be performed while the database is being used, according to Sirota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is dramatic RTO improvement by eliminating the time necessary to recall and transport tapes for recovery. The planned for RTO is also more reliably met because Managed Data Vault lets users know that a successful backup has occurred," Sirota said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backup service is priced per gigabyte of data stored -- the specific price per gigabyte depends on which level of service is used and how long a user wants the data retained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sirota said the price "will be very competitive relative to Internet-based services that do not have consistent nor reliable throughput characteristics, with the added benefit of avoiding ongoing capital expense as data stores grow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM would not release the throughput rates associated with Managed Data Vault, instead saying it is designed to backup large data stores (terabytes) in normal backup windows, and at LAN speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas Mearian covers storage, disaster recovery and business continuity, financial services infrastructure and health care IT for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Weinstein Co, and billionaire brothers Alec and Tom Gores continued to weigh offers on Wednesday for Walt Disney Co's Miramax unit as the media giant pushed back the bid deadline, according to people with knowledge of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline, originally set for March 31, was moved to April 1 and now has been set to April 5 to give interested parties more time to put together bids, a source familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entertainment executives have said pricing could prohibit any near-term deal due to views that Disney's asking price of more than $650 million for Miramax is too high. They estimated its worth as within the $400 million to $500 million range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source said the Weinsteins, who founded Miramax as an art-house studio in 1979 and sold it to Disney in 1993, were mulling various strategies with financial partners and were working closely with advisors to prepare documents for an offer for the film company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney and Weinstein Co declined to comment. A spokesman for Tom Gores' Platinum Equity was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources said The Gores Group LLC, headed by Alec Gores, and Platinum Equity LLC, headed by Tom Gores, were considering making a joint offer for Miramax, known for such films as "Pulp Fiction" and "No Country for Old Men."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction for Miramax is occurring at the same time interested buyers circle the once-powerful Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio. That sale has also faced hurdles and a steering committee for MGM will meet this week with creditors to present a stand-alone plan for the famed studio, home to the James Bond franchise, after being disappointed with bids it received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entertainment industry professionals believe price will be a sticking point on Miramax as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think they're going to sell. It would appear they don't have enough interest at the valuations they were expecting. I can't understand the rationale for selling those assets unless Disney achieves a premium in doing so," said David Molner, managing director of Screen Capital International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Weinsteins sold Miramax to Disney in 1993 for $80 million, but remained as co-chief executives of the studio until five years ago, when they left to form the Weinstein Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, the Weinstein Co confirmed its interest in Miramax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several initially interested parties, like Summit Entertainment and Lions Gate Entertainment, balked at the price, according to sources familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft uncovered more than 1,800 bugs in Office 2010 by tapping into the unused computing horsepower of idling PCs, a company security engineer said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office developers found the bugs by running millions of "fuzzing" tests, said Tom Gallagher, senior security test lead with Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuzzing, a practice employed by both software developers and security researchers, searches for flaws by inserting data into file format parsers to see where programs fail by crashing. Because some crash bugs can be further exploited to successfully hack software, allowing an attacker to insert malicious code, fuzzing is of great interest to both legitimate and criminal researchers looking for security vulnerabilities .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found and fixed about 1,800 bugs in Office 2010's code," said Gallagher, who last week co-hosted a presentation on Microsoft 's fuzzing efforts at the CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. "While a large number, it's important to note that that doesn't mean we found 1,800 security issues. We also want to fix things that are not security concerns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher declined to quantify the number of flaws found via fuzzing that qualified as vulnerabilities, saying only that the Office 2010 team did uncover security bugs in the process and patched them during development. Some of those vulnerabilities have already been addressed in older editions of Office, Gallagher added, because information obtained by fuzzing Office 2010 code was checked against the code in earlier versions -- such as Office 2007 and Office 2003 -- then patched during Office 2010's development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-security bugs discovered in Office 2010 that also exist in previous editions will be fixed in those versions' upcoming service packs, Gallagher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was able to find such a large number of bugs in Office 2010 by using not only machines in the company's labs, but also under-utilitized or idle PCs throughout the company. The concept isn't new: The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( SETI@home ) project may have been the first to popularize the practice, and remains the largest, but it's also been used to crunch numbers in medical research and to find the world's largest prime number .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We call it a botnet for fuzzing," said Gallagher, referring to what Microsoft has formally dubbed Distributed Fuzzing Framework (DFF). The fuzzing network originated with work by David Conger, a software design engineer on the Access team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Client software installed on systems throughout Microsoft's network automatically kicks in when the PCs are idle, such as on weekends, to run fuzzing tests "We would do millions of [fuzzing] iterations each weekend," Gallagher said -- up to 12 million in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between Microsoft's old way of fuzzing -- which involved a tester setting up a fuzzer on a single machine, then letting it run for as long as a week -- and DFF was dramatic, said Gallagher. "We can do 12 million iterations without a lot of effort," he said. "Set it up, go home, come in on Monday, and we have the results listing all the issues. What used to take days now just takes an hour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all the Office development teams use DFF, only some groups within the company have tried it. Currently SharePoint, MSN client and Fast search teams are utilizing the fuzzing network, but Windows developers are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prominent vulnerability researcher, however, has criticized the fuzzing efforts of Microsoft,Apple and Adobe. Last week, Charlie Miller, three-time winner at the Pwn2Own hacking contest, showed CanSecWest attendees how he used a simple "dumb" fuzzer -- one not built to understand a specific file format -- to root out 20 security vulnerabilities and hundreds of crash bugs using fewer than five computers. Miller found vulnerabilities in PowerPoint, the presentation maker in Office, as well as in Mac OS X, Apple's Safari browser and Adobe's Reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller refused to turn over details of the vulnerabilities to the vendors, Microsoft included, but instead showed the vendors how to replicate his work in his own presentation. "What I can do is tell them how to find these bugs, and do what I did. That might get them to do more fuzzing," Miller said last week in an interview with Computerworld .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher, who sat in on Miller's presentation, didn't commit Microsoft to doing what Miller wanted. "We're looking at his technique, how to duplicate it and how we might implement it," Gallagher said today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller was unavailable today to comment on Microsoft's Office fuzzing work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's stepped-up fuzzing was part of a security push for Office 2010 that also added several new features, including a more flexible file blocker -- first introduced in Office 2007 -- and a new sandbox dubbed Protected View that isolates suspicious Word, Excel and PowerPoint files in a limited-rights environment, effectively quarantining them from the rest of the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not banking on finding and fixing every bug in Office 2010," Gallagher admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt; * JP Morgan to take import capacity at Sabine Pass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cheniere expects to buy more LNG with JP Morgan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Edward McAllister&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
announced its entrance into the LNG market on Wednesday under a
deal signed with U.S. liquefied natural gas importer Cheniere
Energy (LNG.A).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the two-year deal, JP Morgan and Cheniere will
jointly look for buying opportunities in the global LNG market,
combining Cheniere's existing LNG assets and experience with JP
Morgan's greater buying power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan will now have import rights for up to 2 billion
cubic feet per day of gas at the Cheniere's Sabine Pass import
terminal in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The aim is to afford Cheniere the opportunity to buy more
cargoes of LNG and give JP Morgan access to an asset like
Sabine Pass which gives the bank a firm foothold in the
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We can buy much larger quantities of LNG with the help of
JP Morgan than we could by ourself," Charif Souki, chief
executive officer of Cheniere Energy, told Reuters. "They have
a balance sheet and we have assets, which is a pretty good
match."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan is the latest in a list of banks looking to get
into LNG trading, following the likes of Morgan Stanley, Citi
Group and Barclays Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley, probably the most established of the banks
in the LNG market, owns assets it can supply LNG to in Spain
and Argentina, giving it more flexibility in the market. JP
Morgan's access to Sabine will provide a similar opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the LNG market is small and difficult for new
entrants to penetrate, it is growing as new production comes
online and the spot market becomes more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see a market changing very rapidly and we see a greater
need for intermediaries," said Paul Polosi, head of Global
Power, Gas, Coal and Emissions at J.P. Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cheniere tried to sign a similar deal with Morgan Stanley a
few years ago, which did not come to fruition, but Cheniere's
Souki said that now, as the market grows, a long term
partnership with JP Morgan could develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Edward McAllister; Editing by David

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan to add investment bankers in emerging markets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Plans to add 500 employees to private bank&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon plans to expand the second-largest
U.S. bank's investment and private banking divisions, he told
shareholders in an annual letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will this year expand its prime services business,
which it acquired when it bought Bear Stearns Cos in March
2008, according to the letter. That unit provides custody,
financing and other services to large investors mostly in the
United States. JPMorgan is expanding this business in Europe
and Asia, Dimon wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is also adding investment banking and trading
staff in countries such as China, India and Brazil, according
to the letter, so the bank can cover more customers in those
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At an investor day last month, JPMorgan executives said the
bank will spend about $1 billion this year on technology at its
investment bank. [ID:nN25132928]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the letter, Dimon also discussed plans to expand
JPMorgan's investment management and private banking
businesses, which were announced at the investor day last
month. JPMorgan will add more than 500 bankers, investors and
other staff to its private bank this year, Dimon wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately Dimon, who has emerged as one of the industry's
most prominent voices after his bank weathered the credit
crisis better than most, repeated his view that big banks are
not inherently risky. While JPMorgan broadly supports the
principles behind further consumer protection and increased
regulation of derivatives and securitizations, he wrote, the
bank is concerned about the details of some proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would urge our regulator and legislators to ... proceed
with clarity and purpose and avoid broadly penalizing all firms
alike -- regardless of whether they were reckless or prudent,"
he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares have risen about 7 percent since the start
of the year. The shares closed up 17 cents at $44.75 on
Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt; * Healthcare professionals paid $5,000 for expert advise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Speaking fees averaged $3,400 for 2,800 doctors
 (Adds comment from Senator Grassley)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on
Wednesday said it paid $35 million to some 4,500 doctors and
researchers from July through December 2009 for a variety of
services, including speaking fees, expert advice and work on
clinical trials of its medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest drugmaker last year agreed to pay a
record $2.3 billion fine and plead guilty to a criminal charge
related to improper promotions of 13 of its medicines, but said
the new disclosures were already in the works before that
widely publicized settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, Pfizer said the disclosures are in line with, and
exceed, payment reporting provisions included in recently
passed U.S. healthcare reform legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About $15.3 million, or some 44 percent of Pfizer's
reported payments over the last six months of 2009, went to
about 250 research organizations for clinical trials that began
after July 1, or for payments made between July 1 and Dec. 31
for clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 1,500 healthcare professionals were paid an average
$5,000 each for expert advice, while 2,800 doctors were paid an
average of $3,400 in speaking fees to lecture peers about
Pfizer's drugs, the company said. The most highly compensated
doctor received about $150,000 during the period, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The disclosures, which are posted on its website,
www.pfizer.com/WorkingWithHCP, involve those who received
payments, meals or non-monetary educational items worth $25 or
more, according to Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This information tells what our relationships are, so
patients can put in the name of their physician (in the
website) and see the doctor had a meal which cost this much, or
a speaking engagement for that much," said Pfizer spokeswoman
Kristen Neese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neese said all types of payments mentioned in its report
are legitimate means of fostering development of drugs and
getting "real world" information from the medical community
about the products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said the disclosures are part of an eight-year effort
by Pfizer to become more transparent in how it conducts
clinical trials, pays for them and interacts with doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a real milestone for the transparency campaign to
have one of the biggest drug makers in the world respond with
an initiative like this," U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa)
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grassley has been one of the most outspoken critics of the
pharmaceutical industry in Congress and has spearheaded calls
for more transparency and reform of past practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other large drugmakers, including Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N),
have recently begun publishing payments to doctors on their
websites. But Neese said Pfizer's disclosures go beyond those
recently established by other companies, in that they include
payments for clinical trial research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said its payment disclosures will become more
detailed a year from now, under a corporate integrity agreement
with federal health authorities related to the drugmaker's $2.3
billion fine and settlement last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will then, on a quarterly basis, include the
value of all financial interactions, including those below $25,
and non-monetary items such as educational items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer in September was slapped with the huge fine by the
U.S. government after being deemed a repeat offender in
pitching its now-withdrawn Bextra arthritis drug and another
dozen medicines to patients and doctors for unapproved uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer pleaded guilty in 2004 to an earlier criminal charge
of improper sales tactics and its practices have been under
U.S. supervision since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking engagements, in which doctors are paid by
drugmakers to discuss their medicines with groups of other
physicians, have been among the most controversial industry
marketing practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By law, companies are forbidden to promote their drugs for
uses not cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But
some companies allegedly have greatly boosted prescriptions for
their drugs by allowing or encouraging paid speakers to discuss
such "off-label" use of their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's chief medical officer, Freda Lewis-Hall, defended
company-paid speakers, saying they allowed practicing
physicians to convey their knowledge to other doctors and to
answer their questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We work very hard to make sure our speakers have the full
range of data and information we have, and that they share it
appropriately," Lewis-Hall said.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will expand its Hohm consumer energy management software to work with Ford Motor Company electric cars, the two companies announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Hohm, future owners of Ford's electric vehicles will be able to determine when the best times will be to recharge their vehicles at home, executives from the two companies said at a press conference in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As consumers start using electric and hybrid electric vehicles en masse, electric companies will experience surges of power demand in the evenings when people come home from work and plug in their automobiles for recharging, explained Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, via satellite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The demand placed on the energy grid will be momentous," Ballmer said. "Addressing the challenge of how that demand is managed in a smart and affordable way is absolutely going to be critical. And information technology will be an essential part of supporting the energy ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies pledged to work with utilities and municipal power companies so the software can determine when the most affordable times will be for consumers to recharge their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a survey from Accenture, 42 percent of consumers are considering purchasing electric or hybrid electric vehicles. Ford plans to introduce five electric or hybrid vehicles for the North American and European markets by 2013. Already, Ford and Mercury offer four hybrids and Lincoln will introduce a new hybrid later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hohm is a Microsoft service that analyzes home electricity usage, suggesting changes for power savings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford already collaborates with Microsoft for its Sync in-car technology, which allows personal electronics such as MP3 players and mobile phones to be controlled by voice recognition. Sync is based on Microsoft's Windows Embedded Auto platform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, over 2 million Ford vehicles use Sync, said Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally at the press conference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World`s deepest offshore production facility marks milestone in the deepwater
U.S. Gulf of Mexico
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) announced today that the Perdido deepwater
project, located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, has started crude oil and natural
gas production. Production from the Great White, Silvertip and Tobago fields
utilizing the Perdido hub is expected to reach full capacity of 130,000 barrels
of oil-equivalent per day after the drilling of additional wells. 

"Achieving first oil at the Perdido development adds to an impressive list of
major capital projects for Chevron in the deepwater," said George Kirkland, vice
chairman, Chevron Corporation. "Perdido follows the recent start-up of two large
deepwater projects, Tahiti and Blind Faith, and demonstrates the importance of
the Gulf of Mexico for Chevron." 

"Perdido represents the industry`s first production from the Lower Tertiary,
where Chevron has made multiple discoveries and is a leading leaseholder. This
project`s success paves the way to develop further opportunities in this
important new area," said Gary Luquette, president, Chevron North America
Exploration and Production Company. 

Tethered in nearly 8,000 feet of water, Perdido is the world's deepest offshore
oil and gas drilling and production spar and is 60 miles beyond any existing
developments in the Gulf. Several new technologies were specifically developed
for Perdido, including a means to separate crude oil and natural gas at the sea
floor rather than on the platform. Chevron is at the forefront of efforts to
develop crude oil and natural gas from the Lower Tertiary. Chevron began
front-end engineering and design for the Jack and St. Malo fields last year and
expects to sanction the project this year. The company also plans to further
evaluate its Buckskin discovery in the Lower Tertiary through appraisal drilling
activities in 2010. 

Chevron has a 37.5 percent working interest in the Perdido regional host
facilities and holds interests in the development`s three producing fields:
Great White (33.3 percent), Silver Tip (60 percent) and Tobago (57.5 percent).
The Great White field is expected to produce approximately 80 percent of
Perdido`s total production. The production platform is located in Alaminos
Canyon Block 857, approximately 250 miles south of Houston.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI BEACH, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Visionary designer Todd Oldham returns to South Beach, bringing his creative
genius to 20 deluxe rooms including two 2 bedroom suites at the new oceanfront
addition to The Hotel of South Beach, owned by Goldman Properties. Oldham
designed The Hotel`s original property, at 801 Collins Avenue, opened in 1998 to
wide acclaim, and the two properties share amenities including room service
provided by The Hotel`s award-winning restaurant, Wish. The Spire Bar &amp; Lounge,
an emerald-shaped rooftop swimming pool, fully equipped rooftop gym, small
conference facility and meeting rooms are available to guests at both
properties. The designer`s vision for the addition, overlooking the Atlantic
Ocean, reflects Miami`s awe-inspiring sunsets, with a distinctive warm palette
of red, coral, and orange, balanced by touches of gray and gold. These colors

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI BEACH, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Visionary designer Todd Oldham returns to South Beach, bringing his creative
genius to 20 deluxe rooms including two 2 bedroom suites at the new oceanfront
addition to The Hotel of South Beach, owned by Goldman Properties. Oldham
designed The Hotel`s original property, at 801 Collins Avenue, opened in 1998 to
wide acclaim, and the two properties share amenities including room service
provided by The Hotel`s award-winning restaurant, Wish. The Spire Bar &amp; Lounge,
an emerald-shaped rooftop swimming pool, fully equipped rooftop gym, small
conference facility and meeting rooms are available to guests at both
properties. The designer`s vision for the addition, overlooking the Atlantic
Ocean, reflects Miami`s awe-inspiring sunsets, with a distinctive warm palette
of red, coral, and orange, balanced by touches of gray and gold. These colors
complement the ocean blues and sea greens featured in the original design of The
Hotel and are consistent with Oldham`s lush color sense. Furnishings showcase

&lt;p&gt;First Public Disclosure to Include Payments for Clinical Development


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. today released detailed information about how and why the company
works with a range of healthcare professionals and researchers to advance
patient care and develop lifesaving medicines. The information reflects payments
or exchanges of value received by licensed U.S. healthcare professionals who
consulted with Pfizer about the development and marketing of new medicines and
helped to educate other healthcare professionals about the safe and appropriate
use of its products. Pfizer`s disclosure is the first in the industry to report
payments made for conducting Phase I-IV clinical trials in addition to
disclosing payments for speaking and consulting. 

"Collaboration is essential between healthcare professionals and the
pharmaceutical industry to ensure today`s scientific advances truly improve the
lives of patients. Our work with clinicians makes possible both product
development and the steady improvement of medical standards and patient care,"
said Freda Lewis-Hall, MD, Pfizer`s chief medical officer. "Pfizer is committed
to ensuring these relationships are transparent to the public and are carefully
managed, so that we foster trust and sustain our ability to deliver the
breakthroughs patients have come to expect from us." 

The report, posted today on www.pfizer.com/WorkingWithHCP, represents data
collected from July through December 2009 about work done with approximately
4,500 healthcare professionals resulting in total payments of $35 million for
their time and expertise to gain and share real-world experience about the safe
and appropriate use of medicines and the development of medical innovations.
Pfizer is reporting data for healthcare professionals who received payments,
meals or non-monetary educational items worth $25 or more and totaling $500 or
more during the six-month reporting period. 

Almost 44 percent of the total payments disclosed for the reporting period are
associated with Pfizer`s collaborations with approximately 250 research
organizations to study how medicines work and to discover new medicines to treat
and prevent life-threatening and debilitating illnesses. In total, Pfizer
reported payments of approximately $15.3 million to these institutions for all
new clinical trials initiated after July 1, 2009 as well as clinical trial
payments made between July 1 and December 31, 2009 to academic medical centers
for ongoing or new research. These payments cover a variety of critical
activities including participant recruitment, coordinating and conducting the
clinical trials and completing compliance activities to ensure regulatory
requirements are met. These payments represent a small portion of Pfizer`s total
investment in research and development. 

Pfizer also reported collaborations with:

* Approximately 1,500 experienced healthcare professionals to provide input and
advice to ensure the company addresses the real needs of clinicians and
patients. These professionals were compensated an average of $5,000 in return
for their time and expertise. 
* Approximately 2,800 experienced healthcare professionals who were selected as
speakers to educate their peers about health conditions and the safe and
appropriate use of Pfizer medicines. These professionals were compensated an
average of $3,400 for their work. Both speakers and attendees were also provided
meals at these events.

In addition, the data include expenditures for meals and educational items
provided to healthcare professionals during engagements with Pfizer's field
force or during activities on Pfizer`s behalf. In-office meetings between Pfizer
representatives and healthcare professionals provide an opportunity for Pfizer
to exchange important product knowledge and discuss new or relevant information
about its medicines. Reimbursed business-related travel is also detailed in the
report and covers the costs incurred by healthcare professional partners related
to their work for Pfizer. 

Pfizer`s disclosures are in line with the healthcare payment reporting
provisions outlined in the healthcare reform legislation passed by the House and
signed into law by the President last week. These include posting payments made
to practicing physicians and other healthcare professionals for consulting and
speaking engagements, as well as the value of certain meals and non-monetary
items such as pill dispensers, educational materials and anatomical models.
Pfizer`s disclosures go beyond the requirements of this legislation with the
immediate inclusion of payments to principal investigators and institutions for
ongoing and new Phase I-IV clinical trials. 

In preparing to disclose the details about its financial interactions with
healthcare professionals, Pfizer reviewed and categorized more than 180,000
transactions and collaborated with patients, researchers and healthcare
professionals to determine the most useful way to convey this information to the
public. Based on this feedback, the information is presented in a clear,
user-friendly format that allows patients to search for their healthcare
professionals using simple tools. 

Pfizer will post the next report on March 31, 2011 and include a full year of
data for 2010. In accordance with the August 2009 Corporate Integrity Agreement
with the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), effective with the report for 2010, Pfizer will expand its
reporting to include the value of all financial interactions including
non-monetary items such as meals and educational items, regardless of value. The
payment report will be posted quarterly beginning in June 2011. 

"Our commitment to publicly sharing the details of our financial relationships
is a natural progression of our efforts to better listen to patients and provide
greater transparency about our business operations," said Dr. Lewis-Hall. "By
providing greater clarity about these payments we hope to establish a better
understanding about our collaborations with healthcare professionals." 

Pfizer Inc.: Working together for a healthier world

At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to improve health and
well-being at every stage of life. We strive to set the standard for quality,
safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacturing of medicines
for people and animals. Our diversified global health care portfolio includes

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following Issuer Default Rating (IDRs) and
outstanding debt ratings of Chevron Corporation (Chevron; NYSE: CVX): 

Chevron Corporation 

-- Long-term IDR at 'AA';
-- Senior unsecured notes at 'AA';
-- Commercial paper at 'F1+';
-- Short-term IDR at 'F1+'. 

Union Oil Company of California (Unocal - Chevron) 

-- Unocal unsecured notes at 'AA'. 

Chevron Funding Corporation 

-- Commercial paper at 'F1+';
-- Short-term IDR at 'F1+'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

Chevron's ratings reflect the size and quality of the supermajor's worldwide
asset base; its oil-heavy upstream portfolio (approximately 69% of 2009 upstream
production was liquids); the diversification benefits of the integrated oil
business model; Chevron's strong cash flow generation capability, conservative
financial management, and very low debt levels. Total gross debt at Dec. 31,
2009 was just $10.51 billion on an asset base of $164.6 billion, while net debt
was just $1.7 billion. As calculated by Fitch, debt/boe of proven upstream
reserves was just $0.95/boe (allocating 25% of debt to non-E segments). Credit
concerns are minimal, and center primarily on high capex spending and
shareholder distributions, as well as the possibility of acquisition-related
event risk. 

For the LTM ending Dec. 31, 2009, Chevron had debt/EBITDA leverage of 0.4x,
interest coverage of 92.3x, and negative free cash flow (FCF) of $5.77 billion,
although this was the result of its policy to 'invest through the cycle' during
the low commodity prices of 1H'09. Note that on a quarterly basis, FCF turned
positive in 2H'09 ($1.54 billion) in line with higher crude oil prices. Looking
forward, Fitch anticipates Chevron will be modestly FCF negative in 2010 using
Fitch's conservative base case assumptions of $70/WTI and $4.00/mcf natural gas.
However, Fitch does not anticipate that Chevron would not need to do any
additional borrowing under these price assumptions, as any deficits could easily
be funded out of Chevron's large existing cash balances. The fact that Chevron
is the operator at many of its projects gives Chevron ample operational
flexibility to throttle back capex in the event of a future significant leg down
in oil prices. 

Chevron's 2009 upstream metrics were good. Worldwide E output was 2.68 million
boepd including equity affiliates, a 7% increase year-over-year. Total proven
reserves increased by 1% in 2009 and stood at 11,315 million boe. 61.4% of
reserves were proven developed at YE 2009, while Chevron's reserve life was 11.6
years. Chevron's all-in one-year reserve replacement rate (RRR) was 115% in 2009
versus 149% the year prior, and 108% on a three-year basis. 2009 Finding,
Development &amp; Acquisition (FD) costs were $12.55/boe, a solid number given
Chevron's orientation towards oil and deepwater offshore projects, both of which
tend to result in higher FD costs per boe. 2009 reserve bookings were impacted
by the higher-prices through Chevron's Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which
generally move inversely to oil prices. In 2009 Chevron saw PSC-related reserve
debookings in Indonesia and Azerbaijan, as well as a 184 million barrel
price-related PSC debooking by an equity affiliate in Kazakhstan. Approximately
26% of Chevron's consolidated reserves were PSC-linked at YE 2009 versus 32% in
2008. Notable reserve additions in 2009 included the booking of reserves from
Chevron's 20% stake in the AOSP Oil Sands project (allowed under revised SEC
rules), as well as increases on the natural gas side from the gigantic Gorgon
project (offshore Australia natural gas fields, 3 planned LNG trains with
capacity of 15 million tonnes per annum; Chevron operator), which drove the bulk
of Chevron's gas-related reserve gains. Excluding PSC effects, Chevron's 2009
RRR rate would have been 145%. 

Chevron's liquidity was strong at year-end and was provided mainly by internally
generated cash, cash and marketable securities balances ($8.82 billion at Dec.
31, 2009) and its two commercial paper funding vehicles, Chevron Corp ($12
billion) and Chevron Funding Corp ($2.5 billion). Note that the $2.5 billion
facility is a carve-out of the main facility, so total board authorized CP does
not exceed $12 billion. The company also has $5.1 billion in committed unsecured
bank credit lines which are comprised of a series of bilateral agreements with a
number of banks. There were no borrowings outstanding on these lines at Dec. 31,
2009. Near term maturities are manageable and include $30 million due in 2010,
$19 million 2011, $1.5 billion in 2012, and nothing in 2013. There are no
financial covenants on outstanding unsecured debt. Chevron also rolls forward a
shelf which allows it to issue debt at the parent level or parent-guaranteed
subsidiary level. 

Other liabilities are manageable. Chevron's Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO)
rose to $10.18 billion at YE 2009 versus $9.39 billion at YE 2008. The unfunded
status of its pension declined slightly to -$3.84 billion in 2009 from -$3.97
billion seen the year prior, primarily due to improved returns on assets and
higher employer contributions. Estimated 2010 pension contributions are $900
million. Reserves for environmental remediation at YE 2009 were $1.7 billion and
are primarily linked to remediation efforts in US and international downstream. 

Chevron is the subject of a well-publicized $27 billion lawsuit in Ecuador
alleging environmental damages committed by a subsidiary of Texaco during its
time in that country. The case, which was brought forth in 2003, is being held
in an Ecuadorean court. Although an unfavorable ruling could take place at any
time, Fitch does not anticipate a material near-term negative credit impact on
Chevron for several reasons, including the fact that Chevron is essentially
judgment proof within Ecuador (assets include only a small lubes plant in that
country). Fitch anticipates any legal proceedings in the US would likely be a
long and drawn out affair given Chevron's formidable legal resources and stated
intention to defend itself vigorously. For comparison' sake, note that the Exxon
Valdez lawsuit was resolved nearly 20 years after the incident in Prince William
Sound in 1989, and the award was reduced to approximately 20% of the original
punitive award of $2.5 billion through a lengthy series of appeals ($507
million). Given its prominence, Fitch will continue to monitor this situation
for new developments. 

Chevron Corporation is a large integrated oil company with 2009 upstream
production of 2.68 million boepd (barrels of oil equivalent per day) and
year-end proven hydrocarbon reserves of 11,315 million boe. Chevron's downstream
portfolio includes interests in 17 refineries with an aggregate refining
capacity of 2.16 million bpd and approximately 22,000 branded retail stations.
Chevron's chemicals assets are held through CPChem, a joint venture with
ConocoPhillips Corporation which holds interests in 34 worldwide manufacturing
facilities and four research centers. Chemicals interests also include the
Oronite lubes and fuel additives business. Other assets include midstream
assets, power generation, and mining, among others. Chevron also controls a 41
tanker fleet to move crude and products around the world held on a short term
(&lt;1 year) charter basis.

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Mar 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
As companies evaluate cloud computing services to improve business
performance, Avanade, a business technology services provider, reports
customers are seeing value from Microsoft cloud-based solutions and
services. 

    "We are seeing a great deal of interest in Microsoft cloud offerings in
the last six months," said Aziz Virani, executive vice president, Global
Technology &amp; Solutions, Avanade. "Several business factors are driving
this. The challenging economic environment has certainly increased
interest in the potential of cloud computing because of its ability to
help reduce costs. Growing competition is forcing companies to consider
how cloud can help them increase speed to market or uncover new market
opportunities. And many customers of ours point to the opportunity of
cloud to eliminate managing application upgrades, which can consume
tremendous IT time."

    In 2009 Avanade engaged Kelton Research to conduct two global surveys on
cloud computing -- one in February 2009 and the other in September 2009.
Between the first survey and the second, there was a 320 percent increase
in executives and IT decision-makers reporting they are testing or
planning to implement cloud computing technologies. 

    In the past year, Avanade has been working to deliver cloud-related
services for Microsoft offerings, including Microsoft Business
Productivity Online Suite, the Windows Azure platform and Avanade Online
Services (AOS). AOS provides a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform to
deliver Microsoft solutions to large enterprises, with Microsoft Dynamics
CRM (customer relationships management) as the first offering.

    Interest in cloud migrations services delivered by Avanade to migrate to
Microsoft's Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS) has doubled in the
last quarter. Based on early deployments, customers are seeing cost
savings of 15 to 30 percent when they switch from traditional internally
managed systems to BPOS. 

    A Real-World Example: Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS)
 A global
manufacturing company based in the Nordic region with operations in more
than 400 locations needed to harmonize its business communications and
collaboration systems to realize the vision of one global company.
Avanade worked with the manufacturer to help deliver a global, unified
communication system. The company explored multiple scenarios, using
Avanade's Business Benefits Calculator and Estimating Model to assess
whether to deploy unified communications on its internal IT systems or in
the cloud. The analysis showed that the company would realize the most
benefit, both from a financial and functional perspective, if deployed in
the cloud to its more than 5,000 employees. 

    By migrating email services and adding functionality such as chat,
conferencing, presence and project workspaces provided by BPOS, the
company estimates it will save several million Euros over a few year
period of time. The system is also easily extendable to customers,
partners, suppliers and future acquisitions to further improve
collaboration across groups. 

    Avanade Online Services
 Avanade Online Services (AOS) is Avanade's SaaS
delivery platform for Microsoft solutions. The first solution running on
AOS is Microsoft Dynamics CRM. According to Avanade's global cloud survey
last fall, the majority of respondents ranked CRM as the most critical
differentiator and strategic weapon for their businesses versus the
competition. The majority of respondents said they are deploying SaaS for
CRM (52 percent).

    Since the launch of AOS, the majority of interest from customers
evaluating and signing contracts are made up of large enterprises, with
less demand from the mid-market. 

    One of the largest global manufacturers, with about 50,000 employees, is
an early adopter of AOS. AOS merges the functionality of the company's
old Lotus Notes with the interoperability of a Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
The deployment was fast, with no upfront hardware or software licensing
costs -- zero. Employees are more productive because they can access the
new service through their familiar Outlook client, even when offline. A
recent survey revealed 95% satisfaction rate, indicating widespread
acceptance and endorsement at the grassroots level.

    Microsoft Windows Azure
 While Windows Azure has only been publicly
available since end of January, Avanade has seen strong interest from
customers. Avanade was early among global systems integrators to deploy
applications into production on Azure. Avanade has created a dedicated
Windows Azure team in India to serve customers globally with development
and delivery needs.

    For example, Avanade worked with Origin Digital, an Accenture company, to
help move to the Azure platform. Origin Digital (www.origindigital.com),
a global IP broadcasting company, wanted to increase transcoding
throughput without increasing capital expense. To gain dynamic
scalability within a familiar development environment, the company built
an innovative transcoding Cloud application on the Windows Azure
platform. The application is expected to reduce compute costs and
database administration time as well as expedite moves into new
geographic markets and grow its business.

    As cloud computing evolves rapidly, Avanade continues to track industry
trends through research as well as customer engagements to help
organizations navigate, deploy and take advantage of Microsoft
cloud-based solutions and services.

&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS--(Business Wire)--
SoTel Systems, LLC, a leading ITSP and SIP service provider, today announced its
SoTel SIP trunking service was qualified for use with Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007 R2. SoTel SIP Services are now available nation-wide
to all authorized Office Communications Server 2007 R2 resellers and their
customers. 

SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking is the de facto interconnection
standard for VoIP calling applications. Unlike in traditional telephony, where
bundles of physical wires were once delivered from the traditional Local
Exchange Carrier service provider to a business, a SIP trunk allows a company to
replace these traditional fixed PSTN lines with PSTN connectivity via a SIP
trunking service provider on the Internet. 

"Sotel provides our channel partners with a powerful communications solution,"
said Moz Hussain, director of the Unified Communications Group at Microsoft
Corp. "The combination of Sotel SIP Services with Office Communications Server
2007 R2 creates an innovative suite of communications services that can be
quickly brought to market by our partners." 

"The addition of Office Communications Server R2 to the growing list of
manufacturers with SIP certification on the SoTel network brings greater
flexibility and more options for both enterprise and SMB customers," said James
F. Goebel, CEO of SoTel Systems. "The rigorous testing process completed by
SoTel Systems ensures reduced costs, increased productivity and truly unified
communications." 

SoTel offers a variety of SIP trunking solutions to meet the needs of the SMB or
Enterprise customer, including:

* Opti-Max IP - unlimited local and long distance services over SIP trunks; 
* Opti-Plus IP - free in-bound calls and measured service for outbound calls
over SIP trunks; 
* Opti-Flex IP - measured service for all calls over SIP trunks; 
* Opti-Link IP - a convenient and flexible collaboration IP conference calling
solution; and 
* SIPCore - hosting application that delivers high-performance SIP call
routing.

One of the first applications to take advantage of SoTel`s SIP trunking service
is the Gold Systems Conference Server. Developed by Gold Systems, a Microsoft
Gold Certified Partner and unified communications expert, the product provides
conferencing services using Office Communications Server 2007 R2 and SoTel SIP
trunks. The system allows companies to host conference calls at a fraction of
the cost of outside conference services. "Until now it has not been practical
for companies to host their own conference calls with any kind of scale, so
conferencing service providers have thrived - and customers` costs have
exploded," says Terry Gold, CEO of Gold Systems. "With Office Communications
Server 2007 R2 software running on industry-standard servers, we can provide a
solution that`s less expensive to acquire and maintain. And by using SIP trunks
from SoTel Systems, users don`t need to pay for extra capacity that isn`t used
most of the time." 

About SoTel Systems, LLC

SoTel Systems, LLC is an Internet Telephony Services Provider (ITSP) offering
SIP service products to replace traditional TDM local and long-distance
services. In addition to SIP trunking applications, SoTel has distributed a
variety of voice and datacom products to the VAR and Interconnect communities
since 1981. Utilizing a unique soft switch technology developed internally by
SoTel, dubbed SIPCore, the company offers a robust bundle of SIP trunking
applications that position the reseller to improve competitive offerings. 

SoTel provides 24/7 Customer Support and the peace of mind of 99.999% network
availability. The target market for SoTel SIP Service is the SMB and Enterprise
sector where six business lines or more are required. Whether the application is
to link multiple customer sites, create connectivity for remote employees, or
simply network savings, SoTel is the SIP Service provider of choice. For more

&lt;p&gt;Odwalla`s Haiti Hope Mango Lime-Aid to Help Fund Collaborative Project with the
Haitian Government, the Inter-American Development Bank and TechnoServe
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today announced the creation of the Haiti Hope Project,
bringing together a coalition of business, government and civil society partners
to create opportunity for 25,000 Haitian mango farmers and their families by
supporting the development of a sustainable mango juice industry in the country.
This five-year project, currently estimated at $7.5 million seeks to double the
income of these farmers and to raise their standard of living, while
contributing to the long-term development and revitalization of Haiti. 

Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company was joined by Haitian
government officials and key stakeholders to announce the Haiti Hope Project at
the International Donors` Conference for Haiti held at the United Nations today,
"The Coca-Cola Company has been a part of the Haitian community since 1927 and
our local bottling partner, Brasserie de la Couronne, is the largest
private-sector employer in the country. Our $3.5 million investment in this
partnership will be joined by contributions from the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB). This project is a great example of how lives can be changed when
business, civil society and governments work together to build sustainable
communities and help to create economic opportunity." 

The Project has garnered support from President Bill Clinton, co-chair of the
Clinton Bush Haiti Fund and currently UN Special Envoy for Haiti, for its
long-term commitment to the Haitian people, "The Coca-Cola Company responded to
Haiti`s urgent immediate needs with financial support and beverages," said
President Clinton "The Haiti Hope Project goes a step further and exemplifies
the innovative role that partnerships with the private sector can play in the
reconstruction of Haiti." 

President George W. Bush, also co-chair of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund added
that "Coca-Cola has done something positive for Haitians by creating the Haiti
Hope Project. The Clinton Bush Haiti Fund will focus on long-term rebuilding and
will continue to promote bottom-up, job-creating investments such as this. I am
grateful to Coca-Cola for setting such a fine example." 

The Prime Minister of Haiti, Jean-Max Bellerive, met with Coca-Cola
representatives in Haiti earlier in March to discuss the Project. The Prime
Minister pledged Haiti`s support for the initiative, stating "Coca-Cola has
created the kind of action-oriented initiative that Haiti needs. This
partnership will create jobs and new sources of revenue for the people of Haiti.
We look forward to working with The Coca-Cola Company, IDB and their partners as
we focus our energies on rebuilding our country and achieving sustained economic
growth." 

The IDB is the leading source of long-term financing for development projects in
Latin America and the Caribbean. Its Multilateral Investment Fund (FOMIN), which
focuses on poverty reduction through work with micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises, has made the Haiti Hope Project eligible for $3 million in funding,
and expects to soon obtain its board's approval for the grant. IDB President
Luis Alberto Moreno added, "We are proud to join forces with The Coca-Cola
Company in this endeavor, which we hope will become a model of how the private
sector can play a critical role in Haiti's recovery. We call on other
corporations to follow their example, helping the Haitian people build a more
prosperous future." 

TechnoServe, a nonprofit dedicated to creating income, opportunity and economic
growth in the developing world through entrepreneurship, will implement this
project in Haiti in partnership with local organizations and the government.
TechnoServe will provide the services of its business advisors, who will help
Haitian mango farmers grow their crops more efficiently, produce additional
crops to boost their incomes, and create businesses that will allow them to
access markets. 

The Project will also improve the participation of women in fruit production and
develop opportunities for entrepreneurs to establish value-adding businesses in
the Haitian mango sector. "This Project will produce long-lasting benefits for
Haiti," said TechnoServe President and CEO Bruce McNamer. "This public/private
partnership will build on TechnoServe`s strong track record of similar
partnerships underway across the world, including banana, cashews, cocoa and
coffee. It will bring world-class business and industry expertise to develop the
private sector and improve Haitian livelihoods for many years to come." 

Consumers can contribute to this Project by purchasing Odwalla Haiti Hope Mango
Lime-Aid launched in the United States this month and a similar Odwalla Haiti
Hope beverage to launch early summer in Canada -- 100 percent of the profits
will be directed to the Project. Odwalla is a juice company that for 25 years
has lived by three principles: make great juice; do good things for the
community; and build a business with a heart. Odwalla Haiti Hope Mango Lime-Aid
is a delicious blend of Mango and Lime in a refreshing, quencher-style beverage,
that may be found at select retailers. Anyone can give directly to the Project,
without the purchase of the beverage, by texting "mango" via their mobile device
to 50555. 

This project will be implemented in close collaboration with the Haitian
government, given its significance in the country`s broader rebuilding efforts.
It is intended to produce lasting benefits for participating mango farm
communities, enabling them to benefit from improved livelihoods for many years
to come.

About the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund

In the aftermath of the earthquake, President Barack Obama asked President Bill
Clinton and President George W. Bush to raise funds for high-impact relief and
long-term recovery efforts to help those who are most in need of assistance. In
response, the two Presidents established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund (CBHF) to
respond to unmet needs in the country, foster economic opportunity, improve the
quality of life over the long term for those affected, and assist the people of
Haiti as they rebuild their lives and "build back better." The Clinton Bush
Haiti Fund is doing this by working with and supporting the efforts of reputable
501(c)(3) nongovernmental and nonprofit organizations. Presidents Clinton and
Bush oversee the CBHF through their respective nonprofit organizations, the
William J. Clinton Foundation and Communities Foundation of Texas. For more

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has won a three-year-old arbitration fight against Ecuador over a commercial dispute as it battles the country separately over an environmental claim against the company that could result in $27 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An arbitration panel ruled on Tuesday that Ecuador's courts violated international law by delaying rulings on commercial disputes between a subsidiary of the second-largest U.S. oil company and Ecuador's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arbitration panel partially resolved seven claims that Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, filed in Ecuador from 1991 to 1993, and awarded the company $700 million, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a partial decision," Ecuador's solicitor general, Diego Garcia, said in a statement. "It is inexact to say that Ecuador has been ordered to pay compensation of $700 million."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel found that Ecuador's courts had breached a trade treaty between the South American country and the United States by not ruling on the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the same treaty that Chevron is citing in its arbitration claim filed in September over alleged interference by the government in a blockbuster case brought by indigenous Ecuadoreans who accuse Texaco of damaging the environment and their health through its operations there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a ruling by the Ecuadorean judge on that case expected at some point this year, lawyers for the plaintiffs accused Chevron of forum shopping by bringing in the arbitrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has spent 17 years battling that claim, which a court expert has said could result in damages of up to $27 billion against the San Ramon, California-based company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs and Chevron both expect the court to rule against the company, which vows to appeal any ruling against it, arguing that Ecuador's courts are biased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its ruling on Tuesday, the panel found Ecuador violated the U.S-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty by not providing an effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have maintained for some time that Ecuador's courts are failing to administer justice when it comes to Chevron and its affiliates, and an international tribunal has now agreed," Chevron's general counsel, Hewitt Pate, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron filed the arbitration claim in December 2006, and the $700 million in damages is pending further proceedings to determine taxes, compound interest and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares rose more than 40 cents, or 0.5 percent, in extended trading in response to the ruling, after closing largely unchanged at $75.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall and Hugh Bronstein in Bogota; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds response from Ecuador's solicitor general)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, March 30 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has
won a three-year-old arbitration fight against Ecuador over a
commercial dispute as it battles the country separately over an
environmental claim against the company that could result in $27
billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An arbitration panel ruled on Tuesday that Ecuador's courts
violated international law by delaying rulings on commercial
disputes between a subsidiary of the second-largest U.S. oil
company and Ecuador's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The arbitration panel partially resolved seven claims that
Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, filed in Ecuador from 1991 to
1993, and awarded the company $700 million, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a partial decision," Ecuador's solicitor general,
Diego Garcia, said in a statement. "It is inexact to say that
Ecuador has been ordered to pay compensation of $700 million."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The panel found that Ecuador's courts had breached a trade
