&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM, which plans to spend a record $1.5 billion next year to develop and market security products, is seriously looking at using acquisitions to help beef up its offerings in that area, a company executive told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company, whose third-quarter revenue climbed 7 percent to $24 billion, sees security as a key to growth, said Val Rahmani, IBM's general manager of infrastructure management for global technology services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're looking at a lot of different companies right now, as we always do in a number of different spaces within security," she said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago International Business Machines paid $1.23 billion to buy Internet Security Systems. Rahmani declined to say when IBM might make its next purchase of a security company, or whether it was considering deals that size or larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is IBM's policy never to identify specific businesses that it might buy, to discuss deals that it has considered, or comment on any speculation about its acquisition activities, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she identified some areas that IBM is interested in: "Keeping the bad guys out and letting the good guys in, authenticating people once they are in and worrying about data if people leave it behind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM already has "pretty good coverage...but we could always do better," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said companies that are most attractive acquisition candidates are ones that can help IBM better predict future threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about understanding where the threats will be before they happen," she said.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - J.P. Hayes birdied five of the last nine holes to forge one stroke clear in the Disney Classic first round in Lake Buena Vista on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bidding for his third PGA Tour title, Hayes fired a seven-under-par 65 on the Magnolia course, one of two venues hosting the final event of the 2007 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron Beckman, boosted by an eagle on his opening hole, returned a flawless 66 on the Magnolia layout for a three-way share of second spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at six under were Scott Verplank, who twice chipped in for birdie, and Japan's Ryuji Imada after starting out on the neighboring Palm course at the Walt Disney World Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South African Tim Clark opened with a 67 to lie two strokes off the pace in a group of eight which also included former major winner Justin Leonard and U.S. Presidents Cup player Woody Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes, whose last PGA Tour victory came at the 2002 John Deere Classic, birdied three of the first four holes before bogeying the sixth for an outward nine of two-under 34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 42-year-old Wisconsin native then covered the homeward nine in a blistering five under par to edge one shot clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victory apart, the biggest incentive for many of the players in the Tour's season finale is to secure playing privileges for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading 125 in the final money list automatically earn full exemption for next year and Ted Purdy held the 125th spot going into this week with earnings of $758,734.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot on his heels were big-hitting J.B. Holmes, with $754,616, and beefy Kevin Stadler, with $737,276.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purdy opened with a 70 on the Palm course, finishing level with Holmes who played the Magnolia layout. Best of the trio was Stadler who shot a 69, also on the Magnolia course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds executive's comments on acquisition strategy, byline.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Nov 1 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N), which plans to spend
a record $1.5 billion next year to develop and market security
products, is seriously looking at using acquisitions to help
beef up its offerings in that area, a company executive told
Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, whose third-quarter revenue climbed 7 percent

Rahmani, IBM's general manager of infrastructure management for
global technology services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're looking at a lot of different companies right now,
as we always do in a number of different spaces within
security," she said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A year ago International Business Machines paid $1.23
billion to buy Internet Security Systems. Rahmani declined to
say when IBM might make its next purchase of a security
company, or whether it was considering deals that size or
larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is IBM's policy never to identify specific businesses
that it might buy, to discuss deals that it has considered, or
comment on any speculation about its acquisition activities,
she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she identified some areas that IBM is interested in:
"Keeping the bad guys out and letting the good guys in,
authenticating people once they are in and worrying about data
if people leave it behind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM already has "pretty good coverage...but we could always
do better," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also said companies that are most attractive

security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smaller companies such as McAfee Inc MFE.N, Check Point
Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP.O) and Websense Inc WBSN.O.
say they have an edge over big technology companies like IBM

mainly for software companies in a drive to expand its most
profitable business.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's discovery of a huge cocaine shipment from Colombia grew even larger on Thursday as the government more than doubled the size of the haul to 23 tons, making it one of the world's biggest drug busts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police, navy and customs officers found the drugs, the second major seizure in the past month, hidden between plastic floor-covering on a Hong Kong-flagged container ship at the Manzanillo port in Colima state on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They initially announced they found 11 tons but further searches of the ship revealed far more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So far, the haul amounts to more than 23 tons of cocaine. This is the biggest seizure of this drug in the country's history," the government said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the latest blow to drug gangs since President Felipe Calderon deployed thousands of troops across Mexico to attack the dominant Gulf and Sinaloa cartels after taking office last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seizure doubles the Mexican record, set only last month when soldiers found more than 11 tons of cocaine at the port of Tampico on the Atlantic coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Manzanillo have so far checked six containers on the Colombian boat, two of which were packed with cocaine divided into more than 21,000 packets. The search continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seizure "is further proof of President Calderon's commitment to cripple drug lords and bring them to justice," U.S. Ambassador Antonio Garza said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He put the value of the cocaine at $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. government said last month the average price of the drug on U.S. streets had risen to $118.70 per gram in the first six months of the year. That would give the Mexican haul an implied value of some $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 2,350 people have been killed in Mexico this year in drug violence, most of it between rival drug gangs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, a private jet with nearly 4 tons of cocaine aboard crashed into a southern Mexican jungle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Nov 2 (Reuters) - Brazil's state oil company Petrobras
(PETR4.SA) (PBR.N) will take a majority stake in an Exxon Mobil
group (XOM.N) refinery in Okinawa, Japan, in a deal estimated at
several billion yen, the Nikkei business daily said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Petrobras will acquire the entire 87.5 percent interest in
the oil refiner owned by Exxon Mobil subsidiary TonenGeneral
Sekiyu KK (5012.T) in an agreement to be signed this month, the
paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the purchase, Petrobras and Japanese trading house
Sumitomo Corp (8053.T), which owns the other 12.5 percent of the
refinery, will spend up to 100 billion yen ($870 million) to
upgrade the facilities, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil traders have been closely following the development of
the deal since it first emerged about a year ago.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
on Thursday that the Alabama Supreme Court has overturned a
$3.5 billion decision against the company, stemming from a
lawsuit over royalty payments to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In 2003, a jury found Exxon Mobil committed fraud in the
calculation of royalties it paid to the state on production
from its Mobile Bay natural gas wells, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the decision, Exxon was told to pay $3.5 billion in
punitive damages to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its appeal, the company argued the state had improperly
turned a contract dispute into a fraud action, the company
said.

&lt;p&gt;ZURICH (Reuters) - Former world number one Martina Hingis said on Thursday she had tested positive for cocaine during Wimbledon this year and announced her retirement from professional tennis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I have tested positive but I have never taken drugs and I feel 100 percent innocent," the five-times grand slam champion from Switzerland told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting back tears and with her voice cracking, Hingis read from a written statement before leaving the room without answering questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an expanded version of the statement later released by her management, the 27-year-old said she found the accusation of drug-taking "so horrendous, so monstrous, that I have decided to confront it head-on by talking to the press."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement added: "I would personally be terrified of taking drugs. When I was informed (about the test) I was shocked and appalled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hingis added that she had undergone a private test that came back negative and consulted an attorney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The attorney and his experts discovered various inconsistencies with the urine sample that was taken during Wimbledon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is also convinced that the doping officials mishandled the process and would not be able to prove that the urine that was tested for cocaine actually came from me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hingis said she had also been advised that any fight to clear her name could drag on for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have no desire to spend the next several years of my life reduced to fighting against the doping officials," she said. "I am frustrated and angry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe that I am absolutely, 100 percent innocent. The fact is that it is more and more difficult for me, physically, to keep playing at the top of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And frankly, accusations such as these don't exactly provide me with motivation to even make another attempt to do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: "And so, considering this situation, my age and the problems I have been having with my hip, I have decided to no longer play tennis on the Tour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After rising to the top of her sport with a much-admired blend of grace and tactical astuteness, Hingis suffered a string of injuries that forced her to first hang up her racket in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SURPRISE RETURN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She made a surprise return to the courts in 2006, proving her doubters wrong as she went on to win two more titles and end the year as world number seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further, final, title followed in Tokyo this year before her injury problems returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Hingis announced an early end to her season, citing hip problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's media conference was widely expected to see the former world number one announcing her retirement -- but not in the circumstances now set out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WTA Tour released a brief statement from chief executive officer Larry Scott on Thursday, mainly paying tribute to Hingis's achievements on the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The WTA Tour has not received any official information regarding the positive doping test result referred to... and as a result we are not in a position to comment," Scott began before going on to praise the player's "incredible touch, on-court intelligence and off-court professionalism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland's national tennis association also highlighted Hingis's attributes as a player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Martina Hingis was a great player who was always a role model and a figurehead for Swiss tennis," association president Rene Stammbach said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We regret very much that Martina is ending her career faced with these recriminations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional writing by Mark Ledsom in Berne)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - American journeyman Cameron Beckman holed a 36-foot birdie putt on his final hole for a share of the early first-round lead at the Disney Classic in Lake Buena Vista on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bidding for his second PGA Tour title, Beckman fired a flawless six-under-par 66 on the Magnolia course, one of two venues hosting the 2007 PGA Tour's final event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at six under was U.S. Presidents Cup player Scott Verplank, who rattled up six birdies on the neighboring Palm course at the Walt Disney World Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South African Tim Clark opened with a 67 on the Magnolia layout to lie one stroke off the pace with Americans Dicky Pride and Vaughn Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beckman, whose only PGA Tour victory came at the 2001 Southern Farm Bureau Classic, set the tone for a memorable day by eagling his opening hole, the par-five 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then picked up further shots at the 11th, 16th and 17th to reach the turn in five-under 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 37-year-old Minnesota native parred the next eight holes before signing off in style with his long-range putt on the ninth green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victory apart, the biggest incentive for many of the players in the Tour's season finale is to secure playing privileges for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading 125 in the final money list automatically earn full exemption for next year and American Ted Purdy held the 125th spot going into this week with earnings of $758,734.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot on his heels were big-hitting J.B.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) said on Thursday its third-quarter earnings declined 10 percent, missing expectations on sharply dropping profits from gasoline production and lower natural gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon's stock fell about 2.7 percent in afternoon trading and was a weight on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, which was down 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margins to produce and sell gasoline and other refined products fell sharply during the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of the drop in profits from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plummeting refining margins cut into gains from an oil price surge that saw crude hit $78 in September before marching on to new records in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income at the world's largest publicly traded company fell to $9.41 billion, or $1.70 a share, from $10.49 billion, or $1.77 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, had expected the company to earn $1.74 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refining margins crashed by as much as 90 percent from record highs reached in May, as the summer driving season ended, oil prices surged and gasoline prices did not keep up with the price increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reduced profits have also dragged down earnings at Exxon's largest competitors, BP Plc (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), offsetting oil prices that were much higher than a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The margins have remained tight in the fourth quarter, threatening to hold back earnings even as U.S. crude prices have surged over $90 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a real blood bath in refining margins right now, and that will largely offset the higher upstream earnings," said John S. Herold analyst Lysle Brinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECOND DROP IN A ROW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first time since 2002 that the company has had two consecutive quarterly earnings drops -- a period marked by a wild bull market for oil during which crude prices have tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has been hugely profitable over those years, pulling in more than $155 billion in profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even now, the company is just $300 million behind last year's earnings for the first nine months of 2006, a year when it posted the largest full-year profit in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the third-quarter rose 2.8 percent to $102.34 billion, a new record for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profits from its refining and marketing unit fell to $2 billion, down $737 million on the lower margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings from Exxon's exploration and production operations slipped 3 percent to $6.3 billion on lower natural gas prices and higher expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas production in the quarter fell 2 percent, due in part to shifts from production-sharing agreements with host countries, OPEC quotas and the loss of projects that were seized by the Venezuelan government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For big oil companies like Exxon, high oil prices have brought huge profits, but have also invited resource-rich countries like Nigeria, Kazakhstan, and Canada to reexamine their contracts with the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Halloran, who helps invest about $35 billion at National City Private Client Group, said these arrangements were cutting into Exxon's international profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's kind of a plateauing of what you can make in international because of production-sharing agreements," Halloran said. "And it's only going to get worse ... There's a trend here, and it's really going to be tough for companies to get a handle on as much of the upside from production as they used to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STILL SEEING DEMAND GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's average oil price rose about 12 percent in the U.S. and 9 percent abroad, while its natural gas prices fell 14 percent in the U.S., 3 percent in Europe and 4 percent elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Vice President of Investor Relations Henry Hubble said the company is still seeing some demand growth for its products despite high prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rate of growth is a little bit less than what we've seen in some previous years," Hubble said on a call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But basically we're continuing to see year-on-year growth, a lot of that coming in the Asia Pacific market. In the U.S., we're about flat this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon fell $2.45 to $89.54 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Wednesday's close, Exxon's shares were up about 20 percent this year, underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Oil Index .OIX, which rose about 29 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman)&lt;/p&gt;

which was down 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margins to produce and sell gasoline and other refined
products fell sharply during the quarter, accounting for more
than two-thirds of the drop in profits from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plummeting refining margins cut into gains from an oil
price surge that saw crude hit $78 in September before marching
on to new records in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income at the world's largest publicly traded company
fell to $9.41 billion, or $1.70 a share, from $10.49 billion,

$1.74 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Refining margins crashed by as much as 90 percent from
record highs reached in May, as the summer driving season
ended, oil prices surged and gasoline prices did not keep up

Exxon's largest competitors, BP Plc (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell

that were much higher than a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The margins have remained tight in the fourth quarter,
threatening to hold back earnings even as U.S. crude prices
have surged over $90 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a real blood bath in refining margins right now,
and that will largely offset the higher upstream earnings,"
said John S. Herold analyst Lysle Brinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SECOND DROP IN A ROW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the first time since 2002 that the company has had
two consecutive quarterly earnings drops -- a period marked by
a wild bull market for oil during which crude prices have
tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has been hugely profitable over those years, pulling
in more than $155 billion in profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even now, the company is just $300 million behind last
year's earnings for the first nine months of 2006, a year when
it posted the largest full-year profit in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in the third-quarter rose 2.8 percent to $102.34
billion, a new record for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profits from its refining and marketing unit fell to $2
billion, down $737 million on the lower margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings from Exxon's exploration and production operations
slipped 3 percent to $6.3 billion on lower natural gas prices
and higher expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil and gas production in the quarter fell 2 percent, due
in part to shifts from production-sharing agreements with host
countries, OPEC quotas and the loss of projects that were
seized by the Venezuelan government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For big oil companies like Exxon, high oil prices have
brought huge profits, but have also invited resource-rich
countries like Nigeria, Kazakhstan, and Canada to reexamine
their contracts with the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Halloran, who helps invest about $35 billion at
National City Private Client Group, said these arrangements
were cutting into Exxon's international profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's kind of a plateauing of what you can make in
international because of production-sharing agreements,"
Halloran said. "And it's only going to get worse ... There's a
trend here, and it's really going to be tough for companies to
get a handle on as much of the upside from production as they
used to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STILL SEEING DEMAND GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's average oil price rose about 12 percent in
the U.S. and 9 percent abroad, while its natural gas prices
fell 14 percent in the U.S., 3 percent in Europe and 4 percent
elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's Vice President of Investor Relations Henry Hubble
said the company is still seeing some demand growth for its
products despite high prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The rate of growth is a little bit less than what we've
seen in some previous years," Hubble said on a call with
reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But basically we're continuing to see year-on-year growth,
a lot of that coming in the Asia Pacific market. In the U.S.,
we're about flat this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon fell $2.45 to $89.54 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through Wednesday's close, Exxon's shares were up about 20
percent this year, underperforming the Chicago Board Options
Exchange's Oil Index .OIX, which rose about 29 percent over
the same period.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JP Morgan's
(JPM.N) infrastructure arm is among bidders shortlisted to
submit binding offers for United Utilities' (UU.L) power
distribution business Norweb, said people familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The fund, which last month led a group that agreed to buy
Southern Water from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) for 4.2
billion pounds including debt, is among those invited to submit
offers in November for Norweb, the people said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The business is expected to fetch between 1.3 billion pounds
($2.7 billion) and 1.5 billion, including debt assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Australia's Macquarie Bank MBL.AX, which had initially
taken part in the process and was hotly tipped by observers as a
candidate to buy the business, has now pulled out of the
auction, the people said, adding the Australian bank had decided
the business is too small and the auction too competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others expected to make binding second-round offers include
Hong Kong-based Cheung Kong Infrastructure (1138.HK) and
Bahrain-based buyout firm Arcapita, which also owns Northern
Irish power company Viridian, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While these offers are technically the second round, about
seven bidders had been asked to reaffirm their first-round bids
after due diligence last month before being whittled down to a
smaller number who will bid this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Utilities are viewed as relatively safe assets in an
economic downturn so are more isolated than most from the global
credit crunch, initially sparked by concerns over U.S. subprime
mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial bidders are prominent in the auction of Norweb,
whose wires carry electricity to the inhabitants of Manchester
in northwest England, because rival utilities have been put off
by terms of the sale, which include United Utilities keeping a
contract to operate the business, said the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Utilities, Arcapita, Macquarie and JP Morgan all
declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to show stock futures hitting session lows on Exxon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jennifer Coogan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were
sharply lower on Thursday after a provocative downgrade of
Citigroup (C.N) and write-downs at Credit Suisse, suggesting
the mortgage crisis may claim more casualties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding to pressure, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) reported earnings
that fell short of expectations and crude oil topped $96 a
barrel overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stocks will likely surrender the sharp gains they made
Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark fed funds
rate a quarter percentage point to 4.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse said its third-quarter investment banking
profit was all but wiped out by write-downs in leveraged loan
commitments, residential mortgages and collateralized debt
obligations. For details, see [ID:nL01556375].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In another troubling sign for financial shares, CIBC World
Markets downgraded Citigroup (C.N) to "sector underperformer,"
citing capital concerns for the biggest U.S. bank, while Credit
Suisse cut Citigroup to "neutral" from "outperform".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC also downgraded Bank of America (BAC.N) to "sector
performer", saying its sees a diminished revenue outlook for
the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you have the biggest, supposedly safest financial
company being accused of not having enough capital, what does
that say about a lot of other banks?" said Peter Boockvar,
equity strategist, Miller Tabak  Co in New York. "It's a major
issue and it's not just Citigroup. All these banks have the
same problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were down 17.6 points, below fair
value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking
into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration
on the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 fell 131
points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures were down 19.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon shares were down 2 percent to $90.15 in pre-market
trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup shares fell 3.2 percent to $40, a four and a half
year low, while Bank of America shares were down 1.8 percent to
$47.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indexes briefly pared some of their declines after a set of
September inflation readings largely matched economists'
forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Crocs (CROX.O) plunged 25 percent after the
trendy plastic shoe maker's profit outlook trailed Wall Street
forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In heavy volume before the market open, the stock tumbled
$18.90 to $55.85 after ending Wednesday's regular session at
$74.75. Ahead of the news, the stock hit a record $75.21 in
intraday trading on Wednesday and had more than quadrupled in
the last year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. equity index futures fell
sharply on Thursday after Citigroup (C.N) shares tumbled to
below $40 for the first time in four-and-a-half years in
pre-market trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Futures briefly pared losses after readings of inflation
and unemployment claims were in line with forecasts, but they
resumed their downward trajectory after Citigroup shares
slumped further following a brokerage downgrade. A
weaker-than-expected profit report from Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) was
also worrying to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Standard  Poor's 500 index futures SPc1 were down 19.3

down 1 percent or more.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Nov 1 (Reuters) - Chevron Geothermal Indonesia
Ltd, a unit of Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), plans to expand its
geothermal power capacity to meet growing electricity demand in
the Southeast Asian country, a company official said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron currently has geothermal power plants with a total
capacity of around 365 megawatts (MW) in West Java province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are very keen to expand our geothermal capacity. We are
considering whether we can expand from our operation in West
Java," Usman Slamet, a Chevron official, told reporters on the
sidelines of an energy conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not specify a time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, dotted with hundreds of active and extinct
volcanoes, has the potential to produce an estimated 27,000 MW
of electricity from geothermal sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the vast potential remains largely untapped
because of the high cost of generating electricity from
geothermal sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has no problem regarding financing and technology.
We are looking for possibilities to expand our geothermal
projects in other areas in Indonesia," Slamet said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, Asia Pacific's only OPEC member, is tapping
alternative energy sources to meet rising power demand and to
cut consumption of expensive crude oil as its own reserves
dwindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon Sembiring, the directorate general of geothermal and
mineral resources, said earlier this year many foreign firms
were interested in investing in geothermal energy projects in
Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firms include Icelands's Reykjavik Energy Invest which
signed a preliminary deal on Oct. 23 with Indonesia's state oil
firm Pertamina to develop a geothermal power plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mines and energy minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said in
February that electricity generated from geothermal sources
could rise to 9,500 MW by 2025 from 850 MW,.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, with its ageing power plants, needs to increase
electricity supply to avoid shortages in the world's
fourth-most populous country, where power demand is estimated
to be growing at around 10 percent a year.

the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chemoil said the new alliance would offer customers such as
shipowners and airlines a one-stop station to not just buy
physical barrels, but also hedge that exposure through the
service alliance formed by the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said shipping companies will now be able to hedge their
exposure more than 12-months out, but will also retain the
option to convert the swap into physical oil at the agreed port
of call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So if your paper is for Singapore, you can convert it to
physical barrels in Singapore," Chemoil's chief executive
officer Robert Chandran said, adding that the two companies is
expected to release more details on the deal in 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chemoil, which listed its stock in Singapore last December,
said it has the largest share of the marine fuel market in Los
Angeles. Chemoil stock rose nearly 3 percent to $0.535 in early
trade on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The alliance marks a push more than two-years ago by Wall
Street banks to have a greater presence in physical oil trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Having a foothold in the physical market gives banks such
as JP Morgan an edge, as cut-throat competition threatens to
squeeze margins on the core business of hedging volatile energy
prices for airlines, producers and industries.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Scott Verplank, helped by six birdies in his first nine holes, grabbed a one-shot lead in the Disney Classic second round at Lake Buena Vista on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Presidents Cup player fired a six-under-par 66 on the Magnolia course, one of two venues hosting the final event of the 2007 PGA Tour season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bidding for his sixth Tour title, Verplank raced to the turn in six-under 30 before parring the last nine holes in blustery conditions for a 12-under total of 132.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I kind of lost my rhythm a little bit and struggled to find it," the 43-year-old told reporters at the Walt Disney World Resort. "It got windier as the day went on and it's a different direction than you normally see around here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I got on such a nice roll in the first nine holes that I didn't kill myself by making a bunch of pars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Ames reeled off seven consecutive birdies on his way to a best-of-the-week 63 on the Palm layout and a tie for second place with Americans Tag Ridings (66) and Ryan Armour (64).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ames launched his red-hot run at the par-five first, his 10th hole of the day, before running up a three-putt bogey at the ninth where he missed a three-footer to save par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was more the putter than anything else that was working for me today," the 43-year-old Trinidad native said after covering his homeward nine in six-under 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEFT SHORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was trying to make nine birdies in a row and (hole) seven was a good up-and-down for birdie. Then I hit a four-iron to about 20 feet (at the eighth) and I thought I'd make that one too. But I didn't, I left it short."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twice PGA Tour winner Ames needed a total of 25 putts in his round, including three from just 10 feet on his final hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overnight leader J.P. Hayes was a further stroke back after carding a 69 on the Palm course, having surrendered a one-stroke advantage with one hole to play, the 500-yard ninth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes, who had opened with a 65, double-bogeyed his final hole after taking a penalty drop off the tee to slide into an eight-way tie for fifth at 10 under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those level with Hayes were Justin Leonard (67), big-hitting Brett Wetterich (65), Sean O'Hair (66) and Vaughn Taylor (67).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite bright morning sunshine at the Disney World Resort, course conditions remained soggy and preferred lies were in operation for the second day in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cut fell at three-under 141 with 89 players qualifying for the weekend. Among those missing out were former major winners Mark Calcavecchia, Tom Lehman, Shaun Micheel and Ben Curtis in danger of missing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta Nov 2 (Reuters) - Production at the Sable
natural gas project in the North Atlantic off the Canadian
province of Nova Scotia is not expected to be hampered by the
remnants of Hurricane Noel, a spokesman for operator Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Noel, whose intense rains are blamed for as many as 100
deaths in the Dominican Republic this week, is forecast to
become an intense extra-tropical storm and pass over Nova
Scotia by late Saturday, according to DTN Meteorlogix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've been watching the storm closely, and based on
current forecasts we don't expect it to affect our operations
offshore," Exxon Mobil spokesman Merle MacIsaac said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'll continue to monitor it to ensure the safety of all
our personnel and the integrity of the facilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sable, located 250 km (155 miles) southeast of Halifax,
Nova Scotia, produces more than 400 million cubic feet a day.
The gas is shipped to Atlantic Canada and New England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sable's other partners are Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L),
Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO), Pengrowth Energy Trust PGF_u.TO
and Mosbacher Operating Ltd.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said it was restarting
the gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit at its 394,000
barrel-per-day refinery in Beaumont, Texas, but had no timeframe for when
the unit would actually be up and running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the filing with the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality, the
company reported an air start-up event caused by the start-up of the FCC
unit following unplanned maintenance activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a pre-notification report for start-up of the unit once the
current maintenance is completed," said Prem Nair, a spokeswoman for the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said the refinery was still running at reduced rates but was unable
to give a time when the FCC unit would be restarted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit was shut down on Oct. 13 for unplanned work and was expected
to be out of service for three weeks, she said at the time.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) third-quarter earnings fell more than 25 percent, missing analyst estimates on sharply lower profits from gasoline production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Margins to produce gasoline and other refined products plummeted during the quarter as prices for the fuel did not keep pace with surging crude oil prices, dragging down earnings across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), BP Plc (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) all posted lower third-quarter earnings despite the sky-high oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, said on Friday its net income dropped to $3.72 billion, or $1.75 a share, from $5.01 billion, or $2.29 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding about $400 million of one-time items, it posted earnings of about $1.94 a share, coming in behind the average analyst estimate of $2.07 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the quarter rose to $55.17 billion from $54.21 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. refining margins plummeted by as much as 90 percent from record highs reached in May after the summer driving season ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly said in a statement that the company had difficulty recovering its higher fuel costs because the U.S. market was well-supplied with gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings at the company's refining and marketing segment fell 74 percent to $377 million, including a loss of $110 million from its U.S. refining and marketing operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are two elements to that red figure. One is more of an industry effect -- margins. The other is an operating effect that is company specific," said Benchmark Company analyst Mark Gilman, who has a "sell" rating on Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This company continues to operate its U.S. refining system poorly, and this is chronic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's U.S. refineries processed 168,000 fewer barrels of oil per day than last year, due to a mid-August fire at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery and a planned shutdown at its El Segundo, California, refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit from its exploration and production unit dipped to $3.43 billion from $3.5 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's worldwide production dropped about 4 percent to 2.6 million barrels a day, due mainly to changes to the company's operating agreements in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell 63 cents to $88.41 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Thursday's close, shares of Chevron were up about 21 percent this year, underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Oil Index .OIX, which rose about 25 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds brokerage comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 2 (Reuters) - Citigroup raised Coca-Cola Enterprises
Inc (CCE.N) to "buy" from "hold" and cut its rating on the
Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N to "hold" from "buy," saying
investors should book gains on PBG's shares and swap those
profits into CCE shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said shares of Coca Cola Enterprises, the
largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), are undervalued given
Glaceau's expansion to European markets. It raised its price
target on the stock to $31 from $25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola purchased Glaceau, the maker of vitaminwater and
smartwater, for $4.1 billion in June in a bid to boost its
position in the fast-growing market for noncarbonated drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said Glaceau's incremental volumes could add
between 19 cents and 27 cents to 2009 earnings per share for
Coca Cola Enterprises, and is not fully reflected in consensus
estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup cuts its rating on Pepsi Bottling Group, the
largest bottler of PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), based on valuation and
said there was a lack of meaningful catalysts in the near term.
It, however, raised its price target on the stock to $46 from
$45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said investors should book profits on PBG at
this juncture as the stock's valuation is fully reflecting the
benefits of its positive performance in 2007 as it is trading
close to its historical valuations.

&lt;p&gt;ZURICH (Reuters) - Former world number one Martina Hingis said on Thursday she had tested positive for cocaine during Wimbledon this year and announced her retirement from professional tennis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I have tested positive but I have never taken drugs and I feel 100 percent innocent," the five-times grand slam champion from Switzerland told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting back tears and with her voice cracking, Hingis read from a written statement before leaving the room without answering questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an expanded version of the statement later released by her management, the 27-year-old said she found the accusation of drug-taking "so horrendous, so monstrous, that I have decided to confront it head-on by talking to the press."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement added: "I would personally be terrified of taking drugs. When I was informed (about the test) I was shocked and appalled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hingis added that she had undergone a private test that came back negative and consulted an attorney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The attorney and his experts discovered various inconsistencies with the urine sample that was taken during Wimbledon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is also convinced that the doping officials mishandled the process and would not be able to prove that the urine that was tested for cocaine actually came from me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hingis said she had also been advised that any fight to clear her name could drag on for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have no desire to spend the next several years of my life reduced to fighting against the doping officials," she said. "I am frustrated and angry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe that I am absolutely, 100 percent innocent. The fact is that it is more and more difficult for me, physically, to keep playing at the top of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And frankly, accusations such as these don't exactly provide me with motivation to even make another attempt to do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: "And so, considering this situation, my age and the problems I have been having with my hip, I have decided to no longer play tennis on the Tour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After rising to the top of her sport with a much-admired blend of grace and tactical astuteness, Hingis suffered a string of injuries that forced her to first hang up her racket in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SURPRISE RETURN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She made a surprise return to the courts in 2006, proving her doubters wrong as she went on to win two more titles and end the year as world number seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further, final, title followed in Tokyo this year before her injury problems returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Hingis announced an early end to her season, citing hip problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's media conference was widely expected to see the former world number one announcing her retirement -- but not in the circumstances now set out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WTA Tour released a brief statement from chief executive officer Larry Scott on Thursday, mainly paying tribute to Hingis's achievements on the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The WTA Tour has not received any official information regarding the positive doping test result referred to... and as a result we are not in a position to comment," Scott began before going on to praise the player's "incredible touch, on-court intelligence and off-court professionalism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland's national tennis association also highlighted Hingis's attributes as a player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Martina Hingis was a great player who was always a role model and a figurehead for Swiss tennis," association president Rene Stammbach said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We regret very much that Martina is ending her career faced with these recriminations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional writing by Mark Ledsom in Berne)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Nov 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian state oil company
Petrobras (PETR4.SA) (PBR.N) will take a majority stake in an
Exxon Mobil group (XOM.N) refinery in Okinawa, southern Japan, to
tap the fast-growing Asian market, an industry source said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petrobras will buy an 87.5 percent interest in Nansei Sekiyu
KK, which operates the 100,000 barrels per day Nishihara
refinery, for several billion yen, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That stake is currently owned by Exxon Mobil's half-owned
subsidiary TonenGeneral Sekiyu (5012.T), while Japanese trading
house Sumitomo Corp (8053.T) owns the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the deal, Petrobras and Sumitomo are expected to invest
60 billion yen to 100 billion yen ($520 million-$870 million) to
upgrade the refinery and boost output of products such as
gasoline, kerosene and jet fuel, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source added that after the deal, Petrobras is likely to
sell some of its stake to Sumitomo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources said Petrobras was aiming to feed its own
crude output to the refinery to cut costs in a shrinking Japanese
market, where refining margins are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's Nikkei business daily said earlier that the agreement
would be signed this month and that Sumitomo would likely lift
its ownership in the refinery to 20 to 30 percent after
TonenGeneral withdraws and join Petrobras in sales of
petrochemical products in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Sumitomo spokesman said his company was aware that
Petrobras and TonenGeneral were in talks but that Sumitomo had
not yet made any decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sumitomo Vice President Noriaki Shimazaki told Reuters last
week that the issue had not been put to its board yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TonenGeneral Sekiyu said it had not made any decisions on the
matter, and an ExxonMobil spokesman in Tokyo declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil traders have been following the deal since news of it
first emerged about a year ago.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Overnight pacesetter Scott Verplank shrugged off a faltering start to hold a share of the lead in the Disney Classic third round at Lake Buena Vista on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American fired a one-under-par 71 for a 13-under total of 203, finishing level with Canada's Stephen Ames (70) in the final event of the 2007 PGA Tour season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five-times Tour winner Verplank dropped his first two shots of the week on the fifth and sixth holes before making a late surge with birdies at the 12th and 15th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ames, bidding for his third Tour title, broke two clear of a congested leaderboard with three birdies in five holes before losing momentum with three-putt bogeys on 16 and at the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody really did anything up at the top," Verplank, 43, told reporters after a blustery day on the rain-sodden Magnolia course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This golf course is still playing really long, making it much harder to hit it close which you occasionally need to do to make a bunch of birdies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is I'm tied for the lead but there's got to be 30 guys who have a chance to win."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, five players held a share of the lead as the scoring fluctuated wildly at the Walt Disney World Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUNCHED LEADERBOARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, the top 19 players were separated by just three shots going into the final round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justin Leonard returned a 70 to share third place at 12 under with fellow Americans Tim Petrovic (68), Tag Ridings (71) and Jeff Overton (69), plus Australian Mathew Goggin (69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big-hitting American Brett Wetterich eagled the par-five 10th to move one stroke in front before tumbling back into a tie for ninth spot with a 72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He bogeyed 12 and 15 and ran up a triple-bogey at the last where he incurred a two-shot penalty after touching a twig that was deemed a loose impediment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Brett had branches and sticks all around the ball that were loose impediments," PGA Tour rules official Jon Brendle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was taking some waggles to see if he could play the ball, accidentally touched the loose impediments and was given a two-stroke penalty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compatriot Rich Beem, winner of the 2002 PGA Championship, also vaulted to the top of the leaderboard with five birdies in the first 13 holes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he lost ground with a three-bogey run from the 15th for a 70 to finish level with Wetterich and nine others at 10 under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite bright sunshine, course conditions remained soggy and preferred lies were in operation for the third day in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from Fuyao, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Nov 5 (Reuters) - China's securities regulator has
blocked a $119 million deal by Fuyao Group Glass Industries Co
(600660.SS) to sell a nearly 10 percent stake to an investment
arm of Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Fuyao said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuyao, China's top automotive glass maker, said in a
statement that it had not won approval from the China Securities
Regulatory Commission for a proposal to issue shares to Goldman
in a private placement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman agreed in late 2006 to buy 111.28 million shares or a
9.98 percent stake in Fuyao at a price of 8 yuan per share, far
cheaper than Fuyao's last market close of 30.69 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal won Ministry of Commerce approval in August, but the
securities regulator blocked it, mainly because the government
did not want Fuyao to sell the stake too cheaply to foreign
investors, which could have prompted protests by Chinese
investors, the official China Securities Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuyao's board secretary Chen Yuedan declined to say whether
the firm would try to renegotiate the price with Goldman or
whether it would raise money in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will make an announcement if we make a decision on a
future move," Chen told Reuters by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuyao's shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange fell 3.55
percent to 29.60 yuan by 0327 GMT, underperforming a 1.44 percent
drop in the benchmark index .SSEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several foreign investment deals have been derailed by the
bull run in China's stock market, which has lifted companies'
share prices far beyond the levels that foreign buyers originally
agreed to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In August, the securities regulator blocked a separate plan
by Goldman to buy a 10.7 percent stake in Midea 000527.SZ, one
of China's top home appliance makers, for about $96 million.
Official media said the problem appeared to be the selling price.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - American Kevin Stadler secured his PGA Tour card for 2008 after a gut-wrenching final round at the Disney Classic in Lake Buena Vista on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beefy 28-year-old squeezed into the top 125 in the money list after tying for 15th in the season-ending event with a 10-under total of 278.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stadler began the week in 127th and knew he was flirting with the cut-off throughout Sunday's final round at the Walt Disney World Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't see it on every board but on most of them out there I was kind of floating around 124, 125, 126 all day," he told reporters after closing with a one-under 71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt pretty good out on the course but once I finished, it was completely out of my hands. I'm pretty glad it's over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stadler, who birdied two of the last six holes, ended his 2007 campaign in 124th place with earnings of $810,876. Swede Mathias Gronberg secured 125th on $785,180 after tying for 37th on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of his third full season on the PGA Tour, Stadler needed to make a two-putt par from 19 feet on the final hole, and did so after running his approach putt to within two feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It felt like putting for the tournament," he said with a smile. "It's pretty impossible to try and two-putt but that's what I was kind of doing there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously I would have liked to make it (the first putt) but my speed was pretty poor all day and I just didn't want to let it get away from me, even though it was uphill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stadler, whose father Craig won the 1982 Masters, started the final seven Tour events of this season reasonably safely in 108th spot in the money list before missing three cuts in five tournaments to spiral out of contention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I played very poorly for the majority of it and just kind of watched myself sink five, six, eight spots every week, which wasn't much fun," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I had a good week this week and I'm glad to be done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Canada's Stephen Ames validated almost a year of overhauling his swing when he clinched his third PGA Tour title by a shot at the season-ending Disney Classic in Lake Buena Vista on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 43-year-old Trinidad native, who has worked hard to shape a shallower swing to hit the ball higher and further, birdied three of the last six holes to end his 2007 campaign in triumphant style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tied for the overnight lead with American Scott Verplank, Ames broke clear of a tightly bunched field for the first time with a nine-foot birdie putt at the par-three 15th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He calmly parred the last three holes, getting up and down from a greenside bunker on 18, for a four-under-par 68 on the Magnolia course and a 17-under total of 271.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South African Tim Clark, who briefly held the outright lead at 16 under with two holes to play, finished second after closing with a six-birdie 66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verplank, hunting his sixth Tour title, edged ahead of the pack three times after making two birdies in the first seven holes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he twice missed birdie putts from inside six feet before slipping back into a tie for third at 14 under with a 71, finishing level with fellow Americans Tag Ridings (70) and Robert Gamez (68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is awesome and it's nice to be back in the winner's circle again," a beaming Ames told reporters after claiming the first prize of $828,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER REASON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were planning on going to Maui for Christmas anyhow and now we have another reason to go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from earning a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour, Ames also wins a spot in the winners-only field for the opening event of 2008, the Mercedes-Benz Championship in Maui from January 3-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably most heartening of all, though, for the Canadian is that his swing is holding up smoothly under tournament pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is starting to feel natural now where I can get up and feel the shots that I want to hit," said Ames, who was forced to overhaul his swing after suffering back problems toward the end of his 2006 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today resulted in that and the whole week did altogether."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In bright, breezy conditions at the Walt Disney World Resort, six players held at least a share of the lead during a wildly fluctuating final round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of the day, the rock-steady Verplank appeared to be the likeliest winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birdies at the second and the seventh helped him reach the turn in two-under 34 for a one-shot cushion going into the back nine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Verplank picked up two more shots at the 10th and 14th, his title bid effectively ended at the par-four 16th where he missed a six-footer to save par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryce Molder, boosted by a 20-foot eagle putt at the 14th, and fellow American Jeff Overton briefly held a share of the lead before Ames took control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian shrugged off a three-putt bogey at the 11th with three consecutive birdies from the 13th to all but seal the final event of the 2007 PGA Tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a superb bunker shot to three feet at the last, Ames coolly tapped in the victory putt before pumping his right fist in celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) cut
its projection for energy demand growth slightly on Monday,
saying it expected greater gains from energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, said it now expected
worldwide demand for energy to increase by about 1.3 percent a
year between 2005 through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, the company said it expected demand to rise 1.6
percent a year for 2000 through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding 2000 through 2004, the company forecast growth of
1.4 percent a year over the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the growth is expected to come from developing
countries, where Exxon sees 2 percent a year demand growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In developed countries, Exxon only sees 0.5 percent demand
growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company still expects fossil fuels to account for about
80 percent of the energy mix in 2030, with natural gas showing
more growth than projected last year and coal slightly less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has long been accused by critics of being
environmentally unfriendly, working to disprove science
supporting climate change and resisting limits on greenhouse
gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it sees carbon dioxide emissions rising
about 2 percent a year through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said slowing that growth would require "global
participation, step changes in energy efficiency, technology
gains and massive investment over decades."

&lt;p&gt;VANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce (CM.TO) said on Monday it expects a gain it
will earn in the fourth quarter from the restructuring of
credit card company Visa Inc. to offset a writedown on the U.S.
mortgage-related securities it holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; At the same time, CIBC's chief executive dismissed market
talk that Canada's fourth largest bank may use the money it
will get from the sale of the bulk of its U.S. capital markets
business to make another acquisition anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CEO Gerry McCaughey said that in the current tough
environment for banks, one that could remain difficult for some
time, preserving its capital was CIBC's top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A transaction at this time is improbable given our view
that capital strength is extremely important," McCaughey said
on a conference call to discuss the sale, announced on Sunday,
of most of CIBC World Markets' U.S. operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would see capital strength taking precedence somewhat
over capital deployment at this time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC is due to report its fourth quarter results on Dec. 6.
Investors and analysts have been particularly interested to
know what further writedowns the bank could face on its book of
collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CDOs are pools of loans that have ties to subprime
mortgages, a market in the United States that has been pummeled
by defaults and resulted in several of the world's largest
banks, including Citigroup Inc (C.N) and UBS AG (UBSN.VX)
writing off billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect the Visa gain to essentially offset the CDO ...
on a pre-tax basis," Chief Financial Officer Tom Woods said on
the same conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woods said CIBC had not yet finalized the writedown amounts
on the CDOs. He also declined to give an amount for the Visa
gain, which CIBC alerted the market to on Oct. 3 and which
several other Canadian banks will also benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC wrote down C$290 million ($312 million) before tax, or
C$190 million after tax, in its third quarter results because
of CDOs and residential mortgage-backed securities related to
the U.S. mortgage market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time of its third-quarter results in August, CIBC
said its overall exposure to the U.S. residential mortgage
market before writedowns was approximately US$1.7 billion,
excluding exposure directly hedged with other counterparties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It estimated then that less than 60 percent of this
exposure relates to underlying subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC's shares closed up 5 Canadian cents at C$98.15 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday. Most of its peers were
slightly weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said at the weekend it will sell CIBC World
Markets' U.S. investment banking, institutional sales,
corporate syndicate lending and options trading businesses,
plus others, to Oppenheimer Holdings Inc (OPY.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the U.S. sale reduces "accident prone" CIBC's
risk profile but also limits expansion opportunities for the
bank, which like other large Canadian banks, faces a mature and
competitive banking market at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "CIBC is nowhere near as risky a bank as it was at the end
of last week," said Dundee Securities analyst John Aiken in a
note to clients on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This transaction substantially reduces its exposure to the
areas of the business that have historically plagued CIBC's
results with writedowns and other charges," Aiken said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC has pulled in its horns in the past two years after it
paid out US$2.4 billion to settle lawsuits related to its
alleged role in the failed Enron Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Nicole Mordant; Editing by Rob Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds comments from study researcher at heart
meeting)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kim Dixon and Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Fla./NEW YORK Nov 5 (Reuters) - Researchers have
been unable to nail down the cause of increased deaths that led
Pfizer Inc  (PFE.N) to drop its once-promising cholesterol drug
torcetrapib, leaving a cloud over similar drugs in development
by other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, halted development
of torcetrapib last year after a large study found it raised
the risk of death in heart patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An analysis of that study did yield new clues about the
drug's impact on blood chemistry, but it remains to be seen
whether the harmful effects were specific to the Pfizer drug or
could spell trouble for the entire class of experimental
medicines called CETP inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysis, presented on Monday at the American Heart
Association's annual scientific meeting in Orlando, does not
rule out "the possibility that CETP inhibition per se may have
adverse effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the lead researchers said clues derived from the
analysis of the 15,067-patient Illuminate trial support further
review of other drugs in the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trial was halted in December when safety monitors found
an unacceptably high rate of deaths and other adverse heart
events in the torcetrapib group. It was Pfizer's most promising
new product and its most expensive research failure to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug was designed to raise levels of "good" HDL
cholesterol while also lowering "bad" LDL cholesterol. It
raised HDL levels by an impressive 72 percent, and lowered LDL
levels by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RIVALS LOOK ON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drugmakers working on similar drugs -- Merck  Co (MRK.N),
and a collaboration between Switzerland's Roche Holding AG
(ROG.VX) and Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) -- are closely watching
for clues on a class effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Philip Barter, the head researcher on the failed trial,
said insight from the analysis and several others reports
released on Monday suggest there is still hope for CETP
inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The trial leaves the way open for further exploration,"
said Barter, who presented the analysis at the AHA meeting. He
said he hoped researchers working on CETP inhibitors had the
courage to continue their work on their compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The findings of the analysis and another report released at
the meeting appear to derail a theory that certain types of HDL
may be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, the analysis found that the higher the HDL, the
lower the rate of harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trial compared two groups of patients -- one taking
both torcetrapib and Pfizer's blockbuster drug Lipitor, and the
other taking LDL-lowering Lipitor alone. When the study was
halted, there were 93 deaths in the torcetrapib group and 59 in
the Lipitor-only group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Causes of death came from both heart and non-heart-related
events and included increased rates of death from cancers and
infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cancer deaths were not statistically significant, and
there was no increase in incidence of new cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rise in infection deaths, which was statistically
valid, was a "big surprise," Barter said. "Clearly, for the
class of drugs, it's very important," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ELECTROLYTE LINK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An increase in blood pressure had been seen throughout the
torcetrapib development program and had long been suspected of
being the link to the increased heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the drug also appears to have affected levels of
electrolytes and other chemicals in the blood in ways that will
require further study, according to the new analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients in the torcetrapib group had a decrease in
potassium and increases in serum sodium, bicarbonate and
aldosterone, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Review of data found increased risk of death was seen in
those patients whose reduction in potassium or increase in
bicarbonate was greater than the median change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paradoxically, there was increased risk of major cardiac
events in patients whose increase in blood pressure was less
than the median, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bicarbonate is a chemical that keeps pH levels in the blood
from becoming too acid. Aldosterone regulates electrolytes in
the body, including sodium and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers said the mechanism by which torcetrapib
increased aldosterone levels is unknown.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Monday his firm's acquisition of a 1.6 percent stake in socializing Web site Facebook for $240 million was an important investment, not a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We didn't make a mistake," Ballmer told reporters on the sidelines of a business conference in Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said Microsoft paid a steep price on a bet that the three-year-old firm would be able to transform itself into a hub for all sorts of Web activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The valuation of Facebook is still to be determined. Certainly today, it's very, very popular. So for a company like ours that wants to be a pre-eminent presence in this space, it's very important for us," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Will Facebook be worth $5 billion, $15 billion or $50 billion some years down the line is really up to their team and how they take it forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who joined Microsoft in 1980 at the request of his Harvard classmate Bill Gates, said last month that the company was focusing on up to 20 smaller acquisitions of $50 million to $1 billion each annually rather than mega-deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Microsoft was interested in buying Yahoo Inc, Ballmer said: "My answer is a considered 'no comment'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to succeed in the online advertising space. What happens with Yahoo, we'll all have to wait and see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who is going to China on Monday night, said the Chinese market was important to Microsoft and that they were making some progress on the issue of intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've made some progress, and there's better respect for software intellectual property there than there was three years ago," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That said, it's still lower than in a lot of other countries. So depending on how you look at it, life's getting better, or life's bleak," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, officials said pirated software worth $500 million, including counterfeit Microsoft and Symantec products, had been seized in a long-running joint probe by Chinese police and U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said more than a fifth of its software running globally was pirated and that cracking down on them can boost sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also said technology companies may face a lower capital spending by businesses because of the turmoil in the financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some concerns about the impact that interest rates, the debt market problem and defaults might have on business spend," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So we will have to keep an eye on it. I don't think things will collapse completely but we do think that there may be some sort of a setback or a cut down to capital spending," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

told Reuters that his company may sell a 20 to 25 percent stake
to foreign investors prior to an overseas IPO as early as 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources said, however, that the stake sale to Goldman
and the others would result in the IPO being brought forward to
next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The share sale is intended to help fund the Chinese
shipbuilder's rapid expansion amid a shipping industry boom,
the first source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The deal is close to being finished and Goldman is also
expected to sponsor Rongsheng's IPO next year," said the second
source, adding that Rongsheng was considering the Hong Kong
stock market as one option for its IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined to comment, while
Rongsheng's Chen could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IPO WAVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rongsheng, which aims eventually to compete with much
bigger state-owned rivals such as Guangzhou Shipyard
International Co (600685.SS) (0317.HK), is joining many of its
peers in seeking to tap the capital markets to fund rapid
expansion, which has been fuelled by China's booming global
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, a senior official of state-owned China
Shipbuilding Industrial Corp told the official Shanghai
Securities News that it was considering a domestic IPO that may
help it to raise 6 billion to 7 billion yuan next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You get more orders (for shipbuilding), so you need more
money to support your business expansion," said the second
source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's what almost every Chinese shipbuilder is doing," he
said. "If you fail to fund your fast expansion, then you will
be acquired by someone who is faster and bigger than you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While expanding its product profile into crude oil tankers
and container ships, Rongsheng is exploring opportunities in
the maritime engineering sector to help offset a possible
downturn in the cyclical industry, which may level off in the
next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rongsheng was also in talks with several potential clients
in the offshore engineering sector, including the country's
dominant offshore oil developer CNOOC Ltd. (0883.HK), and hopes
to land big-ticket orders soon, Chen told Reuters in April.

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is looking to build 
a theme park on a 500-acre (202-hectare) site in southern 
Malaysia, a business weekly reported on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Citing unnamed sources, the Edge said the theme park, to be 
located in Bardar Nusajaya in the Iskandar development zone, 
would be ready six years after a deal was signed, according to 
early proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed Disneyland theme park and resort is slated to 
be bigger than Hong Kong Disneyland and about the size of Tokyo 
Disney Resort, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government unveiled a $105 billion blueprint late last 
year to transform the southern tip of Johor state, which 
neighbors Singapore, into a regional economic zone for 
industry, logistics, trade and leisure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the talks with Disney are progressing fast, 
discussions with other theme park operators, including Warner 
Bros Entertainment and MGM, have not ceased, the Edge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, a deal with Walt Disney looks most promising as 
it has expressed its seriousness and has come out with 
specifications on its requirements," it quoted a source as 
saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the talks with Disney are successful, a deal is expected 
to be signed by the middle of next year, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Malaysia's state-controlled UEM World is developing Bandar 
Nusajaya, a township in southwest Johor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 2,200 square km (850 sq miles) Iskandar zone has so far 
clinched at least $6 billion in investments, including a $4.7 
billion maritime park proposed by Dubai World and Malaysia's 
infrastructure-to-energy group MMC Bhd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sees potential for its Xbox 360 video game console to stay on the market longer than the five-year lifespan that is typical for gaming hardware, an executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about long-term prospects for the game industry, Mindy Mount, chief financial officer for Microsoft's entertainment division that includes the Xbox, pointed to Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 2, which is still going strong after 7 years on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Look at the PS2; they've gone long-time and seem to have pretty good legs on what they are doing," Mount told a BMO Capital Markets conference on interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we were able to do that, as CFO I think that's great, because every year you draw it out you increase profitability," Mount said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft launched the Xbox 360 in November 2005, replacing the original Xbox that debuted four years earlier to challenge Sony for dominance in a video game industry that is on track to hit $40 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mount said features such as high-definition graphics make new machines attractive when compared against older hardware, but hinted that she sees less need to rush out an all-new console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this point from the technological perspective, there are some real advances ... that make it worth having a next-generation console," Mount said. "Right now there aren't that many things on the horizon that you think, wow, that's going to be a game-changer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Scott Hillis, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to late morning)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks erased gains and
were little changed on Tuesday as a brokerage's dour view on
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) weighed on technology shares, while
investors worried that record crude oil prices could squeeze
consumers and corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concern about more credit losses among financial services
companies also weighed on sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs removed Microsoft from a "buy" list, saying
the software maker's earnings momentum may have peaked in its
first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq 100 .NDX and
SP 500, with its shares falling 1.9 percent to $36.03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude oil futures rose more than $3 to a record high $97 a
barrel amid a weaker dollar and supply concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If people start noticing going into the Christmas season
they're going to have to spend more at the pump, it might not
be a good thing," said Tom Schrader, managing director of U.S.
equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore,
Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 12.44
points, or 0.09 percent, at 13,530.96. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX was down 0.02 point at 1,502.15. The Nasdaq
Composite Index .IXIC was down 8.44 points, or 0.30 percent,
at 2,786.74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think you're going to continue to see weakness in the
financials until we get a sense the subprime and loan debacle
at all of these money-center banks and brokerage firms has run
its course," Schrader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among financial stocks, shares of Citigroup Inc (C.N), the
largest U.S. bank, extended losses since the company's warning
of $11 billion more in loan losses and the departure of Chief
Executive Charles Prince.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup fell 2 percent to $34.96.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN Nov 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on
Tuesday it will spend $500 million on building a new European
data processing centre in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said in a statement the planned Dublin centre will
house tens of thousands of servers providing information and
Web-based applications to Internet users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Construction will begin later this month with the centre
expected to be completed by 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the first `mega data centre' deployment outside the
U.S. specifically targeted for the growth and performance of
Windows Live services," said John Mangelaars, Vice President,
Microsoft Online Services Group, Europe, Middle East and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm said an additional "substantial" investment was
planned to kit out the centre with server technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 51,000 square metre facility will deliver Windows Live
services and store data for the company's online services
businesses such as MSN and Windows Live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources said the highly automated facility would
create around 20 jobs. Microsoft employs 1,200 staff in Ireland
at another site in Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said the Irish government and regional
administration had shown "great commitment to growing
next-generation businesses".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fact that Ireland has been selected as the location for
this strategic infrastructure is a very strong endorsement of
the success of our operations here over the past 22 years,"

&lt;p&gt;VANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce (CM.TO) said on Monday it expects a gain it
will earn in the fourth quarter from the restructuring of
credit card company Visa Inc. to offset a writedown on the U.S.
mortgage-related securities it holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; At the same time, CIBC's chief executive dismissed market
talk that Canada's fourth largest bank may use the money it
will get from the sale of the bulk of its U.S. capital markets
business to make another acquisition anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CEO Gerry McCaughey said that in the current tough
environment for banks, one that could remain difficult for some
time, preserving its capital was CIBC's top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A transaction at this time is improbable given our view
that capital strength is extremely important," McCaughey said
on a conference call to discuss the sale, announced on Sunday,
of most of CIBC World Markets' U.S. operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would see capital strength taking precedence somewhat
over capital deployment at this time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC is due to report its fourth quarter results on Dec. 6.
Investors and analysts have been particularly interested to
know what further writedowns the bank could face on its book of
collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CDOs are pools of loans that have ties to subprime
mortgages, a market in the United States that has been pummeled
by defaults and resulted in several of the world's largest
banks, including Citigroup Inc (C.N) and UBS AG (UBSN.VX)
writing off billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect the Visa gain to essentially offset the CDO ...
on a pre-tax basis," Chief Financial Officer Tom Woods said on
the same conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woods said CIBC had not yet finalized the writedown amounts
on the CDOs. He also declined to give an amount for the Visa
gain, which CIBC alerted the market to on Oct. 3 and which
several other Canadian banks will also benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC wrote down C$290 million ($312 million) before tax, or
C$190 million after tax, in its third quarter results because
of CDOs and residential mortgage-backed securities related to
the U.S. mortgage market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time of its third-quarter results in August, CIBC
said its overall exposure to the U.S. residential mortgage
market before writedowns was approximately US$1.7 billion,
excluding exposure directly hedged with other counterparties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It estimated then that less than 60 percent of this
exposure relates to underlying subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC's shares closed up 5 Canadian cents at C$98.15 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday. Most of its peers were
slightly weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said at the weekend it will sell CIBC World
Markets' U.S. investment banking, institutional sales,
corporate syndicate lending and options trading businesses,
plus others, to Oppenheimer Holdings Inc (OPY.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the U.S. sale reduces "accident prone" CIBC's
risk profile but also limits expansion opportunities for the
bank, which like other large Canadian banks, faces a mature and
competitive banking market at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "CIBC is nowhere near as risky a bank as it was at the end
of last week," said Dundee Securities analyst John Aiken in a
note to clients on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This transaction substantially reduces its exposure to the
areas of the business that have historically plagued CIBC's
results with writedowns and other charges," Aiken said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC has pulled in its horns in the past two years after it
paid out US$2.4 billion to settle lawsuits related to its
alleged role in the failed Enron Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Nicole Mordant; Editing by Rob Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Nov 7 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on
Wednesday it will invest $500 million for a new "server farm"
data center in a Chicago suburb in the latest investment to
enhance its Internet services business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The 550,000-square-foot (51,100 square-metre) data center
in Northlake, Illinois, comes on the heels of Tuesday's
announcement that the software maker will invest an additional
$500 million to build a server farm in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Server farms are massive buildings housing tens of
thousands of powerful computers and data storage systems,
providing the base infrastructure upon which Microsoft can
create a wide range of Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From its Xbox Live online video game system to its Windows
Live e-mail and instant messaging applications, Microsoft plans
to include an element of Web services in every one of its
business divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's capital expenditures have surged in recent
years as the company invests billions of dollars in new data
centers to keep pace with Web rivals Google Inc. (GOOG.O) and
Yahoo Inc. YHOO.O, who are also rolling out a variety of
services to engage Internet users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft will lease the property
from data center service provider Ascent Corp. and real estate
firm The Koman Group. Ascent helped identify the location, set
up some of the facility's infrastructure and develop the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The facility's construction is expected to be completed in
April 2008.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa, the world's largest credit card network, has agreed to settle a three-year-old anti-trust lawsuit with rival American Express Co (AXP.N) for about $2.1 billion, Visa said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The settlement stems from a 2004 suit American Express filed against Visa, MasterCard (MA.N) and eight banks that claimed the card associations' "anti-competitive practices" prevented 20,000 U.S. banks from using its credit card products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement must be approved by Visa's members and would be funded by members of Visa USA, not Visa Inc, which is preparing for an initial public offering, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, American Express will receive $945 million in March from Visa and an additional payment from the banks named in the case under a judgment sharing agreement. The rest, up to $1.12 billion, will be paid in installments of up to $70 million per quarter over four years, Visa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said the total nominal amount paid under the settlement will be $2.065 billion. American Express said it could receive a maximum of $2.25 billion under the settlement, including the additional payment from the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement also resolves American Express's claims against US Bank Trust National Corp UBTNL.PK, Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N), Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) which were also named in the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was originally filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, just one month after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected appeals by Visa and MasterCard of a ruling that the two credit card associations violated antitrust law by barring banks from issuing credit cards for rival networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks were sued because they had been members of one or both credit card associations' boards of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement leaves MasterCard as the lone defendant in the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We plan to move forward with the litigation to hold MasterCard accountable for the illegal actions that blocked banks from working with us for many years and to seek full compensation for the value that would have been generated for our shareholders," American Express Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard is "confident in our position" and still planning to pursue the case in court, a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The case is set to go to trial in September, according to court documents, but MasterCard executives have also said in the past they would be open to settlement talks, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig Maurer, an analyst at Calyon Securities, said the settlement was a positive for Visa, removing uncertainty in advance of its initial public offering. The agreement also suggests "a near-term resolution" for MasterCard, which would remove a significant legal overhang on the company, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given that MasterCard has traditionally had half the market share of Visa, we would estimate that any settlement with American Express would total approximately $1 billion," Maurer said on Wednesday in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Visa's latest prospectus filing, if the suit had to go to trial, the company could have faced triple damages because the suit was brought under federal antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Martha Graybow)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Nov 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said a
Wednesday upset would have no impact on production at its
150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in
Torrance, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery had been planning to do minor maintenance on
the unit, which tripped offline Wednesday afternoon, said
spokeswoman Carolin Keith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The work will go forward and only take a few hours, Keith
said. She declined to identify the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Torrance refinery is also performing three weeks of
work on a gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit
and an alkylation unit, which began on Nov. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wednesday's unit upset was unrelated to the FCC and alky
unit work, Keith said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express (AXP.N) on Wednesday said it had reached a settlement with Visa, removing Visa from a lawsuit American Express had filed against rivals for anti-competitive practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co confirms that it has reached an agreement to drop Visa as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging that MasterCard, Visa and their member banks had illegally blocked AXP from the bank-issued card business in the United States. Under terms of the settlement agreement, Visa will pay a maximum amount of $2.25 bln to AXP. Individual banks named in the lawsuit will also be dropped as defendants. These include: J.P. Morgan Chase, Capital One, U.S. Bancorp, Wells Fargo and Providian. The agreement is subject to the approval of Visa's member banks. Under terms of the agreement reached with Visa, Inc., Visa USA, and Visa International, AXP will receive an aggregate maximum payment of $2.25 bln. An initial payment of $1.13 bln will likely be recognized by AXP in income during the fourth quarter 2007. The remainder, payable in installments of up to $70 mln per quarter over the next four years, is subject to achieving certain quarterly performance criteria within the U.S. network services business of AXP. In light of the settlement, AXP said that it is likely to incur a number of significant additional fourth quarter expenses, including: Incremental investments in marketing, promotion, rewards, cardmember services and other business building initiatives designed to capitalize on competitive opportunities in the payments industry at a time when some competitors are pulling back. Additional funding for the AXP Foundation, which will support the company's ongoing philanthropic activities. Litigation expenses related to the lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard. This settlement was announced earlier today on CNBC, see 11:08 comment.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it is adding a feature to its Xbox 360 that limits the amount of time children can play video games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move comes as the software giant tries to make the Xbox 360 more attractive to mainstream consumers ahead of the holiday buying season that is the biggest time of year for the video game industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the customer base broadens, the demand for these kinds of capabilities does increase," said Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new timer can be set to limit playing time on a daily or weekly basis, and turns off the console when the time limit is reached. A similar feature is found in Microsoft's Windows Vista computer operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft research showed 90 percent of parents had some restrictions on video gaming, with half of those being limits on playing time, Bach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The number-one tool they miss is the ability to enforce time restrictions electronically on the console," Bach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360, which competes with Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS Wii, already has a feature that allows parents to restrict the kind of games that are played based upon their content rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also unveiled an initiative with groups such as the National Parent Teacher Association and Boys  Girls Club to educate families about video game content and encourage parents and children to work out rules around gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Scott Hillis; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. released on Tuesday a suite of free Web services that connect to its Windows operating system, delivering a major element of its strategy to maintain the dominance of its software while extending its reach on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package of "Windows Live" services, which was first released in a test version in September, makes available in a single download updated versions of e-mail, instant messaging, photo gallery, blogging and event planning applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the new software suite, users can access their free Web e-mail through a downloaded desktop application -- similar to Office Outlook used by many businesses -- instead of using a Internet browser to check, reply or write e-mails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Windows PC users with a single click can either save photos to the computer's hard drive or publish and store the pictures on the Web using Windows Live Photo Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up against competitors looking to replace traditional Microsoft software that runs on a computer's hard drive with software run over the Internet as a service, the company faces a dilemma that strikes at the core of its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does it dive headfirst into Web services at the expense of its dominant Windows and Office franchises? Or does it ignore the shift to Web services and risk outdating its bread-and-butter businesses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's solution is to straddle the line between the two with a strategy called "software plus services." The idea is to develop new Web services that complement, but not replace, its traditional software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft can't take a brand new approach with services on the Internet because it has to protect Windows and Office," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEB AND DESKTOP MEET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the company's strategy, look no further than the executive pushing its Windows Live agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Jones, a Microsoft corporate vice president, is well versed in both the Web and desktop worlds. Jones worked on developing new versions of its Windows operating system after guiding Microsoft's early Internet Explorer initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now he's responsible for leading a team of Web developers who will try to weave the company's software that runs for free on the Internet like its free Hotmail e-mail, rebranded as Windows Live, together with license-generating desktop software like Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those links must also extend to cell phones, so users can access services from mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people connect to the Internet using a Windows PC, most people use Internet Explorer, many people use Office. We have lots of Hotmail users and lots of (instant) messenger users," Jones said in an embargoed interview this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we just stitch it together and remove the seams, what an opportunity we have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By fostering loyalty to its Web services, Microsoft can create a valuable audience to sell to advertisers. Microsoft and its Web rivals like Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. are all jockeying to capitalize on the surge of advertising money flowing to the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft sees the market for online advertising doubling in size to $80 billion in two or three years from its current $40 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans a marketing campaign that will highlight the potential benefits of downloading its new Web services suite to work with its new Windows Vista operating system. The new services are available at www.windowslive.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar's Tran said the company has been hindered by a fragmented message to consumers about its Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Web business, Microsoft has two umbrella brands in MSN and Windows Live, while individual applications sometimes share branding like Hotmail and Windows Live Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's important to get a cohesive message to consumers," said Tran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Crude oil prices are likely to retreat from near $100 to around $80 a barrel, boosting refining margins which have been dented by the rally, a senior Chevron Corp. executive said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashok Krishna, vice president of technology for Chevron global downstream said the refining industry was particularly squeezed because crude's record rally coincided with the end of the summer driving season, when gasoline demand usually falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His outlook for next year was more positive although he did not expect margins to recover to highs of $24 hit earlier this year, he told reporters on the sidelines of the Hart world refining and fuels conference in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My view is long term prices won't stay this high, they will probably be in the $80 range, and gasoline prices will adjust to this, giving reasonable margins," Krishna said, adding that this price outlook was a personal view, not Chevron's position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm said last week that third-quarter earnings fell more than 25 percent from a year earlier, missing analyst estimates on sharply lower profits from gasoline production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. refining margins have plummeted by as much as 90 percent from record highs reached in May. Crude oil hit what was then a record of $78 in September before marching on to new highs near $100 this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Krishna said the rise had not dented demand growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think demand is going to drop off based on price any time soon, nothing I see in China, India or the US is going to really cause that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we are stuck with ever increasing demand and we are stuck with more difficult to find crude," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However despite rapidly rising demand in China, the world's number two oil consumer, Chevron is not looking for refinery investments there, Krishna said, in part because it is reluctant to enter a loss-making market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-set price caps for diesel and gasoline have pushed Chinese refiners into the red much of the time in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Marketing we have some presence and we have been involved in some upstream projects," Krishna said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Nov 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sees potential for its Xbox 360 video game console to stay on the market longer than the five-year lifespan that is typical for gaming hardware, an executive said on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Asked about long-term prospects for the game industry, Mindy Mount, chief financial officer for Microsoft's entertainment division that includes the Xbox, pointed to Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 2, which is still going strong after 7 years on the market.    "Look at the PS2; they've gone long-time and seem to have pretty good legs on what they are doing," Mount told a BMO Capital Markets conference on interactive entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "If we were able to do that, as CFO I think that's great, because every year you draw it out you increase profitability," Mount said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft launched the Xbox 360 in November 2005, replacing the original Xbox that debuted four years earlier to challenge Sony for dominance in a video game industry that is on track to hit $40 billion this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mount said features such as high-definition graphics make new machines attractive when compared against older hardware, but hinted that she sees less need to rush out an all-new console. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "At this point from the technological perspective, there are some real advances ... that make it worth having a next-generation console," Mount said. "Right now there aren't that many things on the horizon that you think, wow, that's going to be a game-changer." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Scott Hillis, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Bob Iger said he had not seen any signs that economic weakness was weighing on advertising or travel, but a Hollywood writers strike that began this week could cut into network profits if it lasted more than four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESPN drove the networks' growth with a rise in advertising and affiliate revenue from higher rates and more subscribers, as well as more previously deferred revenue than last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadcast television posted a $30 million operating loss due to fewer TV shows selling into syndication and the shutdown of the mobile phone service, which was overseen the division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's domestic theme parks benefited from growth in visitor spending and attendance, as the weak dollar kept U.S. travelers from going abroad. Deteriorating attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland weighed on results, and the park had to renegotiate its debt terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares ticked down a few cents in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $877 million, or 44 cents per share, from $782 million, or 36 cents per share, in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue rose 3 percent to $8.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding a 2-cent-per-share tax-related benefit, Disney earnings were 42 cents per share, in line with Wall Street's average target. Analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $9.02 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto said Disney, which now has posted double-digit operating growth for six quarters, should see "another year of solid growth" despite a softer consumer environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the shares have the potential to appreciate even in a decelerating economic environment ... with drivers of growth coming from content-driven success," Noto said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC AD SALES STRONG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media networks revenue rose 14 percent to $4.0 billion, and operating income at the segment rose 25 percent to $1.1 billion. Parks revenue rose 10 percent to $2.8 billion, while the unit's income rose 9 percent to $430 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's domestic resorts saw an uptick of mid-single-digit percentages in room reservations and attendance, and spot ad sales at its ABC network were running "strong" double-digit percentages ahead of its upfront sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network, with the top-rated prime-time schedule, may be forced to cut costs and slot in more reality shows, news and reruns if the writers' strike lasts more than a month, Iger said. Disney's movie studio won't be affected by it until 2009, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio posted a 24 percent decline in revenue to $1.5 billion in the quarter, and a 21 percent drop to $214 million in operating income, compared with a year ago when "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" was playing in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer products revenue rose 5 percent to $590 million and its operating profit climbed 10 percent to $139 million on the success of "High School Musical" and "Cars" merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said it plans to boost capital expenditures by $250 million to $300 million in fiscal 2008, with the new money going to digital improvements at its studio and networks, and to improvements at its theme parks, particularly California Adventure in Anaheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creditors of the Hong Kong Disneyland joint venture agreed to suspend the debt covenants of a $293 million commercial loan for a year and give partners access to a credit revolver that had been frozen, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In exchange, the joint venture will repay the principal by September 30, 2008, and Disney will forgo royalties from the park for "a couple of years," Staggs said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like rivals Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) and Viacom Inc VIAb.N, Disney is benefiting this year from a string of box office blockbusters and strong cable advertising rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's share price rose less than 1 percent in its fourth quarter ended September 29. The stock was trading at a multiple of 15.7 times estimated 2008 earnings, compared with 15.7 for Time Warner and 15.6 for Viacom, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock fell to $33.55 in after-hours trade from a close of $33.63 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Nov 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), the
second-largest U.S. entertainment company, reported on Thursday
a 12 percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by sports network
ESPN and U.S. theme parks, but revenue just missed Wall
Street's target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Bob Iger said he had not seen any signs
that economic weakness was weighing on advertising or travel,
but a Hollywood writers strike that began this week could cut
into network profits if it lasted more than four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ESPN drove the networks' growth with a rise in advertising
and affiliate revenue from higher rates and more subscribers,
as well as more previously deferred revenue than last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broadcast television posted a $30 million operating loss
due to fewer TV shows selling into syndication and the shutdown
of the mobile phone service, which was overseen the division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's domestic theme parks benefited from growth in
visitor spending and attendance, as the weak dollar kept U.S.
travelers from going abroad. Deteriorating attendance at Hong
Kong Disneyland weighed on results, and the park had to
renegotiate its debt terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares ticked down a few cents in after-hours
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income rose to $877 million, or 44 cents per share,
from $782 million, or 36 cents per share, in last year's fiscal
fourth quarter. Revenue rose 3 percent to $8.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding a 2-cent-per-share tax-related benefit, Disney
earnings were 42 cents per share, in line with Wall Street's
average target. Analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of
$9.02 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto said Disney, which now
has posted double-digit operating growth for six quarters,
should see "another year of solid growth" despite a softer
consumer environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the shares have the potential to appreciate
even in a decelerating economic environment ... with drivers of
growth coming from content-driven success," Noto said in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC AD SALES STRONG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media networks revenue rose 14 percent to $4.0 billion, and
operating income at the segment rose 25 percent to $1.1
billion. Parks revenue rose 10 percent to $2.8 billion, while
the unit's income rose 9 percent to $430 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's domestic resorts saw an uptick of mid-single-digit
percentages in room reservations and attendance, and spot ad
sales at its ABC network were running "strong" double-digit
percentages ahead of its upfront sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The network, with the top-rated prime-time schedule, may be
forced to cut costs and slot in more reality shows, news and
reruns if the writers' strike lasts more than a month, Iger
said. Disney's movie studio won't be affected by it until 2009,
he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studio posted a 24 percent decline in revenue to $1.5
billion in the quarter, and a 21 percent drop to $214 million
in operating income, compared with a year ago when "Pirates of
the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" was playing in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer products revenue rose 5 percent to $590 million
and its operating profit climbed 10 percent to $139 million on
the success of "High School Musical" and "Cars" merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said it plans to boost capital expenditures by $250
million to $300 million in fiscal 2008, with the new money
going to digital improvements at its studio and networks, and
to improvements at its theme parks, particularly California
Adventure in Anaheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creditors of the Hong Kong Disneyland joint venture agreed
to suspend the debt covenants of a $293 million commercial loan
for a year and give partners access to a credit revolver that
had been frozen, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In exchange, the joint venture will repay the principal by
Sept. 30, 2008, and Disney will forgo royalties from the park
for "a couple of years," Staggs said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like rivals Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) and Viacom Inc
VIAb.N, Disney is benefiting this year from a string of box
office blockbusters and strong cable advertising rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's share price rose less than 1 percent in its fourth
quarter ended Sept. 29. The stock was trading at a multiple of
15.7 times estimated 2008 earnings, compared with 15.7 for Time
Warner and 15.6 for Viacom, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock fell to $33.55 in after-hours trade from a close
of $33.63 on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hollywood writers who walked off the 
job this week are wasting their time in a "stupid" strike, 
former Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Michael Eisner said on 
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I've seen stupid strikes, I've seen less stupid strikes 
... This is a stupid strike," Eisner said during a panel 
discussion at the Media and Money conference sponsored by Dow 
Jones  Co Inc and Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a waste of their time," Eisner said. "[The studios] 
have nothing to give. They don't know what to give."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studios have dismissed writers' demand on payments related 
to new digital technologies, such as movies shown on the 
Internet and cell phones, arguing that they first need to see 
how the new areas evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 12,000 writers went on strike on Monday after their 
contract expired last week and talks collapsed over the 
weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several late-night talk shows such as NBC's "The Tonight 
Show with Jay Leno" have been thrown into immediate reruns, and 
at least six prime-time comedies, including the CBS hits "Two 
and a Half Men" and "The New Adventures of Old Christine," have 
halted production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NBC Universal is owned by General Electric Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV networks have said they have enough new episodes of the 
shows to last for at least a few weeks before they are also 
forced into repeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's ABC has postponed the planned debut of a new drama 
series, "Cashmere Mafia" -- from the end of November until 
January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prime-time drama series generally are said to have enough 
stockpiled scripts and episodes to take them into early next 
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Robert MacMillan and Megan Davies)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes on economy, strike)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Nov 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief
Financial Officer Tom Staggs on Thursday said advertising sales
were strong despite the difficult economic climate, but Disney
would look to cut costs if the strike by Hollywood
screenwriters, which began this week, drags out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Concerns over the economy and, more specifically, the
travel and tourism and the ad market are of consideration for
many companies this year," Staggs said on a conference call
after Disney reported quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While these factors could impact our 2008 results, thus
far our businesses remain strong and we have not seen
indications of a downturn," said Staggs. Disney's domestic
theme parks, rooms on the books and attendance to date for the
first quarter are mid-single-digit percentages ahead of last
year, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Disney's media networks, the advertising marketplace
remains very healthy, he said, with prices in the scatter
market -- ad time bought close to air dates -- particularly
strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said ABC's scatter pricing was running strong, about
double-digit percentages ahead of the company's pricing for
upfront ads -- commercial time purchased around May for the
fall season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said that while some strength in scatter pricing was
being driven by tightening supply, underlying demand in the
marketplace was very strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cable net advertising is also very solid with ad sales
trending up double digits in the first quarter," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said it was premature to predict the impact of the
Writers Guild of America strike against major film and
television studios, but he said an extended walkout would first
have an impact on Disney's television operations. The strike
began on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Film results will be impacted later and probably not until
2009," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Of course, we will pursue opportunities to reduce costs
in order to mitigate any impact from a prolonged work
stoppage," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Bob Iger said that the ABC television
network, which already has delayed the start of drama "Cashmere
Mafia," had about four weeks of programs ready to air. "If the

definitely have an impact upon ABC's schedule," he said.

&lt;p&gt;Washington has spent more than $4 billion in Colombia as part of a project to fight cocaine-traffickers and guerrillas, but Democrats debating funding are questioning whether the program has succeeded in slashing drug shipments to U.S. streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Walters, U.S. national drug control policy director, said the U.S.-backed campaign and more cooperation between Colombia and Mexico had disrupted the flow of cocaine sufficiently to push up prices by 44 percent -- one sign of scarce supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have never had disruptions of this magnitude," Walters told reporters during a visit to Bogota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said law enforcement figures showed shortages of cocaine in 37 U.S. cities. Purity of cocaine has decreased 15 percent over the last nine months, according to U.S. figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics of Plan Colombia -- the U.S.-funded anti-narcotics drive in Colombia -- have often dismissed U.S. government reports of price rises and drops in cocaine purity, saying they represent only short-term trends and not a sustained fall in drug supplies to the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration chief Karen Tandy said in May that the price of cocaine had in the past risen by as much as 50 percent for as long as seven months but had always fallen back down again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Colombia's cocaine ends up in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aided by U.S. funds, President Alvaro Uribe has reduced violence from a four-decade-old guerrilla war by sending troops to retake areas once under rebel control and negotiating the surrender of violent paramilitaries who once fought the rebels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats who control the U.S. Congress have proposed reviewing Colombia's aid package to reduce the emphasis on military funds and aerial spraying of coca crops and increase spending on economic development and alternative crop programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations reported earlier this year that while production of coca leaf used to make cocaine had decreased in Colombia, output of the drug still hovered around 600 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Patrick Markey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 8 (Reuters) - Rayovac battery maker Spectrum
Brands Inc SPC.N posted a better-than-expected quarterly
profit on Thursday and said it signed an exclusive deal with
Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), sending shares up about 22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Kent Hussey also said on a conference call
that he expects the company, whose products include Remington
shavers and Tetra pet products, to be hurt by a slowdown in
consumer spending, just like every other consumer goods
company, but that it is more insulated than some of its peers
since its batteries cost less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it signed a 3-year deal with Disney making
it the exclusive supplier of batteries to all Disney parks and
giving it the right to use Disney characters in marketing and
promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spectrum said that excluding items it earned 23 cents per
share in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average were expecting 5 cents per share,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a net basis, Spectrum posted a loss of $333.0 million,
or $6.60 per share, compared with a loss of $439.4 million, or
$8.88 per share, a year earlier when it took a massive charge
to write down trade names and goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net sales rose 13 percent to $548.2 million due to sales
volume increases and the impact of the weak dollar, which
boosts the value of international sales when they are converted
back to U.S. dollars for inclusion on the company's income
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spectrum said in September it would sell the Canadian
division of its home and garden segment to a company formed by
a unit of a Toronto-based investment firm and Clarke Inc
(CKI.TO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said another time that it was trying to sell "an
attractive strategic asset" other than the home and garden
division but would not specify further. Analysts have said the
most likely other asset up for sale would be the company's pet
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said last month it would delay the asset sale
due to the recent credit crunch. Spectrum on Thursday said it
did not know exactly when the sale would take place but
remained committed to that option. It added that it would
rather wait for the credit turmoil to ease than sell the asset
for a discounted price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the quarter was another step in the right
direction for the company and the recovery in lawn and garden
and strong performance in pet (products) bodes well for the
possible divestiture of these businesses," wrote Suntrust
Robinson Humphrey analyst William Chappell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spectrum shares were up 88 cents, or 21.9 percent, at $4.90
on the New York Stock Exchange after reaching $4.92.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to midmorning)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 8 (Reuters) - U.S. technology stocks fell on
Thursday as investors worried that the spillover from the
credit crisis may be starting to hurt business spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke also
added caution after he said in testimony before Congress that
the economy faced risks on both the growth and inflation
fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors sold shares of technology companies a day after
Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) Chief Executive John Chambers said
his company was hit by dramatic decreases in orders from U.S.
banks and retailers, triggering concerns about Cisco's growth
prospects and sending its shares plunging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Cisco, the largest maker of computer networking
equipment, led declines on the Nasdaq, down 6.5 percent at
$30.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's all Cisco," said Steve Goldman, market strategist at
Weeden  Co in Greenwich, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cisco, since September, has had a decent run in the face
of a down market. With the market becoming skittish, the
Googles of the world had been holding up great until today,
(but) there's just so much they can take."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 9.10
points, or 0.07 percent, at 13,290.92. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX was up 1.75 points, or 0.12 percent, at
1,477.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 21.04
points, or 0.77 percent, at 2,727.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Higher crude oil prices lifted shares of Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N), whose 3 percent advance limited losses on the Dow and
underpinned the SP 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernanke's said that when Fed policy-makers met on Oct.
30-31, they saw both downside risks to economic growth and
"important upside risks" to inflation, citing oil and other
commodity price increases and a drop in the dollar's value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The housing market contraction seems likely to intensify,
and household spending and business investment may decelerate
as well, he added. For details, see [ID:nN08571272].

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Asset Management sees few signs that the bull equity market is over despite concerns about credit, a greater chance of U.S. recession and extreme valuation levels in currency markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Shairp, global strategist at the investment firm, told Reuters on Wednesday that his firm had recently taken some risk from its portfolio but that it remains relatively bullish on equities over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It expects the period to be one of high volatility, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are cautious on the economy but optimistic on the markets," Shairp said at a Reuters briefing. "We have yet to see any of the conditions to be met to see the end of the bull market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those conditions include recession, inflation, overvaluation of equities and currency problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shairp said that global inflation was becoming a concern to some investors but that it was likely to be a bigger issue towards the end of 2008 and going in to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason, he said, was that labour in developed markets has little pricing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that JPMorgan's own U.S. recession gauge was pointing to the increased risk of a downturn in the U.S. economy but that it was unlikely to stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gauge attempts to predict recessions by tracking changes in cyclical employment, industrial production, retail sales, unemployment claims, housing starts and cyclical versus defensive stocks prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think that we should bet on a recession at this stage," Shairp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity market valuation, meanwhile, was still pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXTREME DOLLAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shairp did say that a number of currencies were now at extreme levels -- the dollar fell to $1.47 per euro on Wednesday -- but that the U.S. currency's decline had not been disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By and large, the activity we have seen in the dollar has been orderly ... (but) the dollar has now reached levels that are at pretty extreme lows," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested that the rise of the euro had added the equivalent of 25 basis points to euro zone interest rates and that this could now become a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, JPMorgan AM continues to favour European equities. It is overweight in equities as a whole versus bonds, preferring U.S. large caps, Europe including Britain, and Pacific ex Japan stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa, the world's largest credit card 
network, has agreed to settle a three-year-old anti-trust 
lawsuit with rival American Express Co (AXP.N) for about $2.1 
billion, Visa said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The settlement stems from a 2004 suit American Express 
filed against Visa, MasterCard (MA.N) and eight banks that 
claimed the card associations' "anti-competitive practices" 
prevented 20,000 U.S. banks from using its credit card 
products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The settlement must be approved by Visa's members and would 
be funded by members of Visa USA, not Visa Inc, which is 
preparing for an initial public offering, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the agreement, American Express will receive $945 
million in March from Visa and an additional payment from the 
banks named in the case under a judgment sharing agreement. The 
rest, up to $1.12 billion, will be paid in installments of up 
to $70 million per quarter over four years, Visa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said the total nominal amount paid under the 
settlement will be $2.065 billion. American Express said it 
could receive a maximum of $2.25 billion under the settlement, 
including the additional payment from the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The settlement also resolves American Express's claims 
against US Bank Trust National Corp UBTNL.PK, Wells Fargo  
Co (WFC.N), Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), JPMorgan Chase  Co 
(JPM.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) which were also 
named in the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit was originally filed in U.S. District Court in 
Manhattan, just one month after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected 
appeals by Visa and MasterCard of a ruling that the two credit 
card associations violated antitrust law by barring banks from 
issuing credit cards for rival networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The banks were sued because they had been members of one or 
both credit card associations' boards of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The settlement leaves MasterCard as the lone defendant in 
the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We plan to move forward with the litigation to hold 
MasterCard accountable for the illegal actions that blocked 
banks from working with us for many years and to seek full 
compensation for the value that would have been generated for 
our shareholders," American Express Chairman and Chief 
Executive Kenneth Chenault said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard is "confident in our position" and still 
planning to pursue the case in court, a company spokeswoman 
said on Wednesday. The case is set to go to trial in September, 
according to court documents, but MasterCard executives have 
also said in the past they would be open to settlement talks, 
the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Craig Maurer, an analyst at Calyon Securities, said the 
settlement was a positive for Visa, removing uncertainty in 
advance of its initial public offering. The agreement also 
suggests "a near-term resolution" for MasterCard, which would 
remove a significant legal overhang on the company, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given that MasterCard has traditionally had half the 
market share of Visa, we would estimate that any settlement 
with American Express would total approximately $1 billion," 
Maurer said on Wednesday in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Visa's latest prospectus filing, if the suit 
had to go to trial, the company could have faced triple damages 
because the suit was brought under federal antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Martha Graybow)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - More than 125 striking executive producers from shows including "Ugly Betty," "Law  Order: Special Victims Unit" and "Lost" protested at the gates of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank as the Writers Guild of America's strike entered its third day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Every day the producers don't give us a fair and decent deal is a wasted day in Hollywood," "Ugly Betty" creator Silvio Horta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing a T-shirt reading "Wasted Days" written in the famous Disney font, Horta and fellow "Betty" executive producer Marco Pennette said it was important for all showrunners to get together and be seen supporting the strike, which began Monday after contract talks broke down over payment for DVDs and digital downloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the sake of the show, we worked on the scripts up to the deadline," Pennette said. "And for the sake of the actors, they can shoot something. But we chose to not cross the line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the showrunners: "SVU's" Neal Baer, "Entourage's" Doug Ellin, Carlton Cuse of "Lost," veteran producer John Wells ("ER"), and "Desperate Housewives" creator Marc Cherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today is very much about showing solidarity among showrunners," said Cherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more shows begin to close up shop, Cherry said he expects to see more Screen Actors Guild members turn out at the picket lines. Next week, Cherry said, there will be special pickets featuring actors, and on Friday, the "entire guild membership" is supposed to show up at 20th Century Fox studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the march, the showrunners gathered at the Smoke House Restaurant in Burbank for a lunch that was paid for by a talent agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyewitness reported that discussions between moderates and militants escalated into a heated debate over the guild's bargaining strategy as well as the spectrum of producing duties showrunners could perform during a strike. No punches were thrown, though the verbal barbs were said to be sharp and unusually multisyllabic. According to sources, the debate later moved to the WGA headquarters in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - More than 125 striking 
executive producers from shows including "Ugly Betty," "Law  
Order: Special Victims Unit" and "Lost" protested at the gates 
of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank as the Writers Guild of 
America's strike entered its third day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Every day the producers don't give us a fair and decent 
deal is a wasted day in Hollywood," "Ugly Betty" creator Silvio 
Horta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wearing a T-shirt reading "Wasted Days" written in the 
famous Disney font, Horta and fellow "Betty" executive producer 
Marco Pennette said it was important for all showrunners to get 
together and be seen supporting the strike, which began Monday 
after contract talks broke down over payment for DVDs and 
digital downloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For the sake of the show, we worked on the scripts up to 
the deadline," Pennette said. "And for the sake of the actors, 
they can shoot something. But we chose to not cross the line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the showrunners: "SVU's" Neal Baer, "Entourage's" 
Doug Ellin, Carlton Cuse of "Lost," veteran producer John Wells 
("ER"), and "Desperate Housewives" creator Marc Cherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today is very much about showing solidarity among 
showrunners," said Cherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As more shows begin to close up shop, Cherry said he 
expects to see more Screen Actors Guild members turn out at the 
picket lines. Next week, Cherry said, there will be special 
pickets featuring actors, and on Friday, the "entire guild 
membership" is supposed to show up at 20th Century Fox studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following the march, the showrunners gathered at the Smoke 
House Restaurant in Burbank for a lunch that was paid for by a 
talent agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eyewitness reported that discussions between moderates and 
militants escalated into a heated debate over the guild's 
bargaining strategy as well as the spectrum of producing duties 
showrunners could perform during a strike. No punches were 
thrown, though the verbal barbs were said to be sharp and 
unusually multisyllabic. According to sources, the debate later 
moved to the WGA headquarters in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on Kaplan and El-Erian, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Svea Herbst-Bayliss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Nov 9 (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs vice
chairman and business school professor will temporarily manage
Harvard University's $35 billion endowment after its top money
manager resigned unexpectedly, the university said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Kaplan, who oversaw Goldman's investment banking and
investment management divisions and now teaches at Harvard
Business School, will start as chief executive of Harvard
Management Company (HMC) on Monday, the university said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaplan will succeed, at least for a while, Mohamed
El-Erian, a highly regarded emerging markets specialist, who in
less than two years, rebuilt the world's largest university
endowment after his predecessor left to launch a hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; El-Erian said in September that he would rejoin Pacific
Investment Management Co., surprising the Harvard and
investment communities. El-Erian will leave at the end of the
year and Kaplan's will overlap with him three days a week for
the next month to ensure a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Running Harvard's endowment has long been considered a plum
job in the investment world. But it has also been a difficult
one amid friction with a a small but vocal number of Harvard
alumni who complain regularly about the multimillion dollar
salaries the university pays its money managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It took months to appoint El-Erian after Jack Meyer, who
had been at Harvard Management for 15 years, announced that he
and several dozen HMC employees would leave to found Convexity
Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; El-Erian had to rebuild his staff but managed to keep up
the university's hallmark strong investment performance -- the
endowment returned 23 percent in fiscal 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaplan earned his MBA at Harvard and has been involved in
investment bank and money management for years at Goldman
Sachs. He headed Goldman's Asia-Pacific Investment Banking unit
and later moved back to New York where he became co-head of
global investment banking. Kaplan is currently a senior
director of the Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When El-Erian announced his departure there was some
speculation that an insider might possibly be tapped to run the
endowment. Harvard is using a search firm to help identify
candidates but university spokesman John Longbrake declined to
comment further on the process.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co Inc on Friday said shaky credit markets could trigger more write-downs in the fourth quarter as the bank is exposed to about $50 billion worth of leveraged loans, risky subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan did not give any specific potential write-down figures in a quarterly filing. But the bank said unstable market conditions could affect results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As previously disclosed, the bank's portfolio of held-for-sale leveraged lending commitments stood at $40.6 billion at the end of September. These commitments are hard to hedge against losses as the market for corporate debt used in leveraged buyouts has diminished substantially in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Further markdowns could result if market conditions worsen for this asset class," the bank said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, JPMorgan wrote down $1.3 billion, after fees, on the leveraged loan portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the bank also may have to write down its portfolio of subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations or CDOs, whose downturn has walloped rivals such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's exposure to CDOs is about $6.8 billion and about $2.6 billion for risky subprime mortgages.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 9 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) on Friday launched a new commodity index aimed at capturing returns across the futures curve for 33 commodities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The JPMorgan Commodity Curve Index (JPMCCI) will allocate investments based on the open interest available in specific commodities, with 46 percent going into energy, 25 percent to industrial metals, 19 percent to agriculture, 8 percent to precious metals and 3 percent to livestock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "JPMCCI holds exposure along the entire futures curve in proportion to the open interest of each tenor," JPMorgan said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investors traditionally use commodities indexes such as the S GSCI and the DJ-AIGCI to hedge portfolios against exposure to other asset classes such as equities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Many such "long only" indexes invest in the front month of commodities futures contracts and shift their investments to second-month contracts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But these indexes can rack up losses if the front-month contract is cheaper than the second-month, a market situation called contango. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The JPMCCI adopts a simple, curve-neutral approach, holding exposure long the commodity futures curve according to the open interest of each tenor," the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Matthew Robinson; editing by Walter Bagley) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((matthew.robinson@reuters.com; +1 646 223 6052; Reuters Messaging: matthew.robinson.reuters.com@reuters.net))   Keywords: JPMORGAN COMMODITIES/INDEX &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds stock action)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO Nov 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Friday cut its
rating on 3M Co (MMM.N) to "sell" from "neutral," saying the
diversified manufacturer's stock should underperform in the
near term, sending shares down 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Deane Dray said he is less optimistic that
productivity gains at the maker of such products as Scotch tape
and Post-It notes can offset the loss of $200 million to $250
million in operating profit in the optical film business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Further, we are concerned about prospects for
disappointing 2008 guidance as management ... is planning for a
'worst-case scenario' for its U.S. consumer-related businesses
in 2008," Dray said in a research note. "We see downside to
2008 consensus and are cutting our estimate 10 cents to a below
consensus $5.25."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts are expecting a 2008 profit of $5.42 a share,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dray cut his price target on 3M's stock by $20 to $77 a
share. 3M's shares fell $2.49 to $80.34 in early trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M's third-quarter
profit topped expectations, but shares fell as investors
worried about falling profits in the liquid crystal display
television market. 3M's optical films are used for LCDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dray said 3M surprised investors by projecting a "severe
and rapid margin decline" in its highly profitable optical film
that could cut earnings by 19 to 23 cents a share on an annual
basis. That business accounts for about 9 percent of 3M's total
sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dray said management cited productivity gains and margin
improvements as offsets to the decline in the optical film
business, but he is "less optimistic" that can happen in such a
short period of time. "We do not see meaningful margin upside
in any of 3M's other businesses," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that 3M cited continuing pressure for its
consumer-related businesses and said the company's investment
in new capacity is a "potential negative."

The company, whose products range from Rayovac batteries to Tetra pet products, posted a net loss of $333.0 million, or $6.60 per share, for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $439.4 million, or $8.88 per share, a year before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Excluding items the company reported a profit of 23 cents per share in the latest quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net sales rose 13 percent to $548.2 million due to sales volume increases and the impact of the weak dollar, which boosts the value of international sales when they are converted back to U.S. dollars for inclusion on the company's income statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((See here for "Shop Talk" -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Martinne Geller, editing by Mark Porter/Gerald E.

as well as more previously deferred revenue than last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broadcast television posted a $30 million operating loss
due to fewer TV shows selling into syndication and the shutdown
of the mobile phone service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's domestic theme parks benefited from growth in
visitor spending and attendance, as the weak dollar kept U.S.
travellers from going abroad. Deteriorating attendance at Hong
Kong Disneyland weighed on results, and the park had to
renegotiate its debt terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income rose to $877 million, or 44 cents per share,
from $782 million, or 36 cents per share, in last year's fiscal
fourth quarter. Revenue rose 3 percent to $8.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding a 2-cent-per-share tax-related benefit, Disney
earnings were 42 cents per share, in line with Wall Street's
average target. Analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of
$9.02 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto said Disney, which now
has posted double-digit operating growth for six quarters,
should see "another year of solid growth" despite a softer
consumer environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the shares have the potential to appreciate
even in a decelerating economic environment ... with drivers of
growth coming from content-driven success," Noto said in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC AD SALES STRONG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media networks revenue rose 14 percent to $4.0 billion, and
operating income at the segment rose 25 percent to $1.1
billion. Parks revenue rose 10 percent to $2.8 billion, while
the unit's income rose 9 percent to $430 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's domestic resorts saw an uptick of mid-single-digit
percentages in room reservations and attendance, and spot ad
sales at its ABC network were running "strong" double-digit
percentages ahead of its upfront sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studio posted a 24 percent decline in revenue to $1.5
billion in the quarter, and a 21 percent drop to $214 million
in operating income, compared with a year ago when "Pirates of
the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" was playing in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said it plans to boost capital expenditures by $250
million to $300 million in fiscal 2008, with the new money
going to digital improvements at its studio and networks, and
to improvements at its theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like rivals Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) and Viacom Inc
VIAb.N, Disney is benefiting this year from a string of box
office blockbusters and strong cable advertising rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's share price rose less than 1 percent in its fourth
quarter ended Sept. 29. The stock was trading at a multiple of
15.7 times estimated 2008 earnings, compared with 15.7 for Time
Warner and 15.6 for Viacom, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock fell to $33.55 in after-hours trade from a close
of $33.63 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRUSTRATED HONG KONG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creditors of the struggling Hong Kong Disneyland joint
venture agreed to suspend the debt covenants of a $293 million
commercial loan for a year and give owners Disney and the
government of Hong Kong access to funds that had been frozen,
Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In exchange, the joint venture will repay the loan by Sept.
30, 2008, and Disney will forgo royalties from the park for "a
couple of years," Staggs said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong Disneyland, which opened in 2005, missed its
first-year attendance target of 5.6 million by nearly 10
percent and has not released second-year totals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong's commerce secretary, Frederick Ma, told the
Standard newspaper this week that the government was now
reconsidering its approach and may inject new funds to expand
the park. But commerce officials declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The agreement with the creditors is a good thing," said a
spokesperson for the Hong Kong Tourism Board. "We hope the park
and its management will be able to develop a more concrete plan
to attract more visitors."

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co, the No. 2 U.S. entertainment company, plans to launch mobile phone service in Japan next spring offering customers animated content, the Nikkei business daily said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney would use Japan's No. 3 mobile phone carrier Softbank Corp's network and the two would jointly develop handsets, the paper said without citing sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the tie-up would secure Softbank stable revenues from leasing unused frequencies, Disney's entrance into Japan as a mobile virtual network operator is likely to trigger further competition in a saturated mobile market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney aims to win 1 million users by targeting families with an offer of handsets and downloads featuring Disney characters, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial costs of building base stations have prevented many would-be entrants into Japan's mobile phone market, dominated by NTT DoCoMo Inc, No. 2 KDDI Corp and Softbank. Disney would be the first company to launch mobile phone service in Japan using another firm's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japan, carmakers and telecom ventures have used carriers' network, but the lines have been used to enable car navigation or PC data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet access provider Internet Initiative Japan also plans to use DoCoMo's network to provide data services by March, and targets 7,000 firms, the Nikkei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mayumi Negishi; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - More than 125 striking 
executive producers from shows including "Ugly Betty," "Law  
Order: Special Victims Unit" and "Lost" protested at the gates 
of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank as the Writers Guild of 
America's strike entered its third day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Every day the producers don't give us a fair and decent 
deal is a wasted day in Hollywood," "Ugly Betty" creator Silvio 
Horta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wearing a T-shirt reading "Wasted Days" written in the 
famous Disney font, Horta and fellow "Betty" executive producer 
Marco Pennette said it was important for all showrunners to get 
together and be seen supporting the strike, which began Monday 
after contract talks broke down over payment for DVDs and 
digital downloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For the sake of the show, we worked on the scripts up to 
the deadline," Pennette said. "And for the sake of the actors, 
they can shoot something. But we chose to not cross the line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the showrunners: "SVU's" Neal Baer, "Entourage's" 
Doug Ellin, Carlton Cuse of "Lost," veteran producer John Wells 
("ER"), and "Desperate Housewives" creator Marc Cherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today is very much about showing solidarity among 
showrunners," said Cherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As more shows begin to close up shop, Cherry said he 
expects to see more Screen Actors Guild members turn out at the 
picket lines. Next week, Cherry said, there will be special 
pickets featuring actors, and on Friday, the "entire guild 
membership" is supposed to show up at 20th Century Fox studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following the march, the showrunners gathered at the Smoke 
House Restaurant in Burbank for a lunch that was paid for by a 
talent agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eyewitness reported that discussions between moderates and 
militants escalated into a heated debate over the guild's 
bargaining strategy as well as the spectrum of producing duties 
showrunners could perform during a strike. No punches were 
thrown, though the verbal barbs were said to be sharp and 
unusually multisyllabic. According to sources, the debate later 
moved to the WGA headquarters in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Nov 12 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), the No.2
U.S. entertainment company, said on Monday it plans to enter the
Japanese mobile phone market early next year using local carrier
Softbank Corp's (9984.T) network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, which plans to halt its U.S.-based mobile phone
service at the end of the year, is betting on the popularity of
its Tokyo resort to help it gain share in the world's biggest
market of third-generation phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney would use Japan's No. 3 mobile phone carrier
Softbank's for its mobile service and sell its phones at
Softbank's 2,464 stores in Japan, the two firms said in a
release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, whose U.S. mobile phones allow parents to track a
child's location, took a $30 million charge last year when it
shut down another phone service, Mobile ESPN, which it ran on
space rented on Sprint Nextel Corp's (S.N) network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tie-up with Disney would secure Softbank stable revenues
from leasing unused basebands, but Disney's entrance into Japan
increases competition in an already-saturated mobile market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Initial costs of building base stations have prevented many
would-be entrants into Japan's mobile phone market, dominated by
NTT DoCoMo Inc (9437.T), No. 2 KDDI Corp (9433.T) and Softbank.
Disney would be the first company to launch mobile phones in
Japan by renting space from a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Japan, carmakers and telecom ventures have used carriers'
networks, but the basebands have been used to enable car
navigation or PC data transmission.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein may earn a pay package of up to $75 million in cash and stock this year, the New York Post said on Sunday, citing sources inside the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compensation may come as his peers at other Wall Street firms could see their bonuses shrink, the paper noted. Indeed, Swiss financial giant UBS reportedly is set to limit bonuses for its investment bankers and traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein's compensation would be about $20 million more than he got last year, and comes as Goldman appears to have weathered the credit market problems that have rocked rivals Merrill Lynch MER.N and Bear Stearns BSC.N, the Post said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonuses for Goldman's co-presidents, Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelreid, could also top $70 million each, up from about $50 million each last year, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's bonuses were calculated last month at the height of the subprime mortgage meltdown, but traders and bankers will not receive word until mid-December, the Post said, citing insiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the securities arm of Swiss financial giant UBS AG has told investment bankers and traders on Wall Street and elsewhere that their 2007 cash pay will top out at $750,000, according to a report on the Wall Street Journal Web Site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, a much greater portion of the total compensations at UBS is expected to come from stock than in other years. There was previously no limit on the cash amount they could get paid, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Franklin Paul)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA Nov 11 (Reuters) - Bangladesh has approved Chevron's
(CVX.N) plan to conduct a seismic survey to determine the extent
of a gas field in an environmentally-sensistive area, energy
officials said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Now Chevron can go ahead with their three-dimensional (3D)
seismic survey of the northeastern Moulavi Bazar gas field in
block 14, which includes part of a national forest, the official
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The survey is considered essential to better delineate the
field, evaluate additional reserves, and to sustain and possibly
increase much-needed gas production from the field," the firm
said in a statement obtained by Reuters on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Wilson, chief executive of Chevron in Bangladesh, last
week formally announcing the plan said it would place the
highest priority on protection of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The six months-long seismic survey encompassing nearly 152
square kilometres including about 20 percent within the national
forest, will begin early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials said that the survey work would have no
significant impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The survey work will be conducted in an
environmentally-sensitive and careful manner and will protect
the conservation values of the area," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Moulavi Bazar natural gas field with estimated reserves
of 400 billion cubic feet of gas, was discovered in 1999 and
started production in 2005 by the Unocal, which was later
acquired by Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At present Chevron produces more than 100 million cubic feet
of gas per day (mmcfd) from the field, energy officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is also producing nearly 500 mmcfd of gas from the
Bibiyana and Jalalabad fields, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has invested $820 million in Bangladesh, making it the
biggest investor in the country's energy industry.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Nov 13 (Reuters) - Chinese measuring tool maker
Chengdu Yangzhiguang Industrial (600673.SS) said on Tuesday it
has won preliminary approval from the country's top securities
regulator to issue 370 million new shares to investors,
including a unit of Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a filing with the Shanghai bourse, Yangzhiguang said it
had received the green light from the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to go ahead with the offer, which
it initially applied for in 2006. Final approval has yet to be
given by the CSRC, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No other details, such as the price of the new offer, were
given. Shares in Yangzhiguang last traded at 28.70 yuan ($3.87)
each, up 169 percent over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yangzhiguang said last November that it wanted to issue an
additional 370 million shares in a private placement, within
which 60 million, or a 12.08 percent stake in the Chinese
company, would be sold to Jade Dragon (Mauritius) Ltd, a
Goldman Sachs unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some global investment and private equity firms, eager to
cash in on China's breakneck economic growth of more than 10
percent annually, have run into regulatory hurdles amid worries
that China is selling industrial assets too cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, the CSRC blocked a $119 million deal by
China's top automotive glass maker, Fuyao Group Glass
Industries Co (600660.SS), to sell a nearly 10 percent stake to
an investment arm of Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In August, the securities regulator blocked a separate plan
by Goldman to buy a 10.7 percent stake in Midea 000527.SZ,
one of China's top home appliance makers, for about $96
million. (Reporting by Charlie Zhu; Editing by Valerie Lee)

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell for a fourth
session on Monday, led by a widening sell-off in technology
stocks on worries about business spending, while a drop in oil
prices hit shares of energy producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Persistent concerns about the potential for more credit
losses also took the wind out of an attempted recovery in the
shares of financial services companies in the last hour of the
session, causing the Dow to reverse an earlier advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The day's biggest decliners represented a "Who's Who" of
the year's best performers, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and
Google Inc (GOOG.O), whose decline capped the Nasdaq's longest
downward streak in three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the economy does slow down, many manufacturers and
financial institutions, in particular, will not be upgrading
their technical systems" and consequently, won't be buying a
lot of tech supplies and tech support, said Ron Kiddoo, chief
investment officer of Cozad Asset Management, in Champaign,
Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That seems to be the main reason tech is being beaten
down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slid 55.19 points,
or 0.42 percent, to end at 12,987.55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the Dow's first finish below the 13,000 mark since
early August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell 14.52 points,
or 1.00 percent, to finish at 1,439.18. Monday's loss marked
the SP's longest losing in nine months. The Nasdaq Composite
Index .IXIC tumbled 43.81 points, or 1.67 percent, to
2,584.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple shares finished down 7 percent at $153.76 on the
Nasdaq, while shares of Google slid for the fourth straight
 day, ending down 4.8 percent at $632.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) finished down 2.7
percent at $84.54 on the NYSE, pressured by the biggest drop
in crude oil prices in two weeks. The stock was the biggest
drag on both the Dow and the SP 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude oil for December delivery CLZ7 lost $1.70 to
settle at $94.62 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even so, Citigroup Inc (C.N) led banks higher, with Citi
finishing up 1.4 percent at $33.57 on the NYSE as investors
scoured the downtrodden sector for bargains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup's advance also followed comments by Chairman
Robert Rubin to the Financial Times that any successor to
Chief Executive Charles Prince would face "no strategic
constraints." The newspaper said this could make a break-up of
Citigroup more likely. For details, see [ID:nN12446080].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Kiddoo said "the rebound in the financial sector
looks more tentative than definitive because "there's still
going to be a couple of more shoes to drop" in terms of
write-downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial sector notched its its first three-day
string of positive days since early October. Financial shares
have been among the hardest hit in recent weeks as disclosures
and talk of write-downs from risky loans have worried
investors about credit market problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An SP financial index .GSPF gained 0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was lighter than usual because bond markets in the
United States were closed for the Veterans Day holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was below average on the New York Stock Exchange,
with about 1.71 billion shares changing hands, below last
year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq,
about 2.82 billion shares traded, ahead of last year's daily
average of 2.02 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of
about 2 to 1 on the NYSE and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;ROME (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on Monday blamed supply tightness together with strong demand and a weak dollar for high oil prices and said the oil market was likely to stay much the same in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said that while he expected supply to catch up with demand in two to three years, the longer term outlook for oil depended on resource-rich nations opening up their countries for investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not a resource problem. The world has plenty of oil," Tillerson told reporters at the World Energy Congress in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is an issue of whether or not the investment dollars, technology and the know-how to develop those resources in an efficient way and a reliable way ...is going to be brought to bear on those resources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil hit a record high of $98.62 a barrel last week. While it has eased since, it remains within reach of $100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his speech to the congress Tillerson launched a scathing attack on the rising trend of "resource nationalism", calling it a major barrier to innovation and development of new energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emboldened by rising prices, countries such as Russia, Venezuela and Ecuador are seeking more cash and control from western companies that drill in their oil and gas fields. Many of them have either booted out western oil companies or sought to renegotiate earlier contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela earlier this year pushed out Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips as part of a nationalization drive after they failed to strike a deal to stay in multibillion-dollar projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, current conditions and emerging challenges have led some to pursue isolationist or protectionist energy policies which could have severe consequences for the global economy and for global energy security over the longer term," Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that people in resource-rich countries would ultimately bear the "long-term costs of such counterproductive policies".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Mobil CEO also said talks to settle a dispute between Western oil groups and the Kazakh government in the giant Kashagan oil field, the world's biggest oil discovery in three decades, were "very active".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan has criticized Exxon and its partners -- Italy's ENI (ENI.MI), Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and France's Total (TOTF.PA) -- for delays and cost overruns and demanded billions of dollars in compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also called for a bigger role for state oil company KazMunaiGas RDGZ.KZ and has set November 30 as the final deadline in its talks with the western firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if the partners were likely to give KazMunaiGas an increased stake in the field, or whether the government would be satisfied with simply a cash settlement, Tillerson said: "Those talks are very active in all of the areas you touched on." He refused to give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Santosh Menon, editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Europe's main democracy watchdog said on Monday its observers cannot begin work monitoring Russia's December 2 parliamentary election because Moscow has not issued them entry visas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has already come under criticism from Western governments for slashing the number of observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) it will allow to monitor the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading the dominant United Russia party into the election. The Kremlin says the vote will be fair but critics say officials will manipulate the election to ensure a huge endorsement for the Russian leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not, so far, received any visas for those that require them," said Urdur Gunnarsdottir, spokeswoman for the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which runs the election monitoring mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said visa applications were submitted by November 5 for an advance party of 20 observers who need to be in place to monitor the campaign and prepare for polling day. The main body of 50 observers will arrive a few days before the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every day that passes now reduces our ability to observe the campaign," she told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes it very difficult for us to do the pre-election observation and makes it more difficult for us to prepare for the arrival of the additional 50 observers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's Foreign Ministry denied there was a problem with the visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All participants in observation missions who have received invitations will be issued with visas. It is just a matter of time," a source in the ministry told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Western governments view OSCE observers' assessments on elections in ex-Soviet states as the definitive verdict on whether they meet democratic standards. The observers were critical of Russia's last parliamentary vote in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian officials say they will not hinder the observers' work, but they have expressed reservations about the West "lecturing" them about their democratic record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian election chiefs delayed issuing an invitation to the OSCE observers, and when they did, they limited the mission to 70 people. In 2003, the OSCE sent more than 400 observers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House said last month it was "disappointed" by the restrictions Russia imposed on the observers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin is immensely popular in Russia and opinion polls point to a comfortable victory for United Russia in the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian leader is to step down next year when his second term ends. Analysts say a good showing in the parliamentary vote will give him an informal mandate to retain influence after he leaves the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Michael Winfrey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIYADH Nov 12 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N) has sold its
stake in a Saudi lubricant firm to a local consortium, in the
second transaction this month that has seen the U.S. firm pull
out of a joint-venture with state oil giant Aramco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Saudi Advanced Petroleum Services Ltd (APSL), a consortium
of the Dabbagh Group and the Gulf Oil International Group, has
bought the Saudi Arabian Lubricating Oil Co. (Petrolube) from
Aramco and Mobil Investments, an affiliate of ExxonMobil,
financial adviser Swicorp said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petrolube was a joint venture between Aramco, which owned 71
percent of its shares, and ExxonMobil, which owned the remaining
29 percent, Swicorp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It did not say how much APSL has paid for the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon Rowe, Swicorp's managing director, declined further
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil sold its 30 percent stake in the Saudi Aramco
Lubricating Oil Refining Company (Luberef) to Jadwa Investment,
a Saudi firm, earlier this month, the companies said in a
statement last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They did not detail the investment, but one industry source
said the deal was worth around $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aramco wants Luberef to expand, and this did not fit 
Exxon's plans in the lubricant market, industry sources said.
Exxon is the dominant player in the market, supplying 19 percent
of feedstock globally for lubricant production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "APSL, which already operates in the lubricant business,
wants to use Petrolube to grow aggressively into the kingdom and
abroad ... They (APSL) plan to explore their opportunities in
the downstream industry," a source familiar with the Dabbagh
Group said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petrolube, founded 30 years ago, produces finished lubes and
greases in Saudi Arabia. It has three lubricants plants in the
kingdom with a combined capacity of 450,000 tonnes, according to
its Web site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It says it has 28 percent share of the lubricants market in
the kingdom and exports to 30 countries in Africa and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi Arabia's 400,000 bpd Samref refinery is a joint
venture between Exxon and Aramco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, Aramco and China's Sinopec (600028.SS) are also
working together to expand the Fujian refinery in China to
240,000 bpd from 80,000 bpd and build a petrochemical plant at
the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luberef was established in 1976 and produces around 550,000
tonnes per year of oil lubricants at two refineries on the
kingdom's Red Sea coast at Jeddah and Yanbu.

talks to settle a dispute between the partners in the giant
Kashagan oil field and the Kazakh government were "very active".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), the No.2 U.S. entertainment company, plans to launch mobile phone services in Japan early next year to become the newest entrant in an ultra-competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney, which plans to halt its U.S.-based mobile phone service in December, is now eyeing demand for its online contents in the world's biggest market of third-generation phones, officials said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney would use local mobile phone carrier Softbank Corp's (9984.T) network and the two would jointly develop mobile phones and content, the two firms said in a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Softbank - another new entrant which has been winning users with its low-cost price plans - the agreement could be a key to induce subscribers to use their phones for more downloads and switch to pricier handsets and calling plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the phones might appeal to hard-core Disney fans, children and adolescents, they are unlikely to win more than 100,000 to 200,000 subscribers - a tiny sliver of a market of 100 million mobile phone users, said Michito Kimura, a market analyst at research firm IDC Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Softbank is eyeing long-term growth from this partnership, and the question is if Disney will stick it through," Kimura said. "You need to constantly come up with new and quality content to keep users interested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney took a $30 million charge last year when it shut down another phone service, Mobile ESPN, which it ran on Sprint Nextel Corp's (S.N) network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial costs of building base stations have prevented many would-be entrants into Japan's mobile phone market, dominated by NTT DoCoMo Inc (9437.T), No. 2 KDDI Corp (9433.T) and No. 3 Softbank, which bought Vodafone's (VOD.L) local unit in April last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japan, carmakers and telecom ventures have used carriers' networks, but the basebands have been used to enable car navigation or PC data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Noriyuki Hirata; Editing by Malcolm Whittaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein may earn a pay package of up to $75 million in cash and stock this year, the New York Post said on Sunday, citing sources inside the firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The compensation may come as his peers at other Wall Street firms could see their bonuses shrink, the paper noted. Indeed, Swiss financial giant UBS reportedly is set to limit bonuses for its investment bankers and traders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Blankfein's compensation would be about $20 million more than he got last year, and comes as Goldman appears to have weathered the credit market problems that have rocked rivals Merrill Lynch MER.N and Bear Stearns BSC.N, the Post  said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bonuses for Goldman's co-presidents, Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelreid, could also top $70 million each, up from about $50 million each last year, the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman's bonuses were calculated last month at the height of the subprime mortgage meltdown, but traders and bankers will not receive word until mid-December, the Post said, citing insiders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By contrast, the securities arm of Swiss financial giant UBS AG has told investment bankers and traders on Wall Street and elsewhere that their 2007 cash pay will top out at $750,000, according to a report on the Wall Street Journal Web Site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    What's more, a much greater portion of the total compensations at UBS is expected to come from stock than in other years. There was previously no limit on the cash amount they could get paid, the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Franklin Paul) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Richard Chang; Franklin.Paul@reuters.com; +1 646 223 6195; Reuters Messaging: Franklin.Paul.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: GOLDMANSACHS BONUS/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co Inc (JPM.N) on
Friday said shaky credit markets could trigger more write-downs
in the fourth quarter as the bank is exposed to about $50
billion worth of leveraged loans, risky subprime mortgages and
collateralized debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan did not give any specific potential write-down
figures in a quarterly filing. But the bank said unstable
market conditions could affect results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As previously disclosed, the bank's portfolio of
held-for-sale leveraged lending commitments stood at $40.6
billion at the end of September. These commitments are hard to
hedge against losses as the market for corporate debt used in
leveraged buyouts has diminished substantially in recent
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Further markdowns could result if market conditions worsen
for this asset class," the bank said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the third quarter, JPMorgan wrote down $1.3 billion,
after fees, on the leveraged loan portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, the bank also may have to write down its
portfolio of subprime mortgages and collateralized debt
obligations or CDOs, whose downturn has walloped rivals such as
Citigroup (C.N) and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's exposure to CDOs is about $6.8 billion and about
$2.6 billion for risky subprime mortgages. CDOs repackage
assets including mortgages and credit-card receivables into
bond structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Megan Davies and Tim McLaughlin, editing by

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Nov 14 (Reuters) - Shanghai will build a major
theme park by 2020 but has yet to decide on any specific project,
a district official said on Wednesday, discounting a media report
that plans for a Disneyland park in the city had been revived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "A theme park is part of Shanghai's blueprint, but it could
be either a foreign park or a Chinese one," said Qian Weizhong,
head of the economic committee of Shanghai's Nanhui district,
where the theme park will be built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The official China Daily on Wednesday reported that Shanghai
had received positive feedback from the central government about
a Disneyland project and that preparations were going ahead full
steam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shanghai government spokeswoman Zhang Qin said a Disneyland
park had not received the necessary nod from Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have not yet got central government approval for the
Disneyland project," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No comment was immediately available on the matter from Walt
Disney Co (DIS.N) in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plans for a Shanghai Disneyland emerged in 2005 but were
suspended when the city's Communist Party boss Chen Liangyu was
implicated in a corruption investigation last September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney has been exploring options for a theme park
outside Shanghai amid concerns it may not get support from
Beijing for the Shanghai project, sources familiar with the issue
told Reuters in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney signed a statement of intent to build a Disneyland on
the mainland in 2002, and then set up a venture with Shanghai's
Lujiazui Group to develop the site, which would be about 4.7
times the size of Hong Kong's Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mainland plan was soon suspended, partly because of
concerns that the Hong Kong park, which opened in 2005, would
suffer, the China Daily reported.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 13 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), the
leading U.S. cable television operator, is teaming up with
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to offer a package of Internet-based
communications products for small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Microsoft Communications package, described as
collaborative productivity tools, will provide small businesses
with Internet-based corporate-class e-mail, calendar and
document sharing for free to customers of Comcast Business's
high-speed Internet service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's move to offer the online software suite appears
designed to compete with a similar offering from rival Google
Inc (GOOG.O) known as Google Apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comcast said the tools would provide a back-end IT service
that small businesses typically cannot afford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In essence, we're going to be performing some of those
value-added IT-like functions that these customers have to
contract out for externally or just do without altogether,"
said Bill Stemper, president of Comcast Business Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comcast, along with other cable companies, is expanding its
business-class services to win customers from phone companies
such as ATT Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N)
who dominate in providing businesses with voice and Internet
services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is rolling out its digital phone service to small and
medium-sized businesses to complement its Internet service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comcast has said it will spend more than $3 billion over
five years to build out its business services, with most of the
early focus on companies with five to 20 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is projecting Comcast Business revenue of $2.5 billion
by 2011. It estimates its cable runs past 5 million small to
medium-sized businesses and this year will invest about $250
million in capital expenditure to build out business services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the end of 2006 it was serving 250,000 such businesses.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Microsoft and the DAISY digital 
talking books consortium are to work together on a tool for the 
blind and otherwise print-disabled that translates Microsoft 
Word documents into a digital audio standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The two organizations said on Tuesday the collaboration was 
aimed at producing a free, downloadable plug-in that would 
translate documents based on Open XML -- the default 
file-saving format in Microsoft Office 2007 -- into DAISY XML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DAISY XML file can then be processed to produce digital 
audio and other formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plug-in is expected to be available in early 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The not-for-profit DAISY (Digital Accessible Information 
System) consortium, based in Zurich, Switzerland, was formed in 
1996 by talking-book libraries to help the transition from 
analogue to digital talking books, and has adopted open 
standards based on Internet file formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its members include the U.S. National Library Service for 
the Blind and Physically Handicapped, the Spanish National 
Organisation of the Blind and the Korean Braille Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is campaigning to have its Open XML document 
format approved as an international standard, which would help 
it gain wider adoption by public-sector organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It failed to capture the necessary majority in a September 
vote by members of the International Organisation for 
Standardisation (ISO), partly due to concerns the format is not 
truly open but rather a ploy to lock in users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An ISO group will meet again in February to try to agree a 
consensus, giving Microsoft time to lobby for more votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Rory Channing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds JPMorgan CEO comment on SIVs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tim McLaughlin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 13 (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, chief executive
of JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), showed his famous brash side as
he gave a recruiting pitch on the turf of a rival firm on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taking questions at Merrill Lynch's banking and financial
services conference, from an audience including executives and
analysts from rivals, he made the pitch -- a sign of confidence
in his company as the fallout of huge Wall Street losses is
expected to cause a talent exodus at the most troubled firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If any of you think you're good and you're looking for a
job or something like that, feel free to give me a call," Dimon
said. "Because we will be hiring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His pitch might have a broad appeal at Merrill Lynch  Co
MER.N. The company does not have a CEO after the ouster of
Stan O'Neal, blamed for the biggest quarterly loss in company
history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon was in an irreverent mood. He began his presentation
mocking the bronchitis of Morgan Stanley (MS.N) co-President
Zoe Cruz, who attended the event but could not make her
presentation because of a case of bronchitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Can everyone hear me?" Dimon said as he started. Then in a
croaky whisper, he joked, "I have a bad throat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon also twitted other companies, saying that as they
scramble to shore up failed risk management or find their next
CEO, he's willing to make decisions now that don't necessarily
have an immediate payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said it's OK if the earnings pop from JPMorgan's
strategic moves don't start paying off until 2009 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon's shoot-from-the-hip style makes him a standout on
Wall Street, where many executives stick to a script to convey
a carefully worded corporate message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once a top protege of former Citigroup (C.N) Chairman Sandy
Weill, Dimon fell out of favor and was ousted. Years later,
Weill told television interviewer Charlie Rose that Dimon had
been a little "obstreperous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today, Citigroup shares are down 36 percent this year amid
multibillion-dollar write-downs and the exodus of CEO Chuck
Prince. Citigroup's problems include exposure to structured
investment vehicles, or SIVs, which are assets linked to
subprime mortgages and other debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "SIVs don't have a business purpose," Dimon said. "They
will go the way of the dinosaur."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, JPMorgan does not have SIV exposure and its
write-downs on other risky assets have been much smaller than
those of Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. JPMorgan shares are down
7 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When discussing JPMorgan's exposure to subprime
mortgage-related assets, Dimon said, "We think we're fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he also cautioned that the bank's positions contain
risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said subprime lending won't go away, because it is a
good business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was something good that went way to excess," he said.
"But remember subprime is minority groups, younger folks,
immigrants, people who had problems earlier in their life.
There's nothing wrong with it. It's a good thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He later said, "It is not a big deal for the U.S. economy
and certainly a much smaller deal for the world economy."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds company comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil slowed the fluid
catalytic cracker at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery to fix a
leaky clamp on an associate compressor, the company said in a
filing with state environmental regulators Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Unit Operations reduced the FCC feed rate to be able to
shut down the High Pressure Carrier compressor to repair the
leak," Exxon Mobil said in the filing with the Texas Commission
for Environmental Quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon Mobil spokeswoman told Reuters that the impact to
refinery production should be "temporary and very minimal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She declined to comment about how long the repairs would
take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gasoline-making FCC at the 349,000 barrel-per-day
refinery had just returned from unscheduled work Nov. 8 after
nearly a month of repairs.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) does not expect to take any significant asset write-downs, its chief executive said on Tuesday, easing investor fears of a worsening credit crisis and sending financial shares soaring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if he expected significant write-downs, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein offered a one-word answer: "No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're convinced we have a pretty good grip on these valuations," Blankfein said at the Merrill Lynch Banking and Financial Services Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After weeks of speculation that Goldman would be the next bank to report big credit markets losses, Blankfein's comments boosted Goldman shares, rising $18.33, or 8.5 percent, to close at $233.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. It was Goldman's biggest one-day gain in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivals have been less fortunate. In the past month, rivals ranging from UBS (UBSN.VX) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to Merrill Lynch MER.N and Citigroup (C.N) have announced about $45 billion in losses and write downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The losses reflect the meltdown in mortgage securities and broader breakdown in markets for collateralized debt obligations and corporate loans that have triggered a deep sell off in financial shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein's comments helped fuel a rally in financial services stocks, which have plunged in recent weeks on concern the damage of the mortgage meltdown was getting worse. The Amex Securities Broker Dealer index .XBD rose 5.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein addressed skepticism in the market that Goldman's blowout third-quarter results, which stood in stark contrast to the losses posted by rivals, were the result of unrealistic valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's portfolio of level 3 assets, which under accounting rules are the least liquid and the hardest to price, includes private equity stakes, real estate and leveraged loans. A separate group of employees, rather than traders, are charged with assigning value to positions, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Goldman isn't sure about an estimated value, traders execute test trades to help establish market value that it can apply, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are convinced that Goldman has been honest regarding their mortgage problems and are buying calls aggressively, anticipating continued upward stock movement," said William Lefkowitz, an options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORTGAGE WEAKNESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein also reaffirmed Goldman's bearish view on U.S. mortgage markets, where rising default rates and the lack of buyers has erased much of the value of mortgage securities and derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the third quarter, when Goldman reaped windfall gains by betting against the mortgage market, it warned that market conditions would get worse. On Tuesday, Blankfein said Goldman continued to bet mortgages would weaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are net short in these markets," Blankfein said. "We continue to be bearish," he said, noting credit spreads have widened since its results were reported in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Doris Frankel, Dan Wilchins, Ed Leefeldt and Michael Flaherty; Editing by Gary Hill and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Recasts, adds details, background (Reuters) - Citigroup
said it expects JPMorgan Chase  Co Inc (JPM.N) to have a
limited mark-to-market impact from writedowns in collateralized
debt obligations invested in asset backed securities (ABS
CDOs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Unlike its peers Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wachovia
Corp WB.N, U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase is a small
player in underwriting ABS CDOs, the brokerage noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup retained a "buy" rating and price target of $57
on JPMorgan Chase shares, which were trading up about 2 percent
at $43.19 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the brokerage trimmed its fourth-quarter earnings
estimate for JPMorgan Chase to $1 from $1.08 a share, citing
mark-to-market adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase's $40.6 billion leveraged buyout loan book
could see a 1 percent, or $400 million, negative mark in the
fourth quarter based on current market trends, Citigroup said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks including Citigroup Inc (C.N), Merrill Lynch  Co
MER.N and Wachovia have announced more than $40 billion of
write-offs this year as U.S. foreclosures set records and after
investors stopped buying many kinds of risky debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup on Tuesday lowered its price target on Wachovia
to $50 from $56 and on Bank of America to $58 from $60. The
brokerage, however, had a "buy" rating on both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Shamik Paul and Supantha Mukherjee in

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is
expanding in emerging markets to tap their high economic growth
rates, though there is a "bubble element" to some of the
highest flying assets, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Western banks like Goldman Sachs have long pursued
opportunities to invest in developing economies, but many
countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America are now
sources of capital looking for investment at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at a Merrill Lynch Banking  Financial Services
Conference, Blankfein said emerging economies have crossed the
"tipping point" in terms of becoming full fledged members of
the global capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are determined to grow our footprint in these markets,"
Blankfein said, part of a strategy he called "chasing GDP
around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is opening or expanding offices in Mumbai, Moscow,
Sao Paulo, Dubai, Doha and, soon, Tel Aviv, Blankfein said.
Goldman has invested about $1 billion on its India business, he
said, and it is still negotiating a joint venture with Saudi
Arabia's largest commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has obtained broker-dealer licenses in China, India
Russia, Brazil and South Korea, which will let it pursue a
range of financing and banking businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other moves, Blankfein said it is expanding its private
wealth management business in many of these countries, building
ties to a new generation of entrepreneurs, who may also become
banking clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to on-shore wealth management in China and
Brazil, Blankfein said Goldman is expanding its Swiss bank unit
to attract more offshore assets from investors in the Middle
East, Russia, Latin America and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He acknowledged, though, that investors should be wary of
the high valuation of some "BRIC" country markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you look at the valuation of companies, such as
Indian and China IPOs, compared with very similar companies
from more developed markets, there are bubble elements. This
you can see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, he said, these markets offer great rewards in
exchange for the high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Ed Leefeldt, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said on Tuesday the investment bank has raised two debt funds and will launch a long-short hedge fund to take advantage of recent credit market turmoil and bolster a money management arm roiled by volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $1.8 billion fund, known as Liquidity Partners III, is expected to invest in leveraged loans and other debt stuck on bank balance sheets from the credit crunch. Goldman also recently raised a $2.7 billion credit hedge fund, known as Liberty Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are designed "to take advantage of distressed opportunities in the credit markets," Blankfein said at the Merrill Lynch Banking  Financial Services Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next few months, Goldman plans to launch a long-short hedge fund run by traders who managed a similar fund within the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As you know, we've had issues with the performance of certain of our quantitative funds, as have others in this space," Blankfein said. "While direct quantitative hedge funds represent only 5 percent of our assets under management, we realized it would be prudent to further expand our product portfolio in actively managed strategies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volatile stock trading in August forced Goldman to orchestrate a $3 billion capital infusion for its Global Equity Opportunities fund, a quantitative fund. Meanwhile the multi-strategy Global Alpha, at one time with $10 billion under management, and the smaller North American Equity Opportunities funds plunged in value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's asset management division had been expanding rapidly, growing from $50 billion in managed assets 12 years ago to nearly $800 billion today. In the third quarter, the bank attracted $50 billion of total fund in-flows, contributing to the $200 billion that has poured in since the beginning of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph Giannone and Michael Flaherty, editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

said ExxonMobil spokeswoman Gloria Essien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are on essential services. Production was not impacted

the Niger Delta (MEND) announced the end of a ceasefire citing
the arrest of its leader in Angola on arms dealing charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No group has yet claimed responsibility for the Qua Iboe
attack. Industry sources say the attackers are believed to have
come from a militant hideout in neighbouring Rivers State which
has launched MEND operations in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since late 2005, MEND has staged a string of crippling
attacks against Nigerian oil facilities and troops, forcing
thousands of foreign workers to leave and cutting output from
the world's eighth largest exporter by a fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest raids are a setback to a peace process started by
President Umaru Yar'Adua, who used his inauguration speech in
May to promise urgent attention to grievances of poverty and
neglect in the vast wetlands region of southern Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEND, which has demanded greater regional control over the
delta's oil resources, had observed a ceasefire for four months
until the arrest if its leader, Henry Okah. Activists suspect
Nigeria of being behind Okah's detention in Angola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government's attempts to lure militants to the
negotiating table has split them into factions, and activists in
the region say the resurgence of attacks is also a symptom of a
struggle for supremacy in militant ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Okah has been in a war of words with a rival militia leader,
Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, who has joined the peace talks and spoken
out against kidnapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As long as Henry Okah is in detention, the boys loyal to
him will see it as an excuse," said Oyeinfie Jonjon, a member of
the negotiating team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The road map to peace is not moving forward. The government
is looking for any excuse to move it backwards," he added.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Lions Gate Entertainment Corp 
announced on Monday a deal to co-produce films and TV shows 
with Grupo Televisa SA and said it would not violate any of the 
Mexican broadcaster's prior commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The partnership comes at a time of tense relations between 
Televisa and its other U.S. partner, Univision Communications 
Inc, which has an exclusive deal to distribute Televisa's 
Spanish-language programming in the U.S. through 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's partnership with Lions Gate would involve 
production of English-language programming in the United States 
and give Televisa extended reach into the market beyond 
Spanish-speaking audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will co-produce feature films and television 
programming with Televisa, both here and in Mexico, always 
taking into account Televisa's prior contractual commitments," 
Lions Gate's Chief Executive Jon Feltheimer said in his first 
public comments about the long-rumored agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa -- which has sued Univision to end the deal under 
which it provides Univision with the bulk of its prime-time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spanish-language programming -- declined comment on Monday. 
Officials for Univision were not available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Los Angeles Times first reported in October that Lions 
Gate and Televisa had signed a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Feltheimer said on a conference call on Monday that the 
independent studio, home to the popular "Saw" franchise, hoped 
to build on its momentum in the English- and Spanish-language 
marketplace with the Televisa deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the Lions Gate pact should provide Televisa 
with major inroads into the U.S. market. At the same time, 
Univision is also trying to reach Hispanics with 
English-language programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Feltheimer said while Lions Gate would help provide 
Televisa with access to the English-language U.S. market, the 
deal would also help open the Latin American market to his 
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The partnership we contemplate with them involves lots of 
different areas -- video distribution of some of their library, 
TV format exploitation, co-production of television shows, both 
English-speaking and Spanish-language, and co-producing feature 
films together with them," he said on the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa formerly owned a stake in Univision but was beaten 
out by an investment group led by billionaire Haim Saban in its 
efforts last year to buy the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Feltheimer also said the strike by Hollywood screenwriters 
could affect Lions Gate's TV operations, either positively in 
the short-term or negatively in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In a longer strike, some of the renewals, particularly 
'Weeds,' 'Mad Men' and 'Crash', our new order from Starz 
(Entertainment), could be affected," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lions Gate shares ended down 3 percent at $10.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Sue Zeidler, editing by John Wallace and

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) and the DAISY digital talking books consortium are to work together on a tool for the blind and otherwise print-disabled that translates Microsoft Word documents into a digital audio standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two organizations said on Tuesday the collaboration was aimed at producing a free, downloadable plug-in that would translate documents based on Open XML -- the default file-saving format in Microsoft Office 2007 -- into DAISY XML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DAISY XML file can then be processed to produce digital audio and other formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plug-in is expected to be available in early 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The not-for-profit DAISY (Digital Accessible Information System) consortium, based in Zurich, Switzerland, was formed in 1996 by talking-book libraries to help the transition from analogue to digital talking books, and has adopted open standards based on Internet file formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its members include the U.S. National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, the Spanish National Organisation of the Blind and the Korean Braille Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is campaigning to have its Open XML document format approved as an international standard, which would help it gain wider adoption by public-sector organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It failed to capture the necessary majority in a September vote by members of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), partly due to concerns the format is not truly open but rather a ploy to lock in users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ISO group will meet again in February to try to agree a consensus, giving Microsoft time to lobby for more votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Rory Channing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co, the No.2 U.S. 
entertainment company, plans to launch mobile phone services in 
Japan early next year to become the newest entrant in an 
ultra-competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney, which plans to halt its U.S.-based mobile phone 
service in December, is now eyeing demand for its online 
contents in the world's biggest market of third-generation 
phones, officials said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney would use local mobile phone carrier Softbank Corp's 
network and the two would jointly develop mobile phones and 
content, the two firms said in a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Softbank - another new entrant which has been winning 
users with its low-cost price plans - the agreement could be a 
key to induce subscribers to use their phones for more 
downloads and switch to pricier handsets and calling plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But while the phones might appeal to hard-core Disney fans, 
children and adolescents, they are unlikely to win more than 
100,000 to 200,000 subscribers - a tiny sliver of a market of 
100 million mobile phone users, said Michito Kimura, a market 
analyst at research firm IDC Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Softbank is eyeing long-term growth from this partnership, 
and the question is if Disney will stick it through," Kimura 
said. "You need to constantly come up with new and quality 
content to keep users interested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney took a $30 million charge last year when it shut 
down another phone service, Mobile ESPN, which it ran on Sprint 
Nextel Corp's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Initial costs of building base stations have prevented many 
would-be entrants into Japan's mobile phone market, dominated 
by NTT DoCoMo Inc, No. 2 KDDI Corp and No. 3 Softbank, which 
bought Vodafone's local unit in April last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Japan, carmakers and telecom ventures have used 
carriers' networks, but the basebands have been used to enable 
car navigation or PC data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Noriyuki Hirata; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein may earn a pay package of up to $75 million in cash and stock this year, the New York Post said on Sunday, citing sources inside the firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The compensation may come as his peers at other Wall Street firms could see their bonuses shrink, the paper noted. Indeed, Swiss financial giant UBS reportedly is set to limit bonuses for its investment bankers and traders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Blankfein's compensation would be about $20 million more than he got last year, and comes as Goldman appears to have weathered the credit market problems that have rocked rivals Merrill Lynch MER.N and Bear Stearns BSC.N, the Post  said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bonuses for Goldman's co-presidents, Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelreid, could also top $70 million each, up from about $50 million each last year, the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman's bonuses were calculated last month at the height of the subprime mortgage meltdown, but traders and bankers will not receive word until mid-December, the Post said, citing insiders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By contrast, the securities arm of Swiss financial giant UBS AG has told investment bankers and traders on Wall Street and elsewhere that their 2007 cash pay will top out at $750,000, according to a report on the Wall Street Journal Web Site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    What's more, a much greater portion of the total compensations at UBS is expected to come from stock than in other years. There was previously no limit on the cash amount they could get paid, the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Franklin Paul) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Richard Chang; Franklin.Paul@reuters.com; +1 646 223 6195; Reuters Messaging: Franklin.Paul.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: GOLDMANSACHS BONUS/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said on Monday it would buy 
Canada's Cognos Inc CSN.TO COGN.O for $5 billion, snapping 
up the last major independent maker of business intelligence 
software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Investors had expected the deal after SAP AG (SAPG.DE) 
(SAP.N) bid 4.8 billion euros ($6.8 billion) for Cognos rival 
Business Objects SA BOBJ.PA BOBJ.O in October and Oracle 
Corp ORCL.O bought Hyperion Solutions Corp in April for $3.3 
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three targets make software that combs through vast 
amounts of data to analyze business trends. For example, 
Harrah's Entertainment Inc HET.N uses one Cognos program to 
keep frequent gamblers coming back to its casinos. Automaker 
BMW (BMWG.DE) runs a package that creates product quality and 
human resources reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp said it signed an 
agreement to buy Cognos for $58 a share, a 9.5 percent premium 
to its Friday closing price of $52.98 on the Nasdaq. IBM 
expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cognos's U.S. shares rose to $57.15 in Nasdaq trading on 
Monday and have gained 27 percent since the SAP deal for 
Business Objects on October 7. IBM shares rose as much as 3.5 
percent to $104.19 on the New York Stock Exchange before 
closing at $101.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is an effort by IBM to stay relevant in the software 
space," said Rebecca Wettemann, an analyst with Nucleus 
Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oracle, SAP and now IBM are investing in business 
intelligence software to boost the allure of their product 
portfolios. Such programs interface with databases sold by 
Oracle and IBM, as well as business management software from 
SAP and Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Mills, senior vice president and group executive of 
IBM Software Group, said he had been looking for several years 
to add business intelligence programs to IBM's products to 
offer more real-time and higher-performance analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We started looking at this set of issues a number of years 
ago," Mills told Reuters. "Our actions here were not per se 
triggered by the fact that other purchases have happened."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Software is the fastest-growing and most profitable 
division of IBM, the world's largest technology services 
company. IBM also uses software products to get customers to 
buy its consulting services and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have long speculated that the most likely buyer 
for Cognos was IBM, which has worked with Cognos for more than 
15 years. They have integrated some of their technology to 
serve joint customers, such as the New York City Police 
Department, MetLife Inc (MET.N) and Bayer BAYG.DE UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An FBR Research report said IBM's offer valued Cognos's 
enterprise value -- which is market capitalization plus net 
debt -- at 3.9 times forecast 2008 revenue. That compared to 
Business Objects' 3.4 times under the SAP deal, and Hyperion's 
2.8 times multiple in the Oracle deal, FBR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM is paying a slight premium to past deals, which we 
think is appropriate, given the higher-quality company it is 
buying," FBR Research said, adding that it did not expect other 
suitors to step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked about IBM's deal for Cognos, SAP CEO Henning 
Kagermann said at its investor day in Germany, "I would say it 
proves that SAP's acquisition of Business Objects was a 
strategically important one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cognos, based in Ottawa, has about 4,000 employees and more 
than 25,000 customers. It is IBM's 23rd acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said it plans to integrate Cognos as a group within its 
Information Management Software division to be led by Cognos 
President and CEO Rob Ashe, reporting to General Manager Ambuj 
Goyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Georgina Prodhan in Frankfurt;

The shares rose to $57 in premarket trading on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM said the all-cash deal was subject to shareholder approval and should close in the first quarter of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SAP's bid of 4.8 billion euros ($6.8 billion) for Business Objects had sparked speculation in the market that Cognos would become an acquisition target. It and MicroStrategy Inc (MSTR.O) were seen as the most attractive takeover candidates in that space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investors have long speculated that the most likely buyer for Ottawa-based Cognos is IBM because of their existing business partnership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tiffany Wu; editing by John Wallace/Lisa Von Ahn) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((tiffany.wu@reuters.com; +1 646 223 6142; Reuters Messaging: tiffany.wu.reuters.com@reuters.net)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: COGNOS IBM/  .

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
alumni have for decades gone on to top leadership positions
throughout the business world and in government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, NYSE Euronext NYX.N Chairman and Chief
Executive John Thain reportedly accepted an offer to become the
new CEO of Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N, filling a vacancy
created by the departure of Stan O'Neal on Nov. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news is the latest headline-grabbing development
involving former executives from the secretive investment bank,
whose chief executive is now Lloyd Blankfein. Below is a list
of some former bank officials:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Thain -- The former co-president of Goldman Sachs left
to become chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange in
2004. He merged the NYSE with electronic trading network
Archipelago in 2005, accelerated the Big Board's adoption of
electronic trading and converted the nonprofit club into a
publicly listed company. Last year, he merged NYSE Group with
Euronext to build the first trans-Atlantic exchange operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duncan Niederauer -- The former equities trading executive
joined the NYSE in February after 22 years at Goldman Sachs and
was named president and co-chief operating officer. Reportedly,
Niederauer will become the new Big Board CEO if Thain departs
to become Merrill's chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Rubin -- Former U.S. Treasury Secretary and chairman
of the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton.
He was co-head of Goldman in the early 1990s before joining
Clinton's cabinet in 1992. In 2001, Rubin left Washington to
join Citigroup (C.N) as chairman of the executive committee.
Last month, after CEO Chuck Prince resigned under pressure,
Rubin took on the bigger role of nonexecutive chairman and is
leading the search for a new CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Henry "Hank" Paulson - Paulson joined Goldman Sachs in 1974
and rose quickly as an investment banker to become partner in
eight years. Paulson served as chief executive from 1999 to May
last year, when he was named U.S. Treasury Secretary by
President George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Corzine - Now the Democratic governor of New Jersey,
Corzine joined Goldman Sachs as a bond trader in 1975 and
worked his way up to CEO. He played a key role in pushing the
white-shoe partnership to become a publicly traded bank in
1999, although he was ousted by his co-CEO, Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Whitehead -- A 38-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, he
retired in 1984 as co-chair and senior partner. More recently
he was chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp and at
one time chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He
was a deputy secretary of state in 1985, a second-in-command to
Secretary George Shultz under President Ronald Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joshua Bolten - Bush's White House chief of staff served as
Goldman's executive director for legal and government affairs
from een 1994 to 1999.

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks stalled on
Wednesday as doubts about the sustainability of Tuesday's sharp
gains outweighed a rise in shares of energy companies and
investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. Inc BSC.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns gained more than 6 percent as shares of
financial services companies extended their rebound after the
bank announced a smaller-than-expected write-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
were helped by a rise in crude oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But trading was volatile, with investors wary a day after a
strong surge helped it snap a four-session losing streak and
the Nasdaq notched its biggest advance in more than four years.
Investors were cautious before the Consumer Price Index for
October is released on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology shares dragged, with bellwethers Microsoft Corp

restrained by caution and profit-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yesterday was just a reflex rally. We're back to the good,
old, wait-and-see posture, waiting for tomorrow's CPI

market strategist at D.A. Davidson  Co in Lake Oswego,
Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think a lot of traders realize that the overall
situation hasn't changed a whole lot, with yesterday's rally
notwithstanding. There  are more mortgage rate resets on the
horizon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 15.29
points, or 0.11 percent, at 13,322.38. The Standard  Poor's

points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,670.04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon Mobil were up 0.6 percent to $87.36 on the
New York Stock Exchange and were among the biggest positive
influences on both the blue-chip Dow average and the SP 500
after oil prices climbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude oil for December delivery CLZ7 gained $2.48,
or 2.7 percent, to $93.67 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns shares climbed to $107.33 after the investment

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 14 (Reuters) - Amaranth LLC, the hedge fund
that collapsed last year amid $6 billion in losses, has sued
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N) for $1 billion, accusing the bank
of fraudulently taking advantage of the firm during its crisis
in September 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Amaranth, which once had assets of $9.2 billion, charged in
the lawsuit filed Tuesday that JPMorgan executives spread
falsehoods about the value of its energy trading assets in a
successful effort to buy them on the cheap over rivals
including Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a letter to investors, Amaranth said it is seeking over
$1 billion from JPMorgan, although the suit filed in New York
State Supreme Court referred only to unspecified compensatory
and punitive damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Absent JPMorgan's actions, the fund's losses, though
significant, would have been survivable and far less dramatic,"
the letter signed by Amaranth founder Nick Maounis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan called the lawsuit "an effort to rewrite history,
and to blame JPMorgan for losses that were the result of
Amaranth's disastrous trading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan's conduct was entirely appropriate. The firm
intends to defend this baseless lawsuit with the utmost
vigor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit is the latest involving Amaranth, a
once-profitable and high-flying hedge fund that abruptly
imploded within a few weeks over bad trades in the natural gas
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Greenwich, Conn. firm, which has been liquidating since
then, was sued for $150 million last March by the San Diego
County Employees Retirement Association over the pension fund's
losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amaranth's suit said JPMorgan, which was the futures
clearing broker for Amaranth energy trades, sought to derail a
deal that Amaranth had forged with Chicago-based hedge fund
Citadel Investment Group and a previous one with Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan executives allegedly told Citadel officials that
Amaranth "is not as solvent as they are telling you they are,"
according to the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan "intentionally and maliciously sought to derail
the trade between the fund and Citadel, hoping to muscle in on
Citadel's trade to the defendant's financial gain," the suit
stated. "JPMorgan's interference worked... and ultimately
killed the trade" with Citadel, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, JPMorgan and Citadel jointly took over the
energy trading book from Amaranth after the hedge fund
scrambled to find buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortly thereafter, JPMorgan flipped its share of the
assets to Citadel for $725 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This exchange demonstrated that there was so little
remaining risk in the natural gas book by the trade date that
the defendants walked away with $725 million almost immediately
after closing the trade," the suit stated.

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks inched higher on
Wednesday as a rebound in crude oil prices lifted shares of
oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), while
financial services companies gained on reassuring news from
Bear Stearns Cos Inc.BSC.N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But trading was volatile as some investors doubted the
sustainability of Tuesday's sharp gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News of a smaller-than-expected write-down at Bear Stearns
helped calm nerves about the impact of the credit turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch was another standout among financials, its

the leading U.S. brokerage will hire NYSE Chief Executive John
Thain as its next CEO. For details, see [ID:nN14206191]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But technology shares weighed on the broader market a day
after the Nasdaq scored its biggest advance in more than four
years. Shares of big manufacturers, including Caterpillar Inc
(CAT.N) and other energy-hungry industrials, also were on the
defensive as oil prices rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In general, I don't think investors are convinced
yesterday's move was going to be something sustainable," said
Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank
Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Seeing another gap up today, those that were a little
more skeptical about yesterday's rally were certainly looking
to sell stocks into the move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 6.83

&lt;p&gt; (Adds revised profit data, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), the
sixth-largest U.S. bank, said on Wednesday it would restate
third-quarter results to reflect a $115 million charge for its
share of Visa Inc's $2.1 billion antitrust settlement with
American Express Co (AXP.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The charge equals about $80 million after taxes, U.S.
Bancorp said. As a result of the settlement, U.S. Bancorp plans
to revise its third-quarter profit to $1.1 billion, or 62 cents
per share, from the $1.18 billion, or 67 cents, it had reported
on Oct. 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several other U.S. banks have also reduced previously
reported third-quarter earnings for Visa's Nov. 7 settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Bancorp expects its share of proceeds from Visa's
planned initial public offering of stock will more than offset
the $115 million charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa last week said it plans a $10 billion IPO. The
offering is expected by the spring of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp rose 10 cents to
$32.54 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), the
sixth-largest U.S. bank, on Wednesday said it will restate
third-quarter results to reflect a $115 million charge for its
share of Visa Inc's $2.1 billion antitrust settlement with
American Express Co (AXP.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp had on Oct. 16 reported a
quarterly profit of $1.18 billion, or 67 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several other U.S. banks have also reduced previously
reported third-quarter earnings for Visa's Nov. 7 settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Bancorp expects its share of proceeds from Visa's
planned initial public offering of stock will more than offset
the $115 million charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa last week said it plans to conduct a $10 billion IPO.
The offering is expected by the spring of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Nov 14 (Reuters) - The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX has scope to rise more than 13 percent by next summer,
Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief investment strategist at investment
bank Goldman Sachs, said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cohen told a forum at Beijing's Tsinghua University that the
index could reach 1,680 by next summer and said its current fair
value was 1,600. The index closed on Tuesday at 1,481.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology, energy and some financial services would be
among the sectors that should outperform the market, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohen said the U.S. economy was likely to avoid recession.
Growth was set to halve to around 2 percent in the near term,
but she expressed confidence in its long-term prospects as
labour productivity and return on equity were both higher than
in Europe or Japan.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst quote, paragraph 4) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Joseph A. Giannone &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) does not expect to take any significant asset write-downs, its chief executive said on Tuesday, even as the rest of Wall Street posted billions in losses related to the ongoing credit crunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Asked if he expected significant write-downs, CEO Lloyd Blankfein offered a one-word answer: "No." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We're convinced we have a pretty good grip on these valuations," Blankfein said at the Merrill Lynch Banking &amp; Financial Services Conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The comments, which countered rumors that Goldman would be the next bank to report big credit markets losses, drove up Goldman shares $18.08, or 8.4 percent, to $229.41 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "People are convinced that Goldman has been honest regarding their mortgage problems and are buying calls aggressively, anticipating continued upward stock movement," said William Lefkowitz, an options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Blankfein addressed skepticism in the market that Goldman's blowout third-quarter results, which stood in stark contrast to the losses posted by rivals, were the result of unrealistic valuations. His comments also helped fuel a rally in financial services stocks, which have plunged in recent weeks on concern that the damage of the mortgage meltdown was getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman's portfolio of level 3 assets, which under accounting rules are the least liquid and the hardest to price, includes private equity stakes, real estate and leveraged loans. A separate group of employees, rather than traders, are charged with assigning value to positions, Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    If Goldman isn't sure about an estimated value, traders execute test trades to help establish market value that it can apply, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MORTGAGE WEAKNESS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Blankfein also reaffirmed Goldman's bearish view on U.S. mortgage markets, where rising default rates and the lack of buyers has erased much of the value of mortgage securities and derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At the end of the third quarter, when Goldman reaped windfall gains by betting against the mortgage market, it warned that market conditions would get worse. On Tuesday, Blankfein said Goldman continued to bet mortgages would weaken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are net short in these markets," Blankfein said. "We continue to be bearish," he said, noting credit spreads have widened since its results were reported in September. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Doris Frankel, Dan Wilchins, Ed Leefeldt and Michael Flaherty; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Gary Hill) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reuters Messaging: dan.wilchins.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6320)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: GOLDMAN MORTGAGES/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will spend $75 million in 2007 on its "Windows Embedded" operating system for portable devices, up 33 percent from 2006, an executive at the world's largest software maker said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which competes with operating systems like Java, Symbian OS, Palm OS and Linux-based systems, is eyeing demand to link digital cameras, TVs and car audio systems, Ilya Buckshteyn, director of Microsoft's Windows Embedded Marketing, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company launched its latest version of its Windows Embedded CE 6.0 in PDA-hungry Japan on Wednesday, as makers test different operating systems that can run on tiny amounts of memory in a wide array of gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's too difficult to connect and too difficult to share -- it's easier to paste analog photos in an album and post it than it is to share digital photos," Buckshteyn said. "We want to make that easy." Its latest Windows CE program would enable Web services, Voice Over IP calls and Internet browsing on appliances, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects annual corporate sales growth for Windows Embedded to be about 25 percent through 2010 and consumer sales to grow about twice that much each year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mayumi Negishi; Editing by Mike Miller)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. aims to be one of the top two players in the online advertising market in three to five years, a company executive in charge of the business said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a UBS investor conference, Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platforms and services division, laid out the company's strategy to become a leader in the growing online advertising industry with a "10, 20, 30, 40" plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan, which represents Microsoft's aspirations over the next three to five years, calls on Microsoft to increase the company's share in Web search, page views, percentage of time on the Internet and percentage of advertising dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker currently trails Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. in the $40 billion global online advertising market dominated by selling advertising alongside Web search links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft conveyed its seriousness about the business with a $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising firm aQuantive in August. It was the company's biggest-ever acquisition and the company paid a 85 percent premium to land aQuantive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at the landscape of other competitors or other companies in this area, not only do we have the technology, research and development capability to deploy, but (we have) our willingness to invest for the long term," said Johnson in a question-and-answer session with UBS analyst Heather Bellini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the "10, 20, 30, 40" plan, Microsoft wants its Web sites like MSN.com and Windows Live e-mail to comprise 10 percent of all Internet page views from about 6 percent now, Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft also wants to boost the percentage of minutes spent at company Web sites, out of total time spent on the Internet, to 20 percent from about 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another element of Microsoft's plan is to raise its share in online search to 30 percent. Research firm comScore said Microsoft's search market share was about 10 percent in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson said Microsoft has worked to improve the relevance of its Web search results and how it presents that information, but the company has failed to close the gap on Google and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Microsoft aims to capture 40 percent of all dollars coming through digital advertising platforms compared with around 6 percent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to investments in aQuantive, Microsoft said it will have to continue to invest in data centers and servers to power much of its Web services business. Johnson said the company's investments in data centers and servers will range between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Texas court ruled on Thursday that Microsoft Corp did not infringe on patents claimed by Computer Acceleration Corp, a subsidiary of patent warehousing firm Acacia Research Corp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a seven-day trial in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the jury ruled that Computer Acceleration's patent was invalid. The patent in question involved a technology that helps computers boot up faster and speed up the launch of programs, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the suit, Acacia was seeking $2.50 per Windows XP license sold in the U.S. for a total sum of between $600 million to $900 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Acacia fell 25 percent to $12.90 in extended trade from its Thursday Nasdaq close of $17.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the original lawsuit alleged that Microsoft operating systems, Windows XP and Windows Vista, violated the patent but the court dismissed the charges against Vista on procedural grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando and Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle; Editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Mediaweek) - Walter Cronkite, the TV news icon 
often described as "the most trusted man in America," is 
returning to television, signing on as a regular contributor to 
the startup cable network Retirement Living TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Beginning November 20, the former CBS Evening News anchor 
will contribute weekly editorial commentaries during the 
channel's two-hour noontime program, Daily Cafe. Each of 
Cronkite's videotaped messages will run between seven and 10 
minutes in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Cronkite's Commentaries" segments will provide the 
veteran newsman a platform from which to offer his take on a 
host of issues, ranging from politics to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retirement Living made the announcement Thursday morning, 
capping months of negotiations with the 91-year-old Cronkite. 
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Cronkite signed off from CBS News for the last time 
on March 6, 1981, he has stayed true to his parting words, "old 
anchormen, you see, don't fade away; they just keep coming back 
for more." Over the years, he has made occasional appearances 
on TV, including Discovery Channel documentaries and specials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retirement Living reaches some 29 million U.S. households, 
primarily through DirecTV. Its broadcast day runs from 9 a.m.

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - It was Disney's day in the 
picketing spotlight Wednesday, but the studio suggested that 
much of the hubbub was pretty Mickey Mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Each day the east coast branch of the Writers Guild of 
America, which is in its second week of a strike, has been 
targeting a site tied to one of the top media conglomerates. A 
day of leafleting at the World of Disney store in Manhattan 
prompted a corporate rebuttal to some guild claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their impasse between writers and studios has centered 
largely on demands for expanded compensation for content reused 
over the Internet and other new-media platforms. The writers 
are paid for permanent downloads but not in other areas, such 
as ad-supported content streamed for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Union leaflets distributed at the Disney site stated that 
the company has projected $1.5 billion in digital revenue, and 
suggest that the writers' share of that is zero. Disney 
immediately rejected those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The WGA leadership is deliberately distorting the facts," 
the company said in a statement attributed to Disney's ABC 
Studios. "As the WGA knows full well, more than half of 
Disney's digital revenues are from sales of travel packages and 
the vast majority of the rest is from online advertising on 
sites like Disney.com and ESPN.com and through online 
merchandise sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The WGA also knows its members have been paid residuals on 
entertainment content downloaded via iTunes," the company said. 
"Deliberately misleading the public is not the best way to 
resolve this issue and get Hollywood back to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The guild, which also continued picketing activities around 
Los Angeles on Wednesday, said its negotiating demands have 
been reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're only asking for our share," the WGAE said in its 
leaflets. "In fact, we're barely asking for anything: 2.5% of 
whatever money the studios make off our work on the Internet or 
digitally -- the delivery system of the future. But the studios 
are refusing to discuss a fair deal, so we've been forward to 
take our case to you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, a highlight of the WGA West's picketing 
activities Wednesday included an afternoon concert at the NBC 
picket line in Burbank by Scottish singer-songwriter KT 
Tunstall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co says that it has learned of an unsolicited mini-tender offer by KN Value Select to purchase up to 100 mln shares of Coca-Cola's common stock, representing less than 5% of the shares of common stock outstanding. The Coca-Cola Company is in no way associated with KN, its mini-tender or any offering documentation KN may use in connection with its offer. The Coca-Cola Company understands that KN's offer provides that shares cannot be withdrawn once they are tendered pursuant to the offer. The Coca-Cola Company urges shareholders to carefully consider this purported offer, consult with their broker or financial adviser and to exercise extreme caution before surrendering their shares. Among other factors, The Coca-Cola Company urges its shareholders to consider the value of the offered shares relative to the value of Coca-Cola shares, the liquidity and depth of the market for the offered shares, the quality and quantity of information available concerning KN, its control persons and its business plans, and the personal tax consequences to shareholders participating in the exchange offer. In light of the limited publicly available information concerning KN and the exchange offer, The Coca-Cola Company is unable to take a position regarding a recommendation to its shareholders on accepting or rejecting the offer.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) alumni
have for decades gone on to top leadership positions throughout
the business world and in government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, NYSE Euronext NYX.N Chairman and Chief
Executive John Thain, a Goldman alumnus, accepted an offer to
become the new CEO of Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N, filling a
vacancy created by the departure of Stanley O'Neal on Nov. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news is the latest headline-grabbing development
involving former executives from the secretive investment bank,
currently led by Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein. Below is a
list of some former bank officials:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JOHN THAIN -- The former co-president of Goldman Sachs left
a 24-year career at the world's biggest investment bank to
become chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange in 2004.
He merged the NYSE with electronic trading network Archipelago
in 2005, accelerated the Big Board's adoption of electronic
trading and converted the nonprofit club into a publicly listed
company. Last year, he merged NYSE Group with Euronext to build
the first trans-Atlantic exchange operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DUNCAN NIEDERAUER -- The former equities trading executive
joined the NYSE in February after 22 years at Goldman Sachs and
was named president and co-chief operating officer. Niederauer
on Wednesday was named the Big Board's new chairman and CEO,
succeeding Thain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROBERT RUBIN -- Former U.S. Treasury Secretary and chairman
of the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton.
He was co-head of Goldman in the early 1990s before joining
Clinton's cabinet in 1992. In 2001, Rubin left Washington to
join Citigroup (C.N) as chairman of the executive committee.
Last month, after CEO Chuck Prince resigned under pressure,
Rubin took on the bigger role of nonexecutive chairman and is
leading the search for a new CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HENRY "HANK" PAULSON - Paulson joined Goldman Sachs in 1974
and rose quickly as an investment banker to become partner in
eight years. He was chief executive from 1999 to May last year,
when he was named U.S. Treasury Secretary by President George
W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JON CORZINE - Now the Democratic governor of New Jersey,
Corzine joined Goldman Sachs as a bond trader in 1975 and
worked his way up to CEO. He played a key role in pushing the
white-shoe partnership to become a publicly traded bank in
1999, although he was ousted by his co-CEO, Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DANIEL OCH - The former star Goldman trader left to
co-found and head up Och-Ziff Capital Management (OZM.N), which
on Wednesday became the first U.S. hedge-fund-only company to
go public. Its shares fell 4 percent in their market debut
following a $1.15 billion offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROBERT STEEL - U.S. Treasury undersecretary for domestic
finance, under Paulson. He recently helped direct the creation
of the "Super-SIV," a giant investment pool designed to bail
out special investment vehicles hammered by the current credit
crunch. He was a Goldman vice chairman when Paulson was CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROBERT KAPLAN - The former vice chairman and head of
Goldman's investment banking and investment management
businesses was recently named interim head of the Harvard
Management Co, Harvard University's $35 billion endowment.
Kaplan is a professor at Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JOHN THORNTON - Along with Thain, he was formerly president
and co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs. After "the two Johns"
quit, believing they would not ascend to the top spot at
Goldman, Thornton went on to be chairman of the Brookings
Institution. He is also co-chairman of the Committee on Capital
Markets Regulation, which is trying to improve the
competitiveness of U.S. markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EDWARD LAMPERT - A protege of Rubin in Goldman's risk
arbitrage department, he left to form one of the world's top
performing hedge funds, ESL Investments. He was nicknamed "the
next Warren Buffett" after he acquired Kmart for less than $1
billion, using the retailer as a cash cow to make other
investments and reaping the value of its real estate assets. He
later orchestrated the $11 billion merger of Kmart and Sears
Roebuck  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHRISTOPHER FLOWERS - Head of J.C. Flowers  Co, a buyout
firm that unveiled a $25 billion plan to take student lender
Sallie Mae private. Currently he's waging a legal battle after
trying to slash his offer. Flowers, who founded Goldman's
financial institutions merger advisory practice, left the firm
in 1998. Two years later he participated in the takeover of
Japan's Long Term Credit bank, which went public in 2004 as
Shinsei Bank (8303.T). He made an unsuccessful bid for failed
commodities broker Refco in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JOHN WHITEHEAD -- A 38-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, he
retired in 1984 as co-chair and senior partner. More recently
he was chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp and at
one time chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He
was a deputy secretary of state in 1985, a second-in-command to
Secretary George Shultz under President Ronald Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JOSHUA BOLTEN - Bush's White House chief of staff was
Goldman's executive director for legal and government affairs
from 1994 to 1999.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Nov 15 (Reuters) - Asia is still about growth and
investment strategies focused on this theme will continue to
deliver robust returns for stock investors next year, JPMorgan
said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Stocks in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, looked
set to post their fifth straight year of gains and while many
markets have become expensive, there is scope for them to become
even more so, supported by solid earnings growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Focus on earnings momentum, don't get too concerned about
valuations. Don't use valuations as a trigger to sell, use
concerns about earnings as a trigger to sell," regional
strategist Adrian Mowat told a media briefing in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I do think valuations will get more extended because of
what's occuring with monetary policy, what's occuring with the
desire to buy growth, and ... the reflation story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the sectors, JPMorgan likes Chinese and Indian autos
due to strong demand growth and is recommending Minth Group Ltd
(0425.HK), Great Wall Motor Co Ltd (2333.HK), Bajaj Auto Ltd
(BJAT.BO) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The region's strong economies also bode well for
conglomerates such as Swire Pacific Ltd (0019.HK), Bakrie 
Brothers Tbk PT (BNBR.JK) and Macau plays including Shun Tak
Holdings Ltd (0242.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan expects Asia's booming economies will continue to
grow steadily in 2008 and believes a soft U.S landing coupled
with low interest rates in developed nations will be highly
favourable for financial assets in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asian stocks excluding Japan as measured by MSCI's index
.MIAPJ0000PUS have risen nearly 40 percent so far this year,
more than triple the gains for global stocks .MIWD00000PUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It trades at 17 times forward earnings, well above the
long-term average of 12.8 times. This compares with 14 times for
global stocks, 14.7 times for Japan and the United States and
12.4 times for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As we enter the sixth year of an Asian equity bull market
the risk is now high valuations; this region is more expensive on
a forward PE than all other regions including Japan," JPMorgan
analysts said in their 2008 outlook report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "Our advice is to continue to pay up for growth. It is
premium growth that attracts investors to emerging
markets. This trend is increasing as local savers increase
their exposure to equities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the risks facing Asian stocks include a hard landing
for the U.S. economy and weaker European growth, slowing earnings
momentum, a sharp correction for China's mainland stock market,
and Indian equities.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) is staking out a major new source of business helping clients like banks or retailers manage data centers on a par with Internet players such as Google or Microsoft, a top official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Zeitler, the executive in charge of IBM's hardware business, said the initiative to set up customers with the technology, software and services to operate data centers could rank in significance with IBM's support for Linux in recent years or its push to get businesses on the Internet the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has dubbed its new strategy "Blue Cloud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name is a play on IBM's corporate nickname "Big Blue" and "cloud computing," the trend by Internet powerhouses to array huge numbers of computers in centralized data centers to deliver Web-based applications to users, rather than making their customers run such programs on their local machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, which pioneered centralized data centers decades ago, is looking to arm its customers with technology similar to what it has long offered in the form of hosted services for clients who rely on IBM to operate their data centers for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It now wants to help customers build data centers for themselves composed of thousands of low-cost personal computers, equipping them with the data-crunching power of consumer Internet giants Google Inc (GOOG.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Google and Amazon are on to something," Zeitler said. "Our particular focus is taking these standards of Internet computing and bringing them to the mainstream in the commercial world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG BUSINESS, BUT HOW BIG?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeitler declined to say how much revenue its cloud computing strategy might produce, saying IBM was still sizing up prospects. "We think this is a big move in the market and we are going to make a big move behind it," said Zeitler, a 38-year IBM veteran whose full title is senior vice president and group executive of IBM's Systems and Technology Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its initial phase, IBM plans to make 200 IBM researchers available to work with clients, which may include both businesses large and small, university research centers as well as government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first products of the program are set to be available in spring of 2008, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One initial customer of IBM's Blue Cloud strategy will be the government of Vietnam, and it is working with a non-US automaker, the Armonk, New York-based computer company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM plans to unveil plans for Blue Cloud at an event in Shanghai on Thursday, where it said it will demonstrate a cloud computing system running on IBM's BladeCenter brand servers and low-cost Intel-class microprocessors. It said it also intends to offer a mainframe-class cloud computer system next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW CLOUD COMPUTERS WORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is to make corporate data centers operate more like the Internet by enabling computing to be spread across a large, distributed pool of computers, rather than on local machines or remote server farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lets organizations switch to resources to where they are be needed, virtually gaining access to computers and storage on demand. The older approach of running individual applications on separate servers means as little as 10 percent of a stand-alone computer's capacity is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While big Internet players run networks that tie together hundreds of thousands of computers, large commercial customers may operate tens of thousands of servers, Zeitler estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the strategy, IBM will offer services and products that allow customers to implement "cloud computing" strategies of their own, rather than forcing them to rent space in other data centers and risk exposing business secrets. Companies are struggling to pack more computers into cramped data centers while coping with surging electricity demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian marines seized a makeshift submarine capable of smuggling up to 12 metric tons of cocaine through the Pacific to Central America, making it one of the largest such craft found, authorities said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nearly completed fiberglass submarine, found in a rural area in south Narino province, had space for four crew members, the Navy said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia's Pacific coast has become a key transport route for traffickers looking to access commercial sea lanes north to Mexico and the United States. Guerrillas, paramilitaries and traffickers often fight to control Pacific drug routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudimentary submarines and submersible containers dragged behind container ships are among the more inventive transport methods used by traffickers. Since 2005, Colombia's navy has captured 11 homemade submarines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia remains the world's No. 1 cocaine producer -- with output of at least 600 metric tons a year -- despite getting billions in U.S. aid to fight traffickers and guerrillas. But violence from the four-decade-old conflict has eased sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Patrick Markey, editing by Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which has played leading roles in government and business, helped broker one of the biggest deals in baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Goldman executives this week cleared the way for the All-Star third baseman Alex Rodriguez to negotiate a deal with the New York Yankees that could be worth $300 million over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bankers helped restore ties that were severed after A-Rod, as the player is known, last month declined to negotiate a contract extension with the Yankees and instead opted out of the last three years of his contract. His plan, as guided by agent Scott Boras, was to test the market as a free agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez, already baseball's highest paid player, this year led the major leagues with 54 home runs, 156 runs batted-in and 143 runs scored. He was twice named the American League's most valuable player and is heavily favored to win a third award for his 2007 campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rodriguez's tenure with the Yankees has been stormy. Although he is consistently one of the most successful hitters during the regular season, he has come under fire for falling short in playoff series over the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Boras were also criticized for announcing his decision to opt out during the deciding game of the 2007 World Series, violating a long held policy that no baseball news should upstage the annual championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez never sat down with the Yanks to hear the team's offer before declaring his free agency, creating more ill will between Rodriguez and the Yankees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Rodriguez, 32, reached out to John Mallory, a former Miami neighbor who works in Goldman's private wealth management business, according to a person familiar with the matter. Rodriguez asked whether Goldman, which owns a stake in the Yankees' cable network YES, could intervene on his behalf and arrange a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mallory in turn contacted Gerry Cardinale, an executive in Goldman's principal investing business, which makes direct investments with the bank's own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardinale played a lead role in helping create the YES Network, which broadcasts the team's games and has become a major revenue source for baseball's wealthiest team. Cardinale also is a member of the YES board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's intervention in the A-Rod talks comes as some YES Network owners are currently mulling the sale of their stakes in the business, sources have told Reuters. The Yankees own a controlling 40 percent stake in the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rodriguez talks are still in progress and no deal has been signed, though an agreement could be announced Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardinale and Mallory did not receive fees for their efforts, the person familiar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Boras and officials from the Yankees did not respond to messages seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intervention of Goldman Sachs marks yet another moment in the spotlight for the secrecy-obsessed bank. On Wednesday former Goldman co-president John Thain, chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange for the past four years, was named CEO of Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is better known as the world's most active advisor to mergers and initial public offerings, and manages a giant private equity investment business that has snapped up dozens of companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late in October, at the end of the baseball season, Rodriguez and Boras decided to opt out of the remaining three years of his 10-year, $252 million contract with the Yankees. The remaining years were worth a reported $72 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yankees had said they would not negotiate with him if he opted out. Had he not opted out, the Yankees would have a subsidy from Rodriguez's previous team the Texas Rangers under terms of that brought him to New York for the 2004 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources have said Boras told the club it would have to offer $350 million to stop him from becoming a free agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez this week decided to seek talks with the Yankees, without Boras at his side, before heading into serious talks with other clubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, Nov. 16 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's
biggest drugmaker, said on Friday it has agreed to acquire
Coley Pharmaceutical Group Inc COLY.O, a developer of vaccine
technology and drugs to treat cancer, asthma and other
disorders, for $164 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer will make a cash tender offer for all the
outstanding common stock of Coley for $8.00 a share, a 167
percent premium over Coley's closing price of $3.00 a share on
Thursday on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coley's shares rose as high as $7.80 in early trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies said shareholders holding about 27 percent of
Coley's shares have entered into agreements to tender their
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said the acquisition is designed to extend its
presence in the fast-growing market for vaccines and to boost
its portfolio of experimental drugs to treat a range of
diseases, including Alzheimer's, asthma, infectious diseases
and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coley is working to develop a new class of drug candidates
called TLR Therapeutics which either stimulate or block immune
system receptors known as Toll-like receptors (TLR), which
direct the immune system to fight disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition is expected to close in 2008.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The impact of the U.S. mortgage market crisis on the underlying economy could be "dramatic" as leveraged investors may need to scale back lending by up to $2 trillion, according to investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a report dated November 15, Goldman's chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius said a "back-of-the-envelope" estimate of credit losses on outstanding mortgages, based on past default experience, was around $400 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike stock market losses, which are typically absorbed by "long-only" investors, this mortgage-related hit is mostly borne by leveraged investors such as banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds and government-sponsored enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And leveraged investors react to losses by actively cutting back lending to keep capital ratios from falling -- A bank targeting a constant capital ratio of 10 percent, for example, would need to shrink its balance by $10 for every $1 in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The macroeconomic consequences could be quite dramatic," Hatzius said in the note to clients. "If leveraged investors see $200 billion of the $400 billion aggregate credit loss, they might need to scale back their lending by $2 trillion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a large shock," he said, adding the number equates to 7 percent of total debt owed by U.S. non-financial sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatzius said such a shock could produce a "substantial recession" if it occurred over one year, or a long period of sluggish growth if it occurred over two-to-four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of a number of caveats outlined in the report was that baseline economic forecasts may already include significant reductions in the pace of mortgage lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the conclusion remained a gloomy one regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The likely mortgage credit losses pose a significantly bigger macroeconomic risk than generally recognized," he wrote. "While the uncertainty is large, the associated downward pressure on lending raises the risk of significant weakness in economic activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mike Dolan, editing by Mike Peacock)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds details, analyst's comments, background, share
movement)

 Nov 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its price target on
Barclays Plc (BARC.L) by 30 pence to 627 pence, saying the
bank's disclosure of its subprime, structured investment
vehicle and leverage loans positions was not enough to quell
the market's concerns on its investment bank unit Barclays
Capital.

 Barclays, Britain's third biggest bank, on Thursday said
its investment banking arm BarCap had made a 1.3 billion pound
($2.7 billion) write-down due to its exposure to credit market
problems in the four months to the end of October -- far less
than many estimates.

 Analyst James Chappell who has a "neutral" rating on the
stock, added that the key risks to the company include further
significant write-downs in BarCap, continuing slowdown in
capital markets or a significant slowdown in UK growth.

 "While the greater disclosure should assuage some of the
worst fears in the market, Barclays still remains dependent, in
our view, on BarCap to deliver its growth," Chappell wrote in a
note to clients.

 Chappell said Barclays shares currently trade at 7.4 times
his 2008 earnings estimates and trail the broader UK banks and
European banks, which are trading at a multiple of 9.9 and 9.8
respectively.

 Shares of Barclays were trading down about 1.4 percent at
523 pence in morning trade on the London Stock Exchange. They
have fallen 15 percent in the last month on fears that the bank
faces big losses linked to the subprime crisis.

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - It was Disney's day in the 
picketing spotlight Wednesday, but the studio suggested that 
much of the hubbub was pretty Mickey Mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Each day the east coast branch of the Writers Guild of 
America, which is in its second week of a strike, has been 
targeting a site tied to one of the top media conglomerates. A 
day of leafleting at the World of Disney store in Manhattan 
prompted a corporate rebuttal to some guild claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their impasse between writers and studios has centered 
largely on demands for expanded compensation for content reused 
over the Internet and other new-media platforms. The writers 
are paid for permanent downloads but not in other areas, such 
as ad-supported content streamed for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Union leaflets distributed at the Disney site stated that 
the company has projected $1.5 billion in digital revenue, and 
suggest that the writers' share of that is zero. Disney 
immediately rejected those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The WGA leadership is deliberately distorting the facts," 
the company said in a statement attributed to Disney's ABC 
Studios. "As the WGA knows full well, more than half of 
Disney's digital revenues are from sales of travel packages and 
the vast majority of the rest is from online advertising on 
sites like Disney.com and ESPN.com and through online 
merchandise sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The WGA also knows its members have been paid residuals on 
entertainment content downloaded via iTunes," the company said. 
"Deliberately misleading the public is not the best way to 
resolve this issue and get Hollywood back to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The guild, which also continued picketing activities around 
Los Angeles on Wednesday, said its negotiating demands have 
been reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're only asking for our share," the WGAE said in its 
leaflets. "In fact, we're barely asking for anything: 2.5% of 
whatever money the studios make off our work on the Internet or 
digitally -- the delivery system of the future. But the studios 
are refusing to discuss a fair deal, so we've been forward to 
take our case to you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, a highlight of the WGA West's picketing 
activities Wednesday included an afternoon concert at the NBC 
picket line in Burbank by Scottish singer-songwriter KT 
Tunstall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Mediaweek) - Walter Cronkite, the TV news icon 
often described as "the most trusted man in America," is 
returning to television, signing on as a regular contributor to 
the startup cable network Retirement Living TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Beginning November 20, the former CBS Evening News anchor 
will contribute weekly editorial commentaries during the 
channel's two-hour noontime program, Daily Cafe. Each of 
Cronkite's videotaped messages will run between seven and 10 
minutes in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Cronkite's Commentaries" segments will provide the 
veteran newsman a platform from which to offer his take on a 
host of issues, ranging from politics to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retirement Living made the announcement Thursday morning, 
capping months of negotiations with the 91-year-old Cronkite. 
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Cronkite signed off from CBS News for the last time 
on March 6, 1981, he has stayed true to his parting words, "old 
anchormen, you see, don't fade away; they just keep coming back 
for more." Over the years, he has made occasional appearances 
on TV, including Discovery Channel documentaries and specials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retirement Living reaches some 29 million U.S. households, 
primarily through DirecTV. Its broadcast day runs from 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. EST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INGLESIDE, Texas Nov 19 (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers
are putting the finishing touches on Chevron Corp's (CVX.N)
massive $1 billion production platform Blind Faith and, if all
goes well, oil and natural gas will flow from the facility in
next year's second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But there are still hurdles for Chevron to overcome to keep
the project on schedule. That includes possible delays from bad
weather and all the surprises that may come with bringing oil
and natural gas up from reserves at depths below the seabed of
more than 20,000 feet in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only natural gas platform Independence Hub is operating in
deeper waters in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a lot of unknowns with these reservoirs," Buddy
Lang, Blind Faith's project manager told a group of reporters
on Friday. "We're going to learn a lot about the field as we're
doing it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has not done tests to determine how much oil will
flow from the three wells the platform will be located above.
The company plans learn from initial production and make
decisions from that, Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And so far, the project has been built on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For now, the semisubmersible facility towers above the
Texas coast, rising the equivalent of 20 stories from bottom of
the hull to the helicopter landing pad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the ground, men working on the top-sides of the
facility look as small as ants, while seabirds swoop beneath
the four towers that will eventually float in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Initial production from Blind Faith is estimated at 30,000
barrels of oil per day (b/d) and 30 million cubic feet (mmcf/d)
of gas per day. Blind Faith has a production capacity of about
45,000 b/d and 45 mmcf/d of natural gas, but that can be
upgraded, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oil and natural gas that will come from Blind Faith is
needed by Chevron, whose worldwide production drop about 4
percent to 2.6 million barrels a day in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company was also forced to delay its multibillion-
dollar Tahiti project in the Gulf of Mexico by about a year due
to defective shackles in the facility's mooring system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Tahiti project had been scheduled to come online
sometime in mid-2008 with an estimate production of 125,000
barrels per day, making it one of the largest in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After final checks Blind Faith will begin an 11-day journey
to its final location 160 miles southeast of New Orleans in the
Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That trip is scheduled for the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blind Faith is 75 percent owned by Chevron and 25 percent
owned by independent oil and gas company Anadarko Petroleum
Corp (APC.N).

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian marines seized a makeshift submarine capable of smuggling up to 12 tonnes of cocaine through the Pacific to Central America, making it one of the largest such craft found, authorities said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nearly completed fiberglass submarine, found in a rural area in south Narino province, had space for four crew members, the Navy said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia's Pacific coast has become a key transport route for traffickers looking to access commercial sea lanes north to Mexico and the United States. Guerrillas, paramilitaries and traffickers often fight to control Pacific drug routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudimentary submarines and submersible containers dragged behind container ships are among the more inventive transport methods used by traffickers. Since 2005, Colombia's navy has captured 11 homemade submarines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia remains the world's No. 1 cocaine producer -- with output of at least 600 tonnes a year -- despite getting billions in U.S. aid to fight traffickers and guerrillas. But violence from the four-decade-old conflict has eased sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Nov 19 (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the fees
European credit card operators can legally charge shops is
delaying investment in new types of card, Visa Europe and
MasterCard (MA.N) said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The European Union's competition watchdog is looking at
whether MasterCard is abusing its large market share by setting
unreasonably high "interchange" fees for shops that accept its
credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The verdict, which is also likely to affect Visa Europe, may
be delayed until 2008 due to what retailers have said is a
disagreement between EU competition and internal market
authorities over the timing and extent of changes to the
structure of fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This uncertainty makes it hard to invest in new card
services that the European Central Bank and EU officials want
launched off the back of the single euro payments area (SEPA),
which starts on Jan. 1, Visa Europe's chief executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The real plea is that we need certainty on what the
economics are under which we will operate with payment platforms
across Europe," said Visa Europe CEO Peter Ayliffe at
Frankfurt's annual Euro Finance Week conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've been waiting for years to actually get established
what interchange (fees) should be. Until we get that sorted ...
I don't think we will see the benefits we want out of SEPA," he
continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ayliffe cited 'wave and pay' contact-free cards, which can
be used to pay for low-value goods in under a second and are
currently available in London, as products that could be rolled
out more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rival operator MasterCard shared Visa Europe's view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The uncertainty created by interchange is a concern," said
MasterCard Europe's regional manager Alfredo Gangotena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interchange fees typically amount to 1 percent of a
purchase, and have credit and insurance charges bundled in on
top of the pure cost of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes is thought to want
to allow retailers to pay just the transaction charge, while
Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy fears ditching
interchange fees would make new cross-border cards unviable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retailers say interchange fees are too high, but their lobby
group EuroCommerce told Reuters last week that the delay in the
EU decision was nonetheless hurting the implementation of SEPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ECB Executive Board member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell,
speaking on the same panel as the card operators, said almost
all banks were ready for SEPA's January start, but that more
needed to be done to inform consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEPA is a key part of the EU's attempt to create a more
consumer-friendly single market. Consumers in the bloc of 490
million people will be able to authorise payments in euros and
use debit cards anywhere in the 27 member states from a single
bank account.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell on
Monday after Goldman Sachs added Citigroup Inc (C.N) to its
"sell" list, citing prospects for more credit losses at the No.
1 U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of Citigroup dropped more than 2 percent in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, a Citigroup analyst upgraded the U.S. banking
sector's shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said Citigroup could have to write off an
additional $11 billion in the fourth quarter to reflect losses
on securities linked to subprime mortgages and other
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also cut its profit estimates for Citigroup
through 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We could see a new round of selling in some financial
stocks," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm
LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A lot of investors had hoped there was a bottom in terms
of the writedowns, but this quarter hasn't shown that there is
a bottom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 fell 6.2 points and were below fair
value, a formula to evaluate pricing taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 dropped 40
points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures slipped 9.25 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also cut its price target on Citigroup shares to
$33, saying the bank will face many industry and
company-specific challenges in the next six months. For
details, see [ID:nWNA5337].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Europe, the head of Germany's Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE)
said on Monday recent writedowns at major U.S. banks in the
wake of a global credit crunch were rattling investor nerves
again. Chief Executive Josef Ackermann also warned that
credit-market problems could pressure the broader economy in
Europe and the United States. [ID:nL1948250]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Citigroup's Tobias Levkovich upgraded the U.S. banking
sector to overweight from market weight, saying the shares'
valuation was compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noting that his call on the sector may seem fairly
controversial, Levkovich, the company's chief U.S. equity
strategist, said that while the sector had taken some sharp
hits due to the subprime woes, there appears now to be a
pile-on effect that seems to be overdone. [ID:nBNG155523].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks rose on Friday after a day of sharp price
swings, helping the SP 500 to narrowly avert a third straight
week of losses. Bargain-hunting lifted the beaten-down
technology sector, while shares of oil companies advanced on
buoyant crude prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But shares of financial services companies fell on
persistent worry that losses from mortgage defaults and the
housing slump may worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP financial index .GSPF notched its third straight
day of losses, but was up for the week after a two-week losing
streak.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to widen distribution, update closing level on
Countrywide)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kristina Cooke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks clawed back from
three-month lows on Tuesday as surging oil prices lifted Exxon
Mobil Corp and offset falls in financial shares on new
concerns about the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices jumped above $98 a barrel, bolstered by the
dollar's record weakness and giving Exxon shares their biggest
one-day gain in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But financial and housing stocks had another tough day.
Freddie Mac FRE.N, the No. 2 provider of funding for
mortgages, set the tone after it said it may slash its
dividend and raise new capital as it works through what it
called an "extremely difficult year" and its shares fell to an
11-year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bounce-back happened in oil and some of the other
commodities," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of the U.S. Equity
Group at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management in New York.
"But you may also be seeing some bottom fishing as the market
may be beginning to think that the worst of the write-offs are
behind us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 51.70
points, or 0.40 percent, at 13,010.14. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX was up 6.43 points, or 0.45 percent, at
1,439.70. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 3.43
points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,596.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon Mobil climbed 4.4 percent to $87.82, while
Chevron (CVX.N) rose 3.4 percent to $87.90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the session, the Nasdaq fell to a level more than
10 percent from its 52-week high set on Oct 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Federal Reserve projected U.S. growth to slow in 2008
to between 1.8 percent and 2.5 percent, sharply down from the
2.5 percent to 2.75 percent forecast in June, initially
sending stocks lower. But some analysts saw the lowered growth
forecast as a sign that the Federal Reserve may have to cut
interest rates again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Freddie Mac plunged nearly 29 percent to $26.74,
off an 11-year low at $25 touched earlier in the session.
Freddie Mac, however, still ranked near the top of the list of
the biggest percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of its bigger rival, Fannie Mae FNM.N, tumbled 24.8
percent to $28.25 after hitting a 12-year low at $27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other mortgage lenders' stocks also got hammered by
investor jitters about mounting losses in the sector. Shares
of Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N initially fell more than
22 percent, before slashing those losses after the company
said it had ample liquidity and capital. Countrywide shares
ended down 2.7 percent at $10.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But large technology companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O)
and IBM (IBM.N) gained on optimism about earnings after a
stronger-than-expected profit and forecast from computer and
printer maker Hewlett Packard (HPQ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft rose 1.8 percent to $34.58 on the
Nasdaq, while IBM advanced 1.2 percent to $103.42 on the NYSE.
HP shares added 0.2 percent to $49.56 on the Big Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Upscale department store chain Nordstrom (JWN.N) rose 12.1
percent to $34.21 on robust earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was a mixed day for retailers, with Target's
(TGT.N) shares falling 4.1 percent to $51.69 after its
quarterly profit dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones U.S. home construction index .DJUSHB slid
4.1 percent after data showed permits for future building hit
a 14-year low, indicating the grim market for home
construction will likely continue to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was especially volatile due to the upcoming
Thanksgiving holiday, which has many market participants
absent for most of the week, leaving stocks vulnerable to
swift turnarounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was active on the NYSE, with about 1.87 billion
shares changing hands, above last year's estimated daily
average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.64 billion
shares traded, also ahead of last year's daily average of 2.02
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In spite of the late in the day rally, declining stocks
outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about 17 to 16 on the
NYSE and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut Credit Suisse
(CSGN.VX) to "sell" from "neutral" and added the Swiss bank to
its conviction sell list, citing lower anticipated global
growth and continued scepticism over the value of capital
markets businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also removed British lender HBOS HBOS.L
from its conviction buy list, while adding Lloyds TSB Group Plc
(LLOY.L) to the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said HBOS' stock would be weighed down by the
negative sentiment over rising funding costs, a UK housing
slowdown and concerns over corporate earnings sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage noted that the Lloyds TSB stock had held up
relatively well versus its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also resumed coverage of Spanish bank Banco
Santander (SAN.MC) with a "buy" rating. The brokerage said the
bank had gained credibility as an efficient capital manager
with its acquisition of ABN AMRO's AAH.AS Brazilian bank
Banco Real.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds attorney comment, stock activity)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) has won a
U.S. court ruling that could limit the lawsuits claiming that
its Celebrex painkiller caused heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge Charles Breyer of U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California ruled on Monday that plaintiffs
had not presented scientifically reliable evidence that
Celebrex causes heart attacks or strokes when taken at a
strength of 200 milligrams, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most Celebrex patients are prescribed the 200 milligram
dosage, according to Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In federal lawsuits against the drug maker, more than 3,000
plaintiffs have said Celebrex caused heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are pleased with the decision of the federal court,
which recognizes the lack of any credible evidence linking
Celebrex, at its most common dosage form, with heart attacks or
strokes,"  Pfizer General Counsel Allen Waxman said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that this ruling will greatly limit the scope
of this litigation," Waxman said, "and we intend to continue to
vigorously defend the cases against us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Pennock, a plaintiffs' lawyer with Weitz  Luxenberg,
said 500 to 1,000 of the plaintiffs were 200 milligram cases,
but other, higher-dose cases were moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The 200 milligram cases were never really a major
component of the litigation for those of us who were leading
the charge," Pennock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Celebrex is part of the Cox-2 class of painkillers that
also includes two drugs no longer on the market: Merck  Co's
(MRK.N) Vioxx and Pfizer's Bextra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion earlier this month to
settle most of the claims that Vioxx caused heart attacks and
strokes in thousands of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares were up 11 cents at $22.82 in morning New
York Stock Exchange trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Justin Grant; Editing by

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analysts' comments, share movement, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 20 (Reuters) - Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns
and Needham  Co raised their price target on Hewlett-Packard
Co (HPQ.N), while maintaining their top ratings, a day after
the world's largest personal computer maker posted
better-than-expected quarterly profit and outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Palo Alto, California-based HP fell 10 cents to
$49.34 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would continue to buy HP shares as the company's
balanced strength and ability to drive outsized earnings growth
and upside... provide the stock with strong defensive
characteristics in a softer macro and market environment," said
Goldman analyst Laura Conigliaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's Conigliaro, who rates HP "buy," and Bear Stearns
analyst Andrew Neff upped their price target on HP's stock by
$2, to $57 and $70, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear's Neff, who has an "outperform" rating on the stock,
said he saw opportunities for both cost reduction and stronger
growth at HP, and that the company remains well positioned to
transition "from a turnaround to a growth story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HP last year overtook Dell Inc DELL.O as the largest
maker of personal computers after three years of lagging behind
its Round Rock, Texas-based rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HP Chief Executive Mark Hurd has focused on selling laptops
and printers in stores and in markets outside the United
States, areas where Dell lagged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With overall IT spending stable in the company's core
markets, and a predominately international revenue stream, we
expect HP to continue to outperform and generate
earnings-per-share upside even versus its raised guidance,"
Needham analyst Richard Kugele wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kugele, who maintained his "buy" rating on HP, raised his
price target to $57 from $54.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quote, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRIPOLI Nov 20 (Reuters) - Libya's state-owned energy
company NOC said on Tuesday it had signed an agreement with
Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) to explore for oil at Bloc 21 in the Sirte

total acreage of 10,000 sq km of deep waters with a depth of
2,000 metres on average," National Oil Corporation (NOC) added

years, NOC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The agreement also stipulates that Exxon pays for the
permit signing, and for a training programme of Libyan experts
on the top of other amounts of money to be spent on education
facilities in Libya," NOC said without elaborating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February Exxon Mobil signed an exploration and production
sharing agreement with Libya on four blocs in the Sirte Basin
offshore awarded to the company in December 2006 in an
exploration licensing round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Libya wants to attract foreign investment to help it hike
its oil output capacity to more than 3.0 million barrels (bpd)
per day by 2010/12 from about 1.6 million bpd at present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The NOC says less than a third of Libya, Africa's
fourth-largest country, has been explored for hydrocarbons. Its
estimated reserves of more than 37 billion barrels so far have
put it among the top 10 oil reserves owners.

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian marines seized a makeshift submarine capable of smuggling up to 12 tonnes of cocaine through the Pacific to Central America, making it one of the largest such craft found, authorities said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nearly completed fiberglass submarine, found in a rural area in south Narino province, had space for four crew members, the Navy said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia's Pacific coast has become a key transport route for traffickers looking to access commercial sea lanes north to Mexico and the United States. Guerrillas, paramilitaries and traffickers often fight to control Pacific drug routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudimentary submarines and submersible containers dragged behind container ships are among the more inventive transport methods used by traffickers. Since 2005, Colombia's navy has captured 11 homemade submarines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia remains the world's No. 1 cocaine producer -- with output of at least 600 tonnes a year -- despite getting billions in U.S. aid to fight traffickers and guerrillas. But violence from the four-decade-old conflict has eased sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs issued a gloomy report on the U.S. financial services sector, saying housing prices are likely to fall a lot further, write-downs will mount and some mortgage insurers and guarantors will be forced to raise capital just to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Falling house prices and a worsening economy will drive down securities based on residential mortgages, especially those given to borrowers with the riskiest credit, Goldman Sachs financial analysts Lori Appelbaum, Thomas Cholnoky, James Fotheringham and William Tanona, wrote in a lengthy report released on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the value of collateralized debt obligations -- bonds based on pools mortgages -- related to those subprime mortgages, could fall another $150 billion across the industry, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's on top of the $18 billion financial firms globally wrote down in the third quarter and the $22 billion that some companies have indicated they expect in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share markets across the globe sank after an earlier report from the Goldman analysts downgrading Citigroup (C.N) reignited fears that losses from the global credit crisis may widen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock benchmarks in the United States fell to their lowest levels in three months on Monday. In Asia MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks .MIAPJ0000PUS hit its lowest level since late September. Financial stocks were among the worst affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inevitability, certain financial guarantors and mortgage insurers will need to raise capital to shore up their balance sheets. The Goldman analysts said these companies will fall into two groups, the desperate -- those which will face the risk of going out of business if they don't raise capital -- and the needy -- those that could employ other means to do so, such as cutting dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman lists financial guarantors MBIA Inc (MBI.N), Ambac Financial Group Inc, Security Capital Assurance Ltd SCA.N and Assured Guaranty Ltd (AGO.N) as the desperate. It lists Citigroup Inc, Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), First Horizon National Corp (FHN.N) and National City Corp NCC.N in the "needy" column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the riskier loans such as subprime or no-or-low documentation mortgages, returns in the mortgage business will be significantly lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investor appetite for high-yielding subprime mortgage securities fuelled the home pricing bubble and this investor market is not coming back," the analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brokers will rethink their business models focused on these exotic loans, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSUMER CREDIT FEAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With home prices, consumer credit deterioration is not far off. The downturn in housing is spilling over into employment in some states and is leading to high consumer losses, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling home prices have put one-third of the United States, by Gross Domestic Product, in or near recession, the analysts wrote. California is the biggest concern as it represents 13 percent of the U.S. GDP. Card and auto losses will rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although financial companies across the board have seen their stock prices walloped, despite attractive valuations, Goldman says a broad wave of industry consolidation is still another 12 to 18 months away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Credit risk, balance sheet deterioration, and business model risk continues to outweigh low valuations," the analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe acquisitions are unlikely to occur until balance sheets stabilize and a market bottom is in sight," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once U.S. housing shows signs of bottoming out, there will be some solid but tarnished companies investors will view as likely acquisitions targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suitors are likely to come from all parts of the globe, even from emerging economies such as China or India, as the dollar remains weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would not be surprised to see the first acquisition of a major U.S. broker or commercial bank by an emerging market institution," the analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday, the analysts downgraded Citigroup (C.N) to a sell because of its exposure to CDO revaluations and Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) because of its vulnerability to consumer credit deterioration. In the report, the analysts suggested pairing trades with these companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Go long on American Express Co (AXP.N) shares and short Discover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Go long on Lehman Brothers Holding's LEH.N shares and short Citigroup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the firm believes that three financial "babies" have been "thrown out with the bathwater" and recommend buying American International Group Inc (AIG.N), US Bancorp (USB.N) and aircraft lessors, such as AerCap Holdings NV (AER.N), Aircastle (AYR.N), and Genesis Lease Ltd GLS.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally it recommends another pair trade; go long on U.S. Bancorp's shares and short First Horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ilaina Jonas; editing by Louise Heavens)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Nov 21 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
revealed some details on amended loan terms for its ailing Hong
Kong park on Wednesday, including its waiver of management
fees, as well as a previously announced deferral of royalties
for fiscal 2008 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company also said in its 10-K annual filing that it
expects to distribute about 13 feature films in fiscal 2008
under the Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar and Touchstone Pictures
banners and nine films under the Miramax banner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It listed $22.8 billion in total contractual commitments
for broadcast rights for sports, feature films and other
programming as of the Sept. 29 end of its fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That total includes $1.1 billion for available programming
and about $19.2 billion related to sports programming rights,
primarily NFL, NBA, NASCAR, MLB and College Football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said earlier this month that two-year-old Hong Kong
Disneyland, in which it holds a minority stake, had to change
the terms of loans whose performance-based covenants it had not
been able to meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney and the park reached an agreement with its
creditors, effective Nov. 14, to remove the performance
measures tied to a term loan and revolving credit facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new agreement shortened the $284 million term loan
maturity to Sept. 30, 2008 and decreased the available credit
in the revolving facility to $103 million from $129 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The loan previously matured in 2015 and the revolving
credit facility had been frozen after the park failed to meet
attendance targets since its September 2005 opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the filing, Disney said it would be paid deferred
royalties "dependent upon the future operating performance of
Hong Kong Disneyland."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company reiterated it expects to invest more money in
the park, which analysts have described as too small to attract
enough visitors to meet its attendance targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares closed down 16 cents, or less than 1 percent,
at $31.50 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Babies born to mothers who used cocaine while pregnant show a reduction in blood flow to the brain when they reach adolescence, according to a report in the journal Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Nov 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).
has told investors it expects its Global Alpha hedge fund will
end the year with roughly $4 billion in assets, about 60
percent less than in January, several people familiar with the
matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The fund, a so-called quantitative portfolio that relies on
computer models to make big bets, suffered losses amid the
ongoing credit market turmoil that also hurt other prominent
hedge funds. On top of that, some investors in the Alpha fund
asked for their money back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs' fiscal year ends on Nov. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The steep loss marks an embarrassment for the prominent
Wall Street securities firm, which has trained many of the
world's most successful hedge fund managers early in their
careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One person familiar with the Alpha fund who was not
authorized to speak about it publicly said recent redemption
notices were heavier than initially anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That person also said Goldman has signaled it has no plans
to wind the fund down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Historically, smaller hedge funds had been thought to
perform better because they are considered to be more nimble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The securities firm declined to comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein
said the firm plans to expand in the distressed debt area and
will launch a new long-short hedge fund that will be launched
in the next months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Changes have already been promised at the Alpha fund with
the firm telling investors in September the fund would
constrain its borrowing in the future and consider the level of
borrowing as a separate risk factor.

&lt;p&gt;ACCRA (Reuters) - Two British teenagers may face up to three years in jail after a Ghanaian court on Wednesday found them guilty of smuggling 6 kg (13 lbs) of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The juvenile court postponed sentencing for Yasemin Vatansever and Yatunde Diya, both aged 16, until December 5, pending a social services report, British High Commission spokesman Gary Nicholls told reporters in the capital Accra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vatansever and Diya were arrested on July 2 at Accra's Kotoka airport when Ghanaian anti-drugs officers said they found cocaine worth 300,000 pounds ($600,000) in two laptop bags the girls were carrying as they boarded a flight to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girls "looked devastated" at the ruling, one of their aunts present at the court said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyers will appeal the verdict, for which they could be sentenced to a maximum of three years in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yasemin and Yatunde are two extremely vulnerable young girls whose naivety was ruthlessly exploited by the men who lured them to Ghana and left them to a terrible fate," said a statement from the parents of the two, read by a representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to misleading reports, based on inaccurate leaks from the prosecuting authority, neither of the girls had any knowledge of drug-smuggling activities," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are deeply disappointed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teenagers, who pleaded not guilty, had told British TV they were tricked into carrying the bags by male acquaintances in Ghana and Britain and did not know their content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police investigators said a Ghanaian man had promised the two 3,000 pounds ($6,000) each and a paid holiday if they delivered the cocaine to London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girls were met in Ghana by two other men who checked them into a hotel and gave a party for them before seeing them off, investigators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While drug smuggling is clearly a problem which the Ghanaian authorities wish to prevent, our daughters are not the criminal masterminds which the prosecuting authorities have attempted to portray," the parents said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teenagers were arrested under Operation Westbridge, a project set up by Britain and Ghana to tackle drug smugglers using Accra airport as a gateway to Britain and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Africa has become an important staging post for Colombian cocaine on its way to lucrative European markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, two Lithuanian youths living in London, aged 16 and 19, were arrested for trying to smuggle 3.5 kg (7.7 pounds) of cocaine from Accra airport to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kwasi Kpodo; Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Elisabeth O'Leary)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese shares listed on the mainland 
and in Hong Kong may reach their peak in mid-2008, while 
full-year returns on 300 key mainland large-capitalized stocks 
are forecast at a negative 11.3 percent for 2008, mainly due to 
high valuations, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Stocks of mainland Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, 
or H shares, are expected, however, to generate a positive 
return of 8.8 percent next year, the investment bank said in a 
research report presented at a media briefing on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe euphoric sentiment and liquidity could 
potentially propel Chinese stocks to unsustainably high levels 
in the first half of 2008 before they subsequently retrace on 
growth, margin, inflation and valuations concerns," it said, 
citing next summer's planned Olympic Games in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report was written by a team headed by Thomas Deng, its 
chief strategist for China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC has 
jumped 350 percent since the start of 2006, buoyed by strong 
economic growth and corporate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a 14 percent correction since mid-October, the 
average A-share price-earnings ratio remains above 60 times 
2006 earnings, compared with Hong Kong's 22 times, sparking 
repeated warnings from global investment bankers of a possible 
bubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley, in a research report published on Tuesday, 
said: "The A-share market hosts not only the biggest valuation 
bubble amongst the world equities, but also one of the largest 
earnings bubbles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It warned that the A-share market was now struggling to 
stay at its current high valuations and any further negative 
news could accelerate a correction to levels that might 
resemble what happened in Japan in the late 1980s.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MARKET BUBBLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Jonathan Anderson, chief Asia economist at UBS, said 
any major A-share correction should not have much impact on 
China's economy mainly because of the country's small free 
float, which gives it one of the smallest equity exposures as a 
share of gross domestic product in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And even the total market capitalization data put China a 
long way behind other historical market bubbles," Anderson 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An analysis of the relationship between stocks and bank 
deposits in Japan and Taiwan indicated that in each case total 
equity market capitalization reached 140 percent of broad money 
M2 at the height of the bubble, he said in a research report 
last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In China today the ratio is just passing 75 percent," he 
said. "On this measure, China is only half way up, more in line 
with Japan and Taiwan in the late 1990s than in the late 
1980s."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman Sachs report forecast that China's CSI300 Index 
.CSI300, which tracks 300 A shares on the Shanghai and 
Shenzhen stock exchanges and is used by most A-share funds as a 
benchmark, was forecast at 4,700 points by the end of 2008. The 
index closed at 4,997.62 on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong's China Enterprises Index .HSCE of H shares, 
which closed at 15,993.50 on Wednesday, was forecast to reach 
19,600 points by the end of next year, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Using a combination of valuation models and explicit 
cross-country comparisons, we conclude that current valuations 
are at most fair for H shares and unjustifiable for A shares," 
the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the current forward P/E, which is at around 32 
times, is neither justifiable in theory nor by fundamentals. We 
expect it to gradually normalize to our expected long-term 
maximum fundamental forward of 27 times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's real GDP growth was forecast to slow to 10.3 
percent in 2008 from 11.6 percent in 2007, translating into 
slower forecast corporate earnings growth in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Edmund Klamann)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 21 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities downgraded
electronics retailer Circuit City Stores Inc CC.N to
"neutral" from "overweight," saying the company's turnaround
likely requires involvement of a strategic partner or acquirer
of some sort, and shares fell more than 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We fear that such a scenario may wait itself out until
after the second half (2H08) and this year's holiday season,
when trends will likely be worse than expected," analyst
Stephen Chick said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Circuit City has cut jobs and overhauled store procedures
in an effort to turn its business around, but faces a major
competitive onslaught from Best Buy (BBY.N) and mass retailers
such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N), which has boosted its
electronics offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, Circuit City introduced a plan to replace 3,400
store workers with lower-paid staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also reported earlier this month that David Mathews, its
merchandising and marketing executive vice president was
leaving, the news coming less than three weeks before the
"Black Friday" kickoff to the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Chick said there was growing concern about many of
the company's issues, leftover from earlier management
decisions, particularly with respect to real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Richmond, Virginia-based company touched a
new year low of $5.60 before closing at $5.77 on Tuesday. They
were trading further down at $5.40 in early electronic trade
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA Nov 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. energy firm Chevron
(CVX.N) has proposed building a gas fired power plant with 450
megawatts (MW) capacity to meet Bangladesh's yawning power
shortage, a senior official of the firm said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The power plant would be adjacent to the Bibiyana natural
gas field in northeast Bangladesh from where Chevron produces
350 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcfd).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is the developer and operator of Bibiyana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bangladesh faces a power deficit of up to 2,000 MW against
demand of 5,000 MW daily, energy officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But its decades-old 60 power plants have either reached
their optimum generation level or are unable to produce as much
because of technical problems, the ministry officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are capable to develop and run independent power plants
to help meet Bangladesh's fast growing energy needs by the end
of 2012," Steve Wilson, chief executive of Chevron in
Bangladesh, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A large portion of the proposed power project which might
require $675 million investment, would be supported by the World
Bank, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state run Power Grid Company has already sought about
$75 million fund from the power and energy ministry to build and
develop required infrastructure facilities for transmitting the
electricity from the Bibiyana plant, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials said that the demand for electricity would almost
double to nearly 8,000 MW in 2012 when Bangladesh should aim to
generate about 10,000 MW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Finance Corporation (IFC), an arm of the World
Bank, has been advising Bangladesh to make the Bibiyana power
plant as a priority project among large-scale power schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frequent power failures cut the country's gross domestic
product by around $1.0 billion annually, the World Bank said.
Earlier it had said that Bangladesh would require $10 billion in
investment in the next 10 years to overcome the shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has invested $820 million in Bangladesh, making it
the biggest investor in its energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=68.60 taka)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Serajul Islam Quadir)

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL Nov 21 (Reuters) - South Korean firms are in talks to
buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from projects run by Woodside
Petroleum (WPL.AX) and Chevron Corp, the latest effort by Asian
buyers to snap up long-term supplies of the super-cooled gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seoul's energy ministry said on Wednesday state-run Korea Gas
Corp (KOGAS) (036460.KS) and the country's No.2 refiner, GS
Caltex, are seeking LNG supplies from Woodside's Browse and
Chevron's Gorgon projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the first such confirmation by the South Korean
government, but it did not disclose details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KOGAS is in talks for both the Browse and Gorgon projects,
but GS Caltex, a 50:50 joint venture between GS Holdings and
Chevron (CVX.N), is only in for the Gorgon project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Woodside, Australia's largest oil and gas
producer, signed a deal with Taiwan's CPC Corp [CHIP.UL] for 2-3
million tonnes of LNG a year from the Browse project off Western
Australia, for a period of between 15-20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CPC deal comes just two months after an agreement to sell
2-3 million tonnes of LNG a year to China's PetroChina Ltd
(0857.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Browse, the larger of Woodside's two planned LNG projects,
comprises three major gas discoveries and contains gas resources
estimated at 20 trillion cubic feet (570 billion cubic metres).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's Gorgon project is estimated to hold certified gas
reserves of over 40 trillion cubic feet. Chevron is the operator
of the project and holds a 50 percent stake. Exxon Mobil (XOM.N)
and Shell (RDSa.L) each have 25 percent.

Australia, as domestic demand for natural gas is expected to
continue to grow, the ministry said.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Grammy Award-winning U.S. hard rock band 
Velvet Revolver said it would not perform in Japan this month 
as scheduled because the authorities had refused them visas due 
to previous run-ins with the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Japanese immigration officials appear to have taken 
exception to the backgrounds of various band members "which 
have included arrests," the band said in a statement on its Web 
site (www.velvetrevolver.com).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We want to apologize to our fans in Japan that we won't be 
able to perform our scheduled concerts," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't understand why the authorities won't give us 
visas when they granted them for us in 2005. We love Japan and 
look forward to our return there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the immigration department at the Justice 
Ministry said he could not comment on individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But under Japanese law, anyone with a drug conviction can 
be refused entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Velvet Revolver features three members of rowdy rock 
legends Guns N' Roses and the Stone Temple Pilots' volatile 
former frontman Scott Weiland, who has been arrested several 
times on drug-related charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band had been due to perform four concerts between 
November 26 and November 30 in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and 
Yokohama to promote its current album "Libertad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band said it was appealing against the immigration 
authorities' decision, but the process would take months. 
Velvet Revolver will start their Australian tour as scheduled 
on December 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Miral Fahmy and Isabel Reynolds; editing by

Wednesday, including its waiver of management fees, as well as 
a previously announced deferral of royalties for fiscal 2008

banners and nine films under the Miramax banner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It listed $22.8 billion in total contractual commitments 
for broadcast rights for sports, feature films and other 
programming as of the September 29 end of its fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That total includes $1.1 billion for available programming

measures tied to a term loan and revolving credit facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new agreement shortened the $284 million term loan

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 23 (Reuters) - Oil majors Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) have agreed to sell their
German natural gas network joint venture BEB to Dutch state
pipeline operator Gasunie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell said the deal was part of the company's portfolio
management strategy, which has seen it shed many downstream
assets in refining, distribution and retail sales, to focus
investment in its core oil upstream oil and gas exploration and
production businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This agreement is in line with Shell's portfolio management
strategy to maximise shareholder value," Charles Watson,
Executive Vice President Shell Energy Europe, Shell Gas  Power,
said in a statement on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale of the 3,100 km high pressure network, for which no
financial details were disclosed, is subject to regulatory
approval and is expected to be completed in 2008, Shell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry executives said the sale, which has been in train
for some months, would raise billions of euros for Exxon and
Shell, the first and second-largest non-government controlled
oil companies in the world by market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2004 Shell and Exxon agreed the sale of their 50 percent
stake in the Dutch gas transportation network to the Dutch
government for 2.78 billion euros ($3.78 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEB's exploration and production and storage activities are
unaffected by the network sale, Shell said, and Exxon's German
unit will continue to operate the exploration and production
activities for BEB on the basis of service agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Tom Bergin)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday
dismissed a case against Pfizer Inc in which the state of
Louisiana sought to recover Medicaid payments for the withdrawn
diabetes drug Rezulin as well as the costs of treating
illnesses caused by the drug, according to court papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Rezulin was pulled from the market in 2000 due to liver
toxicity problems and the drug has since been the subject of
numerous lawsuits. Pfizer (PFE.N) inherited the Rezulin
litigation when it acquired Warner-Lambert Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge Lewis Kaplan of U.S. District Court in New York
granted Pfizer's motion for summary judgment dismissing the
case brought by Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti on
behalf of the state and its citizens, the court papers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not immediately clear how much Louisiana had been
seeking in damages from the world's largest drugmaker.
Louisiana was aiming to recover the amount paid to fill Rezulin
prescriptions for state Medicaid recipients and to treat
illnesses allegedly caused by Rezulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In handing down his decision, Kaplan said the plaintiffs
failed to file papers needed to avoid a summary judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Indeed, the failure to file such an affidavit is fatal to
a claim," Kaplan wrote in his decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs had argued that more discovery information
was necessary from Pfizer and therefore a summary judgment in
the case should not be entered before the information was
provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However the judge said in his ruling that "a party
resisting summary judgment on the ground that it needs
discovery in order to defeat the motion must submit an
affidavit" showing what facts are sought to resist the motion
and what effort was made to obtain them.

&lt;p&gt;  CHICAGO, IL, Nov 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 At the Radiological Society of North America's annual conference, Carestream
Health, Inc. today announced an agreement to integrate and sell a key
component of the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Unified Communications and Collaboration
(UC2(TM)) platform -- IBM Lotus(R) Sametime(R). The combination of Lotus
Sametime
software and Carestream Health's radiology solutions will facilitate rapid
communication, including instant messaging and Voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP)
interactionsbetween radiologists and other medical professionals involved in the
diagnosis and treatment of patients.

    The quality of patient care can be adversely affected by delayed
communication or
the inability to immediately collaborate with the right experts at the right
time. Incorporating communications and collaboration capabilities into routine
work
processes for medical professionals can improve the speed and efficiency of
diagnosis, resulting in faster results and treatment plans for patients. With
Carestream Health's systems and IBM software, medical professionals will be
able to find experts quickly based on location and topic, and collaborate
instantly through instant messaging or a VoIP conversation.

    Additionally, users can share computer screens in real time, highlighting
key parts of
an image to collaborate on a diagnosis. For example, if a radiologist
determines that urgent care is required, they can immediately contact the
referring
physician to communicate critical results. By clicking on the referring
physician's name -- which appears within the application -- they can begin an
instant messaging dialog or initiate a VoIP call. If additional opinions
are needed, colleagues can quickly be added to a VoIP conference call.

    "IBM's communications tools will enable real-time discussion between medical
professionals both inside and outside of the radiology department, which can
lead to
quicker diagnosis and communication of critical results for an overall
improvement in patient care," said Michael W. Jackman, President, Healthcare
Information Solutions, Carestream Health. "We continue to provide advanced
digital technologies that help the physician community collaborate and work
together more effectively. This agreement with IBM is another example of the
speed
with which we are making valuable solutions available to healthcare providers
around the world."

    This software helps promote collaborative patient care that transcends
organizational and geographic boundaries by incorporating the physician referral
community into the overall radiology workflow. The integration with Lotus
Sametime
software will involve Carestream Health's portfolio of radiology solutions
including:


--  CARESTREAM RIS (radiology information system), a fully featured
    workflow, scheduling and information solution for radiology departments;
--  CARESTREAM PACS (picture archiving and communications system), a
    powerful electronic system used for management, viewing, sharing and
    storage of all radiology imaging studies; and
--  The KODAK CARESTREAM Digital Dashboard that provides system
    administrators with a convenient way to proactively monitor equipment
    performance, storage utilization and user volumes.
    

    
"When organizations integrate unified communications and collaboration
capabilities
into their business processes, employees can significantly reduce the time and
complexity required to resolve issues and make decisions," said Bruce Morse,
Vice President of Unified Communications and Collaboration, IBM Lotus
software. "This integration with Carestream Health's digital imaging systems is
an
excellent example of how easy it is to incorporate the powerful capabilities
of Lotus Sametime and help workers collaborate instantly regardless of location
or what they are working on."

    Representatives from Carestream Health will begin selling, installing and
supporting this new tool worldwide -- available on new and previously purchased
systems from Carestream Health -- in the second quarter of 2008.

    CARESTREAM Radiology Solutions address the diverse operational needs of
clinics, imaging centers, hospitals and healthcare networks, including
orthopaedic,
mammography and oncology facilities. Carestream Health is an independent
company that employs more than 8,000 people and its products are present in 90%
of
hospitals worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co Inc (JPM.N) plans to cut about 100 subprime mortgage jobs in California amid falling U.S. housing prices and tighter lending standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disclosed the cuts in a recent filing with the California Employment Development Department. The cuts, effective December 15, will take place at JPMorgan's subprime retail operations center in Ontario, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it has reduced subprime originations and operations staff because of home price weakness and tighter credit standards. About 40 percent of JPMorgan's 2006 subprime originations would not be approved under today's standards, the bank said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has discontinued, for example, all subprime home equity loans. JPMorgan has said that it expects to originate about $1 billion subprime loans per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tim McLaughlin, editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production of "Enchanted" Benefits from Its Ability to Scan
          Difficult Objects Quickly in a Variety of Locations
REDONDO BEACH, Calif.--(Business Wire)--Realscan 3D (www.realscan3d.com), the industry leader in
high-resolution, high-color structured light 3D scanning, recently
overcame a number of challenges to deliver photo-real digital doubles
used in Walt Disney Pictures' new film Enchanted, now in theatres. For
the film, Realscan was charged with creating digital doubles of lead
characters Giselle (Amy Adams), Robert (Patrick Dempsey), and Queen
Narissa (Susan Sarandon). Realscan's proprietary hardware and ability
to quickly scan objects in diverse locations allowed them to deliver
the doubles on time and on budget to Tippett Studios.

   For starters, Realscan needed to acquire the wedding dress worn by
lead character Giselle. The dress featured intricate lacing, and an
irregular shape too odd for a traditional VFX 3D scanning system. The
dress measured six to eight feet across in certain areas, making the
prospect of getting a workable scan very difficult. In addition to the
wedding dress, the costume for the character Queen Narissa featured
highly reflective, translucent scales that made not only scanning but
photography a difficult proposition. In each case, however, Realscan's
RealCapture NexGen(TM) 3D scanning technology acquired the objects in
great detail without any difficulty.

   Disney also benefited from Realscan's ability to quickly adapt to
productions' rapidly changing schedules and scan in a wide variety of
locations. A portable solution, RealCapture NexGen(TM) scanned the
film's talent and costumes in ad hoc locations across New York City,
often between takes. This saved Enchanted both time and money, as it
eliminated the need to schedule additional locations and wardrobe, and
to accommodate the heavy equipment associated with traditional
scanning systems.

   The results of Realscan 3D's work can be seen in theatres and at
their website, www.realscan3d.com.

   Realscan 3D (www.realscan3d.com) is a Los Angeles-based effects
company specializing in solutions for the creation of low-cost,
high-quality digital assets for any application. Rapidly becoming one
of the most attractive technology companies working in the
entertainment industry, Realscan 3D has created digital doubles for a
wide variety of clients, including Jerry Bruckheimer Films' National
Treasure II: Book of Secrets and Deja Vu, Walt Disney Pictures'
Underdog and South of the Border, Universal Television's House, FOX
Television's American Idol, Nike, Nintendo, Gatorade, and Wal-Mart.

&lt;p&gt;  BANGALORE, INDIA, Nov 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the implementation of first-of-its-kind
unified communications and collaboration solution for IDEA Cellular, a
leading cellular operator and an Aditya Birla Group Company. This is in
addition to the 10-year strategic outsourcing contract announced by IDEA and IBM
earlier this year.

    The fully IP-based solution offers rich media conferencing and integrated
messaging
for productive and effective communication within IDEA Cellular. The
implementation
of Cisco Unified MeetingPlace by IBM Global Technology Services will help enable
IDEA Cellular improve the way employees communicate and collaborate across the
enterprise, resulting in significant productivity boost and enhancing business
growth. Supporting open standards, the solution is customized to effectively
address IDEA's growth plans and ensure smooth roll-out across the company's
twenty-four offices within India.

    Speaking on this implementation, Sanjeev Aga, Managing Director, IDEA
Cellular
Ltd, said, "India is one of the fastest-growing economies. Today, a mobile
connection is not a luxury but a necessity to achieve progress. A
significantly large number of people are using mobiles and the number is
only increasing. To address an ever-increasing customer base it is important
for cellular operators to provide the latest infrastructure and technology to
support their customers. Hence, they also need to equip themselves with the
latest systems to communicate internally and collaborate better. It is our
endeavor to step up efforts towards ensuring real-time collaboration with the
help
of Cisco and IBM."

    The system deployed by IBM offers users IP telephony with touch screen
phones
integrated with rich media (Voice, Video and Web) conferencing facilities,
enabling
IDEA Cellular to set up and conduct remote meetings with a face-to-face quality
and to speed decision-making. Cisco Unified MeetingPlace supports multiple types
of devices to accommodate distributed operations along with integrating
collaboration
tools with the corporate user management system, directory, e-mail and
calendaring.
The solution also supports a range of applications and user roles that were
implementedby IBM to promote highly collaborative meetings, training sessions,
and
presentations.

    IBM offers design and deployment services that draw from its extensive
converged
communications experience, industry-leading tools and key strategic
alliances. According to Nipun Mehrotra, Director, Global Technology Services,
IBM India/South Asia, "In India's intensely competitive telecommunication
industry,
the pace of business growth is faster than ever. IDEA's solution is a
reflection of our commitment to helping our clients generate competitive
advantage in the rapidly expanding market."

    With the ever-increasing popularity of conducting business online, a
significant portion of the customer experience is now dictated by call center
processes and agents. Organizations are increasingly leveraging the situation
to their advantage, differentiating themselves through robust contact centers
that helps enable increased efficiency, lower costs, enhanced productivity and
higher revenue. IP telephony using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and
other real-time collaboration technologies can quicken the pulse of an
organization -- and helps potentially enable heightened productivity, faster
response to customers, greater agility in capturing business opportunities
and a more innovative, competitive approach.

    "Globalization demands open, application-rich unified communications systems
that take
full advantage of a highly secure, services-rich, intelligent network
foundation," said
Naresh Wadhwa, Country Manager for Cisco India &amp; SAARC. "The rich
collaboration capabilities that IDEA is enabling through Cisco UC helps
enable them to be more collaborative with their employees and customers, thus
driving business growth."

    About IDEA Cellular:

    "IDEA is part of the Aditya Birla Group, a US $24 billion corporation with a
market capitalization of US $31.5 billion, and in the league of the Fortune
500.  It is anchored by an extraordinary force of over 100,000 employees
belonging to 25 different nationalities.  Over 50% of its revenues flow from
its operations overseas. The Group has been adjudged 'The Best Employer in India
and among the top 20 in Asia' by the Hewitt-Economic Times and Wall Street
Journal Study 2007."

        "US businesses across all industries have begun to focus on
         the rapidly growing Hispanic/Latino market through targeted
         advertising spending and customized products. We believe this
         trend will continue. Firms taking the lead in these
         initiatives and in areas likely to benefit from the
         population growth of Hispanic/Latinos in the United States
         are likely to see their revenues grow faster than those of
         their competitors over the long term."

   Ceril Shagrin, Senior Vice President, Univision presented a new
study about Latinos and media usage revealing compelling
characteristics of advertising on Spanish TV. Among a number of
interesting findings, the study shows that Latinos are more likely
than non-Latinos to view commercials and make purchase decisions based
on advertisements seen on television. In addition, Hispanic DVR users
are less likely to skip commercials and are more likely to stop and
watch commercials of interest than non Hispanic DVR users.

   Industry leaders from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida,
Farmers Insurance, General Mills, and Toyota Financial Services
presented case studies showcasing their success and growing market
share within the multicultural markets.

   Fernando Chavez, son of late activist Cesar Chavez, shared unique
insights on Latino growth within the United States of today during his
presentation to summit participants.

   Cesar Melgoza, Co-Founder of Latin Force Group, released the 2008
version of the American Marketscape DataStream, the most comprehensive
and up to date source of consumer geo-demographic data. The report
forecasts current year estimates for 2008 and five year future
projections for 2013 of the US multicultural landscape. The data is
presented from the micro to the macro level built from the ground-up
and is an in-depth representation of U.S. cultural diversity.

   While participates engaged in case studies and workshops
throughout the day, at night they were able to enjoy live
entertainment from such artists as Def Jam recording artist Chrisette
Michele, Locos por Juana, and El Chino.

&lt;p&gt;Visage Imaging and Agfa Healthcare Sign Worldwide Agreement to Integrate Visage Offerings to the IMPAX(TM) Suites

    Agfa Healthcare to expand PACS portfolio through Visage CS Thin
  Client/Server for supplying enterprise-wide advanced visualization
                   solutions to customers worldwide
CARLSBAD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--Visage Imaging, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercury Computer
Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRCY), announced a worldwide integration
agreement with Agfa HealthCare, a leading provider of IT-enabled

image data volumes can reside entirely on the central server, and
interactive 3D and 4D viewing and post-processing can be performed
from any client computer using an innovative thin-client streaming
technology. Because of the tight integration of IMPAX and Visage CS,
large 3D and 4D images become instantly accessible at the click of a
mouse within the PACS workflow, throughout the entire healthcare
enterprise.

   "Our collaboration with Visage Imaging enables us to achieve
increased performance levels for loading and viewing large studies
such as multi-slice CT throughout the hospital enterprise, fully
integrated into the workflow of our radiology and image management
solutions," said Erkan Akyuz, General Manager RIS/PACS at Agfa
HealthCare. "Our customers can deploy this new enterprise
visualization option easily and with minimal administrative effort,
taking advantage of the existing RIS/PACS infrastructure."

   Visage CS integrated into IMPAX provides breathtaking performance
for data access as well as for different visualization techniques such
as multi-planar reformatting (MPR), maximum intensity projection
(MIP), and volume rendering. Furthermore, a rich set of integrated
tools enable efficient viewing, post-processing, and quantitative
analysis for applications such as CT and MR angiography and cardiac
CT.

   "We are very pleased to announce our relationship with Agfa, a
world leader in Healthcare IT and PACS," said Marcelo Lima, President
at Visage Imaging. "Our 3D thin-client solution will enhance the
enterprise visualization capabilities of Agfa's product portfolio. We
look forward to a very productive, long-term relationship."

&lt;p&gt;S Cycle and ExxonMobil Team Up to Develop Performance Cruiser Motorcycle for Jay Leno

      Entertainer Receives the First Cycle Made with "Performance
                       Cruiser Kit" and Mobil 1
FAIRFAX, Va.--(Business Wire)--As the owner of literally hundreds of unique vehicles, Jay Leno is
not easily impressed by many of the new models on the market. But when
he climbed onto the brand-new motorcycle presented to him by S Cycle
and ExxonMobil, Leno was clearly thrilled.

   "Having ridden a variety of bikes, I can tell you that this
motorcycle is really impressive. It represents the next generation of
engineering and also meets 2008 California Tier II emission standards,
so you can feel good about riding it," Leno said. "S and ExxonMobil
represent some of the most leading edge engineering and technology in
their respective fields; it's about American ingenuity."

   This motorcycle is the first to include the third-generation
"performance cruiser" chassis/powertrain kit. The powertrain kit
features the much anticipated X-Wedge(TM) engine and ExxonMobil's
flagship Mobil 1 motorcycle oil. A fitting pair, considering that each
new S engine is not only end-of-line tested with Mobil 1, but also
the initial fill for each completed engine.

   The motorcycle also features high end components and controls. The
special edition paint job, created by Dougz Custom Paint, features
Mobil 1 and highlights the S 50th Anniversary, which will be
celebrated at an event in La Crosse, Wisconsin, in June 2008. Leno's
bike will also be displayed at the 2008 Sturgis Rally and a select
number of events throughout the year.

   The X-Wedge(TM) engine is not only powerful and looks great, but
also meets new 2008 CARB and 2010 EPA emissions standards, providing
significant reduction in noise and gaseous emissions. This next
generation v-twin is a departure from S' traditional engine design
and a step toward the future of air-cooled, pushrod operated v-twins.

   "For me this is the only air cooled motor that feels as tight and
quiet as one that is liquid cooled, and that's saying a lot. It's got
everything a guy could ask for, especially in an era when motorcycle
manufacturers are getting away from air cooled engines. This bike has
performance, power and a comfortable ride, which is especially
important at my age," said Leno.

   S President Brett Smith described the project as a labor of
love. "Working with ExxonMobil and Jay Leno on this project has been a
lot of fun," he said. "Having spent some time with Jay, it has become
clear to me that what he does for a living is exceeded in passion and
enthusiasm only by his desire for high-performance engines."

   "We are very proud to be associated with this project," said
Margaret Parnell, vice president of Planning &amp; Technology, ExxonMobil
Lubricants &amp; Specialties. "Mobil 1 is known for delivering outstanding
performance. This state of the art S designed and developed
motorcycle is definitely a high-performance machine that's on par with
Mobil 1's fully synthetic formulations designed to withstand the
extreme heat produced by high-revving motorcycle engines and handle
some of the toughest riding conditions. We are thrilled that Jay Leno
has embraced this project, and we're looking forward to taking it on
the road."

   Representatives from both companies presented Leno with the cycle
during a ceremony at the entertainer's famed southern California
garage on November 7. The motorcycle itself weighs less than 550
pounds, has a wheelbase around 60 inches, rake of 28 degrees, and
trail of 5.2 inches. The chassis is TIG welded, 1020 DOM steel tubular
frame with a modular rear subframe. The build also includes 17"
Michelin Pilot tires, Brembo radial binders, and Ohlins front and rear
suspension.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--JPMorgan Chase announced today that it has appointed Barry Zubrow as its Chief

Officer.

"The Chief Risk Officer function is a critical role for our company, and I'm
thrilled that we've attracted someone of Barry's caliber and experience to this
position," said Dimon. He added, "In addition to his distinguished work in
public service, Barry has excelled in critical senior functions at Goldman
Sachs, acting as Chief Credit Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, and
co-Chairman of the Risk Committee."

Zubrow added, "JPMorgan Chase is a first-class organization and a true leader in
global financial services. I'm very excited about working with Jamie and other
senior leaders to build on the firm's successes and to help make the company
even stronger."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, share price, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI Nov 26 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the No. 2
U.S. oil firm, said on Monday it was evaluating its options for
its stake in India's Reliance Petroleum RPET.BO, in which
majority owner Reliance Industries (RELI.BO) sold 4 percent
last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron owns 5 percent in Reliance Petroleum and has an
option to raise its holding to 29 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say the U.S. major may review its plans for the
option after Reliance Industries sold 4 percent for $1.0
billion last week, lowering its stake to 71 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron continues to evaluate our options with our
ownership in Reliance Petroleum. We will provide specific
project updates when definitive decisions are made," a Chevron
spokeswoman for its Asian operations said in an e-mailed
response to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reliance Petroleum is building a 580,000 barrels per day
(bpd) refinery in the western state of Gujarat, adjacent to its
parent Reliance Industries' existing 660,000 bpd refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Reliance Petroleum, valued at about $24 billion,
are now trading at more than 200 rupees, or about 3.5 times
their initial public offer in April 2006 at 60 rupees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron had bought its 5 percent holding at the IPO price
for $300 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that Reliance Petroleum's rich valuation and
the fact that Reliance sold a 4 percent stake to the market,
may imply a possible future Chevron exit unless there is
meaningful pullback in the market," Goldman Sachs said in a
note on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Reliance Petroleum ended down fell 2.6 percent at
204.05 rupees in a Mumbai market .BSESN that rose 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock had hit a lifehigh of 295 rupees on Nov. 1, on
speculation Chevron may increase its stake in the company, but
the rise in prices was a deterrent for the U.S. firm to raise
its stake, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We note that increasing its stake to 29 percent... would
mean a significant investment of more than $5.5 billion for
Chevron," Goldman Sachs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Chevron exercises its option to raise its holding at
current prices, it would effectively almost fully finance the
$6 billion refinery, brokerage Kotak Securities said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch said the 4 percent stake sold by Reliance
Industries last week could mean it may reduce its holding in
the subsidiary to below 51 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The other question is whether Reliance Industries is
planning a project or acquisition, for which it plans to use
the $1 billion raised," Merrill said in a client note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron and Reliance Industries are also yet to finalise an
initial agreement signed in April 2006 for crude supplies at
the new refinery and marketing its products.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters Life!) - The dancing penguins of "Happy Feet" have beaten Harry Potter to win the best film award at this year's children's Baftas, the junior version of the annual film and television awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer-animated movie, featuring the voices of Nicole Kidman, Elijah Wood and Robin Williams, pipped the latest boy wizard adventure, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The penguins were also up against the sewer rat comedy "Flushed Away" and the fantasy adventure "Bridge to Terabithia".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Happy Feet", a box office hit made by Warner Bros. Pictures and Australia's Village Roadshow, won the best animated feature Oscar in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potter also lost out in the video game category. That prize went to "Buzz! Junior: Jungle Party", where players compete to build a banana empire and be crowned king of the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other winners included the BBC children's channel CBeebies (TV channel of the year); cartoon character "SpongeBob SquarePants" (international) and "In the Night Garden", the Ragdoll production featuring Igglepiggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winners were announced at a London ceremony on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full list is at: www.bafta.org/awards/childrens/previous-nominations-and-winners,53,BA.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Peter Griffiths, editing by Paul Casciato)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mouse Makes House Calls: Vacationers That Purchase a Walt Disney World Vacation to Receive a Call From Mickey Mouse on Christmas Day

ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--Walt Disney Parks and Resorts today announced that families in the
U.S. and Canada that book between now and Dec. 23 will get a telephone
call from Mickey Mouse personally announcing the good news on
Christmas Day.

   Parents can plan their trips start-to-finish online and choose to
have Mickey Mouse call their house and give a magical surprise to
their kids on Dec. 25. They can also select the greeting that Mickey
gives their families -- either "Merry Christmas" or "Happy Holidays."
Starting on Cyber Monday, Disney launches the special "Mickey Call"
holiday promotion website directing families to book their Disney
vacation packages online, by calling Walt Disney World Resort at
407/939-7734 or through a travel agent.

   "Many families purchase Walt Disney World vacations as Christmas
gifts for their kids," said Walt Disney World President Meg Crofton.
"The call from Mickey is a creative, personalized way to bring magic
into homes on Christmas morning and to get kids excited about their
incredible gift."

   The "Mickey Call" holiday promotion is back by popular demand
after its success last holiday season, when Mickey Mouse called
thousands of homes on Christmas Day, making the holiday extra special
for those families. This year the holiday gift promotion is expected
to be even more popular, largely appealing to the savvy group of
"online moms" who want gift-giving without the hassle and in just a
few clicks.

   "Research shows that the majority of moms (62%)(a) will do at
least some of their holiday shopping online this year," Crofton said.
"This is a chance to connect with parents online and help them add
some special magic to the holidays. This holiday, parents get Disney
vacation packages at an affordable price, and kids get a Christmas
surprise from Mickey."

   This Disney holiday offer will be available to families who book a
non-discounted 2008 Walt Disney World vacation online at
Disneyworld.com/holidaycall or by calling Walt Disney World Resort at
407/939-7734 or through a travel agent.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney Feature Animation's "Bolt" -- previously titled "American Dog" -- will be released in digital 3-D when it opens November 26, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We absolutely believe in the whole concept of 3-D and the enhancement that it brings in the ability to separate us from any of the other mediums," Disney president of domestic distribution Chuck Viane said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Travolta and Susie Essman lead the voice cast of "Bolt," the story of a TV-star dog named Bolt (Travolta) who is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York, where he begins a cross-country journey through the real world. Chris Williams directs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bolt" is the latest digital 3-D announcement from Disney, which has been a pioneer of the format. The company's digital 3-D releases have included "Chicken Little," "Meet the Robinsons" and "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burton recently signed a two-picture deal with Disney through which he will direct and produce 3-D features based on Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" and Burton's short "Frankenweenie." Disney next releases in 3-D the "Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour," which will play in theaters February 1-7. The "Hannah Montana" release should be available on about 700 screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By the time we get to 'Bolt,' I think you may be looking at somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 potential 3-D screens (domestically)," Viane said.

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords to Discuss High-Tech Visa Reform Legislation at Optical Engineering Firm Breault Research

TUCSON, Ariz.--(Business Wire)--U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords will visit Tucson-based optical
software and engineering firm Breault Research Organization, Inc. on
Wednesday to meet with leaders of Southern Arizona's growing
high-technology industry and discuss possible visa reforms enabling
competition in the 21st Century global marketplace.

   The meeting will take place at Breault Research Organization, a
30-year-old firm that has been recognized by Gov. Janet Napolitano for
excellence in technology development. Breault Research has 50
employees and sells its products in 35 countries.

   H-1B visas are critically important to firms such as Breault
Research to remain innovative and globally competitive. Nationally,
more that 60 percent of H-1B visas are held by workers in computers,
science, engineering, and medical positions. More than 40 percent of
H-1B visa workers possess graduate or doctorate degrees.

   This year, the United States capped new H-1B visas at
approximately 65,000, not nearly enough to meet industry demands. The
cap was hit on the first day applications were accepted, meaning that
much-needed, well-educated high-tech workers were not available to
U.S. companies.

   Giffords, a member of the House Science and Technology Committee,
will outline several H-1B visa reform ideas and solicit comments and
suggestions from the executives. The Tucson lawmaker is planning to
introduce legislation in December that accurately reflects industry
needs.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO--(Business Wire)--Turbolinux, a leading Linux client and server distributor in Japan

Vendor Alliance," said Sam Rosenbalm, Interop Vendor Alliance manager,
Microsoft Corporation. "We are very excited about collaborating with
Turbolinux to build a bridge between open source and commercial
technologies that benefits the entire IT ecosystem."

   Microsoft Corporation and Turbolinux signed a business agreement
in October that addresses customer issues, furthered Linux-Windows
interoperability and R collaboration, and provided IP assurances to
Turbolinux users. Taking part in the IVA, Turbolinux will provide
solutions which greatly enhance Linux-Window Server interoperability
by developing some modules that enable Turbolinux products to work
more seamlessly with Active Directry and the Windows networking
environment.

   "Joining the IVA is an important component of our partnership with
Microsoft and will allow us to start solution development and
testing," said Yano Koichi, CEO of Turbolinux. "Working
collaboratively with Microsoft, we are eager to deliver the solutions
as soon as we can to the market."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on
Tuesday said a new technology developed by its chemicals
business will be key in helping the automotive industry switch
to lighter, more efficient batteries for hybrid and electric
vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The technology is a film that will allow battery companies
to make larger lithium ion batteries that will not overheat,
Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lithium ion batteries, often used in consumer electronics
like cell phones and laptop computers, hold a charge longer
than the nickel metal hydride batteries now used widely in
automobiles. They are also lighter than their predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the batteries' tendency to overheat -- and even catch
fire -- has been a hold-up in shifting to the more efficient
power source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil Chemical and its Japanese affiliate Tonen
Chemical said they have developed new separator film
technologies that can stand up at higher heat levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separator films are thin membranes that keep the battery's
positive and negative electrodes apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This new technology for making films, will make the next
generation of hybrid and electric vehicles possible," said Jim
Harris, a senior vice president at ExxonMobil Chemical Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The battery separator film makes a bigger lithium ion
battery possible ... it will continue to be hot, but it will
not fail," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This technology could help automakers address one of the
biggest challenges in producing a plug-in car, as they try to
lower the cost of the batteries and boost their power and
storage capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike earlier gasoline-electric hybrids, which run on a
system that twins battery power and a combustion engine,
plug-ins are designed for short trips powered entirely by an
electric motor and a battery charged through a socket at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; General Motors Corp (GM.N) plans to launch an electric car
using lithium ion batteries -- the Chevrolet Volt -- by the end
of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil's chemical unit has been producing separator
films for lithium ion batteries for consumer electronics and
other non-automotive technologies for about 20 years, Harris
said, and is the second largest producer in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company would not quantify its earnings from the
business or make projections about the profitability of the new
film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Harris said he believes the market for lithium ion
batteries for hybrid vehicles will substantially swamp the
battery market for consumer electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, has long been
been dogged by criticisms of its environmental record. Critics
claim that the company funds groups to mislead the public about
climate change and under invests in research and development
for renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harris said the new technology should make hybrid batteries
more efficient, affordable and lighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think we'll help the industry reduce fuel consumption
and emissions," he said.

    IBM Lotus Sametime Entry software is designed for businesses looking for
analternative to public instant messaging services or costly proprietary
offerings.
Small to medium-sized businesses will benefit from the encrypted and
authenticated
business-ready instant messaging of Lotus Sametime Entry that is easy to
install and has lower list price than full IM suites. Additionally, the Sametime
Entry offering supports multiple server and client operating systems and does
not lock an organization into a single proprietary operating system or
directory, nor does it typically require desktop or server upgrades.

    Lotus Sametime Entry software provides the core real-time collaboration
capabilities
needed to keep pace with today's business environment. It includes instant
messaging capabilities, multi-person chat, presence awareness, spell check, rich
text capabilities, emoticon support and contact list management features.
Chat history capabilities are also available, enabling users to keep a record
of their business-critical discussions.

    Lotus Sametime Entry software is also designed to integrate with business
applications such as Microsoft(R) Office or e-mail through Microsoft Outlook.
Through this integration, organizations will be able to presence-enable
e-mail inboxes and applications letting users see who is available to
collaborate and start a chat instantly regardless of what they are working on.
The presence awareness features in Lotus Sametime Entry software also allow
users to customize their status or use default options such as away, in a
meeting
or do not disturb.

    "For years, IBM Lotus Notes(R) users have benefited from the core IM
capabilities we are now making available to businesses with the Lotus Sametime
Entry offering," said Bruce Morse, vice president of unified communications and
collaboration, IBM Lotus.  "We believe the ease of use, feature set and cost
effectiveness of Lotus Sametime Entry will make it attractive for small to
medium-sized businesses as well as organizations that use email programs from
other
vendors."

    For businesses looking for a full set of unified communication and
collaboration capabilities, IBM offers Lotus Sametime Standard software. The
Lotus
Sametime Standard offering delivers "out-of-the box" presence awareness, instant
messaging, VoIP, Web and video conferencing capabilities, mobile client support,
interoperability with public IM networks and a model for custom application
plugins.

    New features in the Lotus Sametime Standard 8 release include:


--  Expanded platform support for IBM Lotus Domino(R) 8 server and server
    support for VMWare environments.
--  Extended mobile support including the Nokia E-series, Sony Ericsson,
    and Microsoft Windows(R) Mobile 6 devices.
--  New point to point video capabilities for Macintosh users.
--  Integration with Microsoft Office 2007.
    

    
Lotus Sametime Entry and Lotus Sametime Standard version 8, previously known as
Lotus Sametime will be available the week of December 3, 2007.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled a new release of the free IBM OmniFind
Yahoo! Edition enterprise search software with Web search services powered by
Yahoo! that enables users to further customize and personalize their searches to
quickly and easily find, access and capitalize on information stored inside
organizations and across the Web.

    The new version of IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition offers the ability to
easilyseparate content into different searchable document collections, an
improved
administration console that simplifies set-up and management of the search
tool, and enhanced search support based on the latest open source Lucene
indexing library. Other enhancements improve the performance, indexing and
custom
search field capabilities, as well as support for additional browsers.

    IBM introduced IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition last December to address the
growing need for a no-cost, full-featured search product that eliminated
financial
and technology barriers to information access. Since its launch, nearly 25,000
users have downloaded IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition and global organizations of
all sizes are using it to improve their enterprise search experience. In
addition, numerous ISVs and businesses have developed new offerings that
integrate with or support IBM's free search platform.

    Consistent with its commitment to advancing open software solutions, IBM and
Yahoo! were the first major search vendors to offer a full commercially
supported
version of advanced enterprise software based on open source technology.

    "Last year, IBM and Yahoo! came together to change the rules of enterprise
search,
defining a new market standard for search as a core capability that should be
ubiquitous and free," said Joff Redfern, senior director of product
management, Yahoo! Search Distribution. "We're committed to helping enterprises
-- both large and small -- get more value out of their information quickly and
inexpensively, and providing them with an on-ramp to leveraging the power of all
their information."

    Prior to the introduction of IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition, enterprise
searchcapabilities were out of reach for many companies who were unable to
affordthousands of dollars on a search platform. Customers of all sizes have
rapidly
adopted IBM's free enterprise search software, while other vendors have followed
IBM's lead.

    German Knowledge Management company USU Corporation is using IBM OmniFind
Yahoo!
Edition along with IBM OmniFind Enterprise Edition and USU LIS as a search
platform to support its USU KnowledgeCenter suite of knowledge management
software.
"Enterprise search is the cornerstone of knowledge management," said Myriam
Weber,
sales and marketing representative, USU Corporation. "IBM OmniFind Yahoo!
Edition provides a powerful search tool for USU KnowledgeCenter helping
address a wide variety of information management, document and knowledge
management
challenges."

    The new version of IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition provides the ability to
create a number of collections, each indexing a different set of
documents.This allows the user to limit the search to only the documents from a
specific source, providing more accurate results.

    It also provides the ability to define additional custom fields in the index
allowing field values to be mapped from HTML meta tags, extracted from the
document's own metadata, or pushed in from the push API. For example,
OminFind Yahoo! Edition can now allow the user to search within content intended
for a specific country by specifying a custom country metadata field as part of
the search request.

    Additional features in the new version of OminFind Yahoo! Edition include
added
support for detecting and removing "near-duplicates" from search results,
further improving the accuracy and usefulness of searches. The new version of
the software can also be more easily installed as a Microsoft Windows service.

    Earlier this year, IBM announced localized language support to meet
expanding
worldwide demand for the product in Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese,
Traditional Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Dutch,
Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese and Swedish. IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition can
search websites and local or remote file systems up to 500,000 documents per
instance and search the Web all from a single search user interface.

    IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition is available at no charge and can be
downloadedat http://omnifind.ibm.yahoo.com. Worldwide, enterprise-class phone
supportis available from IBM.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 27 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) estimates
that overall losses from collateralized debt obligations tied
to risky subprime mortgages may climb to $260 billion,
according to Chris Flanagan, head of U.S. asset-backed
securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan estimates that structuring banks are exposed to
$216 billion of supersenior risk, while guarantors have
exposure to about $90 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In upcoming months, the focus will be the extent of
mortgage-related losses and who owns these losses," the report
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank CDO write-downs may climb to $77 billion, while
write-downs for guarantors may be $30 billion, according to
JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bond insurers have recognized very little in losses and
are counting on delayed loss timing and outperformance" versus
benchmark indexes, JPMorgan said in a report late on Monday.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney Feature 
Animation's "Bolt" -- previously titled "American Dog" -- will 
be released in digital 3-D when it opens November 26, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We absolutely believe in the whole concept of 3-D and the 
enhancement that it brings in the ability to separate us from 
any of the other mediums," Disney president of domestic 
distribution Chuck Viane said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Travolta and Susie Essman lead the voice cast of 
"Bolt," the story of a TV-star dog named Bolt (Travolta) who is 
accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York, 
where he begins a cross-country journey through the real world. 
Chris Williams directs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bolt" is the latest digital 3-D announcement from Disney, 
which has been a pioneer of the format. The company's digital 
3-D releases have included "Chicken Little," "Meet the 
Robinsons" and "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Burton recently signed a two-picture deal with Disney 
through which he will direct and produce 3-D features based on 
Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" and Burton's short 
"Frankenweenie." Disney next releases in 3-D the "Hannah 
Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour," which 
will play in theaters February 1-7. The "Hannah Montana" 
release should be available on about 700 screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By the time we get to 'Bolt,' I think you may be looking 
at somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 potential 3-D screens 
(domestically)," Viane said. "That would be terrific."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  STUTTGART, GERMANY and ARMONK, NY, Nov 27 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that car maker Audi has deployed a
comprehensive portal platform based on IBM WebSphere Portal to serve as a
central,
unified and multilingual access point for all Audi employees worldwide, with
contentcustomized to employee roles.

    Based in Ingolstadt, Germany, Volkswagen-owned Audi had to address the
challenge of deploying new procedures as internationalization created the
need for corporate change, as well as streamlining employee activities and
administrative Human Resource Management (HRM) tasks.

    Audi now relies on WebSphere Portal to create a central platform that allows
all work and business processes to be handled without re-entering data or
switching
from one medium to another, thus making these processes quicker and more
efficient.

    In addition to accessing business applications, employees can now utilize
personalized desktops through the portal platform, allowing them to
performadministrative tasks such as applying for time off or booking flights.

    "Our aim was to provide new technologies and online media that would
enableour employees to gain comfortable, quick, Web-based access to all relevant
services, information and communication offerings," explains Anton Kramm, head
of IT Web Solutions at Audi. "Together with IBM we managed to achieve this goal
in a very short time."

    "The new employee portal puts a flexible information and communication
platform at the
disposal of Audi that allows all business processes to be integrated
independently of their respective application platforms," says Sebastian
Krause, Vice President of the Software Group, IBM Germany. "This enables the
company to optimize the working, information and knowledge processes that are
indispensable to keeping up with the relentless pace of change in today's
market."

    The benefits of the Audi portal include:


--  A central location for various production locations and international
    subsidiaries of Audi: All Audi employees worldwide now have single-sign on,
    browser-based access to any services and information they might require.

--  A convenient tool for employees to manage and customize individual
    work processes: Personalized information and processes are presented to
    each employee, which are tailored to their individual roles and
    responsibilities, and delivered through portlets that provide relevant
    information and procedures to their specific assignments.

--  Reduction of administrative processes: Audi reduced the number of HTML
    pages in the intranet from 240,000 to 40,000 -- with no loss of content --
    and decreased the number of applications by introducing standard solutions
    such as content and document management systems.
    

    
Audi plans to continue evolving its portal strategy by developing
"processportals" and integrating newer functions such as collaboration services
andknowledge structuring.

&lt;p&gt;  CHICAGO, IL, Nov 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 At the Radiological Society of North America Conference today, IBM (NYSE: IBM) 
announced that HealthAlliance Hospital has implemented an IBM Grid Medical
Archive
Solution (GMAS) to make patient records available to clinicians anytime,
anywhere.

    HealthAlliance Hospital, a member of UMass Memorial Health Care, serves
thecommunities of north-central Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire with
acute care facilities, a cancer center, outpatient physical therapy facilities
and a remote home health agency.  As an investment in continued high-quality
patient care, the hospital has implemented a picture archiving and communication
system (PACS) from Siemens Medical Solutions so that it can move toward
digital health records while eliminating traditional paper and film.

    HealthAlliance is now able to make all of their data, including PACS images,
available instantly, using the IBM GMAS, a cross-IBM offering comprised of
storage, software, servers and services.  The GMAS solution provides hospitals,
clinics, research institutions and pharmaceutical companies with an automated
and
resilient enterprise storage archive for delivering medical images, patient
records and other critical healthcare reference information on demand.

    "Fast, easy access to diagnostic images is a priority," said Rick Mohnk,
Vice
President and Chief Information Officer of HealthAlliance.  "Being paperless not
only helps our staff improve their productivity and the quality of patient
care, but also lowers our costs and improves our competitiveness.  The IBM
GMAS has helped us stay competitive and offer the leading edge technology
that attracts top physicians to our staff and keeps patients feeling
comfortable and well cared for."

    Not only is the volume of medical images growing, but image sizes are
ballooning as well.  The introduction the newest CT scans are expected to
increase file sizes by a factor of five -- from 50 MB to approximately 300
MB.  Digital mammography scans can be as much as 500 MB each. HealthAlliance
has recently installed several new systems to their existing infrastructure,
including new CT, PET, MRI and digital mammography systems, and expects that it
will be dealing with burgeoning numbers of high-resolution medical images.

    With their previous systems, HealthAlliance routinely ran into slow
retrieval
processes and limits on how much it could store -- only the most recent 18
months of studies could be stored digitally, while older studies would remain in
film and paper form.  With their IBM solution, all studies, regardless of age,
are
archived and accessed quickly, allowing for more rapid diagnosis and improved
patient care, as well as more accurate comparisons of current and historical
data.

    HealthAlliance chose the IBM GMAS because it needed a cost-effective
archiving system
with the flexibility and scalability to grow along with their organization. 
In addition, given the critical nature of the files, the GMAS is able to provide
a solution that is highly reliable, always available, and based on open
standards, so that the archive can interface with other systems that the
hospital
might add in the future.

    "Our GMAS solution enables clients of all sizes, from community hospitals to
large
integrated delivery networks and research institutions, to start out small and
easily expand their archive over time," said Hernan Vega, Vice President,
Healthcare and Life Sciences in IBM's System and Technology Group. "IBM views
flexibility and ease of use as critical requirements, especially in the small
and
medium healthcare market."

    All HealthAlliance PACS images are archived on the IBM GMAS and accessible
in
numerous ways.  For example, all clinicians can access GMAS through hospital
record system, which provides complete access to the patient record including
medical images, lab results, radiology reports, and pharmacy records. 
Medical workers at any location can also access the grid using their Web
browsers.

    The GMAS configuration that HealthAlliance installed includes an IBM
SystemStorage DS4000 disk system, IBM System x servers, and IBM Grid Access
Manager
software.  This configuration is duplicated at a separate building on the
hospital
campus for disaster recovery purposes. A wide-area network connects the two
systems, allowing the GMAS archive to continue to function in the case of any
planned or unplanned downtime.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The housing slump has increased the chance of a U.S. recession and will further weaken home prices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Tuesday, cutting its stock recommendations on a slew of companies vulnerable to sluggish growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a grim assessment of the U.S. economy's health, the investment bank said the Federal Reserve will have to cut its lending rate to banks by 1-1/2 percentage points to 3 percent in the next six to nine months to avert a recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakness in construction and consumption will likely shave 2 percentage points from real U.S. economic growth in 2008, and will likely increase the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent from the current 4.7 percent, the U.S. investment bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of a U.S. housing market that is "mired in a full-blown vicious cycle" suggests the risk of recession has risen to a range of 40 percent to 45 percent, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home prices will likely decline by 15 percent from their peak. But if the United States enters a recession -- which Goldman expects the economy to narrowly escape -- home prices could fall as much as 30 percent nationwide, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing economic weakness, Goldman analysts cut their rating on industries involved in a wide swath of the U.S. economy, including automobiles, airlines, hotels, truckers, human resources and staffing providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also cut office furniture sectors, real estate investment trusts, or REITs, dining stocks and base metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman upgraded U.S. tobacco companies as investors seek so-called defensive positions in sectors that do well when the economy slows or enters a recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman downgraded the U.S. automobile sector to "cautious," in part due to growing concerns about the U.S. macroeconomic outlook and its implication for auto sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It cut the U.S. airline sector to "cautious" from "neutral," citing the economy and rising fuel costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman raised UAL Corp UAUA.O, the parent of United Airlines, to "buy" from "neutral" and Alaska Air Group (ALK.N) to "neutral" from "sell." It downgraded US Airways Group LCC.N to "sell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman lowered its rating on the U.S. hotel sector to "cautious" from "neutral," calling an end to the sector's long-running boom. Among companies that Goldman cut were Marriott International Inc MAR.N, Starwood Hotels  Resorts Worldwide Inc (HOT.N) and Wyndham Worldwide Corp (WYN.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since peaking in July, the Standard  Poor's hotels index .GSPHOTL has fallen 19 percent, compared with the Standard  Poor's 500 Index's .SPX 8 percent fall over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman reduced its rating on U.S. REITs to "cautious" from "neutral" and cut property companies Vornado Realty Trust (VNO.N) and General Growth Properties (GGP.N), among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The base metal sector was cut to "neutral" from "attractive." Companies whose ratings were cut included Alcoa Inc (AA.N), Freeport McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc (FCX.N) and Southern Copper Corp PCU.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said slower growth and a weakening labor market would delay a rebound in the restaurant industry. Analysts trimmed stock price targets on sit-down chains: P.F. Chang's China Bistro Inc PFCB.O, Ruth's Chris Steak House Inc (RUTH.O), Chili's parent Brinker International Inc (EAT.N), Cheesecake Factory Inc (CAKE.O), and Red Lobster and Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nichola Groom in Los Angeles, Chris Reiter in New York and Sreerupa Mitra, Nivedita Gupta, Neetha Mahadevan and Nachiket Kelkar in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tom Bergin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 27 (Reuters) - Russian gas export monopoly
Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said partners in the Exxon Mobil Corp-led
(XOM.N) Sakhalin-1 project should be prepared to accept a price
similar to discounted, domestic levels for their gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon wants to export gas from Sakhalin-1, offshore east
Russia, to lucrative international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gazprom wants to block this, saying the gas is needed
for the domestic market, where prices are a fraction of
international levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are prepared to pucharse the entire gas production of
Sakhalin 1," Gazprom Deputy Chairman Alexander Medvedev told
reporters in London, speaking through an interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The people involved in Sakhalin-1 are very well aware of
the price range in the Russian far east. I believe that this
price level would be a good basis for our negotiation," he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sakhalin-1 partners also include Russian
state-controlled oil company Rosneft (ROSN.MM), India's ONGC
(ONGC.BO) and the Japanese consortium Sodeco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom is the majority shareholder in the Sakhalin-2
project, also on Sakhalin Island, which plans to export gas as
liquefied natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon was not immediately available for comment.

Cancellation of Secondary Listing of Common Stock on the London Stock Exchange

Exxon Mobil Corporation is cancelling its secondary listing of common stock on
the London Stock Exchange. This decision was taken due to the relatively low
volume of stock traded on the London Stock Exchange.

Investors can easily trade Exxon Mobil Corporation common stock on the New York
Stock Exchange, on which the Corporation's primary listing is maintained.

Accordingly, Exxon Mobil Corporation has requested the UK Listing Authority to
remove it from the Official List and for the London Stock Exchange to cancel
admission to trading, with effect from the close of trading on 31 December 2007.

The common stock will continue to be listed on Exxon Mobil Corporation's primary
exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, providing on-going liquidity to
ExxonMobil shareholders.

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA (Reuters) - A Nigerian court adjourned civil and criminal cases brought by the federal government against U.S. drugmaker Pfizer over technicalities on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal government and the northern state of Kano are suing Pfizer for a combined $8.5 billion and pressing criminal charges over the 1996 testing of the drug Trovan on Nigerian children in Kano during a meningitis epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria alleges that Trovan was responsible for the deaths of 11 children and caused permanent health problems for dozens of others. It also says Pfizer did not obtain proper regulatory approval for the trial and misled parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer denies all the charges, arguing that it was meningitis, not Trovan, that killed the children or damaged their health. It says Trovan saved lives and was as effective as the other, established drug used for comparison in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil and criminal cases, which are being heard separately in a federal and a Kano state court, were launched in May but have dragged on from one adjournment to the next. The courts are yet to hear a witness or tackle the substance of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the federal court adjourned the criminal case until January 28. This was because in a separate offshoot of the case, Pfizer has obtained an injunction from a Lagos court stopping the government from serving criminal summons. The government is appealing and the issue has not been decided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal court said the adjournment until next year was to give the Lagos court time to rule on whether Pfizer should be served criminal summons or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil suit was adjourned until December 3. The background to that adjournment was that in August, Pfizer had applied to the court to disregard a Nigerian experts' report on the Trovan test, arguing the report was biased and inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of whether to admit the report as evidence has dominated the civil proceedings since then. The parents of three of the alleged victims of the Trovan trial have applied to be defendants, arguing that if the court throws out the report their interests will be harmed. Pfizer objects to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjournment until next week was to allow time for the lawyers representing the parents and Pfizer to submit written positions on why the parents should or should not be admitted as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Janet Lawrence)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, background)

 NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs lowered its
rating on the U.S. hotel sector to "cautious" from "neutral,"
calling an end to the sector's long-running boom.

 U.S. hotel companies like Marriott International Inc
MAR.N, Starwood Hotels  Resorts Worldwide Inc (HOT.N), and
Wyndham Worldwide Corp (WYN.N) have seen profits soar in recent
years as robust demand and limited construction of new hotels
has allowed them to steadily raise rates.

 But hotel building has recently picked up pace, while the
U.S. economy shows signs of slowing, which could impact
spending on business and leisure travel.

 "In the next two years, a slowing economy will be met by
accelerating supply growth, resulting in a loss of pricing
power," Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said in a note. "With
weakening operating trends, we would urge investors to move
away from the group."

 But other analysts disagree that the hotel sector is headed
for a slump.

 "Predictions of a significant downturn in lodging
fundamentals are premature at this point," said Robert LaFleur,
an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group.

 He said supply growth is below historical levels and can be
absorbed by the industry. Also, the weak U.S. dollar creates
demand for hotel rooms from foreign tourists.

 Since peaking in July, the Standard  Poor's hotels index
.GSPHOTL has fallen 19 percent, compared to the SP 500's
.SPX 8 percent fall over the same period.

 The index was up 0.7 percent in morning trading on Tuesday
amid a broader market rebound.

 Goldman also lowered estimates and price targets for a
number of casino operators, because of the slowing U.S.
economy.

 "Gaming operators may also have trouble ahead stemming from
a slowdown in both Las Vegas convention and leisure traveler
trends," Kent said.

 He added that results from China's fast-growing gambling
enclave of Macau, however, will likely drive the performance of
the stocks in the casino sector. Goldman retained its neutral
rating on the gaming sector.

 Following are the price target changes on the companies in

&lt;p&gt;Users Vulnerable to Attack When Viewing Corrupt Lotus 1-2-3 File
                              Attachments
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--Core Security Technologies, provider of CORE IMPACT, the most
comprehensive product for performing enterprise security assurance
testing, today issued an advisory disclosing several vulnerabilities
that could severely impact the thousands of organizations using IBM
Lotus Notes. The buffer overflow vulnerabilities affect the groupware
application and the ability to elicit users to open corrupt email
attachments.

   The email functionality of Lotus Notes supports previewing and
processing file attachments in various formats. A researcher from
CoreLabs, the research arm of Core Security, discovered that by
exploiting vulnerabilities in the Lotus WorkSheet file processor, an
attacker could leverage a specially crafted Lotus 1-2-3 email
attachment to remotely execute arbitrary commands and compromise
vulnerable systems when users "view" the attachment.

   "This is a severe threat to organizations that use Lotus Notes for
corporate email communications," said Ivan Arce, CTO at Core Security
Technologies. "The discovery of this vulnerability in the Lotus Notes
client underlines, once again, that securing endpoint systems and the
applications that run on them is critical and that no vendor is immune
to the perils of client application security. Vulnerable organizations
should be prepared to quickly deploy the appropriate fixes and
workarounds and users of the Lotus Notes client should use caution
when presented with unknown file attachments, especially those from
unfamiliar senders."

   Vulnerability Specifics:

   CoreLabs discovered several buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the
third-party library from software vendor Autonomy. To preview and
process files in the Lotus Worksheet File format (WKS) used by Lotus
1-2-3, the Lotus Notes email client uses Autonomy's Verity KeyView
SDK. As tested, the vulnerabilities affect Lotus Notes Version 7, but
Core Security cautions that the problem may also affect other
applications using Verity KeyView SDK.

   Although the exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires user
intervention and the vulnerability is present on a third-party
component, the problem is compounded by the way Lotus Notes displays
information about attachments, which makes it easier to elicit
assistance from unsuspecting users. Some particular characteristics of
the Lotus Notes client could allow an attacker to send a malicious
Lotus 1-2-3 file as an attachment with a seemingly innocuous file name
and extension (for example, .JPG or .GIF) that could more easily lure
users into viewing the file.

   IBM has acknowledged this security problem and made a fix
available for the l123sr.dll. IBM recommends that customers follow the
instructions in their technote, which outlines the options customers
have based on their current version of Lotus Notes. The technote can
be found at:
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=475=swg21285600.

   To protect against potential attacks, Core Security recommends
that users immediately implement one of the following measures:

   --  Workaround 1: Delete the keyview.ini file in the Notes program
        directory. This disables ALL viewers. When a user clicks View
        (for any file), a dialog box will display with the message
        "Unable to locate the viewer configuration file."

   --  Workaround 2: Delete the problem file (l123sr.dll). When a
        user tries to view the specific file type, a dialog box will
        display with the message "The viewer display window could not
        be initialized." All other file types work without returning
        the error message.

   Additional workarounds can be found in the detailed advisory.

&lt;p&gt;Webmail.us Advances Business-Class Mail Platform with Microsoft Outlook Collaboration Capabilities

      Outlook-Sync Collaboration Feature from Webmail.us Enhances
    Integration With the Most Widely Used Email Client in the World
SAN ANTONIO--(Business Wire)--Webmail.us, LLC, a leading business-class email hosting specialist
and the mail division of Rackspace(R) Managed Hosting, today announced
the launch of Outlook-Sync, a service that allows business email users
to synchronize web-based shared calendars, contacts, and task lists
with Microsoft Outlook.

   Based on the Funambol open source software project, Outlook-Sync
leverages SyncML wireless technology to share data between the web and

Outlook, can increase productivity by allowing business email users to
access their shared calendars, contacts, and task lists from Outlook
or webmail without having to enter data into both locations.

   Outlook-Sync further demonstrates the Webmail.us commitment to
business-class email. "Microsoft Outlook is the de facto standard when
it comes to business-class email software," said Pat Matthews,
president, Webmail.us. "However, many business users are on the go and
need access to email, calendars, contacts and tasks from a browser. By
syncing data between the web and Outlook, they can be sure that all of
the information in Outlook is replicated and accessible from the web."

   "As a full-service retailer of machinery and industrial equipment,
email is an essential communication tool between us, our vendors and
customers," said John Larson, network administrator, Burton Saw &amp;
Supply Co. "Webmail.us provides us with a complete business-class
email platform and now with Outlook-Sync, our employees can enjoy all
aspects of using Microsoft Outlook from home or on the road."

software architects at Webmail.us. This is the latest feature added to
Webmail.us' growing portfolio of business-class email products that
include industry-leading spam filtering and virus protection.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) on Tuesday slashed its target for the expected trough in U.S. benchmark interest rates by a full percentage point, citing an increased probability of recession and the likelihood of a prolonged period of sluggish performance for the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investment bank said it expects the Federal Funds rate to bottom out at 3 percent in the next six to nine months, down from an earlier forecast of 4 percent. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is likely to reach 5.5 percent by the end of 2008, the bank said, up from the current rate of 4.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also said chances of a recession are pushing up to between 40 percent and 45 percent. Even without an outright contraction, Goldman said U.S. gross domestic product growth will be well below trend for an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;         ABUJA, Nov 27 (Reuters) - A Nigerian court adjourned civil and criminal cases brought by the federal government against U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) over technicalities on Tuesday.          The federal government and the northern state of Kano are suing Pfizer for a combined $8.5 billion and pressing criminal charges over the 1996 testing of the drug Trovan on Nigerian children in Kano during a meningitis epidemic.          Nigeria alleges that Trovan was responsible for the deaths of 11 children and caused permanent health problems for dozens of others. It also says Pfizer did not obtain proper regulatory approval for the trial and misled parents.          Pfizer denies all the charges, arguing that it was meningitis, not Trovan, that killed the children or damaged their health. It says Trovan saved lives and was as effective as the other, established drug used for comparison in the trial.          The civil and criminal cases, which are being heard separately in a federal and a Kano state court, were launched in May but have dragged on from one adjournment to the next. The courts are yet to hear a witness or tackle the substance of the matter.          On Tuesday, the federal court adjourned the criminal case until Jan. 28. This was because in a separate offshoot of the case, Pfizer has obtained an injunction from a Lagos court stopping the government from serving criminal summons. The government is appealing and the issue has not been decided.          The federal court said the adjournment until next year was to give the Lagos court time to rule on whether Pfizer should be served criminal summons or not.          The civil suit was adjourned until Dec. 3. The background to that adjournment was that in August, Pfizer had applied to the court to disregard a Nigerian experts' report on the Trovan test, arguing the report was biased and inaccurate.          The issue of whether to admit the report as evidence has dominated the civil proceedings since then. The parents of three of the alleged victims of the Trovan trial have applied to be defendants, arguing that if the court throws out the report their interests will be harmed. Pfizer objects to this.          The adjournment until next week was to allow time for the lawyers representing the parents and Pfizer to submit written positions on why the parents should or should not be admitted as defendants.

&lt;p&gt;Visage Imaging and Medicsight Announce Collaboration to Provide Thin Client-Based CT Colonography Solution

   Visage Imaging to integrate Medicsight's CT colonography and ColonCAD (1) technologies
            into the Visage(TM) Thin Client PACS solutions
CARLSBAD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--Visage Imaging, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercury
Computer Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRCY), and Medicsight announced a
partnership on the joint development of an advanced CT colonography
solution which will be fully integrated with the Visage(TM) Thin
Client/Server platform.

   "We look forward to supporting Visage Imaging in delivering this
unique integrated solution to hospitals and imaging centers. The easy
deployment and enhanced accessibility of the Visage solution results
in a powerful package that brings CT colonography to its true
potential," said David Sumner, Chief Executive Officer at Medicsight.

   Visage Imaging's leading-edge PACS and advanced visualization
solutions are capable of displaying and processing the ever-increasing
amounts of 2D, 3D, and 4D data efficiently on standard computers
connected through LAN, WAN, or the Internet. The planned CT
colonography (CTC) application will be fully integrated into this
platform, providing server-based performance and consistent data
access across the entire healthcare enterprise. In this way,
radiologists and clinicians can make most efficient use of the power
of CTC combined with Medicsight CAD, in both second and concurrent
reading paradigms; as well as for distributing, documenting, and
sharing the diagnostic results. The CTC application becomes an
integral part of the PACS infrastructure and workflow, thereby
removing the need for costly, dedicated CTC workstations.

   "This partnership reflects our commitment to providing advanced
clinical applications that become available directly within the PACS
workflow, and throughout the enterprise," said Marcelo Lima, President
of Visage Imaging. "Visage enables our customers to make more
efficient use of their PACS, advanced visualization, and clinical
applications such as CT angiography, cardiac CT, and CT colonography.
The benefits of an integrated, thin client- based solution start with
an optimized workflow inside the radiology department, and go all the
way to enabling remote reading services and an enhanced service
offering to their referral base."

costs, and improve quality of care.

   "Multi-site healthcare facilities that have disparate RIS, PACS,
and 3D applications running are demanding solutions to bridge the gap
between systems and help streamline workflow," said Michael Mardini,
Vice-President, Medical Imaging, Dictaphone Healthcare Solutions. "By
integrating our respective applications, we are providing radiologists
the control they need via a single bi-directional interface to create
a more seamless diagnostic workflow, drive productivity and fully
utilize their medical imaging IT infrastructure."

   In addition to launching images for interpretation, the
speech-driven reporting software can be launched directly from within
the Visage PACS worklist or viewers. Regardless of its imaging and
health information configuration, healthcare facilities can greatly
enhance clinical processes through the use of a powerful data-driven,
structured speech reporting application in combination with thin
client-enabled PACS.

   "We are very excited about the opportunities of our partnership
with the Dictaphone Healthcare Solutions Division," said Marcelo Lima,
President of Visage Imaging, Inc. "Dictaphone's speech-enabled,
workflow orchestration and documentation solutions will help to
integrate Visage's PACS and advanced visualization solutions more
deeply and seamlessly in many cases, thus offering significantly
improved reporting tools. Both Commissure RadWhere(TM) for Radiology

diagnostic workflow, and thus form a perfect match."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the National Football league (NFL) has
standardized its business on IBM BladeCenter and System x servers.  The
servers from IBM leverage X-Architecture -- the company's design blueprint
for x86-based servers.

    The league standardized on IBM servers to run its media information systems,
facilitate distribution of game day video and run day-to-day operations for
dozens
of applications including its unique salary cap management system and a
statistical analytics system.

    A decade ago, companies typically used industry standard servers for
simplefile-and-print services.  IBM helped change the future trajectory of the
x86
market by leveraging its mainframe and supercomputer chip experience to help
enhance the performance of  industry-standard server components --
processors, memory and I/O -- to deliver unparalleled capabilities to x86
computing.  The resulting "X-Architecture" laid the groundwork for IBM
technology advancements that have brought x86-based servers to the forefront
of enterprise computing, helping clients streamline business operations and do
more with the same IT dollars.

    "IBM X-Architecture has evolved with superior engineering innovations that
have continued to deliver for the NFL year after year," said Jonathan Kelly, NFL
Director of IT.  "System x provides the performance and the reliability we
need to drive our diverse business applications.  It enables the NFL to deliver
reliable information services to our 32 teams and our business partners.  In
addition, the new x3850 M2 system is optimized for virtualization which is
critical to the NFL maximizing utilization and efficiency."

    The NFL is currently testing the new IBM System x3850, based on the fourth
generation of IBM's chipset technology -- X4.  With the System x3850, the NFL
will have the ability to begin building a virtualized environment to reduce
its datacenter footprint and further improve its business operations.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Tuesday it would hire 1,000 engineers in the current fiscal year, joining the current 5,000 staff in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We will add 1,000 engineers," Zhang Yaqin, the company's chairman in the mainland, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. "There will be researchers, but most will be involved with product," he said, without elaborating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments come after Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said earlier this month that the Chinese market was important to Microsoft but Beijing needed to do more to protect intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said more than a fifth of its software running globally was pirated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(US$=7.40 yuan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kirby Chien; Editing by Quentin Bryar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co Inc (JPM.N) plans 
to cut about 100 subprime mortgage jobs in California amid 
falling U.S. housing prices and tighter lending standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan disclosed the cuts in a recent filing with the 
California Employment Development Department. The cuts, 
effective December 15, will take place at JPMorgan's subprime 
retail operations center in Ontario, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said it has reduced subprime originations and 
operations staff because of home price weakness and tighter 
credit standards. About 40 percent of JPMorgan's 2006 subprime 
originations would not be approved under today's standards, the 
bank said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank has discontinued, for example, all subprime home 
equity loans. JPMorgan has said that it expects to originate 
about $1 billion subprime loans per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tim McLaughlin, editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that its Internet Security Systems (ISS)
division has been recognized as the leading managed security services (MSS)
provider in 2007 in a new report by industry analyst firm Frost &amp; Sullivan.
The report, entitled "North American Managed Security Services Markets,"
examined the market penetration, long-term vision and competitive
differentiators of 40 MSS providers active in the North American market and
found IBM ISS to be the leader with 11.8 percent share of the highly
fragmented market.(1)

    According to the report, "IBM Internet Security Systems is uniquely
positioned to
remain at the forefront of managed security with a combination of resources
that is unprecedented in the industry." The report also predicts continued
market leadership for IBM ISS due to the combined strengths resulting from IBM's
acquisition of ISS last year. Frost &amp; Sullivan concluded that the
combination of IBM's professional services and ISS' MSS expertise and threat
research would solidify the company's leadership for years to come. "These
business
units ensure that IBM Internet Security Systems is poised to thrive in the
greater security market independent of any of the obvious directions that the
managedsecurity services market may take."

    With key market drivers including increasingly innovative threats, growing
corporate awareness of the potential damage of attacks and the need for
companies to comply with new legislation, Frost &amp; Sullivan expects the North
American MSS market to grow from $950 million in 2007 to $1.5 billion in the
next
five years. According to the report, "As we see the MSS market continue to grow
in 2007, industry participants are becoming increasingly defined by their
ability to
meet the growing expectations and goals of a monolithic end-to-end offering
that integrates initial consulting services (which may include policy
development), appliance and product identification and installation, and finally
monitoring and management."

    "With a comprehensive offering of security products, managed services and
professional services designed to minimize risk while reducing complexity and
enabling business, IBM's portfolio exemplifies the simple, elegant and
versatile security solution that Frost &amp; Sullivan calls for in this report as a
means of solving current network security issues," said Jason Hilling,
Enterprise
Services Business Line Executive with IBM Internet Security Systems. "IBM does
not
merely monitor devices. Instead, we partner closely with our customers to tailor
flexible, end-to-end solutions that are designed to fit and scale with
changing needs to not only help organizations  protect themselves today, but
also shield them from the threats of tomorrow."

    Through its MSS group, IBM ISS offers a comprehensive range of services
forvarious IBM and third-party security technologies including firewalls,
intrusion
detection and prevention systems, unified threat management (UTM), security
event
and log management, vulnerability management, e-mail, data and Web security.
Managed Security Services complement the IBM ISS product line -- a
multi-layered security solution designed to provide preemptive protection from
network- and host-based attacks before they impact business assets. As
security increasingly becomes a crucial need for organizations of all
sizesacross industries, IBM is firmly committed to continuing to innovate and
enhance its security portfolio to help keep customers ahead of the latest
threats. For additional information on IBM ISS Managed Security Services, please

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that its Managed Security Services (MSS)
division has been recognized as a "leader" in a new report from Forrester
Research, Inc., entitled "Forrester Wave(TM): Managed Security Services for Q4
2007." The report evaluated 10 different managed security services vendors based
on 56 criteria including product and service offerings, market presence and
strategy.

    According to the report, "IBM is a leader in MSS with excellent offerings
and a
solid strategy." The report goes on to say that, "with a large range of
capabilities as well as established security expertise and technologies -- many
gained
from IBM's recent acquisition of [Internet Security Systems] ISS -- IBM occupies
a
very strong position in the MSS market."

    In The Forrester Wave(TM) Vendor Summary, Q4 2007 for IBM, Forrester
statesthat IBM "offers the only cash-back warranty among MSS providers -- backed
by
its decade of security experience -- and boasts strong messaging with its
'Next-Generation Virtual SOC.' The company also has strong threat intelligence
capabilities -- provided by IBM X-Force Threat Analysis Service (XFTAS) --
implementation abilities, and a very strong portal strategy." The report further
states IBM is "an especially good fit for buyers that are looking for very
strong threat intelligence... and require fast, straightforward implementation."

    In a separate report, The Forrester Wave: Security Consulting, Q3 2007,
IBM's
Professional Security Services (PSS) division was recognized as a "strong
performer with a solid customer base." According to the report, "IBM has one of
the biggest security consulting practices in the market, with a robust partner
ecosystem and a solid customer base across all global regions... Companies
seeking in-depth technical expertise to help with security projects involving
large-scale integration efforts should strongly consider IBM."

    According to Forrester, "The reputation ISS held in the industry as a
security expert and advocate is extending to IBM." Forrester's MSS report also
points out that, moving forward, "managed security services will tie more
closely to wider business goals like infrastructure transformation and IT
risk management."

    "As the market continues to shift towards this model, IBM is confident
thatit will remain a strong managed security services leader by tightly
weavingsecurity services into its comprehensive portfolio of products and
servicesdesigned to help companies simplify IT processes and mitigate risk,"
said
Carolyn Schreiber, director of business line management for IBM Internet
Security
Systems. "IBM's global resources, unique preemptive security technology and deep
expertise make us an ideal business partner for customers seeking to reduce
risk, lower the cost of security management, improve system uptime and
performance,
and more readily comply with federal, state and industry security regulations."

    "Companies are continuing to embrace technologies that allow them to work
smarter, faster and more fluidly -- and attackers are becoming even more
stealthy in their ways -- causing the need for security to grow
exponentially," said Rick Miller, director of Managed Security Services
Operations
for IBM ISS. "Add to that the increasingly rigorous compliance demands being
placed
on organizations across vertical markets, and there isn't an Internet-connected
company in the world that can really afford to skimp on security. IBM
Managed Security Services are highly scalable and are designed to help reduce
security complexities and improve operational compliance for organizations of
all
types and sizes."

    Through its MSS group, IBM ISS offers a comprehensive range of services
forvarious IBM and third-party security technologies including firewalls,
intrusion
detection and prevention systems, unified threat management (UTM), security
event
and log management, vulnerability management, e-mail, data and Web security.
Managed Security Services complement the IBM ISS product line -- a
multi-layered security solution designed to provide preemptive protection from
network- and host-based attacks before they impact business assets. As
security increasingly becomes a crucial need for organizations of all sizes
across industries, IBM is firmly committed to continuing to innovate and
enhance its security portfolio to help keep customers ahead of the latest
threats.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday dismissed a case against Pfizer Inc in which the state of Louisiana sought to recover Medicaid payments for the withdrawn diabetes drug Rezulin as well as the costs of treating illnesses caused by the drug, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rezulin was pulled from the market in 2000 due to liver toxicity problems and the drug has since been the subject of numerous lawsuits. Pfizer (PFE.N) inherited the Rezulin litigation when it acquired Warner-Lambert Co. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Judge Lewis Kaplan of U.S. District Court in New York granted Pfizer's motion for summary judgment dismissing the case brought by Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti on behalf of the state and its citizens, the court papers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It was not immediately clear how much Louisiana had been seeking in damages from the world's largest drugmaker. Louisiana was aiming to recover the amount paid to fill Rezulin prescriptions for state Medicaid recipients and to treat illnesses allegedly caused by Rezulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In handing down his decision, Kaplan said the plaintiffs failed to file papers needed to avoid a summary judgment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Indeed, the failure to file such an affidavit is fatal to a claim," Kaplan wrote in his decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The plaintiffs had argued that more discovery information was necessary from Pfizer and therefore a summary judgment in the case should not be entered before the information was provided. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    However the judge said in his ruling that "a party resisting summary judgment on the ground that it needs discovery in order to defeat the motion must submit an affidavit" showing what facts are sought to resist the motion and what effort was made to obtain them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reuters Messaging: bill.berkrot.reuters.com@reuters.net phone 646 223-6030)) Keywords: PFIZER REZULIN/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Infosys Technologies Expand Relationship With Increased Focus on Seamless Collaboration

    Infosys Establishes Dedicated Microsoft Facility With More Than
                               400 Seats
BANGALORE, India--(Business Wire)--Infosys Technologies Limited (NASDAQ:INFY), a world leader in
consulting and information technology (IT) services, today announced
several strategic efforts directed toward deepening services delivered
to Microsoft Corp., including a new dedicated Vendor Offshore Facility
(VOF) and a Microsoft Dynamics Concept Center.

   As a strategic partner of Microsoft, Infosys has a
multi-dimensional relationship with the company. Infosys has
established the new 400 seat capacity VOF to facilitate and highlight
its expertise in working on Microsoft programs and industry-leading
solutions. It is completely compliant with Microsoft's rigorous
security and privacy standards.

   In addition, Infosys has developed a Microsoft Dynamics Concept
Center that is designed to showcase Infosys employees' thought
leadership around Microsoft technologies and accelerate deployment of
solutions developed around the Microsoft Dynamics line of business
solutions to clients.

   Moorthy Uppaluri, CEO of Microsoft IT-Global, stated: "Together
with Infosys we are creating technology solutions that enable the
businesses of our customers and stakeholders to be People-Ready. At
Microsoft, we firmly believe that the talented people we engage with
are our fundamental and most important asset, helping us accelerate
the transformation and growth of our business. I expect this

include:

        platform built on next generation Microsoft BI technologies
        for Microsoft to analyze and provide important feedback on
        customer interactions to product teams.

   --  Supporting Microsoft's focus on customer experience by
        architecting and deploying a download Web site, reducing the
        time from product release-to-market to availability of
        downloads to less than 10 days from six to eight weeks. Within
        the first two weeks of launch, more than 30,000 Microsoft
        customers accessed the download solution and new capabilities.

   --  Establishing a Test Center of Excellence focused exclusively
        on quality assurance of IT solutions for Microsoft to manage
        its customer and partner relationships.

   --  Building a talent management platform for Microsoft to deliver
        development and retention programs to its more than 70,000
        employees.

   "The Infosys and Microsoft relationship is a shining example of
how a strong collaboration may enhance a client's competitive
advantage in the marketplace," said Anand Swaminathan, associate vice
president, High-Tech &amp; Manufacturing, Infosys Technologies. "Infosys
is committed to combining its industry solutions and services and

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Nov 27 (Reuters) - China's Changsheng Fund
Management Co, partly owned by Singapore's DBS Group Holdings
(DBSM.SI), will hire Goldman Sachs (GS.N) as the investment
adviser for its planned $5 billion overseas investment fund, a
person familiar with situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Beijing-based Changsheng is expected to sign the deal with
Goldman in the near future, the source, who asked not to be
identified because he was not authorised to make the disclosure,
told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Changsheng and Goldman were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Changsheng said last month it had won approval from China's
securities regulator to invest clients' money overseas, under
China's Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far, 11 domestic fund houses have obtained such
permission, and four of them have launched products under the
scheme -- aimed at giving domestic residents more investment
opportunities and promoting a better balance in its international
payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, Chinese fund management firms are allowed to raise
a maximum of $4 billion for each such QDII fund from initial
public offerings. The quota can be expanded to $5 billion through
additional offers, industry officials have said.

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL Nov 29 (Reuters) - An Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
affiliate is planning to invest 300 billion won ($322.1 million)
to build a battery plant in Gumi, south of Seoul, the Gumi
municipal office said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tonen Chemical, Exxon's Japanese affiliate, signed a
memorandum of understanding to build a plant that produces
battery separator film, a key component of lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production is to begin in 2009, with the construction of the
plant starting next year, a Gumi spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lithium-ion batteries are often used in consumer electronics
such as cell phones and laptop computers as they hold a charge
longer than the nickel metal hydride batteries now used widely in
automobiles. They are also lighter than their predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, has long been
dogged by criticism of its environmental record and accused of
underinvesting in research and developing renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, the oil company said its development of
the film that allow battery companies to make larger lithium-ion
batteries without overheating will be key in helping the
automotive industry switch to lighter, more efficient batteries
for hybrid and electric vehicles. [ID:nN27511383]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This technology could help automakers address one of the
biggest challenges in producing a plug-in car, as they try to
lower the cost of the batteries and boost their power and storage
capacity.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. and NYC Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg Announce Expansion of Hybrid Trucks Fleet in New YorkNEW YORK--(Business Wire)--John F. Brock, president and chief executive officer of Coca-ColaEnterprises (NYSE: CCE), today joined Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg toannounce that the company is undertaking energy saving measures in NewYork, including introducing the five hybrid-electric trucks to theirdistribution center in the Bronx. Currently, the Bronx sales centerhas 90 trucks servicing 8,700 customers in Manhattan and the Bronx,delivering more than 8 million cases of product annually. Thehybrid-electric trucks use 32 percent less fuel than standard trucksand use technology to eliminate emissions when they're idling or intraffic.   "Sustainable business practices will save businesses money in thelong run. That's why we're seeing support for converting the taxifleet to hybrids, major rental companies like Hertz converting theirfleets, and it's why a leader in product distribution like Coca-ColaEnterprises has made this commitment," said Mayor Bloomberg. "AlthoughCCE is a global company, there are important local implications tothis decision. Coca-Cola Enterprises runs trucks though our fiveboroughs on their distribution routes, and by converting their fleethere, they're contributing to better air quality in the communitiesthey serve locally -- like the South Bronx."   "Coca-Cola Enterprises has long been responsive to the needs ofour local communities, and the expansion of our hybrid-electric fleetin the Bronx demonstrates our commitment to Mayor Bloomberg's call forlocal industries to be proactive in the search for alternative fuelsources," said Mr. Brock. "CCE will continue to explore ways to helpour customers and communities through our corporate responsibility andsustainability efforts. These efforts, coupled with other energysaving measures here in the Bronx and elsewhere, are not only acommitment to the environment, but they're good business practice."   CCE conducted an intensive research and design program with theirsupplier to develop, test and produce hybrid-electric trucks for theirNY fleet. Currently, CCE has two trucks in the Bronx facility, withthree additional trucks scheduled for deployment in December. The fiveBronx trucks represent the largest CCE hybrid-electric fleet of anycity in the U.S.   The International 4300 truck, with Eaton Hybrid Technology, meetsNew York City weight restrictions for use in town and on bridges. Overthe next year, an additional 120 side load hybrid-electric trucks willjoin the CCE fleet across the country. A motor/generator, working withthe transmission and a 340-volt battery, allows the truck to sourceelectrical power instead of gas when traveling at speeds below 30 MPH,eliminating emissions in slow traffic.   CCE employs more than 3,500 people in the metro-NYC area, 434 attheir Bronx facility, where recently, they began the installation ofan energy efficient lighting system. The upgrade at the 264,025 sq.ft. facility is about 90 percent complete.   In May, Mayor Bloomberg announced that the City's yellow-taxifleet would be required to meet stringent emission standards thatcurrently are only reachable by converting to hybrid taxis. In June,Mayor Bloomberg joined officials from Hertz Rental Cars to announcethat they would convert a major portion of their New York based fleetto hybrid.   Coca-Cola Enterprises is the world's largest marketer,distributor, and producer of bottled and canned liquid nonalcoholicrefreshment. CCE sells approximately 80 percent of The Coca-ColaCompany's North American volume, and is the sole licensed bottler forproducts of The Coca-Cola Company in Belgium, continental France,Great Britain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Monaco.Coca-Cola EnterprisesLaura Brightwell - Media Relations770-989-3023orFred Roselli - Media Relations770-200-8731Copyright Business Wire 2007

&lt;p&gt;  SINGAPORE, Nov 28 (MARKET WIRE) --  IBM (NYSE: IBM), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), National University ofSingapore (NUS), Singapore Management University (SMU), and 15 industryfirst-movers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- supported by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) -- today-- supported by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) -- todayannounced their collaboration to push the frontier of service innovationthrough Service Science education, research, talent development andcollaborationwithgovernment, academia and industry.  A major milestone is the offering of theService Science, Management and Engineering (SSME) programme by Singapore'suniversities from 2008, in collaboration with IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Services is a key pillar of Singapore's economy(1), and it has become akeyengine of growth across a variety of industries, including finance,healthcare andlogistics.  In particular, the demand for high value services is growing in theIT and business consulting space, where companies are seizing new businessopportunities by building more efficient IT systems, streamlining their businessprocesses and embracing the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rear-Admiral (NS) Ronnie Tay, Chief Executive Officer, IDA, said, "Theintroduction of the SSME programme by IBM and the Institutes of Higher Learning,or IHLs, is a timely one.  It is aligned with the iN2015 masterplan wherenurturing a pool of 'techno-strategists' is critical in helping to achievethe vision of an intelligent nation, global city powered by infocomm. Developinga multi-disciplinary infocomm workforce, ready for the service-based economywill certainly enhance Singapore's status as an infocomm hub.  The effortsby industry leaders like IBM and the IHLs are most encouraging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Teresa Lim, Managing Director, IBM Singapore, said, "Service Science createsanew and exciting paradigm, which transforms the way we develop, deliver, manageand measure service.  It provides a means to sustain and scale qualityservice performance and accelerate service innovation through research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Lim added, "This industry, academia and government ecosystem collaborationis unique. It provides a critical foundation to sustain success in Singapore's servicessector growth and differentiate Singapore's competitive position globally. Singaporehas the opportunity to become a global knowledge centre where innovativeservices are created and delivered globally and seamlessly.  These are excitingtimes which emphasise the need to raise service level capabilities, becomemore systematic in service innovation, venture into service research, andconstantly strive for service excellence locally and globally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Developing Service Science Expertise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In today's announcement, IBM signed separate Memorandum of Understanding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(MOU) with theNTU School of Computer Engineering; NUS School of Computing, Institute ofSystemsScience (ISS) of NUS, and SMU School of Information Systems on Service Sciencecurriculum development and research exploration. The new Service Sciencecurriculum iscalled Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The signing ceremony was witnessed by Rear-Adm (NS) Tay of IDA; NickDonofrio,Executive Vice President, Innovation and Technology, IBM Corporation; GloriaNg, Senior Programme Director of ISS; and Professor Howard Hunter, President ofSMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM has designated Dr. Jim Spohrer, Director of Service Research, and PaulMaglio, Senior Manager, Service Systems Research, both from the IBMAlmadenResearch Center in San Jose, California, to lead IBM's collaboration withtheuniversity faculties and ISS.  Under the MOU, the collaboration includes reviewofexisting curricula, development of new courseware and case studies, anddefining areas for service research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the beginning, SSME will be integrated into the undergraduate curriculaof theuniversity faculties as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--  NTU School of Computer Engineering - Bachelor of Engineering (Computer--  NTU School of Computer Engineering - Bachelor of Engineering (Computer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Science/Computer Engineering)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--  NUS School of Computing - Bachelor of Computing (Computer--  NUS School of Computing - Bachelor of Computing (Computer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Science/Information Systems)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--  SMU School of Information Systems - Bachelor of Science (Information--  SMU School of Information Systems - Bachelor of Science (Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Systems Management)The universities will announce details of the SSME curricula in March2008when students enrol for their courses for the academic year startingAugust 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NUS School of Computing will also be introducing a SSME specialisation inthe undergraduate degree programme and will explore joint research opportunitieson service science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In addition, SMU's School of Information Systems said it will offer SSMEasa specialisation track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NTU's School of Computer Engineering is also looking into the possibility ofofferingSSME as one of its specialisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ISS plans to introduce SSME into its Master of Technology, professionalandexecutive continuing education programmes, and, also, embark on jointresearchin service science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The collaboration aims to develop a new breed of service scientists andservice entrepreneurs who understand service systems, are trained toenableefficient and systematic approaches to service delivery, and serve ascatalysts for service innovation in organisations and for various industrysectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SSME-trained graduates will likely enter the workforce as solutiondesigners,consultants, engineers, scientists, and managers.  After gaining practicalexperience across multiple industry sectors and with rapidly evolving technologytools and solutions that transform businesses and institutions, they willthen go on to be successful entrepreneurs, executives, researchers, andpractitioners,with a solid grounding in theory and best practices in designing high-valueservice solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    National Infocomm Scholarships&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    To catalyse the development of multi-disciplinary professionals throughinfocommand service science, IDA, together with Avaya Singapore Pte Ltd, DBS Bank Ltd,IBM Singapore, Singapore Computer Systems Limited (SCS) and SingaporeTelecommunications Ltd are sponsoring talented students who are keen topursue infocomm and SSME-related courses through the National InfocommScholarship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(NIS).   The Scholarship aims to identify and nurture a group of talentedstudents for a career in infocomm.  Together, the six organisations havepledged their support to sponsor up to 38 new scholarships from 2008,enhancing next year's NIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Industry Support for Service Science and SSME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The industry first-movers in Singapore which have expressed their supportforService Science and SSME include: Avaya Singapore Pte Ltd; Cisco; DBS BankLtd; Fuji Xerox Singapore Pte Ltd; Intel Technology Asia Pte Ltd; LandTransport Authority; Lenovo Singapore; OCBC Bank; Oracle Corporation, AsiaPacific; PowerSeraya Ltd; Singapore Airlines; Singapore Computer Systems Limited&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SCS); Singapore Power Ltd; Singapore Telecommunications Ltd; and UnitedOverseas Bank Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Given the importance of services as a key growth driver, businesses areexpected to invest more to make innovation in services more systematic. Greaterandmore open collaboration among the academia, government and industry will alsolead to initiatives to capture the vast quantities of service data beinggenerated by the business world everyday, and leverage them for research whichisthe seedbed for generating new service value and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For more information on the IBM SSME Initiative, visit:http://www.ibm.com/university/ssme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For more information on IDA or the National Infocomm Scholarships, visit:http://www.ida.gov.sg or http://talent.singaporeinfocomm.sg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For more information on NTU School of Computer Engineering, visit:http://www.ntu.edu.sg/sce/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For more information on NUS School of Computing, visit:http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For more information on Institute of Systems Science, National University ofSingapore, visit: http://www.iss.nus.edu.sg/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For more information on SMU School of Information Systems, visit:http://www.sis.smu.edu.sg/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (1) Economic Surveys Series 2005: The Services Sector published by theDepartment of Statistics (October 2007)Media contacts:Maggie TanIBM Communications+65 6418 2404tanjpm@sg.ibm.comPasha Ray DahnckeIBM Academic Innovation Initiatives914-766-3389bipasha@us.ibm.comCopyright 2007, Market Wire, All rights reserved.-0-

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 28 (MARKET WIRE) --  IBM (NYSE: IBM) today previewed new software that will help cellular phone,Internet and other communications service providers to analyze and improve thequality of their services to a degree not possible before. Before a customer hasthe chance to complain about a service problem, the software will helpallow operators to pinpoint problems ahead of time and facilitate the resolutionof network issues more quickly -- which can help them realize their goals ofincreasing customer satisfaction and reducing call center costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    The new IBM Tivoli(R) Netcool(R) Customer Experience Management solution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--available in the first half of 2008 -- will help provide instant access to--available in the first half of 2008 -- will help provide instant access todata that enables service providers to manage user accounts by customer,location,device, time, grouping and service -- all through one dashboard view. Thesolutionwill bring proactive management of individual customer's experience which canhelpusers achieve rapid problem resolution, greater customer confidence andincreasedper customer revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As the front line of contact with customers, customer care teams areuniquelypositioned to build trust and grow per customer revenues for businesses.Until now, insufficient information about network issues coupled withinefficient communication between customer care and network operations haslimited customer care's ability to drive customer satisfaction as a profitableindustry advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With access to customer-specific information, service teams will not have torelay back and forth between network operations. Instead, they will beempowered with real-time and advance information. They can notify thecustomer that a problem is acknowledged and immediately start a Trouble Ticket.Then they will be able to identify and notify other account teams affected bythe problem as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Since network issues can be resolved more quickly, incoming service callsmaybe minimized before large groups of users are affected. And with a betterunderstanding of usage patterns, customer care can know in advance what's goingon and can reassure, if not alert in advance, high volume and key customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Assuring the availability and quality of service for every customer issomething communications service providers recognize as the key toprofitability and long-term sustainability," said Karl Whitelock, seniorconsulting analyst, Stratecast, a division of Frost &amp; Sullivan.  "IBM is oneof only a few suppliers possessing enough solution capability and servicesexpertise to address the end-to-end needs of Customer Experience Managementtransformation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On the business side, service providers may expect that with improvedcustomersatisfaction, new customers will be won and users will be encouraged to tryother services offered by the provider. It can also help allow marketingdepartments to leverage usage patterns and behavior data for targetedcampaigns, matching existing customers with new products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The software can also help service providers validate quality in advanceofa new service launch. This can help ensure a good first experience forcustomers, encourage repeat usage, improve a customer's inclination to tryother services and attract new customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The new Customer Experience Management solution is a further step inconnecting network operations to the front line of quality service delivery,"said Kieran Moynihan, vice president &amp; CTO of telecommunications software,Tivoli Software,IBM. "Network management is a customer impacting function, and next generationtelecommunications is all about placing the customer at the heart of thebusiness.  While businesses are increasing confidence in their service, they cansimultaneously lower operational costs. The solution will help to reduce callcentercall volumes and boosts overall effectiveness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Customer Experience Management solution from IBM Tivoli Netcool willbeavailable in conjunction to the release of the new version of IBM TivoliNetcoolService Quality Manager -- both scheduled to be released in the first half of2008.

&lt;p&gt;  FAYETTEVILLE, AR, Nov 29 (MARKET WIRE) --  Children of select public schools and all charter schools in Arkansas, andtheir parents will now have access to new translation technology from IBM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(NYSE: IBM) that will help bridge the communication gap for the growingnumbers of Spanish-speaking families and English-speaking teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM awarded a grant valued at nearly $1.4 million to the University ofArkansas College of Education and Health Professions for IBM's !TraduceloAhora!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Translate Now!) program, software that translates e-mail messages and Web pagesbi-directionally (English-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-English) automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The college's Charter School Resource Center will make the technologyavailable toat least 72 schools across the state. The goal of the technology is to enableparents who speak only Spanish and teachers who speak only English tocommunicate more easily so that the parents can remain involved in theirchildren's progress, which is critical to educational success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Training sessions designed to help teachers and schools access and use thesoftware will be held at locations across the state. The schools selected tohaveaccess to !TraduceloAhora! will be notified by the University of Arkansaswhen the sessions are set. The schools chosen include all the charter schoolsin the state, all the small, rural districts to which the Arkansas School forMath and Science already provides technological and curriculum support, andthe Springdale School District because it has the largest Hispanic studentpopulation in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    According to recent U.S. Census data, Arkansas had one of the country'sfastestgrowing Hispanic populations in the past six years with an increase of 59percentfrom 2000 to 2006. According to the Arkansas Department of Education, 37,477students, or 8 percent of all students in Arkansas, are Hispanic. InNorthwest Arkansas, the Springdale School District has a 39 percent Hispanicenrollment in the public school system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Providing technology that helps eliminate the barrier between English andSpanish can allow for successful communication that can play a major role inthe healthy development of every member of the Hispanic family," said ChrisHolmes, IBM senior state executive for Arkansas. "The College of Educationand Health Professions Arkansas Charter School Resource Center is givingparents of Hispanic children across the state a way to stay connected to theschool, their child's progress and the community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are grateful to IBM for making this gift to the University of Arkansas,"said Reed Greenwood, dean of the College of Education and Health Professions."It will help strengthen our college's outreach efforts across the state byproviding a practical and much-needed resource for our schools,Spanish-speaking English Language Learner students and their families."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The easy-to-use technology provides a pathway to help Hispanic familiesfacilitatetheir interaction with the community at large. In practice, Spanish-speakingparents can use !TraduceloAhora! to e-mail their child's teacher in their ownlanguage. In the classroom, Spanish-speaking students can use the translationcapability on Web pages to keep up with classroom curricula while they learnEnglish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A recent report by the Springdale School District suggests that becomingfluent inEnglish takes too long and that English Language Learner students are "stallingout" when they reach mid-level fluency. Access to a program that could translateWeb sites and other communications may aid in the language learning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Anything like this that builds a bridge between parents and educatorswillbe beneficial to the community. We need to create more ideas like this andpromote them to the community," said Al Lopez, school/community liaisonforthe Springdale School District and advocate for bilingual issues andeducation in northwest Arkansas. "It will be good for everybody. We havetoteam up and not let language be the barrier and programs like this will help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Public charter schools are public schools of choice that operate withfreedomfrom many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools. Thecharter establishing each such school is a performance contract detailing theschool's mission, program, goals, students served and methods of assessment.Charters are granted for a period of up to 5 years. At the end of the term,the state Board of Education may renew the school's contract. According tothe Arkansas Department of Education, there currently are 20 public charterschools operating in Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    !TraduceloAhora! is based on IBM's WebSphere translation technology. Thegrant program is in its fourth year and most recently 200 schools andnonprofit organizations received access to this technology, bringing to350the number of organizations participating in the program in the United Statesand Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Since 1994, IBM has been a leader in elementary and secondary school reform.Reinventing Education, IBM's flagship program with an investment of $75 millionworldwide, has led to the development of a series of high-impact technologytools and more importantly, introduced technology into school districtoperations inan effective manner with resulting improvements in student achievement.CONTACT:Laura Jacobsuniversity relations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(479) 575-7422laura@uark.eduJamie BanksCollege of Education and Health Professions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(479) 575-3126jbanks@uark.eduSandra DresselIBM Communications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(914) 499-6609sdressel@us.ibm.comCopyright 2007, Market Wire, All rights reserved.-0-

industrial average .DJI rose 22.36 points, or 0.17 percent,
to end unofficially at 13,311.81. The Standard  Poor's 500

&lt;p&gt;OCALA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--When world renowned horse breeder and trainer Abelardo Moralespurchased Peninsula Farm in 2001, it created a stir in the localcommunity known as the Horse Capital of the World. Local breeders andtrainers especially took notice when Morales began expanding thefacilities, leading some to wonder if he intended to create a facilitymirroring his famous Cortijo las Morerias in Monterrey, which is hometo some of the world's finest horses, including Andalusian andLusitano world-class champions.   But over time, Morales determined that it would be impossible tomanage the facility as he does his Mexican ranch, so he is preparingto sell Peninsula Farm at auction Wednesday, Dec. 12, with J.P.

With its 132 stalls, a covered arena, a 5/8 mile race track andfacilities for breeding horses for race and show alike, the pieces arein place for the next owner, according to Craig King, president ofJ.P.

"We will sell the farm in five parcels ranging from approximately11 acres to a little over 60 acres. Four of the parcels have barns,and three have homes, so you could have three or four differentsmaller farms," said King.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to early afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little
changed in a choppy session on Thursday as a pullback in
financial shares and lingering worries about the economy offset
a rise in energy shares, including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disappointing retail profits and caution before a speech by
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later on Thursday also
kept a lid on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Wall Street coming off its biggest two-day advance in
five years, some investors opted to sell some of the winners
from the recent rebound, such as banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon rose 1.1 percent to $88.78 on the New York Stock
Exchange, as U.S. crude for January delivery CLc1 gained 57
cents at $91.13 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil rose after an explosion at a pipeline supplying
Canadian crude to U.S. Midwest refineries on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Considering the move that took place in just a few days,
the move today is just a pause," said James Rosenthal, head
trader at Punk Ziegel  Company in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With a weaker economy, the Fed has pretty much telegraphed
that it will probably lower interest rates on Dec. 11. Lower
interest rates will make a lot of the financial institutions
more comfortable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 9.43
points, or 0.07 percent, at 13,280.02. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX was down 3.66 points, or 0.25 percent, at
1,465.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 4.55
points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,658.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of ConocoPhillips (COP.N) rose 1.4 percent to
$78.87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Altria Inc (MO.N), parent of cigarette maker Phillip
Morris, was another notable Dow gainer, up 1.7 percent at
$75.34. The stock is among shares favored by investors in a
slowing economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But financial shares headed lower after a two-day surge,
with shares of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the No. 2 U.S.
bank, down 1.5 percent at $44.17 on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of American Express (AXP.N) were among the Dow's top
drags, down 1.5 percent at $56.55. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
LEH.N declined 4.4 percent to $62.01 on the NYSE after CIBC
World Markets analyst Meredith Whitney cut her price target and
profit estimates for the investment bank. For details, see
[ID:nBNG134373].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retailers were led lower by Sears Holdings (SHLD.O), which
reported sharply lower earnings. Other big retailers falling
included department store operator Macy's Inc (M.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sears stock was down 13.7 percent at $100.48, while Macy's
was down 1.9 percent at $29.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Softer-than-expected new-home sales and a surge in new
claims for jobless benefits reported on Thursday heightened
fears of a steep U.S. economic slide and overshadowed a strong
third-quarter performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernanke is due to deliver a speech on the U.S. national
and regional economic overview to the Charlotte, North
Carolina, Chamber of Commerce at 6:45 p.m. New York time (2345
GMT).

The above estimates do not take into accountcertain adjustments yet to be made in relation to performance fee calculationsfollowing a repurchase of the Company's stock.2.

Notes on Estimated ValuationCertain securities or other assets in which the Advisors invest may not have areadily ascertainable market price or may otherwise be difficult to value andwill be priced by the Advisors.The Company may not have received valuations (or estimated valuations) fromAdvisors on a timely or current basis, and may not have received valuations atall. In order to arrive at the net asset value, the Company will generally usethe latest available valuations (or estimated valuations) provided, directly orindirectly, by the Advisors.

In certain circumstances as set out in the Company'sprospectus, including if the Investment Manager determines, in its solediscretion, that a valuation is inaccurate or incomplete, the Investment Managermay, in its sole discretion, determine the fair value of the Company's interestsindependently of the Advisor's valuations based on information available to, andfactors deemed relevant (at its sole discretion) by, the Investment Manager atthe time of such valuation.  As stated in the prospectus, no reliance should beplaced on any weekly valuations.Other risk factors which may be relevant to this estimated valuation are set outin the Company's prospectus dated 7 July 2006.As a result of these factors, the actual value of the Company's assets may bematerially different from this published estimated value.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 29 (Reuters) - Investors should sell gold in
2008 to take advantage of falling prices as the dollar steadies,
Goldman Sachs said on Thursday, naming the strategy as one of
its top 10 tips for next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank expects an easing of the fears that have paralysed
credit markets. It also sees the dollar trading more steadily
than it has this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These trends would lessen the "safe haven" appeal of the
precious metal, which this year has helped gold to its highest
in almost three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would now use a short exposure in gold, expressed in US
Dollars, to capitalize on a gradual relaxation of credit
concerns in the financial sector over the coming months, and as
an avenue to benefit from the prospect of a stabilization in the
US Dollar," Goldman Sachs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A U.S. central bank campaign of bringing down interest rates
would lower the chances of recession, Goldman said in a report
listing trades it recommends for the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have this year seen gold as a sensible way to
invest money on the grounds that the precious metal retains and
often appreciates in value in economically and politically
turbulent times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has been one of the strongest-performing assets in
financial markets in 2007, as the dollar has plumbed historic
lows against other currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the spot market, gold XAU= touched a 28-year peak of
$845.40 per ounce earlier this month, and year-to-date gains are
more than 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By contrast, in equity markets the MSCI World Index
.MSCIW0 is up 7 percent, and the FTSE all-share index .FTAS
is down less than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Daniel Magnowski, editing by Michael Roddy)

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 29 (MARKET WIRE) --  IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that its recently introduced E7100 BalancedWarehouse(TM), consisting of the IBM POWER6(TM) processor-based System p(TM)570 server, the IBM System Storage(TM)  DS4800 and DB2(R) Warehouse 9.5, isalready lapping the field in performance.  The new data warehousing solution isnow ranked number one in both performance and in price/performance in theTPC-H business Intelligence performance benchmark (1), outshining HP and Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--  2 x speed-up over HP system with Oracle 10g and equal number of cores;--  2 x speed-up over HP system with Oracle 10g and equal number of cores;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--  3.17 x speed up over Sun with Oracle 10g and 38 percent price--  3.17 x speed up over Sun with Oracle 10g and 38 percent price&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    advantage; (3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--  A new world record by loading 10 terabytes (TB) data at six TB per--  A new world record by loading 10 terabytes (TB) data at six TB per&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    hour. (4)"These latest benchmark results further prove IBM's strength andleadershipin the business intelligence arena," said Scott Handy, vice presidentofmarketing and strategy, IBM Power Systems. "The E7100 Balanced Warehouseisa complete data warehousing solution comprised of pre-tested, scalable andfully integrated system and storage components, designed to get customers up andrunning quickly to get to the real benefit of unprecedented business insight andintellect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With expanded solutions optimized to meet the entire spectrum of warehousingrequirements, IBM recently added the E7100 Balanced Warehouse to its E-Classportfolio, which is optimized for large scale enterprise data warehouses. TheE7100Balanced Warehouse exploits POWER6 technology in System p on AIX(R), IBM'sUNIX(R) operating system, along with IBM System Storage DS4800 and DB2Warehouse. This offering can accommodate higher levels of concurrency as well assignificant fluctuations in workload, providing ultimate scalability andperformance for the most demanding enterprise data warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM has done the hard work for customers by creating a base data warehousemodulethat has balanced price/performance with the appropriate amount of CPU coresand memory for 2 terabytes (TB) of storage -- nothing more or less than isneeded for each. Then IBM created higher performing 2TB data server modulesand other optional modules that can easily be added to snap together largerdata warehouses that are also balanced in performance with the appropriateCPU, memory and storage. One base module with 24 2TB add-on data server modulescan easily be configured, ordered and installed to create a 50TB balancedwarehouse. Customers working with IBM have built balanced data warehouses ofover 300TB or more using these pre-tested, building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    DB2 Warehouse 9.5 breaks new ground in business intelligence, deliveringanindustry-first combination of advanced, embedded analytics and highperformance that enables organizations to gain greater value from theirinformation that was previously unavailable from conventional data warehouseproducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    About TPC-H&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC), a not-for-profitorganization, wasfounded to define transaction processing and database performance benchmarks,suchas the TPC-C, TPC-H, and TPC-W benchmarks, and to disseminate objectiveperformance data based on these benchmarks. TPC benchmarks have extremelystringent requirements, including both reliability and durability tests, andmust undergo an independent audit. Council members include most major databasevendors and suppliers of server hardware systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The TPC benchmark(TM)H (TPC-H) is a decision support benchmark. Itconsistsof a suite of business oriented ad-hoc queries and concurrent datamodifications. The queries and the data populating the database have beenchosen to have broad industry-wide relevance. This benchmark illustratesdecisionsupport systems that examine large volumes of data, execute queries with a highdegree of complexity, and give answers to critical business questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The performance metric reported by TPC-H is called the TPC-H CompositeQuery-per-Hour Performance Metric (QphH@Size), and reflects multiple aspects ofthe capability of the system to process queries. These aspects include theselected database size against which the queries are executed, the queryprocessingpower when queries are submitted by a single stream, and the query throughputwhen queries are submitted by multiple concurrent users. The TPC-HPrice/Performancemetric is expressed as $/QphH@Size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    About IBM System p servers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Renowned for their computing power, IBM System p servers support userneedsacross a broad range of applications, including transaction processing,webpublishing, data mining, systems management and others. This family of1-to64-core IBM Power processor-based systems is designed to provide customerswithfeatures for high performance, scalability and dynamic resource allocation,together with leadership features designed for high availability. Unique IBMvirtualization features allow users to process more information on a singleserver, creating the potential to save on total cost of system ownership, aswell as space and energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    System p products are designed for smaller and mid-sized business andlargeenterprises that are using UNIX platforms. The servers support both theAIXand  Linux(R) operating systems.  Migration services enable customers toquickly and easily convert from competing platforms -- such as SunMicrosystems and Hewlett-Packard -- to IBM hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    System p servers are powered by IBM's leadership technology, including forcertain systems the POWER6 microprocessor, the world's fastest chip, builtusing IBM's state-of-the-art 65 nanometer process technology. At 4.7GHz, thedual-core POWER6 processor doubles the speed of the previous generation POWER5whileusing nearly the same amount of electricity to run and cool it, meaningcustomers can use the new processor to either increase their performance by 100percent or cut their power consumption virtually in half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For more information on IBM System p servers and offerings, please visithttp://www.ibm.com/systems/p/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    About DB2 Warehouse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM DB2 Warehouse 9.5 -- based on the DB2 9 "Viper" data server -- is thefoundation of IBM's dynamic warehousing initiative, and includes a unique set offeatures and capabilities that support growing customer demand for analyticsand Information on Demand.  DB2 Warehouse provides data movement andtransformation capabilities to reduce the complexity and lower the coststypically associated with loading data into the warehouse and preparing thatdata so that it can be leveraged more effectively. It also offers performanceoptimization capabilities that enable the warehouse to address broadenterprise warehousing requirements, such as advanced data partitioning andworkload management to ensure that the most critical applications are servicedaccordingly. Additionally, DB2 Warehouse takes advantage of Viper's deepcompression technology to increase performance and efficiency, while reducingstoragecosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    About IBM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For more information, please visit www.ibm.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM is a trademark of IBM Corporation in the United States and/or othercountries.

Technology hasplayed a major role at Crutchfield since the company launched thefirst vendor-authorized audio/video Internet shopping destination.Today, a 14-person IT infrastructure team oversees 120 Microsoftservers running Windows 2003, SQL Server 2005, Exchange 2003 andSharePoint Portal Server 2007. The company also supports a growingstorage environment comprising EMC SANs and 8 terabytes of storagethat continues to increase by approximately 15 percent each year.   After a storage growth spurt overtaxed the company's existingbackup and recovery foundation, Crutchfield decided to deploybest-of-class disk-to-disk-to-tape hardware and more robust dataprotection software. The evaluation of competing software alternativescoincided with a deployment of Microsoft SharePoint, which addeditem-level recovery of SharePoint files to its top selection criteria.As one of the first vendors to support this level of granular backupand recovery for SharePoint, CommVault was selected over SymantecVeritas NetBackup and EMC Networker, both of which would have requiredCrutchfield to rebuild an entire SharePoint system offline from tapefor restores. In contrast, CommVault's first SharePoint recovery tookless than an hour.   According to Steve Weiskircher, vice president of informationtechnology for Crutchfield, CommVault's seamless SharePoint supporthas expedited upgrades to newer releases, optimized overall datamanagement and reduced administrative overhead substantially."CommVault is our corporate standard for backup and recovery," hesays. "It gives us great peace of mind knowing they are in lock-stepwith Microsoft while continuing to keep pace with the latesttechnology advancements to give Crutchfield unprecedented levels ofdata protection."   Crutchfield has taken advantage of CommVault's multi-streamingcapability to reduce backup times from 48 hours to about five hours,enabling the IT team to incorporate less-critical data and stillachieve significant reductions in daily backups. Major improvements onrestores also were achieved as the time to recover data shrank fromseveral hours to about 30 minutes. In addition to SharePoint,item-level recovery of Exchange files provides fast restores of fullmailboxes, individual items and extended Outlook information, such ascontacts, calendars and tasks.   Crutchfield also leverages CommVault's on-the-fly tape encryptionto ensure complete compliance with Payment Card Industry (PCI)regulations while its "set it and forget it" operation andsystem-state backup feature have virtually eliminated administrativeoverhead. As a result, the company has freed resources to focus onmore strategic technology initiatives, including a recently completedSharePoint 2007 upgrade as well as a planned migration to Exchange2007.   CommVault's proven Microsoft prowess extends to SQL Server, whichCrutchfield is considering as part of a singular approach to datamanagement. Additionally, Crutchfield is reviewing the technologyadvances of CommVault's latest Simpana software suite, especially itsenterprise-wide search and discovery feature for strengtheningcompliance, auditing and archival capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the AnalystBlog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latestnews and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocksrecently featured in the blog include: Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS),Syngenta AG (NYSE: SYT), The Mitsui Group (Nasdaq: MITSY) and KB Home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(NYSE: KBH).   See the latest posts to the Analyst Blog by visiting:http://at.zacks.com/?id=2673   Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:   Zacks Rank Upgrades   Another morning for the bulls on Wall Street has generally treatedthe following stocks kindly, all of which get boosts to their ZacksRank as of the opening bell today:   Good as Goldman   Top global investment banker Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) has justbeen upgraded from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)today. With the new announcement of an excellent bonus pay-out toGoldman employees expected for the end of this year, it's clear goodtimes have not run dry for the Wall Street giant.   The consensus six-month EPS estimate for Goldman Sachs shares iscurrently $242.17, but according to Zacks' calculations, we'reexpecting the share price to hit $248.90. Currently, the shares areexperiencing a pop this morning, as its bonus expectation meets asecond-straight bull market. Goldman is up $11.30 thus far, whichamounts to a 5.3% gain in share price.   Syngenta's Fields of Green   Global agribusiness giant Syngenta AG (NYSE: SYT) -- among theworld leaders in commercial seed supply and crop protection -- iscurrently getting a favorable nod from brokers, as its Zacks Rankrises from a #2 (Buy) to a #1 (Strong Buy). With extra attention beingpaid these days to food quality and ethanol energy expansion, theSwiss-based company appears to be firing on all cylinders.   Here's what Zacks senior European markets analyst SantiagoBurgaleta, CFA had to say in his latest report on the company: "Weremain buyers of Syngenta...The depth of its product mix, robustbusiness model, and highly regarded management team support ourpositive view on the stock." SYT shares are up about $1 this morning,or roughly 2%.   Upgrade &amp; Pullback for Mitsui   Though shares of Japanese media conglomerate The Mitsui Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Nasdaq: MITSY) were just today upgraded to a Zacks Rank of #1, itsshares are trading down, possibly on mixed views today of Asianmarkets in general. Its share price has fallen about 2.7%, or $11.85,in what has in most cases been a very favorable market this morning.   The Mitsui Group is a global empire comprising more than 860subsidiaries and associated companies. It has operations in chemicals,foodstuffs, general merchandise, iron and steel, machinery, nonferrousmetals, textiles, energy, and real estate and service industries.   KB Home Hits Firm Ground   After what can only be described as a disastrous August quarterearnings report, brokers have doubtless begun to get a bit morehopeful regarding the outlook of KB Home (NYSE: KBH), the large-capdomestic home builder. Though the market has proven unkind for thesingle-family residence developer of late, the Zacks Rank for thecompany has gone up from a #5 (Strong Sell) to a #3 (Hold).   Shares of KBH are up four-and-a-quarter percent thus far today,trading at around $19.75 per share. KB Home is a builder ofsingle-family homes with domestic operations in several Westernstates. Domestically, the company builds innovatively designed homeswhich cater primarily to first-time homebuyers, generally inmedium-sized developments close to major metropolitan areas.Internationally, the company also builds commercial projects and highdensity residential properties such as condominium complexes.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--Zacks.com releases the latest Analyst Interview. Today's interviewis with senior analyst Abdul Saleh, who discusses Cognos (Nasdaq:COGN), IBM (NYSE: IBM), Epicor (Nasdaq: EPIC) and Intuit (Nasdaq:INTU).   A synopsis of today's Analyst Interview is presented below. Thefull article can be read at www.zacks.com.   What top Buy recommendations do you have for us today?   We have, currently, of the 12 companies I cover in (the software)group, I have a Buy on only one company, which is Cognos (Nasdaq:COGN). Now, IBM (NYSE: IBM) has just pledged to buy the company forabout $5 billion or so. The stock has performed phenomenally well. Ithas gone up about 39.2% for the time period (between) November 2006and November 2007.   Aside from that, although we have a Hold rating on the rest of thestocks in the group, the two companies that I keep a close eye on areEpicor (Nasdaq: EPIC) and Intuit (Nasdaq: INTU), for two differentreasons altogether. Epicor basically is mostly based on valuation.It's a cheap valuation stock, and if you look at this sector you'llsee a preponderance of M valuations. And M valuations imply, forthis particular year, a floor of about 2.5x, which is enterprise value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(EV)-to-sales, and a takeover value of about 3-4x. Epicor is tradingat a discount, at 2.2x, so on this stock we currently have a targetprice of $15, but that could change in a hurry.   The other stock I'm keeping an eye on is Intuit, and that'scompany-specific. One of the biggest products they have coming into2008 is TurboTax, which is very important for filing during taxseason. And they have phenomenal returns on this particular product interms of margin and revenue growth for April, getting into thatparticular quarter.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 30 (MARKET WIRE) --  IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced an expansion of its WebSphere Portalsoftware portfolio with the availability of two additional business-readypackages -- called accelerators -- that can be easily added to a customer'sportal to drive online training projects and automate key business processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    These two new accelerators provide training, development and educationprojectsthrough an IBM Lotus Sametime Web conference -- and also make it easier forcustomers to automate core business processes with easy entry and integrationof data and electronic forms across numerous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The two accelerators add to the collection that IBM has releasedincrementallysince April. These include: IBM Self-Service Accelerator for human resourcestasks, IBM Dashboard Accelerator, IBM Collaboration Accelerator for teamcollaboration,IBM Content Accelerator for building and managing websites, and IBM EnterpriseSuite Accelerator which supports multiple portal projects, including Web contentmanagement and electronic forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "IBM continues to see significant momentum from accelerators as customersareshowing ever-growing interest in using accelerators to help speed the time tovalue for portal-based business solutions. With these two new accelerators,customers have a full range of choice to implement projects quickly andcost-effectively, adding value to their portal investments," said Larry Bowden,VicePresident of Portals and Interaction Services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM Learning Accelerator enables customers to provide personalized onlinetraining within the context of employees' ongoing activities.Highlightsinclude:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--  Optimization for WebSphere Portal 6 including unified administration,--  Optimization for WebSphere Portal 6 including unified administration,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    personalization, and performance benefits. The user interface is fully&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    integrated within the Portal environment to lower administrative overhead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    and provide key tasks in one location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--  Improvements to key learning administrative tasks, such as managing--  Improvements to key learning administrative tasks, such as managing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    results, enrollment and course uploads. Learning administrators now get a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    quick view and links to key learning responsibilities -- helping them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    identify the critical tasks and their status. Quick links give easy access&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    to commonly performed tasks to manage courses, curriculums, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--  Distributed content deployment options that offer response time--  Distributed content deployment options that offer response time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    improvements by placing content geographically closer to students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--  Critical learning data can be updated in bulk allowing learning--  Critical learning data can be updated in bulk allowing learning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    administrators to more efficiently handle large learning initiatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--  Support for software license migration and learning data migration--  Support for software license migration and learning data migration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    from previous Lotus eLearning solutions, including Workplace Collaborative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Learning and Learning Management System.IBM Learning Accelerator is also integrated with IBM Lotus Quickr andLotusSametime Web Conferencing, providing the ability to deliver long-distancetraining,share multiple content types, and collaborate on documents from a central,shared repository without tying up email resources.  Integration with LotusSametimeWeb Conferencing gives the learning admin the ability to schedule and driveenrollment of training web conferences from within the learning accelerator. Theaddition of Lotus Quickr capabilities in this software provides students andinstructors a place to collaborate on learning topics to enhance the overalllearning experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM Business Process Accelerator is designed to simplify and improve theadoption of business processes by using the role-based, personalized userinterface of WebSphere Portal to improve both implementation and end userresponse time for the entire range of processes, i.e.: document centric, humancentric and system centric processes. Users can more efficiently completeworkflowtasks when they have role-based, personalized access through a portal to all theinformation, applications and data necessary to complete their assigned task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This accelerator helps integrate siloed applications and processes throughout-of-the-box integration.  The IBM Business Process Accelerator consists ofmarket-leading IBM WebSphere Portal Server and IBM Lotus Forms Server. Users caneasily view and act on workflow tasks assigned to them in IBM WebSpherePortal through the My Tasks portlet. The IBM Lotus Forms Server enablespixel-perfect rendering of electronic forms in the portal user interface.Then, eForms, portlets and workflows can be quickly customized and easilyintegratedwith back end systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This offering enhances and complements the other offerings from IBM, such asWebSphere Business Modeler, IBM FileNet Business Process Manager andWebSphere Process Server. What's more, IBM Business Process Accelerator enableselectronic forms and workflows to run in personalized business mashups thatprovide an aggregated view of information and tasks based upon the user's roleand stage of the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Customers across numerous industries including government, banking andinsurance can benefit from this new accelerator package which streamlinesintegrationof data with WebSphere Portal and other existing back end systems from IBM aswell as with independent software vendors such as SAP and Siebel. Byautomating core business processes with electronic forms run in personalizedbusiness mashups, customers can help improve response times by rapidly buildingand deploying customer and partner facing workflows in WebSphere Portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cardiff University in the UK plans to use key components of IBM BusinessProcessAccelerator: Lotus Forms, WebSphere Portal and WebSphere Process Server as apartof an overall plan to create a collaborative environment for students,researchers,staff and partner organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With IBM's help, the University's Information Services Directorate iscreating a personalized environment whereby through a single sign-on anindividual has access to all the resources they need to perform theirrole.For example, a student will have access to personalized areas such asfiles,timetables, bookmarks, school notices, Cardiff email, Forums, study-groups anddiscussions, school software, and course fee payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We will use a combination of WebSphere Portal, WebSphere Process Server andLotus Forms software to help streamline our business processes with electronicforms and role-based portal applications. This implementation will enable us tomovetowards streamlined administrative processes, either directly or throughpre-reqs, we can now model, orchestrate, deploy and participate in thebusiness processes. We have the flexibility of choice to plug-in processengines from WebSphere, FileNet or third parties to run these processes,"said Simon Bradford of Cardiff University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cost and availability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Customers can purchase individual accelerators and snap them onto theirexisting WebSphere Portal environment, or they can purchase the entire solutiontogether with WebSphere Portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Learning Accelerator is available now for $36 per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The IBM Business Process Accelerator consists of IBM WebSphere Portal ServerandIBM Lotus Forms Server.  Those products are available now at $515 per valueunit and $400 per value unit, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    *IBM, Lotus, Quickr, Sametime and WebSphere are trademarks of IBMCorporationin the United States, other countries, or both.

&lt;p&gt; (New throughout, adds bylines)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Nicole Maestri and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 30 (Reuters) - Discount retailer TJX Cos
(TJX.N) said on Friday it agreed to a settlement with Visa Inc
and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) under which it will pay up to
$40.9 million related to a security breach that put millions of
shoppers' credit card data at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parent of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls clothing chains
said the pre-tax payout will go to eligible U.S. Visa issuers
that issued cards potentially affected by computer breaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa, meanwhile, agreed to suspend or rescind various fines
it had imposed against Fifth Third, TJX's card processor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TJX, based in Framingham, Massachusetts, on March 29
disclosed that hackers had stolen data from about 45.7 million
credit and debit cards from July 2005 through January 2007,
covering transactions dating as far back as December 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The theft is one of the world's largest reported security
data breaches, based on the number of affected accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Chief Executive Carol Meyrowitz and Fifth Third
spokeswoman Stephanie Honan in separate statements said the
settlement constituted a fair recovery to eligible issuers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ellen Richey, Visa's head of global risk management, in a
statement said card issuers that join the settlement will get
"immediate recovery on their data breach claims." Visa is based
in San Francisco, and Fifth Third in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TJX said the settlement cost is already reflected in a $118
million second-quarter charge it took for data breaches. It
said issuers with at least 80 percent of the eligible accounts
must agree to the settlement by Dec. 19 for it to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company disclosed the settlement in a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September, TJX agreed to settle related class-action
lawsuits brought on behalf of customers in the United States,
Puerto Rico and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, U.S. District Judge William Young, who sits in
Boston, ruled that banks suing TJX and Fifth Third cannot
pursue their claims in a class-action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He wrote that he had "serious doubts" that the class was
properly defined, and that it would often not be obvious
whether a bank's injuries stemmed from data breaches or
unrelated fraud. The judge also said there were too many
"individual questions touching on fundamental issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fifth Third's Honan said the bank was "certainly pleased"
with the decision. Banks remain free to pursue their claims
separately, but likely at higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In late morning trading, TJX shares rose $1.07, or 3.8
percent, to $29.15 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Fifth
Third rose $1.02, or 3.6 percent, to $29.66 on the Nasdaq.

Calculation of Net Asset ValueThis valuation of the Company's net asset value, which has been prepared in goodfaith by the Company's administrator, is for information only.  Save as setforth below, it is determined based upon the latest available valuations (orestimated valuations) provided, directly or indirectly, by the investmentmanagers ("Advisors") selected by the Company's investment manager (the "Investment Manager").2.  Calculation of Performance DataSet out above are the estimated week to date ("WTD"), final month to date&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;("MTD") and final calendar year to date ("YTD") performance figures. The WTDperformance figure is calculated by reference to the previously publishedestimated NAV. The MTD performance figure is calculated by reference to theprevious month's estimated NAV as published or, if published, the previousmonth's final NAV. The YTD performance figure is calculated by reference to theNAV at the end of the last calendar year.3.  ERISAThe articles of association of the Company prohibit any purchase or acquisitionof shares by or on behalf of or for the benefit of an ERISA plan or benefit planinvestor subject to similar laws (a "Plan Investor"), and incorporate provisionswhereby purported purchases of shares by or on behalf of or for the benefit ofan ERISA plan or Plan Investor will not operate to confer any interest or rightswhatsoever in such shares in favour of an ERISA plan or Plan Investor, butinstead will take effect as a trust for redemption in favour of the Company andthe Company will subsequently purchase or redeem such shares, which purchase orredemption may take place at an amount per share which is less than the pricepaid by an ERISA plan or Plan Investor on the purported acquisition.4.  For the Attention of United States ResidentsThe shares may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for theaccount or benefit of, US Persons (as defined in the Regulation S under theSecurities Act of 1933 or any person who would be considered a US person underRule 4.7 of the United States Commodity Exchange Act).5.  Investment PolicyIn seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Company will (directly orindirectly) allocate its assets to a relatively concentrated portfolio ofAdvisors (or entities managed by them) selected by the Investment Manager. It isexpected that such Advisors will employ a broad range of alternative investmentstrategies, which will include both core strategies (i.e., event driven,tactical trading, equity long/short and relative value strategies) as well asother niche strategies. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieveits investment objective or that it will be able to implement its investmentpolicy, or that the portfolio design, risk monitoring and hedging strategies ofthe Company will be successful.6.  Notes on ValuationCertain securities or other assets in which the Advisors invest may not have areadily ascertainable market price or may otherwise be difficult to value andwill be priced by the Advisors.The Company may not have received valuations (or estimated valuations) fromAdvisors on a timely or current basis, and may not have received valuations atall. In order to arrive at the net asset value, the Company will generally usethe latest available valuations (or estimated valuations) provided, directly orindirectly, by the Advisors.  Valuations (or estimated valuations) received bythe Company may be unaudited or may be subject to little verification or otherdue diligence and may not comply with generally accepted accounting practices orother valuation principles.In addition, neither the Company's administrator nor the Investment Manager willgenerally have sufficient information to be able to independently confirm orreview the completeness, genuineness or accuracy of the Advisors' valuations (orestimated valuations).  In certain circumstances as set out in the Company'sprospectus, including if the Investment Manager determines, in its solediscretion, that a valuation is inaccurate or incomplete, the Investment Managermay, in its sole discretion, determine the fair value of the Company's interestsindependently of the Advisor's valuations based on information available to, andfactors deemed relevant (at its sole discretion) by, the Investment Manager atthe time of such valuation.Other risk factors which may be relevant to this valuation are set out in theCompany's prospectus dated 7 July 2006.As a result of these factors, the actual value of the Company's assets may bematerially different from this published value.  In the event that a valuationsubsequently proves to be incorrect, no adjustment to a previously publishedvaluation is expected to be made nor would compensation be payable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;                      This information is provided by RNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            The company news service from the London Stock ExchangeENDNAVOKKKKABDDADN

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Visa Issuers Eligible to Participate in Speedy, AlternativeRecovery ProgramSAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--Visa Inc. announced today it has negotiated an agreement with TheTJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) and its U.S. acquirer to offer analternative recovery program to U.S. issuers that may have beenaffected by the retailer's previously announced unauthorized computerintrusion(s). The retailer will pay up to $40.9 million to fund theprogram, which requires a certain level of participation by issuersfor the offer to be finalized. Visa is supporting the program andpresenting the optional offering to eligible issuers.   "We believe issuers will benefit greatly by participating in thisprogram because it offers immediate recovery on their data breachclaims," said Ellen Richey, head of global risk management for VisaInc. "This agreement demonstrates the importance of retailers and thepayment card industry working together to protect cardholder data.Additionally, it's clear the impact of a data compromise harms allpayment system stakeholders -- merchants, banks and consumers alike.We hope one outcome of this resolution is recognition that a greaterinvestment in security is good business."   The agreement, which is contingent upon acceptance by financialinstitutions representing 80 percent of the eligible U.S. Visaaccounts affected by the data compromise, also includes mutualreleases by TJX, its U.S. acquirer and Visa related to the retailer'sdata compromise. All U.S. Visa card issuers that experiencedcounterfeit fraud losses on accounts that were used at TJX's U.S.stores during certain time periods identified by Visa or that hadoperational expenses related to the accounts involved in the TJXbreach and flagged by Visa will be eligible to receive some financialrecovery this calendar year if they participate in the optionalprogram. Participation in the optional alternative recovery supplantsany other recoveries that may be available to U.S. issuers andrequires accepting issuers to release TJX and its U.S. acquirers fromlegal and financial liability. The recovery program does not coverVisa card transactions involving accounts of non-U.S. issuers or Visacard transactions involved in the computer intrusion that wereacquired by non-U.S. acquirers.   Additionally, Visa will suspend and rescind a portion of the databreach fines it levied on the retailer's U.S. acquirer that remaineligible for appeal in accordance with Visa rules. Visa and TJX agreedto the suspended and rescinded fines in part because it would increasethe funds available in the alternative recovery program.   Visa will be notifying all eligible issuers in the coming dayswith details about the optional settlement and how to participate. Inorder to facilitate payment in December, eligible issuers will haveapproximately 10 business days from the date of the communication toopt-in to the program before it expires.   Helping financial institutions reduce data compromise relatedcosts after a data compromise has been a long-standing component ofVisa's comprehensive security strategy as is preventing fraud,innovating new security technologies and driving PCI DSS complianceamong U.S. merchants. Visa launched a streamlined recovery program inOctober 2006 called Account Data Compromise Recovery (ADCR)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(http://corporate.visa.com/md/nr/press631.jsp) that provides automaticreimbursement to U.S. issuers for incremental counterfeit fraud lossesfrom the theft of improperly stored card information. ADCR was animprovement over the industry's traditional compliance recoveryprocess, which placed an administrative burden on financialinstitutions. It is expected that financial institutions will receivegreater reimbursement by opting into the TJX settlement than theywould have received under the traditional or ADCR programs.   Additionally, Visa has led the industry in driving merchantcompliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCIDSS). In less than 18 months, Visa has been able to drive complianceamong the largest U.S. merchants from about 12 percent in March 2006to 66 percent in October 2007 through a multi-tiered strategy offines, incentives and education.   "We've made steady progress in accelerating merchant compliancewith PCI standards to protect cardholder information and reduce thecost and impact of fraud," remarked Richey. "Security is a sharedresponsibility and this progress demonstrates that many of the largestparticipants in the system understand their role and responsibilityfor protecting this information."   Visa was the first payments brand to focus compliance effortsagainst the harmful practice of storing sensitive data. As of today,Visa has verified that 99 percent of Level 1 and 2 U.S. merchants arenot storing prohibited account data such as magnetic stripe (alsoknown as track data), CVV2 (the security code on the back of the card)and PIN data and has been working with the remaining handful ofoutstanding merchants to eliminate this practice.   Visa has also been actively encouraging smaller merchants tobecome compliant with the PCI DSS. In May 2007, Visa announcedrequirements for U.S. acquirers to identify security risks among theirsmall merchant customers and developed an educational program to raisetheir awareness and understanding of the PCI DSS. Since Visa announcedthe requirement, 100 percent of active U.S. acquirers have submittedplans to Visa.   Education is a critical component of increasing merchantcompliance with the PCI DSS. Visa's online education center atwww.visa.com/cisp offers a series of webinars and security alerts thatwill help a merchant better understand the PCI DSS and the validationrequirements.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Nov 30 (MARKET WIRE) --  Gartner Data Center Conference -- IBM (NYSE: IBM), Sun Microsystems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(NASDAQ: JAVA) and Sine Nomine Associates showcased a milestone demonstration onWednesday at Gartner's Data Center Conference, showing the OpenSolaris(TM) codebaserunning on an IBM mainframe, illustrating the Solaris(TM) Operating System (OS)andthe mainframe's powerful ability to virtualize the data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Complementing this news, IBM also endorsed Sun's xVM initiative. IBM and Sunbelieve in an open, comprehensive virtualization and management platform thatincreases customer value and choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Today's news demonstrates important progress for Solaris compatibilitybetween IBM andSun, since the companies announced in August that IBM was expanding supportfor the Solaris OS. To see the complete press announcement from Aug. 16, 2007,visit http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2007-08/sunflash.20070816.1.xml&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Momentum surrounding Sun's Solaris Operating System and Sun xVMvirtualization continues to grow, and we're thrilled to be able to reach newcustomers and market opportunities alongside IBM," said Rich Green, executivevice president, Software, Sun Microsystems. "Broadening our collaborationwith IBM expands the reach of Solaris and Sun xVM to the mainframemarketplace, and brings the benefit of open source operating systems and opensource virtualization to the highest scale datacenters in the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    OpenSolaris on System z Mainframe Demonstrated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this week, IBM, Sun Microsystems and Sine Nomine Associatesdemonstrated forthe first time ever, the OpenSolaris code base running on an IBM mainframe.The demonstration for customers, Gartner analysts and press follows SineNomine's announcement last year of an independent project to do the port andAugust'sannouncement that IBM and Sun would investigate a project to port OpenSolaristo the System z mainframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Building on the innovation, flexibility, and product improvementshappeningwithin the OpenSolaris community, this demonstration is an example of aport of this flexible open source operating system to run on yet anotherarchitecture. The work is being undertaken by Sine Nomine Associates, aresearch and engineering firm based in Ashburn, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The future of the data center lies in virtualization's ability to reduceskyrocketing energy and maintenance costs," said James Stallings, generalmanager, IBM System z. "Corporations around the world have for yearsreliedon the IBM mainframe -- which pioneered virtualization -- to run theirbusinesses. The Solaris Operating System is similarly prevalent in datacenters. It makes perfect sense to marry these two stalwarts in avirtualized mainframe environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    David Boyes, president and chief technologist at Sine Nomine, commented,"For SineNomine, the ability to add Solaris to the menu of options for massive-scalevirtualization on multiple platforms formed an almost irresistible challenge. Wehad to apply learnings from our work on the original Linux enablement on themainframe to other shared resource environments. We also needed to cooperateclosely with IBM and Sun to ensure that we preserved the best parts of bothenvironments and the skills that enterprises have built around Solaris. We arevery pleased to be a partner in this cooperative effort. This is astrategic step for all three companies to present an even more compellingargument to enable production scale virtualization across the enterprise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the demonstration, OpenSolaris runs within the mainframe's z/VM, theindustry's most powerful virtualization technology. z/VM enables more than1,000 virtual images on a single hypervisor -- allowing customers to furtheroptimize their infrastructures. The Solaris Operating System offers a powerfulfeature set, including Solaris ZFS, and Solaris Dynamic Tracing (DTrace) to helpcustomers improve uptime, cut costs and speed time to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    z/VM already provides the foundation for running Linux on the mainframe.Inrecent years, many mainframe customers have selected Linux for a varietyofnew workloads, such as Web serving and virtual worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Unique among servers, the mainframe was designed from the beginning toincorporate processors that handle a variety of specialized tasks. Forexample, so-called "specialty processors" are designed for processing eligibleLinux, Java(TM) software and data workloads as well as encrypting and decryptingcertain data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For more information about OpenSolaris, visit http://www.opensolaris.org andfor Sun'svirtualization offerings, Sun xVM, visit http://www.sun.com/xvm. Sun has alsoannounced that it will release the source code used to build Sun xVM OpsCenter, a highly scalable datacenter automation tool, under the General PublicLicense version 3 (GPLv3).

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Nov 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's
biggest drug maker, wants to expand its research and development
activities in Asia, targeting China, India, Japan, and South
Korea, an executive said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, who makes blockbuster anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor
and the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, opened a research
centre in Shanghai in 2005 and aims to expand clinical research
activities globally, with nearly 80 studies ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin Mackay, the company's president of global research and
development, said Asia was key to the company because its
pharmaceutical market would grow to US$200 billion by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "China is going to be really important to us, the Shanghai
centre is going to be exceptionally important," Mackay told
Reuters on the sidelines of an investors' meeting in Hong Kong.
"We are looking at Korea, India and other countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mackay gave no further details of the expansion plans, but
said he was impressed with the progress made by Pfizer's
 Shanghai RD centre since it opened two years ago. The centre
has about 200 staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have grown very quickly in Shanghai," Mackay said, adding
contributions to revenue from the Chinese market were small but
expected to grow fast.
  The drug maker has announced a US$300 million investment in
research and development in South Korea over the next five years
to develop drugs and medical technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which claims to rank first in Asia pharmaceutical
market sales for the 12 months to June 2007, has a manufacturing
plant in the Chinese city of Dalian and collaborates on research
with Peking University and Tsinghua University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company announced a sharp fall in third-quarter earnings
due to a US$2.8 billion charge to end its involvement with the
poorly selling inhaled insulin drug Exubera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer forecasts its revenue will hit US$47.5-US$48 billion
in 2007 and will expand slightly to US$46.5-US$48.5 billion in
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which spent US$7.6 billion on RD in 2006, says it is
facing challenges from unprecedented patent expirations,
competition from generic drugs.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Nov 30 (Reuters) - Major drug makers AstraZeneca Plc
(AZN.L) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Friday they were upbeat
about their prospects in the Japanese market, citing a sea change
in the regulatory environment and mild generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International companies have been cheered by government moves
to speed up the approval process in the world's second-biggest
drug market, worth some $70 billion, where products on average
reach market four years after they were first sold overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Around a quarter of the top 100 selling drugs globally are
still not sold here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AstraZeneca development head John Patterson said the company
would spend 10 billion yen ($90 million) in 2008 on trials and
internal resources, roughly double 2006 levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has also as put some 20 new medicines into clinical trials
this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would hope to put at least 20 into Japan first trials
next year as well," he told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's Health Ministry has said it is determined to reduce
the so-called "drug lag". It is working to increase regulatory
staff and has made changes in the types of data accepted.
 Pfizer's new head of research Martin Mackay also expressed
optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The regulatory world is changing in Japan and we are very
well positioned to launch a host of compounds," he told an
investors meeting in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generic competition is also limited in Japan, accounting for
17 percent of drugs prescribed compared with 63 percent in the
United States and 59 percent in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the government has recently proposed measures to
promote generics including changes to prescription forms, both
branded and generic industry executives as well as analysts have
said they expect growth to be slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Generic penetration is really mild here, so if a new drug
debuts in Japan it has really strong sales prospects," said
Masahiro Kato, head of AstraZeneca's Japan unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit accounts for around 6 percent of the company's
overall revenues and expects double digit growth this business
year on the back of strong sales of its cholesterol-lowering drug
Crestor, originally developed by Shionogi  Co Ltd (4507.T).
