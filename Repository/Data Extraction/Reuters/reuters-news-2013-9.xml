&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nokia CorporationStock Exchange ReleaseSeptember 3, 2013 at 06.00 (CET +1)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Washington and ESPOO, Finland - Microsoft Corporation and Nokia Corporation today announced that the Boards of Directors for both companies have decided to enter into a transaction whereby Microsoft will purchase substantially all of Nokia's Devices  Services business, license Nokia's patents, and license and use Nokia's mapping services.Under the terms of the agreement, Microsoft will pay EUR 3.79 billion to purchase substantially all of Nokia's Devices  Services business, and EUR 1.65 billion to license Nokia's patents, for a total transaction price of EUR 5.44 billion in cash. Microsoft will draw upon its overseas cash resources to fund the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014, subject to approval by Nokia's shareholders, regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Building on the partnership with Nokia announced in February 2011 and the increasing success of Nokia's Lumia smartphones, Microsoft aims to accelerate the growth of its share and profit in mobile devices through faster innovation, increased synergies, and unified branding and marketing. For Nokia, this transaction is expected to be significantly accretive to earnings, strengthen its financial position, and provide a solid basis for future investment in its continuing businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"It's a bold step into the future - a win-win for employees, shareholders and consumers of both companies. Bringing these great teams together will accelerate Microsoft's share and profits in phones, and strengthen the overall opportunities for both Microsoft and our partners across our entire family of devices and services," said Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive officer. "In addition to their innovation and strength in phones at all price points, Nokia brings proven capability and talent in critical areas such as hardware design and engineering, supply chain and manufacturing management, and hardware sales, marketing and distribution." &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We are excited and honored to be bringing Nokia's incredible people, technologies and assets into our Microsoft family. Given our long partnership with Nokia and the many key Nokia leaders that are joining Microsoft, we anticipate a smooth transition and great execution," Ballmer said. "With ongoing share growth and the synergies across marketing, branding and advertising, we expect this acquisition to be accretive to our adjusted earnings per share starting in FY15, and we see significant long-term revenue and profit opportunities for our shareholders." &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"For Nokia, this is an important moment of reinvention and from a position of financial strength, we can build our next chapter," said Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors and, following today's announcement, Nokia Interim CEO. "After a thorough assessment of how to maximize shareholder value, including consideration of a variety of alternatives, we believe this transaction is the best path forward for Nokia and its shareholders. Additionally, the deal offers future opportunities for many Nokia employees as part of a company with the strategy, financial resources and determination to succeed in the mobile space."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Building on our successful partnership, we can now bring together the best of Microsoft's software engineering with the best of Nokia's product engineering, award-winning design, and global sales, marketing and manufacturing," said Stephen Elop, who following today's announcement is stepping aside as Nokia President and CEO to become Nokia Executive Vice President of Devices  Services. "With this combination of talented people, we have the opportunity to accelerate the current momentum and cutting-edge innovation of both our smart devices and mobile phone products."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nokia has outlined its expected focus upon the closing of the transaction in a separate press release published today.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, Microsoft will acquire substantially all of Nokia's Devices and Services business, including the Mobile Phones and Smart Devices business units as well as an industry-leading design team, operations including all Nokia Devices  Services-related production facilities, Devices  Services-related sales and marketing activities, and related support functions. At closing, approximately 32,000 people are expected to transfer to Microsoft, including 4,700 people in Finland and 18,300 employees directly involved in manufacturing, assembly and packaging of products worldwide. The operations that are planned to be transferred to Microsoft generated an estimated EUR 14.9 billion, or almost 50 percent of Nokia's net sales for the full year 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is acquiring Nokia's Smart Devices business unit, including the Lumia brand and products. Lumia handsets have won numerous awards and have grown in sales in each of the last three quarters, with sales reaching 7.4 million units in the second quarter of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;As part of the transaction, Nokia is assigning to Microsoft its long-term patent licensing agreement with Qualcomm, as well as other licensing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also acquiring Nokia's Mobile Phones business unit, which serves hundreds of millions of customers worldwide, and had sales of 53.7 million units in the second quarter of 2013. Microsoft will acquire the Asha brand and will license the Nokia brand for use with current Nokia mobile phone products. Nokia will continue to own and manage the Nokia brand. This element provides Microsoft with the opportunity to extend its service offerings to a far wider group around the world while allowing Nokia's mobile phones to serve as an on-ramp to Windows Phone. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nokia will retain its patent portfolio and will grant Microsoft a 10-year non-exclusive&#160;license to its patents at the time of the closing. Microsoft will grant Nokia reciprocal rights to use Microsoft patents in its HERE services.&#160;In addition, Nokia will grant Microsoft an option to extend this mutual patent agreement in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In addition, Microsoft will become a strategic licensee of the HERE platform, and will separately pay Nokia for a four-year license.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also immediately make available to Nokia EUR 1.5 billion of financing in the form of three EUR 500 million tranches of convertible notes that Microsoft would fund from overseas resources. If Nokia decides to draw down on this financing option, Nokia would pay back these notes to Microsoft from the proceeds of the deal upon closing. The financing is not conditional on the transaction closing. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also announced that it has selected Finland as the home for a new data center that will serve Microsoft consumers in Europe. The company said it would invest more than a quarter-billion dollars in capital and operation of the new data center over the next few years, with the potential for further expansion over time.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;NOKIA LEADERSHIP CHANGES&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nokia expects that Stephen Elop, Jo Harlow, Juha Putkiranta, Timo Toikkanen, and Chris Weber would transfer to Microsoft at the anticipated closing of the transaction. Nokia has outlined these changes in more detail in a separate release issued today.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;EXTRAORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS MEETING&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nokia plans to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting on November 19, 2013. The notice of the meeting and more information on the transaction and its background are planned to be published later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - European banks would leave London
"in very short order" if Britain voted to exit the European
Union, a senior Goldman Sachs executive said in a newspaper
interview published on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Sherwood, a vice-chairman at the bank, said
the prospect of a British withdrawal was a real worry given
Prime Minister David Cameron's plans to hold a referendum on the
subject if re-elected in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't say we are relaxed, we regard it as a very big
tail-risk to our business," Sherwood, whose investment bank
bases around 6,000 of its 7,000-strong European workforce in
London, told the Evening Standard newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of Britain turning its back on its biggest trading
partner intensified in January when Cameron said he would seek a
new deal with the EU and then hold a referendum before the end
of 2017 to decide if Britain left the 28-nation bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His promise of a plebiscite upset many European allies and
prompted warnings from some business leaders that Britain's
economy would suffer if it were outside the bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move went some way to placating rebellious eurosceptics
in his ruling Conservative Party, who felt threatened by the
rise of the UK Independence Party, which wants to leave the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman's Sherwood predicted European banks would
quickly relocate if Britain did sever its EU ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Forget what we would do. Every European firm would be gone
in very short order," he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event of a British withdrawal, Goldman would have to
decide how to divide its staff between London and the rest of
Europe, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our people want to be in London. It works for us. We would
hate to pull it apart," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His colleague Richard Gnodde, who is his co-chief executive
at Goldman Sachs International, said London's financial
district, known as the City, would continue to operate for
decades to come regardless of the outcome of any referendum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a City before the EU was ever thought of. In or
out, there will be a City for the next 100 years," he was
reported as saying. "The question is: What kind of City will it
be?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/HELSINKI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - When a British
bookmaker installed Stephen Elop as favorite to take over the
soon-to-be-vacant CEO slot at Microsoft Corp last week,
most tech observers laughed it off as a publicity stunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft's purchase of Nokia's handset
business, announced late on Monday, has suddenly made Elop one
of the most visible candidates for the top spot at the company
where he once worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and others familiar with the board's thinking
reject any suggestion that the deal was done with Elop in mind,
and his track record at Nokia is decidedly mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, though, the understated, steely Canadian will
play a critical role in managing Microsoft's controversial entry
into the mobile handset market, and thus shape the future of the
software giant as it plunges headlong into the hardware
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper at least, 49-year-old Elop fits the role. He knows
broadly how Microsoft works, having spent nearly three years
there running the highly profitable Office unit, and has just
spent three years in the thick of the mobile war at Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is not enough time to cast him as an "insider" in
the minds of many looking to shake up insular Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are looking for Microsoft to go through some
dramatic change," said Kevin Walkush, an analyst at Jensen
Investment Management, which holds Microsoft shares. "He has a
very good understanding of what happens at Microsoft, and he has
made hard decisions in the face of big challenges. It's a pretty
strong combination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury is still out on whether Elop saved or put a nail in
Nokia's coffin by making the pivotal decision to adopt
Microsoft's Windows Phone system as its smartphone platform in
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's shares fell more than 60 percent during Elop's
tenure as CEO, and its sales collapsed as it jumped from its
long-held but outdated Symbian system to the largely untested
and unknown Windows, choosing it over the more popular Android
system by Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Nokia) only have 3 percent market share in
smartphones. They lost 40 percent of their revenue in mobile
phones in Q2. That's not a business on stable ground," said
Hakan Wranne, an analyst at Swedbank, summing up Elop's legacy.
"Of course we will never know what would've happened if they had
chosen Android."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRAIL TO FINLAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps it could have been worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of Elop as Nokia CEO in 2010, making him the
first non-Finn to lead the company, was seen by many at the
company as a breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many who survived the massive job cuts - around 40,000 since
his arrival - credited Elop for turning around a culture that
many said lacked speed, decisiveness and a sensitivity towards
demands of customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts credit him for speeding up product launches over
the past year by eliminating unnecessary processes and holding
individual executives more accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview in July, Elop said the company spent 22
months on the N8, which used the now-obsolete Symbian operating
system and was launched shortly after he joined the company.
With Windows phones, he got that down to six- to eight-month
delivery cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Finns were relieved the Canadian was more understated
than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer or other U.S. tech executives,
bonding with his adopted countrymen over a love of ice hockey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many were impressed he answered 10 to 20 emails from
customers each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is a nice guy. Everyone liked him. That's his strength,"
said one former Nokia employee who worked closely with Elop and
asked not to be named. "He is very down-to-earth, he answers all
of his email. His communication skills are very good, but he has
got a sense for the dramatic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop's dramatic side came to the fore with his startling
"Burning Platform" memo sent to staff shortly before he
announced the company would adopt Microsoft's Windows Phone in
early 2011, which essentially announced the death of Symbian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was an internal memo but he (Elop) knew it would get out
given the situation at Nokia," said the former Nokia employee
who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But outside the company it was broadly welcomed as the
jump-start Nokia needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He (Elop) changed the way Nokia operated. And he did a very
good job, he was fast at executing and changing the mind-set of
the company," said IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before he came to Microsoft in 2008, Elop was a fairly high
profile Chief Operating Officer at network equipment maker
Juniper Networks Inc and before that a president at
software firm Adobe Systems Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's got a technical background, he actually understands
engineering, he gets it," said Paul Murphy, formerly Elop's
chief of staff at Microsoft. "I've seen him interact with
customers, he's fantastic with customers in difficult
situations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less is known about Elop's stint as Chief Information
Officer of restaurant chain Boston Chicken from 1992 to 1998
when the company filed for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia deal is not expected to distract the special
committee from conducting a thorough search for a new CEO, said
one person with knowledge of the matter, hinting strongly that
Elop is not a shoo-in for the job, but admitting that he is a
probable candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People can point to his Nokia track record and say that he
failed, but he was really dealt a tough hand," said Walkush at
Jensen Investment Management. "He's demonstrated a lot of
leadership and ability."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MONTERREY, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Mexican bottler Coca-Cola
Femsa  said on Tuesday it is open to more
acquisitions, just days after its $1.9 billion purchase of
Brazil's Spaipa, its ninth deal in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector Trevino, chief financial officer of the venture
between Coca-Cola Co and Mexican retail and bottling
company Femsa, said the company had the financial
wherewithal to make new purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the company's net debt would be 1.6 times its
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) by December, and that it was comfortable with a level
of up to twice its EBITDA, giving it the leeway for new
acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we were to face a purchase that requires more than that,
we could also use our stock, and if not...we could also do a
public stock offering," Trevino told an analysts briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spaipa S.A. Industria Brasileira de Bebidas acquisition
come on the heels of Coca-Cola Femsa's $448 million purchase of
Brazil's Companhia Fulminense de Refigerantes. Some have said
the purchases could reflect an effort to diversify away from a
potentially less lucrative Mexican market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's government is due to present a reform plan on
Sunday that is expected to include a tax on fizzy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wants to raise the country's paltry tax take by four
percentage points and the move is part of a wider agenda that
includes energy and telecoms reforms to boost growth in Latin
America's second-largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa shares closed down 1.3 percent at 163.95

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and former Bear Stearns Cos managers Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin won the dismissal of a lawsuit in which Bank of America Corp accused them of causing heavy losses by lying in a desperate bid to prop up two failing hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and
former Bear Stearns Cos managers Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin
won the dismissal of a lawsuit in which Bank of America Corp
 accused them of causing heavy losses by lying in a
desperate bid to prop up two failing hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan on Tuesday
rejected Bank of America's fraud and breach of fiduciary duty
claims, and said the bank failed to prove damages that could be
traced to Bear's concealing of market-moving information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was distinctive because it pitted the two largest
U.S. banks against each other, over a mid-2007 event that was
among the earliest high-profile signs of market stress that
culminated in the 2008 global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It related to Bear's High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies
and High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage
funds, which had been crammed with subprime mortgage-backed
securities prior to their collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a lawsuit first filed in October 2008, Bank of
America suffered "significant losses" on a series of
transactions that Bear had induced it to enter with the hedge
funds in May 2007, two months before they went bankrupt and a
year before JPMorgan bought Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These transactions included a $4 billion securitization
backed mostly by mortgage assets in the hedge funds, and the
providing of nearly $1 billion of short-term financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America said it would not have entered these
transactions had it known that the funds were facing substantial
investor redemption requests, and were "desperate to secure
liquidity" to avoid an imminent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In dismissing the lawsuit, Nathan rejected as "inherently
unreliable" the testimony by a Bank of America expert about the
bank's losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the expert failed to identify which losses were
attributable to the market's realizing the risks addressed in a
May 23, 2007 letter describing the redemption requests, and the
effect of "fire sales" stemming from the funds' liquidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also said that Bank of America did not show that
the redemptions, coming in a "volatile" market, were so material
that Bear should have disclosed them prior to the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no evidence from which a rational jury could
conclude that there was a duty on the part of the defendants to
disclose the redemptions at the funds," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-defendant Raymond McGarrigal, a former portfolio manager
at the hedge funds, also won dismissal of the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to
comment. JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Weinstein, a lawyer for Cioffi; Nina Beattie, a lawyer
for Tannin; and Catherine Redlich, a lawyer for McGarrigal, did
not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2009, a federal jury in Brooklyn, New York,
acquitted Cioffi and Tannin of criminal fraud and conspiracy
charges over their handling of the hedge funds, whose collapse
saddled investors with an estimated $1.6 billion of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of America NA et al v. Bear Stearns Asset
Management Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York, No. 08-09265.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI/SEATTLE (Reuters) - In an era when shiny new tech start-ups can be worth tens of billions of dollars, Microsoft's deal to acquire Nokia's mobile handset business for 5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion) is a modest one from a strictly financial point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the deal is likely to go down as a major turning point in the contemporary technology business, one that marks the end of a Finnish company's unlikely run as world-beating tech icon even as it shapes the future of Microsoft Corp - for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Finland, politicians and business leaders mourned the fall of Nokia, while pensioners wondered what it all meant for them. In Seattle, the chatter centered on what the deal might say about the race to succeed Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, who announced 10 days ago that he would step down within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the global telecom industry, meanwhile, the deal signals further consolidation, coming just a day after Verizon announced a $130 billion deal to buy Vodafone's stake in its wireless unit. It could also help Microsoft achieve its long-held ambition of becoming a major rival to Apple and Samsung in the global smartphone business, though it will also put even more pressure on the company to show that its massive investments in consumer devices make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia deal "unequivocally suggests they aren't exiting the business and in fact are doubling down on mobile," said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can in all likelihood carve out a decent niche with their scale as a fully integrated player, however investors are questioning the merits," Lowenstein added. "The markets have spoken volumes." Microsoft shares finished down 4.6 percent on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia and Microsoft have been joined at the hip since early 2011, when the Finnish company agreed to adopt Microsoft's Windows Phone software for its smartphones - a big gamble for Nokia, but one that came at a time when the company's market share was already in a freefall and it had few good options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then Nokia has produced a series of Windows-powered phones that were mostly well-reviewed by critics, though largely shunned by customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been speculation from the start that Microsoft might eventually buy Nokia, but many analysts thought Microsoft had the best of both worlds - a committed hardware partner, but none of the considerable downside risk that might go with owning a phone-maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, though, friction developed, according to a source familiar with the situation, especially after Microsoft launched its Surface tablets last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each was trying to spend money on app developers, music stores, all the parts critical to the ecosystem," said the source. "It all came to a head at the end of last year, beginning of this year - was this really the right way to work or are we better as one entity?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions on an acquisition began in earnest in February, after Ballmer approached Nokia for an "open dialogue." Ballmer and Nokia board chairman Risto Siilasmaa met at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. After a few hiccups the negotiations kicked into high gear in July, with almost 50 board meetings on the part of Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source close familiar with the negotiations said the timing of the deal, which was called "Project Gold Medal" at Microsoft, was influenced by Ballmer's announced departure, with Nokia seeking to wrap it up before a new CEO was named. Nokia officials were concerned that if it delayed it could end up with facing a firesale down the road as its cash position worsened, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, moving ahead with a major strategic acquisition even as it seeks a new CEO reaffirms its commitment to being a broad-based "devices and services" company - a strategy crafted by Ballmer and one which was at the heart of a major reorganization announced just weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft called the Nokia deal "a huge leap forward on our journey of creating a family of devices and services that delight people and empower businesses of all sizes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People close to the situation rejected the idea that the transaction meant that Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, a former Microsoft executive who will rejoin the company as head of the devices and services division, would automatically succeed Ballmer. But analysts said the move could make it harder to bring in an outsider CEO who might want to revisit all aspects of the company's strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINLAND'S NATIONAL CHAMPION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's deal marks the breakup of a company almost embedded in Finnish DNA, a once-proud symbol of Nordic entrepreneurial engineering prowess and design. At its peak it accounted for 40 percent of the world's mobile phones, a fifth of Finland's exports and four percent of its GDP, and had a market value of close to $300 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barely a decade ago, consumers talked about Nokia with the same bated breadth as they do about Apple today, marveling at its sleek but practical designs. But its abrupt fall symbolizes the breakneck speed and unforgiving competition in consumer electronics, where nimble rivals can quickly upset established industry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia itself has had plenty of experience in reinvention over its 148-year history. From its beginning as a paper manufacturer in 1865, it grew to make everything from rubber boots to televisions, and eventually its brand name was even emblazoned on lavatory tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its modern incarnation began under Jorma Ollila, who headed the cellphone unit beginning in 1990 and then, as chief executive, transformed the Finnish conglomerate into a global handset leader. Its brand name was often mistaken as Japanese, something that at the time delighted a company whose home country was harder to sell globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was something Finland hadn't had, this major consumer brand," said Mikko Makipaa, an entrepreneur, recalling his days at the company from 1996 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ollila was blamed for being late to recognize the threat of Apple's iPhone and the smartphone revolution. A report by the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy said Nokia developed touch-screen phones three years before the iPhone and a tablet as early as 2005, but they never reached the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop's appointment in 2010 was hailed for bringing Silicon valley zip into the struggling company as rivals led by Apple were gaining market share in high-end smartphones even as Asian competitors were eating away at the cheaper, simpler end of the handset market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Canadian with five children and an amateur pilot who had previously headed Microsoft's business division, Elop was the first non-Finn to head Nokia. At his first press conference - broadcast live on Finnish TV - he played up his love for ice hockey, a passion many Canadians share with Finns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His enthusiasm quickly endeared him to staff, but he was also blunt. In a now-famous 2011 email to staff, he compared Symbian - Nokia's then operating software - with a "burning platform" that needed to be abandoned. It was dropped in favor of a largely untested alternative from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in three jobs were cut, and one source who was there at the time said the memo was ill-advised because it destroyed sales of Symbian before the Windows phones were ready. Still, it was mostly seen as the sort of bold stroke needed to rescue the flailing company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Elop is viewed in a different light. "A Trojan horse," the widely-read tabloid Ilta-Sanomat declared in a column on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sounds like a betrayal to me," said Finnish pensioner Paivi Rengman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, many in Finland saw the deal as a sign of deeper malaise within the Finnish economy and its celebrated Nordic welfare model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Finland, Nokia is emotional and symbolic. My generation grew up with a Nokia in their pocket. We view the deal in Finland as the end of an era," said Alexander Stubb, Finland's minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia is not disappearing, and will now concentrate on its networking equipment unit, navigation business and technology patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimists say it is not the first time Nokia has taken a big bet. In the early 1990s it sold off businesses that accounted for around 70 percent of its sales to focus on telecoms. That followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, which halted a highly profitable cross-border trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland also remains one of the few countries in the euro zone with a triple-A credit rating. But its reputation as an egalitarian society with top-notch education and health services belies worries about its once-mighty export manufacturers and rapidly ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a major challenge for Finland," said Tero Kuittinen, an analyst at Alekstra. "Microsoft is unlikely to keep any meaningful handset R or production in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2007, Finland had 60 percent of the global smartphone market. That will now plunge to zero percent - a massive blow for a country that bet so much on mobile technology," Kuittinen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, Nokia's decline may have inoculated Finland against a sudden shock. At its peak, Nokia accounted for 4 percent of Finnish GDP and supported myriad suppliers. Today it contributes closer to 1 percent, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many former Nokia employees have helped to spawn a growing IT industry, symbolized by fast-growing Rovio, maker of the popular Angry Birds game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuittinen said that Rovio's Angry Birds empire has racked up nearly 2 billion downloads while Supercell, another game company, is getting close to $100 million in monthly revenue from its two blockbusters, Hay Day and Clash of Clans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is that these two companies combined only have 700 or so employees," Kuittinen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for an upcoming generation, nostalgia about Nokia may have been supplanted by straightforward realism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their share price is all that I'm interested in," said a 28-year-old business student named Aleksi, who declined to give his last name. "I don't understand this crying about national treasure being sold. People seem to think it's the year 2000. Business is business. Nokia is not defining Finland."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the global tech business, the big question is to what extent Nokia will define Microsoft. Activist shareholders, led by ValueAct Capital, have urged the company to stop spending so heavily on consumer products and instead return money to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's track record in both consumer devices and major acquisitions does little to inspire confidence. Yet it remains among the very few firms with the muscle to challenge the market leaders in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I continue to believe that there is enough innovation in devices, unlike some of our investors, that it will be a growth opportunity in terms of the financial reward to the bold, to the innovative who pursue it," Ballmer said Tuesday in explaining the deal to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called the phone business "the best opportunity for pursuing users in very, very large numbers." As Nokia learned though, translating opportunity into success is the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Terhi Kinnunen and Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki, Simon Johnson and Geert de Clercq in Stockholm, Anjuli Davies in London and Poornim Gupta in San Francisco.

Yet it remains among the very few firms with the muscle to challenge the market leaders in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I continue to believe that there is enough innovation in devices, unlike some of our investors, that it will be a growth opportunity in terms of the financial reward to the bold, to the innovative who pursue it," Ballmer said Tuesday in explaining the deal to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called the phone business "the best opportunity for pursuing users in very, very large numbers." As Nokia learned though, translating opportunity into success is the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Terhi Kinnunen and Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki, Simon Johnson and Geert de Clercq in Stockholm, Anjuli Davies in London and Poornim Gupta in San Francisco.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI/SEATTLE, Sept 3 (Reuters) - In an era when shiny
new tech start-ups can be worth tens of billions of dollars,
Microsoft's deal to acquire Nokia's mobile handset business for
5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion) is a modest one from a
strictly financial point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the deal is likely to go down as a major turning point
in the contemporary technology business, one that marks the end
of a Finnish company's unlikely run as world-beating tech icon
even as it shapes the future of Microsoft Corp - for
better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Finland, politicians and business leaders mourned the
fall of Nokia, while pensioners wondered what it all 
meant for them. In Seattle, the chatter centered on what the
deal might say about the race to succeed Microsoft Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer, who announced 10 days ago that he would
step down within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the global telecom industry, meanwhile, the deal signals
further consolidation, coming just a day after Verizon 
announced a $130 billion deal to buy Vodafone's stake in
its wireless unit. It could also help Microsoft achieve its
long-held ambition of becoming a major rival to Apple 
and Samsung in the global smartphone business,
though it will also put even more pressure on the company to
show that its massive investments in consumer devices make
sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia deal "unequivocally suggests they aren't exiting
the business and in fact are doubling down on mobile," said Todd
Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management,
which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can in all likelihood carve out a decent niche with
their scale as a fully integrated player, however investors are
questioning the merits," Lowenstein added. "The markets have
spoken volumes." Microsoft shares finished down 4.6 percent on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia and Microsoft have been joined at the hip since early
2011, when the Finnish company agreed to adopt Microsoft's
Windows Phone software for its smartphones - a big gamble for
Nokia, but one that came at a time when the company's market
share was already in a freefall and it had few good options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then Nokia has produced a series of Windows-powered
phones that were mostly well-reviewed by critics, though largely
shunned by customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been speculation from the start that Microsoft
might eventually buy Nokia, but many analysts thought Microsoft
had the best of both worlds - a committed hardware partner, but
none of the considerable downside risk that might go with owning
a phone-maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, though, friction developed, according to
a source familiar with the situation, especially after Microsoft
launched its Surface tablets last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each was trying to spend money on app developers, music
stores, all the parts critical to the ecosystem," said the
source. "It all came to a head at the end of last year,
beginning of this year - was this really the right way to work
or are we better as one entity?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions on an acquisition began in earnest in February,
after Ballmer approached Nokia for an "open dialogue." Ballmer
and Nokia board chairman Risto Siilasmaa met at the Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona. After a few hiccups the negotiations
kicked into high gear in July, with almost 50 board meetings on
the part of Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source close familiar with the negotiations said the
timing of the deal, which was called "Project Gold Medal" at
Microsoft, was influenced by Ballmer's announced departure, with
Nokia seeking to wrap it up before a new CEO was named. Nokia
officials were concerned that if it delayed it could end up with
facing a firesale down the road as its cash position worsened,
the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, moving ahead with a major strategic
acquisition even as it seeks a new CEO reaffirms its commitment
to being a broad-based "devices and services" company - a
strategy crafted by Ballmer and one which was at the heart of a
major reorganization announced just weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft called the Nokia deal "a huge leap
forward on our journey of creating a family of devices and
services that delight people and empower businesses of all
sizes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People close to the situation rejected the idea that the
transaction meant that Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, a former
Microsoft executive who will rejoin the company as head of the
devices and services division, would automatically succeed
Ballmer. But analysts said the move could make it harder to
bring in an outsider CEO who might want to revisit all aspects
of the  company's strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINLAND'S NATIONAL CHAMPION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's deal marks the breakup of a company almost
embedded in Finnish DNA, a once-proud symbol of Nordic
entrepreneurial engineering prowess and design. At its peak it
accounted for 40 percent of the world's mobile phones, a fifth
of Finland's exports and four percent of its GDP, and had a
market value of close to $300 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barely a decade ago, consumers talked about Nokia with the
same bated breadth as they do about Apple today, marvelling at
its sleek but practical designs. But its abrupt fall symbolises
the breakneck speed and unforgiving competition in consumer
electronics, where nimble rivals can quickly upset established
industry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia itself has had plenty of experience in reinvention
over its 148-year history. From its beginning as a paper
manufacturer in 1865, it grew to make everything from rubber
boots to televisions, and eventually its brand name was even
emblazoned on lavatory tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its modern incarnation began under Jorma Ollila, who headed
the cellphone unit beginning in 1990 and then, as chief
executive, transformed the Finnish conglomerate into a global
handset leader. Its brand name was often mistaken as Japanese,
something that at the time delighted a company whose home
country was harder to sell globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was something Finland hadn't had, this major consumer
brand," said Mikko Makipaa, an entrepreneur, recalling his days
at the company from 1996 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ollila was blamed for being late to recognise the threat
of Apple's iPhone and the smartphone revolution. A report by the
Research Institute of the Finnish Economy said Nokia developed
touch-screen phones three years before the iPhone and a tablet
as early as 2005, but they never reached the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop's appointment in 2010 was hailed for bringing Silicon
valley zip into the struggling company as rivals led by Apple
were gaining market share in high-end smartphones even as Asian
competitors were eating away at the cheaper, simpler end of the
handset market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Canadian with five children and an amateur pilot who had
previously headed Microsoft's business division, Elop was the
first non-Finn to head Nokia. At his first press conference -
broadcast live on Finnish TV - he played up his love for ice
hockey, a passion many Canadians share with Finns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His enthusiasm quickly endeared him to staff, but he was
also blunt. In a now-famous 2011 email to staff, he compared
Symbian - Nokia's then operating software - with a "burning
platform" that needed to be abandoned. It was dropped in favour
of a largely untested alternative from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in three jobs were cut, and one source who was there at
the time said the memo was ill-advised because it destroyed
sales of Symbian before the Windows phones were ready. Still, it
was mostly seen as the sort of bold stroke needed to rescue the
flailing company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Elop is viewed in a different light. "A Trojan horse,"
the widely-read tabloid Ilta-Sanomat declared in a column on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sounds like a betrayal to me," said Finnish pensioner
Paivi Rengman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, many in Finland saw the deal as a sign of deeper
malaise within the Finnish economy and its celebrated Nordic
welfare model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Finland, Nokia is emotional and symbolic. My generation
grew up with a Nokia in their pocket. We view the deal in
Finland as the end of an era," said Alexander Stubb, Finland's
minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia is not disappearing, and will now concentrate on its
networking equipment unit, navigation business and technology
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimists say it is not the first time Nokia has taken a big
bet. In the early 1990s it sold off businesses that accounted
for around 70 percent of its sales to focus on telecoms. That
followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, which halted a highly
profitable cross-border trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland also remains one of the few countries in the euro
zone with a triple-A credit rating. But its reputation as an
egalitarian society with top-notch education and health services
 belies worries about its once-mighty export manufacturers and 
rapidly ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a major challenge for Finland," said Tero
Kuittinen, an analyst at Alekstra. "Microsoft is unlikely to
keep any meaningful handset R or production in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2007, Finland had 60 percent of the global smartphone
market. That will now plunge to zero percent - a massive blow
for a country that bet so much on mobile technology," Kuittinen
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, Nokia's decline may have inoculated
Finland against a sudden shock. At its peak, Nokia accounted for
4 percent of Finnish GDP and supported myriad suppliers. Today
it contributes closer to 1 percent, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many former Nokia employees have helped to spawn a growing
IT industry, symbolised by fast-growing Rovio, maker of the
popular Angry Birds game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuittinen said that Rovio's Angry Birds empire has racked up
nearly 2 billion downloads while Supercell, another game
company, is getting close to $100 million in monthly revenue
from its two blockbusters, Hay Day and Clash of Clans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is that these two companies combined only have
700 or so employees," Kuittinen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for an upcoming generation, nostalgia about Nokia may
have been supplanted by straightforward realism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their share price is all that I'm interested in," said a
28-year-old business student named Aleksi, who declined to give
his last name. "I don't understand this crying about national
treasure being sold. People seem to think it's the year 2000.
Business is business. Nokia is not defining Finland."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the global tech business, the big question is to what
extent Nokia will define Microsoft. Activist shareholders, led
by ValueAct Capital, have urged the company to stop spending so
heavily on consumer products and instead return money to
shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's track record in both consumer devices and major
acquisitions does little to inspire confidence. Yet it remains
among the very few firms with the muscle to challenge the market
leaders in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I continue to believe that there is enough innovation in
devices, unlike some of our investors, that it will be a growth
opportunity in terms of the financial reward to the bold, to the
innovative who pursue it," Ballmer said Tuesday in explaining
the deal to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called the phone business "the best opportunity for
pursuing users in very, very large numbers." As Nokia learned
though, translating opportunity into success is the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will buy Nokia's phone business and license its patents for 5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion), a bold foray into mobile devices that also brings potential chief executive contender Stephen Elop back into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years after hitching its fate to Microsoft's Windows Phone software, the Finnish phone maker that once dominated the global market collapsed into the arms of the U.S. software giant, its mobile business ravaged by nimbler rivals Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Microsoft slid as much as 6 percent in the afternoon, lopping more than $15 billion off the company's market value, as investors protested the acquisition of an underperforming and marginalized corporation that lost more than $4 billion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retiring CEO Steve Ballmer is trying to remake Microsoft into a gadget and services company like Apple, a move that has not won the endorsement of all shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia CEO Elop, who ran Microsoft's business software division before jumping ship in 2010, will return to the U.S. firm to head up its mobile devices business just as the company's board considers a successor to Ballmer, who announced last week he will retire within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop, who presided over Nokia's market share collapse and a shriveling share price during his three years at the helm, is being discussed as a potential replacement because he remains respected and is considered one of the few who can fully grasp Microsoft's sprawling empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But disgruntled Finnish media labeled him a Trojan horse who handed over the keys to one of the few remaining European technology powers. Nokia, whose market value topped $200 billion over a decade ago, will now concentrate on its networking equipment unit, navigation business and technology patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia deal thrusts Microsoft deeper into the hotly contested mobile phone market, despite some investors urging it to stick to its core strengths of business software and services. Activist fund manager ValueAct Capital Management, which has been offered a board seat, is among those concerned with Ballmer's leadership and his attempts to plough headlong into the lower-margin, highly competitive mobile devices arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adding to the cost structure when shareholders may be looking for steps in the other direction is not likely to be well received...," said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund. "Perhaps a decision to repurchase stock and up the dividend would be a good idea right about now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others applauded Ballmer's aggressive gambit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft cannot walk away from smartphones, and the hope that other vendors will support Windows Phone is fading fast. So buying Nokia comes at the right time," said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In today's market it is clear that a vertical integration is the way forward for a company to succeed. How else could Microsoft achieve this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Microsoft, Elop will head an expanded Devices unit. Julie Larson-Green, who in July was promoted to head a new Devices and Studios business in Ballmer's reorganisation, will report to Elop when the deal is closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRUNCH TIME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a pivotal moment for Microsoft, which still has huge revenues from its Windows operating system, Office suite of business software and Xbox game console, but has failed so far to set up a profitable mobile device business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's own mobile gadget, the Surface tablet, has sold tepidly since it was launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think we have made excellent, excellent progress with the partnership and yet we also know we have a long way go and felt on balance that together this is the best approach for both companies' shareholders," Ballmer told Wall Street analysts in a conference call to explain the deal early on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would make more than $40 profit on each smartphone it sells once it owns the Nokia business, as opposed to less than $10 now, due to development and marketing costs it pays to Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it said the business would not be fully profitable until fiscal year 2016, and needs to sell more than 50 million smartphones a year to break even. Last quarter, Nokia sold 7.4 million smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal leaves the Finnish company with Nokia Solutions and Networks, which competes with the likes of Ericsson and Huawei in telecoms equipment, as well as a navigation business and a broad portfolio of patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, after writing a memo that said Nokia lacked the in-house technology and needed to jump off a "burning platform", Elop made the controversial decision to use Microsoft's Windows Phone for smartphones, rather than Nokia's own software or Google Inc's ubiquitous Android operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, which had 40 percent of the handset market in 2007, now has just 15 percent, and only 3 percent in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Nokia surged 34 percent to close at 3.97 euros by late Tuesday. While up from their decade-low of 1.33 euros hit last year, they are still only a fraction of their 2000 peak of 65 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After today's gains the whole company is worth about 15 billion euros, a far cry from its glory days when it reached over 200 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's deal includes an agreement to license Nokia's patent portfolio for 10 years. Without it, Nokia's devices and services business would have been worth about 3.7 billion euros, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very clear to me that rationally this is the right step going forward," Elop told reporters, though he added he also felt "a great deal of sadness" over the outcome. "I feel sadness because inevitably we are changing Nokia and what it stands for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOLD FOR "PEANUTS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some investors credit Elop for bringing urgency to Nokia, which has stepped up its pace of product development in recent months and is due to announce a "phablet" large-screen handset this month, his legacy will be a bitter one for Finland. The company, which began life as a paper mill and has sold an eclectic range of products from television sets to rubber boots in its 148-year history, was a national champion in its heyday, accounting for 16 percent of all exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hired by former chairman Jorma Ollila, Elop was Nokia's first foreign CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many Finns, the fact that a former Microsoft executive had come to Nokia, bet the firm's future on an alliance with Microsoft, laid off about 40,000 worldwide and then delivered it into the software giant's hands, was a galling snub to national pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jorma Ollila brought a Trojan horse to Nokia," a column in widely read tabloid Ilta-Sanoma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a Finnish person, I cannot like this deal. It ends one chapter in this Nokia story," said Juha Varis, Danske Capital's senior portfolio manager, whose fund owns Nokia shares. "On the other hand, it was maybe the last opportunity to sell it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varis was one of many investors critical of Elop's decision to bet Nokia's future in smartphones on Microsoft's Windows Phone software, which was praised by tech reviewers but hasn't found the momentum to challenge the market leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So this is the outcome: the whole business for 5 billion euros. That's peanuts compared to its history," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Stubb, Finland's Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade, said on his Twitter account: "For a lot of us Finns, including myself, Nokia phones are part of what we grew up with. Many first reactions to the deal will be emotional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's new interim CEO Risto Siilasmaa painted a picture of just how grudgingly the call to sell had been arrived at, describing how the board had met almost 50 times after the approach by Microsoft around February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, at a news conference in the Finnish capital, sought to assuage fears the deal would hit jobs in the Nordic country and said Microsoft would build on the recent growth of Nokia's flagship Lumia smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia said it expected around 32,000 people of its roughly 90,000 staff to transfer to Microsoft, including about 4,700 who will transfer in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIRE SALE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Tero Kuittinen at consultancy Alekstra said the sale price of Nokia's phone business, about a quarter of its sales last year, represented a "fire sale level." Others were less clear about what a shrunken Nokia was worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price agreed for the devices and services business gives it an enterprise value of about 0.33 times sales for a loss-making business, about half what Google paid for Motorola's handset business in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What should be paid for a declining business, where market share has been constantly lost and profitability has been poor?" said Hannu Rauhala, analyst at Pohjola Bank. "It is difficult to say if it's cheap or expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia remains the world's No. 2 mobile phone maker behind Samsung, but it is not in the top five in the more lucrative and faster-growing smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Nokia's Lumia phones have helped the market share of Windows Phones in the global market climb to 3.3 percent, according to consultancy Gartner, overtaking ailing BlackBerry Ltd for the first time this year. Still, Google's Android and Apple's iOS make up 90 percent of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit default swap spreads on Nokia tightened by more than 30 basis points to around 200 basis points after the news, meaning it now costs $200,000 to insure $10 million worth of Nokia debt, which is rated junk due to worries about its shrinking cash position and market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia said it expected that senior executives Jo Harlow, Juha Putkiranta, Timo Toikkanen, and Chris Weber would transfer to Microsoft when the deal is concluded, probably in the first quarter of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Microsoft, while JP Morgan advised Nokia, according to people close to the deal. Law firm Simpson Thacher represented Microsoft, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom represented Nokia, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7582 euros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Terhi Kinnunen, Jussi Rosendahl and Niklas Pollard; Editing by Peter Graff, Will Waterman and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nokia may have sold its handset business to Microsoft Corp, but by hanging on to its valuable patent portfolio, the Finnish company could also get a big future payoff at the expense of Android phone makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed on Tuesday to pay 3.79 billion euros ($5 billion) for Nokia's handset business and another 1.65 billion euros for a 10-year license for Nokia's patents, considered some of the highest-quality patents in the mobile market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This involves the right to, in effect, make use of Nokia's inventions," Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said on Tuesday. "It doesn't involve the transfer or ownership of the patents itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, Nokia has not widely licensed many of its patents, preferring instead to use them to protect its handset business against competitors, Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said in an email to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once we no longer have our own mobile devices business, following the close of the (Microsoft) transaction, we would be able to explore licensing some of those technologies," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the world's dominant handset maker, Nokia has failed to close a huge lead opened up by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in the highly competitive market for smartphones. It will now concentrate on its networking equipment unit, navigation business and technology patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finnish company has long been a savvy player in the intellectual property market. It sued Apple in 2009 and then reached a licensing deal with the iPhone maker. The terms were not disclosed, but the deal was believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, taking a license for Nokia's patents rather than buying them serves a strategic objective as well. Microsoft has already convinced about 20 Android manufacturers to pay patent royalties as part of its effort to raise the cost of Google Inc's mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Nokia remains free to go after the same Android manufacturers for royalties as well, although Nokia spokesman Durrant did not reveal specific targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wouldn't surprise me at all to see litigation filed by Nokia in coming months," said one senior IP executive who has dealt with both companies, but did not want to be identified to maintain those relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Microsoft bought Nokia's patents outright, the pincer movement against Android likely would have been precluded, the executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia also gave Microsoft the option to convert the 10-year agreement to a perpetual license, which Smith said Microsoft would exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for high quality mobile patents, such as Nokia's, could be quite strong judging by past deals. Google, for instance, paid $12.5 billion in 2011 for Motorola Mobility, a transaction largely driven by the patent value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Nokia to sell the business, and not sell the patents, there must be something else cooking to recover value," said Michael Pierantozzi, a partner at Lumen SV, an intellectual property advisory firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia could decide to try to sell its patent portfolio as a whole if the company thought it could get a price approaching the Motorola deal, Pierantozzi said, adding that Microsoft likely was not willing to pay that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia "probably just weren't getting the price they were looking for," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7582 euros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Levine.; Editing by Andrew Hay and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has agreed to
pay $18.3 million to settle claims that documents for mortgages
acquired by a unit of Bear Stearns Cos failed to disclose
material information about interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, disclosed in court papers filed on Friday in
U.S. District Court in Los Angles, is one of several class
actions JPMorgan has agreed to resolve related to option
adjustable rate mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed in 2007, the lawsuit alleged that JPMorgan and units
of Bear Stearns failed to make proper disclosures related to the
 resetting of introductory interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit alleged the mortgage documents misleadingly
failed to disclose that the loan's principal balance would
increase if a borrower made the minimum monthly payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loans were acquired by EMC Mortgage Corp, the lending
unit of Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan took over amid the U.S.
economic meltdown in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following several years of litigation, U.S. District Judge
James Otero certified in September 2012 a class of people who
from August 2003 to March 2013 had option adjustable rate
mortgages purchased by EMC secured by property in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan continues as part of the settlement to deny
wrongdoing. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm happy with the settlement, and I think given the risk
to reward, people are going to be pleased," said Jeffrey Berns,
a lawyer for the plaintiffs at Berns Weiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the plaintiffs are in the process of settling
two other cases against JPMorgan involving option adjustable
rate mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has agreed to pay $10 million in settle a similar
lawsuit involving loans acquired by Washington Mutual, which
JPMorgan acquired in 2008 following the lender's failure, court
papers filed last month show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has agreed to pay another $2 million to resolve
another lawsuit over a smaller set of loans originated by
Lending 1st Mortgage and sold or owned by it or EMC, Berns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lending 1st separately agreed last year to pay $150,000 to
resolve claims against it in that case, which is pending in U.S.
District Court in Oakland, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar case involving Bank of America Corp's 
Countrywide Home Loans Inc is in the process of settling for
$100 million in a deal that received preliminary court approval
in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All these cases are starting to resolve after six years of
litigation," Berns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Monaco et al v. The Bear Stearns Companies Inc,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Dan Levine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Nokia may have
sold its handset business to Microsoft Corp, but by
hanging on to its valuable patent portfolio, the Finnish company
could also get a big future payoff at the expense of Android
phone makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed on Tuesday to pay 3.79 billion euros ($5
billion) for Nokia's handset business and another 1.65 billion
euros for a 10-year license for Nokia's patents, considered some
of the highest-quality patents in the mobile
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This involves the right to, in effect, make use of Nokia's
inventions," Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said on
Tuesday. "It doesn't involve the transfer or ownership of the
patents itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, Nokia has not widely licensed many of its
patents, preferring instead to use them to protect its handset
business against competitors, Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said
in an email to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once we no longer have our own mobile devices business,
following the close of the (Microsoft) transaction, we would be
able to explore licensing some of those technologies," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the world's dominant handset maker, Nokia has failed to
close a huge lead opened up by Apple Inc and Samsung
Electronics Co Ltd in the highly competitive market
for smartphones. It will now concentrate on its networking
equipment unit, navigation business and technology patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finnish company has long been a savvy player in the
intellectual property market. It sued Apple in 2009 and then
reached a licensing deal with the iPhone maker. The terms were
not disclosed, but the deal was believed to be worth hundreds of
millions of dollars to Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, taking a license for Nokia's patents rather
than buying them serves a strategic objective as well. Microsoft
has already convinced about 20 Android manufacturers to pay
patent royalties as part of its effort to raise the cost of
Google Inc's mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Nokia remains free to go after the same Android
manufacturers for royalties as well, although Nokia spokesman
Durrant did not reveal specific targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wouldn't surprise me at all to see litigation filed by
Nokia in coming months," said one senior IP executive who has
dealt with both companies, but did not want to be identified to
maintain those relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Microsoft bought Nokia's patents outright, the pincer
movement against Android likely would have been precluded, the
executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia also gave Microsoft the option to convert the 10-year
agreement to a perpetual license, which Smith said Microsoft
would exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for high quality mobile patents, such as Nokia's,
could be quite strong judging by past deals. Google, for
instance, paid $12.5 billion in 2011 for Motorola Mobility, a
transaction largely driven by the patent value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Nokia to sell the business, and not sell the patents,
there must be something else cooking to recover value," said
Michael Pierantozzi, a partner at Lumen SV, an intellectual
property advisory firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia could decide to try to sell its patent portfolio as a
whole if the company thought it could get a price approaching
the Motorola deal, Pierantozzi said, adding that Microsoft
likely was not willing to pay that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia "probably just weren't getting the price they were
looking for," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

			Market Vectors&#8217; Fran Rodilosso on the Microsoft/Nokia Deal News and 
      the Case for &#8220;Fallen Angels&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Monday&#8217;s announcement that Microsoft intends to purchase Nokia&#8217;s handset 
      business and license the company&#8217;s patents for a total of $7.2 billion 
      has provided a major boost to Nokia&#8217;s bonds and highlights the 
      investment case for investing in &#8220;fallen angels,&#8221; according to Fran 
      Rodilosso, Fixed Income Portfolio Manager at Market Vectors ETFs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is expected that Nokia will continue to exist and will move to focus 
      on its network equipment business,&#8221; said Rodilosso. &#8220;I believe it will 
      still be in a very competitive space, but the cash infusion from this 
      deal, should it be completed, will be a big credit positive for the 
      company and highlights one of the investment theses behind focusing on 
      fallen angels.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In this case, we are dealing with a long established player and brand 
      name in the handset business which, despite its falling market share and 
      worsening business prospects, still possesses attractive assets that 
      hold significant value,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Rated B+ on average by the major 
      rating agencies, Nokia&#8217;s debt may soon be considered for potential 
      upgrades based on the success of this deal, which is expected to close 
      in early 2014.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rodilosso pointed to another significant telecommunications player and 
      &#8220;fallen angel,&#8221; Sprint, which has experienced very positive credit 
      events in the past 12 months as Japan&#8217;s Softbank emerged as the leading 
      suitor of the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Part of the attractiveness of fallen angel bonds is that the issuers, 
      formerly investment grade companies, tend to be larger, more established 
      players in their lines of business,&#8221; said Rodilosso. &#8220;While some of 
      these companies continue to decline, there is often value to be tapped 
      in brand names, patents, capacity and various other factors. It is also 
      helpful from a bond investor&#8217;s perspective that often a major goal of 
      management of these companies is to regain their investment grade 
      status.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rodilosso noted that not all mergers become credit positive events. 
      &#8220;Fortunately for creditors the Sprint deal is not a leveraged buyout 
      (LBO), and Nokia&#8217;s agreement to sell assets is being struck with a 
      partner that is in a very strong financial position, in my view,&#8221; he 
      said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Market Vectors offers the Fallen 
      Angel High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: ANGL), which tracks an index 
      of below investment grade corporate bonds denominated in U.S. dollars, 
      issued in the U.S. market that were rated investment grade at the time 
      of issuance. ANGL invests in high-yield bonds, which may be subject to 
      greater risk of loss of income and principal and are likely to be more 
      sensitive to adverse economic changes than higher rated securities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Rodilosso has 20 years of experience trading and managing risk in 
      fixed income investment strategies, including 17 years covering emerging 
      markets. In addition to ANGL, Mr. Rodilosso also oversees Emerging 
      Markets Local Currency Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: EMLC), Emerging 
      Markets High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: HYEM), Investment 
      Grade Floating Rate ETF (NYSE Arca: FLTR), Treasury-Hedged 
      High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: THHY),
			International 
      High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: IHY), LatAm 
      Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: BONO) and Renminbi 
      Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: CHLC). As of June 30, 2013, the total assets 
      for these ETFs amounted to approximately $1.9 billion.

			About Market Vectors ETFs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Market Vectors exchange-traded products have been offered since 2006 and 
      span many asset classes, including equities, fixed income (municipal and 
      international bonds) and currency markets. The Market Vectors family 
      totaled $21.8 billion in assets under management, making it the seventh 
      largest ETP family in the U.S. and tenth largest worldwide as of June 
      30, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Market Vectors ETFs are sponsored by Van Eck Global. Founded in 1955, 
      Van Eck Global was among the first U.S. money managers helping investors 
      achieve greater diversification through global investing. Today, the 
      firm continues this tradition by offering innovative, actively managed 
      investment choices in hard assets, emerging markets, precious metals 
      including gold, and other alternative asset classes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss 
      of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks 
      similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and 
      margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. 
      Debt securities carry interest rate and credit risk. Interest rate risk 
      refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates 
      rise and vice versa. Credit risk is the risk of loss on an investment 
      due to the deterioration of an issuer's financial health. The Funds' 
      underlying securities may be subject to call risk, which may result in 
      the Funds having to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates, 
      resulting in a decline in the Funds' income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Funds may be subject to credit risk, interest rate risk and a 
      greater risk of loss of income and principal than those holding higher 
      rated securities. As the Funds may invest in securities denominated in 
      foreign currencies and some of the income received by the Funds may be 
      in foreign currency, changes in currency exchange rates may negatively 
      impact the Funds&#8217; returns. Investments in emerging markets securities 
      are subject to elevated risks which include, among others, 
      expropriation, confiscatory taxation, issues with repatriation of 
      investment income, limitations of foreign ownership, political 
      instability, armed conflict and social instability. Some Funds are 
      subject to risks associated with investing in high-yield securities; 
      which include a greater risk of loss of income and principal than funds 
      holding higher-rated securities, as well as concentration risk; hedging 
      risk; and short sale risk. Investors should be willing to accept a high 
      degree of volatility and the potential of significant loss. The Funds 
      may loan their securities, which may subject them to additional credit 
      and counterparty risk. For a more complete description of these and 
      other risks, please refer to the Funds&#8217; prospectus and summary 
      prospectus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The &#8220;net asset value&#8221; (NAV) of an ETF is determined at the close of each 
      business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the ETF; 
      it is calculated by taking the total assets of an ETF subtracting total 
      liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The 
      NAV is not necessarily the same as an ETF's intraday trading value. 
      Investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV. Total returns 
      are based upon closing &#8220;market price&#8221; (price) of the ETF on the dates 
      listed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Nokia CEO Elop to rejoin Microsoft when deal closes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Elop among those who could succeed Microsoft CEO Ballmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Deal expected to close in first quarter of 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Nokia shares up 34 percent, Microsoft's down 5 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Finnish newspaper calls Elop a Trojan horse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ritsuko Ando and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI/SEATTLE, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
will buy Nokia's phone business and license its
patents for 5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion), a bold foray into
mobile devices that also brings potential chief executive
contender Stephen Elop back into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years after hitching its fate to Microsoft's Windows
Phone software, the Finnish phone maker that once dominated the
global market collapsed into the arms of the U.S. software
giant, its mobile business ravaged by nimbler rivals Apple Inc
 and Samsung Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Microsoft slid as much as 6 percent in the
afternoon, lopping more than $15 billion off the company's
market value, as investors protested the acquisition of an
underperforming and marginalized corporation that lost more than
$4 billion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retiring CEO Steve Ballmer is trying to remake Microsoft
into a gadget and services company like Apple, a move that has
not won the endorsement of all shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia CEO Elop, who ran Microsoft's business software
division before jumping ship in 2010, will return to the U.S.
firm to head up its mobile devices business just as the
company's board considers a successor to Ballmer, who announced
last week he will retire within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop, who presided over Nokia's market share collapse and a
shrivelling share price during his three years at the helm, is
being discussed as a potential replacement because he remains
respected and is considered one of the few who can fully grasp
Microsoft's sprawling empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But disgruntled Finnish media labelled him a Trojan horse
who handed over the keys to one of the few remaining European
technology powers. Nokia, whose market value topped $200 billion
over a decade ago, will now concentrate on its networking
equipment unit, navigation business and technology patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia deal thrusts Microsoft deeper into the hotly
contested mobile phone market, despite some investors urging it
to stick to its core strengths of business software and
services. Activist fund manager ValueAct Capital Management,
which has been offered a board seat, is among those concerned
with Ballmer's leadership and his attempts to plough headlong
into the lower-margin, highly competitive mobile devices arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adding to the cost structure when shareholders may be
looking for steps in the other direction is not likely to be
well received...," said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund. "Perhaps a
decision to repurchase stock and up the dividend would be a good
idea right about now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others applauded Ballmer's aggressive gambit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft cannot walk away from smartphones, and the hope
that other vendors will support Windows Phone is fading fast. So
buying Nokia comes at the right time," said Carolina Milanesi,
an analyst at Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In today's market it is clear that a vertical integration
is the way forward for a company to succeed. How else could
Microsoft achieve this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Microsoft, Elop will head an expanded Devices
unit. Julie Larson-Green, who in July was promoted to head a new
Devices and Studios business in Ballmer's reorganisation, will
report to Elop when the deal is closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRUNCH TIME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a pivotal moment for Microsoft, which still has huge
revenues from its Windows operating system, Office suite of
business software and Xbox game console, but has failed so far
to set up a profitable mobile device business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's own mobile gadget, the Surface tablet, has sold
tepidly since it was launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think we have made excellent, excellent progress with
the partnership and yet we also know we have a long way go and
felt on balance that together this is the best approach for both
companies' shareholders," Ballmer told Wall Street analysts in a
conference call to explain the deal early on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would make more than $40 profit on each
smartphone it sells once it owns the Nokia business, as opposed
to less than $10 now, due to development and marketing costs it
pays to Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it said the business would not be fully profitable
until fiscal year 2016, and needs to sell more than 50 million
smartphones a year to break even. Last quarter, Nokia sold 7.4
million smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal leaves the Finnish company with Nokia Solutions and
Networks, which competes with the likes of Ericsson 
and Huawei in telecoms equipment, as well as a
navigation business and a broad portfolio of patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, after writing a memo that said Nokia lacked the
in-house technology and needed to jump off a "burning platform",
Elop made the controversial decision to use Microsoft's Windows
Phone for smartphones, rather than Nokia's own software or
Google Inc's ubiquitous Android operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, which had 40 percent of the handset market in 2007,
now has just 15 percent, and only 3 percent in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Nokia surged 34 percent to close at 3.97 euros by
late Tuesday. While up from their decade-low of 1.33 euros hit
last year, they are still only a fraction of their 2000 peak of
65 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After today's gains the whole company is worth about 15
billion euros, a far cry from its glory days when it reached
over 200 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's deal includes an agreement to license Nokia's
patent portfolio for 10 years. Without it, Nokia's devices and
services business would have been worth about 3.7 billion euros,
the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very clear to me that rationally this is the right
step going forward," Elop told reporters, though he added he
also felt "a great deal of sadness" over the outcome. "I feel
sadness because inevitably we are changing Nokia and what it
stands for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOLD FOR "PEANUTS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some investors credit Elop for bringing urgency to
Nokia, which has stepped up its pace of product development in
recent months and is due to announce a "phablet" large-screen
handset this month, his legacy will be a bitter one for Finland.
The company, which began life as a paper mill and has sold an
eclectic range of products from television sets to rubber boots
in its 148-year history, was a national champion in its heyday,
accounting for 16 percent of all exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hired by former chairman Jorma Ollila, Elop was Nokia's
first foreign CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many Finns, the fact that a former Microsoft executive
had come to Nokia, bet the firm's future on an alliance with
Microsoft, laid off about 40,000 worldwide and then delivered it
into the software giant's hands, was a galling snub to national
pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jorma Ollila brought a Trojan horse to Nokia," a column in
widely read tabloid Ilta-Sanoma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a Finnish person, I cannot like this deal. It ends one
chapter in this Nokia story," said Juha Varis, Danske Capital's
senior portfolio manager, whose fund owns Nokia shares. "On the
other hand, it was maybe the last opportunity to sell it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varis was one of many investors critical of Elop's decision
to bet Nokia's future in smartphones on Microsoft's Windows
Phone software, which was praised by tech reviewers but hasn't
found the momentum to challenge the market leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So this is the outcome: the whole business for 5 billion
euros. That's peanuts compared to its history," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Stubb, Finland's Minister for European Affairs and
Foreign Trade, said on his Twitter account: "For a lot of us
Finns, including myself, Nokia phones are part of what we grew
up with. Many first reactions to the deal will be emotional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's new interim CEO Risto Siilasmaa painted a picture of
just how grudgingly the call to sell had been arrived at,
describing how the board had met almost 50 times after the
approach by Microsoft around February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, at a news conference in the Finnish capital, sought
to assuage fears the deal would hit jobs in the Nordic country
and said Microsoft would build on the recent growth of Nokia's
flagship Lumia smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia said it expected around 32,000 people of its roughly
90,000 staff to transfer to Microsoft, including about 4,700 who
will transfer in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIRE SALE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Tero Kuittinen at consultancy Alekstra said the sale
price of Nokia's phone business, about a quarter of its sales
last year, represented a "fire sale level." Others were less
clear about what a shrunken Nokia was worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price agreed for the devices and services business gives
it an enterprise value of about 0.33 times sales for a
loss-making business, about half what Google paid for Motorola's
handset business in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What should be paid for a declining business, where market
share has been constantly lost and profitability has been poor?"
said Hannu Rauhala, analyst at Pohjola Bank. "It is difficult to
say if it's cheap or expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia remains the world's No. 2 mobile phone maker behind
Samsung, but it is not in the top five in the more lucrative and
faster-growing smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Nokia's Lumia phones have helped the market share
of Windows Phones in the global market climb to 3.3 percent,
according to consultancy Gartner, overtaking ailing BlackBerry
Ltd for the first time this year. Still, Google's 
Android and Apple's iOS make up 90 percent of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit default swap spreads on Nokia tightened by more than
30 basis points to around 200 basis points after the news,
meaning it now costs $200,000 to insure $10 million worth of
Nokia debt, which is rated junk due to worries about its
shrinking cash position and market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia said it expected that senior executives Jo Harlow,
Juha Putkiranta, Timo Toikkanen, and Chris Weber would transfer
to Microsoft when the deal is concluded, probably in the first
quarter of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Microsoft, while
JP Morgan advised Nokia, according to people close to the deal.
Law firm Simpson Thacher represented Microsoft, while Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom represented Nokia, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Nokia may have
sold its handset business to Microsoft but by hanging
on to its valuable patent portfolio, the Finnish company can try
to boost royalties by sueing Android phone makers, or unload the
patents in a future deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, once the world's dominant handset maker, has failed
to close a yawning lead opened up by Apple and Samsung
 in the highly competitive market for smartphones. It
will now concentrate on its networking equipment unit,
navigation business and technology patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Tuesday agreed to pay 3.79 billion euros ($5
billion) for Nokia's handset business, and another 1.65 billion
euros for a 10-year license to Nokia's patents, considered some
of the highest-quality patents in the mobile
space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This involves the right to, in effect, make use of Nokia's
inventions," Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, said on
Tuesday. "It doesn't involve the transfer or ownership of the
patents itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia has long been a savvy player in the intellectual
property market. It sued Apple in 2009 and then reached a
licensing deal with the iPhone maker. The terms were not
disclosed but the deal was believed to be worth hundreds of
millions of dollars to Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, taking a license to Nokia's patents - but not
buying them - serves a strategic objective as well. Microsoft
has already convinced about 20 Android manufacturers to pay
patent royalties, part of Microsoft's effort to raise the cost
of Google's mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Nokia remains free to go after those Android
manufacturers for royalties as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wouldn't surprise me at all to see litigation filed by
Nokia in coming months," said one senior IP executive who has
dealt with both companies but did not want to be identified to
maintain those relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Microsoft bought Nokia's patents outright, that pincer
movement against Android likely would have been foreclosed, the
executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia also gave Microsoft the option to convert the 10-year
license to a perpetual license, which Smith said Microsoft would
exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia representatives were not immediately available for
additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for high quality mobile patents, like Nokia's,
could be quite strong judging by past deals. Google, for
instance, paid $12.5 billion in 2011 for Motorola Mobility, a
transaction largely driven by the patent value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Nokia to sell the business, and not sell the patents,
there must be something else cooking to recover value," said
Michael Pierantozzi, a partner at Lumen SV, an intellectual
property advisory firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia could decide to try to sell its patent portfolio as a
whole if the company thought it could get a price approaching
the Motorola deal, Pierantozzi said, adding that Microsoft
likely was not willing to pay that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia "probably just weren't getting the price they were
looking for," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has agreed to buy Nokia's handset business for $7.2 billion, but there is no guarantee that acquiring the fading cellphone pioneer will accelerate the PC-centric software company's lumbering move toward mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades Microsoft has spent billions of dollars buying or investing in scores of companies as a shortcut to obtain the technology or market presence it does not possess. But few of those deals have yielded great results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell - Microsoft agreed to lend $2 billion to Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake to help finance their move to take PC maker Dell Inc private earlier this year, but the deal has been held up by shareholder opposition, even as Dell's fortunes decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yammer - Paid $1.1 billion last year for online social network business Yammer, but has said very little about it since and does not break out its financials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nook - Last year Microsoft agreed to invest $605 million in Barnes &amp; Noble Inc's money-losing Nook e-reader and college textbook business over five years. The bookseller said in June it would stop making the Nook as sales fell 20 percent, badly trailing Amazon.com Inc's market-leading Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype - In May 2011, the company signed a deal to buy online video chat company Skype for $8.5 billion, a price that was considered high at the time by analysts. Microsoft says consumer demand is rising and Skype revenue increased last quarter, but stopped giving user numbers this year and does not divulge the actual financials of the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo - After offering to buy the former internet company in 2008 for $47 billion and being rebuffed, Microsoft signed a 10-year deal to provide internet search services to Yahoo Inc in exchange for a cut of the ad revenue. The deal has disappointed both companies so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danger - Reportedly paid $500 million for the edgy smartphone designer in 2008, but most staff left and two years later Microsoft launched the disastrous Kin phone based on a Danger blueprint. The Kin was supposed to appeal to the under-30 Facebook generation, but was pulled off the market in less than two months after poor sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook - Scored a home run with a $240 million purchase of a 1.6 percent stake in the social network in 2007, which is now worth much more and paved the way for co-operation between Facebook Inc and Microsoft's Outlook email and Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;aQuantive - paid $6.3 billion in cash for the online ad company in 2007 and wrote off virtually all of that in 2012, effectively admitting the investment had been worthless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great Plains/Navision - the acquisition of these two companies in 2001 and 2002, respectively, laid the foundation of Microsoft's corporate software business and is considered a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bungie - Paid only tens of millions of dollars for game studio Bungie, creator of the mega-hit shooter game Halo, in 2000. Bungie eventually split from the company, but Microsoft kept the lucrative Halo franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT - In 1999, Microsoft bought $5 billion in stock of cable and telephone company AT Inc with the aim of getting its Windows software into set-top boxes, but it did not deliver the desired entry into the emerging cable-based broadband market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple - Invested $150 million in a struggling Apple Inc in 1997 and committed to make software for the still unpopular Mac. The deal ended a long-running patent spat between the two companies but arguably saved Apple and put it on course to eventually eclipse Microsoft financially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry officially put itself on the block a few weeks ago in the face of lackluster sales for its new line of smartphones, and some analysts have been skeptical about whether it would be able to attract bidders as its business has shrunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But others argue that BlackBerry's pile of valuable patents and the well-regarded services business that powers its security-focused messaging system could be attractive to rivals or even private-equity players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of BlackBerry, which jumped as high as $10.48 early on Tuesday, were up 2.2 percent at $10.34 in midday trading on the Nasdaq, following the announcement of Microsoft's 5.44 billion euro ($7.2 billion) bid for Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell cautioned that it is hard to tell whether Microsoft's move will make others any more, or less interested in making a bid for BlackBerry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nokia was already using the Microsoft's Windows platform, so integration-wise it is relatively straightforward," he said.

&lt;p&gt;* Chevron wins first shale gas tender by Lithuania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Baltic state is today 100 pct dependent on Russian gas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Andrius Sytas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VILNIUS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Chevron
 has won a tender to explore for shale gas in western
Lithuania, the government said on its Twitter feed on Tuesday,
as the Baltic state tries to wean itself from its dependence
from Russian gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron was the only bidder to explore for unconventional
hydrocarbons in the 1,800 square kilometre Silute-Taurage
prospect, which Lithuanian experts estimate might hold up to 80
billion cubic metres (bcm) of technically recoverable shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was decided to announce U.S. Chevron as winner of the
shale gas exploration tender in Lithuania," the government said
on Twitter after a meeting of the ruling coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the opinion of the prime minister and the whole
government after the coalition meeting," the spokeswoman for the
Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baltic state gets all its gas from neighbouring Russia
and has said Gazprom overcharges Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission (EC) has started an investigation
into Gazprom's pricing policy in the Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest gas market report from the EC showed Lithuania
paying the highest wholesale gas price in the European Union ().&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithuania government plans to formalize Chevron's win later
in September, and to sign the exploration contract by the end of
this year, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron will be required to agree to invest at least 80
million litas ($30.56 million) in exploration in exchange for a
seven-year permit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they act quickly, they can start drilling in half a year
after the licence is granted," said Environment Minister
Valentinas Mazuronis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government had previously postponed the decision after
public protests by local communities, who fear the chemicals
used in hydraulic fracturing could pollute underground waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar public protests in Bulgaria led to the country's
government cancelling Chevron's exploration permit for
unconventional resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Lithuania's southern neighbour Poland has already
issued more than 100 shale gas exploration licences to local and
international firms which have drilled 48 wells to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While none of them has produced commercial flows so far, a
recent test in northern Poland has buoyed shale gas
hopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baltic Basin in northern Poland, which also extends to
western Lithuania, is the most prospective region in Europe, the
U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EIA estimates the Lithuanian extension to hold 0.3
billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil and 11.3
bcm of associated shale gas, less than estimated by local
experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baltic state consumed 3.3 bcm of natural gas in 2012,
all supplied by Russia's Gazprom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision on shale gas exploration comes ahead of
Butkevicius meeting in Vilnius with Gazprom's Chief Executive
Alexey Miller on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are expected to discuss Lithuania's plans to liberalize
its gas market, affecting Gazprom's holdings in Lithuania, and
Russia's gas transit to its Kaliningrad exclave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Wednesday a jury decided in its favor in the second of two trials in federal court in Seattle concerning Motorola Mobility's licensing of so-called standard, essential patents used in Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury agreed with Microsoft's claim that phone maker Motorola, owned by Google Inc, broke agreements with standard-setting bodies to license certain patents at a fair and reasonable rate, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury awarded Microsoft about $14 million in damages, Microsoft said, about half what the company had asked for. That consisted of $11 million for the costs of relocating a warehouse in Germany due to an injunction on certain Microsoft products brought by Motorola in that country, and about $3 million in legal fees for fighting that injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a landmark win for all who want products that are affordable and work well together," Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Motorola spokesman indicated the company would appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're disappointed in this outcome, but look forward to an appeal of the new legal issues raised in this case," said William Moss at Motorola. "In the meantime, we'll focus on building great products that people love."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victory for Microsoft follows a decision in its favor in another, related Seattle trial last year in which the judge found that the appropriate rate for Motorola to license certain wireless and video technology used in the Xbox game console was only a fraction of what Motorola had asked for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that trial, U.S. District Judge James Robart said the appropriate rate was about $1.8 million, slightly above Microsoft's estimate, but well below Motorola's demand for as much as $4 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest trial, Microsoft argued that Motorola's initial demand was exorbitant and a clear breach of its agreement to charge reasonable and non-discriminatory terms - commonly referred to as 'RAND' - for technology that is an industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-running argument between Microsoft and Motorola - and by extension Google - is just one facet of a wide-ranging global patent war surrounding smartphone and internet technology that has drawn in Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Nokia and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At heart, the companies are arguing over who owns the technology and design features behind smartphones, which are now essentially small computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More particularly, Microsoft has been locked in a battle with Google to ensure that handset makers using Google's free Android phone operating system pay Microsoft a license fee.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on
Wednesday a jury decided in its favor in the second of two
trials in federal court in Seattle concerning Motorola
Mobility's licensing of so-called standard, essential patents
used in Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury agreed with Microsoft's claim that phone maker
Motorola, owned by Google Inc, broke agreements with
standard-setting bodies to license certain patents at a fair and
reasonable rate, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury awarded Microsoft about $14 million in damages,
Microsoft said, about half what the company had asked for. That
consisted of $11 million for the costs of relocating a warehouse
in Germany due to an injunction on certain Microsoft products
brought by Motorola in that country, and about $3 million in
legal fees for fighting that injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a landmark win for all who want products that are
affordable and work well together," Microsoft said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Motorola spokesman indicated the company would appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're disappointed in this outcome, but look forward to an
appeal of the new legal issues raised in this case," said
William Moss at Motorola. "In the meantime, we'll focus on
building great products that people love."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victory for Microsoft follows a decision in its favor in
another, related Seattle trial last year in which the judge
found that the appropriate rate for Motorola to license certain
wireless and video technology used in the Xbox game console was
only a fraction of what Motorola had asked for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that trial, U.S. District Judge James Robart said the
appropriate rate was about $1.8 million, slightly above
Microsoft's estimate, but well below Motorola's demand for as
much as $4 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest trial, Microsoft argued that Motorola's
initial demand was exorbitant and a clear breach of its
agreement to charge reasonable and non-discriminatory terms -
commonly referred to as 'RAND' - for technology that is an
industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-running argument between Microsoft and Motorola -
and by extension Google - is just one facet of a
wide-ranging global patent war surrounding smartphone and
internet technology that has drawn in Apple Inc,
Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Nokia and
others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At heart, the companies are arguing over who owns the
technology and design features behind smartphones, which are now
essentially small computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More particularly, Microsoft has been locked in a battle
with Google to ensure that handset makers using Google's free
Android phone operating system pay Microsoft a license fee. Most
large handset makers, such as Samsung, LG and HTC
, have agreed to pay Microsoft a royalty on Android
handsets that Microsoft believes may infringe on its patents.
Motorola, which was bought by Google last year for $12.5
billion, partly because of its trove of patents, is the last big
holdout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Coca-Cola Femsa's Ratings Following Spaipa Acquisition 
      Announcement
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following credit ratings of Coca-Cola 
      Femsa S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF):
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Local currency IDR at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --National scale long-term rating at 'AAA(mex)';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --National scale short-term rating at 'F1+(mex)';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior notes for USD500 million due 2020 at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Certificados Bursatiles for MXN7,500 million due 2023 at 'AAA(mex)'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These rating actions follow the announcement by KOF that it has reached 
      an agreement to acquire 100% of Spaipa S.A. Industria Brasileira de 
      Bebidas (Spaipa) for an enterprise value of USD1,855 million. The 
      transaction will be fully funded with additional debt and Fitch 
      estimates that KOF's total debt to EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA will 
      increase on a pro forma basis to approximately 2.0x and 1.6x by the 
      year-end 2013. Fitch expects that leverage will gradually decline in the 
      following years approaching historical levels. The acquisition is 
      subject to customary approvals and is expected to close in the last 
      quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      From a business perspective, the acquisition of Spaipa by KOF is 
      positive since it will increase its geographic foot print in Brazil by 
      integrating contiguous territories and capturing synergies of around 
      USD33 million in the following 18 to 24 months. In addition, the 
      integration of Spaipa operations will allow KOF to increase its volume 
      by 40% in Brazil as well as to reach 39% of the Coca-Cola system's 
      volume in the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Spaipa territories cover all the state of Parana and more than half of 
      the state of Sao Paulo and have four bottling plants and seven 
      distribution centers. During the last 12 months as of June 2013, the 
      company sold 233.3 million unit cases of beverages, including beer, and 
      generated revenues and EBITDA of around USD905 million and USD134 
      million, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Expected Deleverage:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation that KOF's total debt to 
      EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA ratios should strengthen in the following 
      two years after integrating the operations of Spaipa to levels around 
      1.5x and 1.3x, respectively, through higher EBITDA generation or debt 
      reduction. For the last 12 months (LTM) ended June 30, 2013, the 
      company's total debt to EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA were 1.3x and 
      0.6x, respectively. KOF's total debt as of June 30, 2013 was MXN37.8 
      billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Strong Free Cash Flow (FCF) Generation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects KOF's FCF generation to remain strong over the long term. 
      During the last five years, the company's FCF estimated by Fitch after 
      covering capital expenditures and dividends has averaged annually 
      approximately MXN5.5 billion. Fitch believes that KOF's FCF generation 
      provides financial flexibility across the ups and downs of economic 
      cycles to maintain a conservative capital structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ample Liquidity Position
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's liquidity position is ample. As of June 30, 2013, the company had 
      MXN19.9 billion of cash and marketable securities and MXN8 billion of 
      short-term debt maturities in 2013 and 2014. In addition, the company 
      used around MXN5.8 billion to settle the acquisition of Companhia 
      Fluminense de Refrigerantes, S.A. (Fluminese) which was closed in August 
      2013. Fitch believes that KOF has sufficient flexibility to face 
      upcoming debt maturities after 2015 considering its historical solid 
      financial position and ample access to capital markets and banks loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch incorporates the greater diversification of KOF's revenue and 
      EBITDA coming from its operations from South America. Assuming a 
      successful closing of Spaipa acquisition and including the operations of 
      Fluminense, the revenues and EBITDA from its operations in South America 
      would represent approximately, 58% and 52% of its consolidated results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's ratings continue to reflect the company's substantial FCF 
      generation, solid financial position, ample financial flexibility and 
      strong business profile. The ratings also reflect the company's 
      strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola Company (KO; rated 
      'A+'/Outlook Stable) and the explicit and implicit financial support KOF 
      has received from KO. In addition, the ratings consider the geographical 
      diversification of the EBITDA generated outside Mexico, as well as its 
      strong credit profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downgrade pressures in the ratings could be triggered if KOF's leverage 
      ratios in the following 18 to 24 months are above Fitch's expectation or 
      by a change in the company's long term capital structure that materially 
      deviates from its historical levels. After the acquisition of Spaipa, 
      Fitch does not foresee any positive rating action over the medium term.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Clifton Savings Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") (Nasdaq:CSBK), the holding

      and President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, have announced 
      their retirement, effective December 31, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Board of Directors also announced the appointment of Paul M. Aguggia

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "It has been an honor and a privilege to be associated with Clifton 
      Savings for these many years," said Celentano. "I am proud of the Bank's 
      accomplishments and its position in the community. I look forward to 
      retirement and the next chapter in my life knowing that we leave the 
      Bank in excellent hands. We could not be more pleased to have Paul take 
      the helm. He is someone with extensive experience and who is known to 
      our board to be a person of great character and integrity with an 
      unsurpassed work ethic."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "I am honored to assume the leadership of an institution that I have

      for many years, I feel well positioned to help Clifton Savings grow and 
      continue to serve its shareholders and the communities of northern New 
      Jersey. The legacies created by Messrs. Celentano and Celuch are great.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Wednesday it appointed senior banker Stuart Bernstein as head of its venture capital coverage group, as it seeks to generate more business in sectors such as telecommunications and clean technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The venture capital community has become a strategically important constituent of the division's client franchise and is critical to our ability to serve the needs of our emerging growth clients," Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg, co-heads of Goldman's investment banking division, wrote in a memo to staff on Wednesday to announce Bernstein's appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein is currently global head of Goldman's clean technology and renewables group, a role he will retain, according to the memo. He previously led Goldman's financial institution's equity capital markets group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the deals he has worked on was the $20 billion initial public offering of Visa Inc, the largest in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein joined Goldman Sachs in 1986, was promoted to managing director in 1999 and made partner in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A U.S. regulator may proceed with parts of three lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to recover losses that now-defunct credit unions suffered on billions of dollars of residential mortgage-backed securities, a federal judge in Kansas has ruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John Lungstrum said the National Credit Union Administration may pursue civil claims that the largest U.S. bank and two companies it bought, Bear Stearns Cos and Washington Mutual Inc, misrepresented the quality of dozens of securities sold to four credit unions in 2006 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate decision on Tuesday, the Kansas City-based judge also let the regulator pursue part of a lawsuit against Swiss bank UBS AG over securities sales to two of the credit unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCUA is pursuing 11 lawsuits as the conservator of five corporate credit unions that suffered losses in the U.S. housing crisis after buying more than $14 billion of mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said about $7 billion of those securities were traceable to JPMorgan, with about one-half sold or underwritten by Bear, one-third by Washington Mutual and one-sixth by JPMorgan itself. JPMorgan bought Bear and Washington Mutual in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's decisions allowed the NCUA to pursue claims over roughly one-half of the securities in these cases, while dismissing claims over the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS had been sued over more than $1.1 billion of securities, and Lungstrum dismissed claims on roughly two-thirds of these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment. UBS spokeswoman Karina Byrne did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Fairbanks, an NCUA spokesman, said the regulator is pleased the lawsuits can continue, and that the federal appeals court in Denver is weighing how to apply statutes of limitations on some claims. "NCUA intends to continue to aggressively pursue responsible parties," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCUA is based in Alexandria, Virginia.

Lenexa is a Kansas City suburb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 27, the appeals court said the NCUA may use an "extender" provision in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 to pursue some claims that would otherwise be deemed too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar provision appears in the 2008 Housing and Economic Recovery Act, covering lawsuits by the Federal Housing Finance Agency against JPMorgan, UBS, Bank of America and others as the conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, a federal appeals court in New York interpreted that provision in the FHFA's favor.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. authorities are conducting a criminal investigation into whether several employees of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co tried to impede a regulatory investigation into alleged manipulation of power markets, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe, which is in its early stages, is being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and prosecutors in Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office. It comes after a JPMorgan subsidiary agreed on July 30 to pay a $410 million penalty to settle a manipulation case brought by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources said investigators aim to determine whether individuals at JPMorgan - including three Houston-based employees - gave regulators all the information they needed to investigate JPMorgan's power market deals in California and the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deliberately withholding information from investigators or lying during interviews conducted as part of an investigation is considered obstruction of justice, a criminal offense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Queliz, a spokeswoman for Bharara, and Peter Donald, a spokesman for the FBI, both declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 30, FERC announced JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corp had agreed to settle a case in which FERC alleged the bank had used "manipulative bidding strategies" from September 2010 through November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the settlement, according to FERC, JPMorgan admitted the facts in the agreement but "did not admit or deny the violations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has said publicly it told regulators it did not lie during the investigations. No individual from the bank has been accused of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal inquiry by federal authorities is the latest in a series of legal and regulatory headaches for Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon piloted JPMorgan through the financial crisis, but it is now facing at least a dozen investigations from federal agencies and state and foreign governments, including probes over the "London Whale" trading scandal that cost the bank more than $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the bank revealed that it was facing parallel criminal and civil probes by the U.S. Department of Justice in California into mortgage bonds that it sold before the financial crisis. It also disclosed an investigation by U.S. officials about whether its Hong Kong office hired the children of powerful heads of state-owned companies in China with the purpose of winning underwriting business and other contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal first reported the existence of the criminal probe into the bank's activities in the power market last month but said the investigation focused on whether JPMorgan manipulated the power markets, not allegations of obstruction of justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impetus for the investigation, according to one of the sources, was in part a July 31 letter to FERC from Massachusetts Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, both Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter asked FERC about why it had allowed JPMorgan to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing and why no individual executives faced regulatory action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter also asked FERC why no action was taken against people who "impeded the Commission's investigations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2012, months before the settlement, FERC imposed a six-month suspension on JPMorgan from participation in the electric power market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A FERC press release said the regulator imposed the suspension "because the company made factual misrepresentations and omitted material information over the course of several months of communications with the California Independent System Operator (California ISO) and in filings to the Commission in connection with requests for information involving bidding activities in the California market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. criminal probe is not the only inquiry into the matter. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is also looking into issues surrounding the FERC case, including whether the bank or any of its employees lied to regulators or impeded their inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elise Bean, the committee's chief counsel and majority staff director, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story corrects identification of Edward Markey in paragraph 13 to reflect he is a senator, not a congressman.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Emily Flitter; Additional reporting by David Henry; Editing by Frank McGurty)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft's purchase of Nokia's handset business, announced late on Monday, has suddenly made Elop one of the most visible candidates for the top spot at the company where he once worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and others familiar with the board's thinking reject any suggestion that the deal was done with Elop in mind, and his track record at Nokia is decidedly mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, though, the understated, steely Canadian will play a critical role in managing Microsoft's controversial entry into the mobile handset market, and thus shape the future of the software giant as it plunges headlong into the hardware business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper at least, 49-year-old Elop fits the role. He knows broadly how Microsoft works, having spent nearly three years there running the highly profitable Office unit, and has just spent three years in the thick of the mobile war at Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is not enough time to cast him as an "insider" in the minds of many looking to shake up insular Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are looking for Microsoft to go through some dramatic change," said Kevin Walkush, an analyst at Jensen Investment Management, which holds Microsoft shares. "He has a very good understanding of what happens at Microsoft, and he has made hard decisions in the face of big challenges. It's a pretty strong combination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury is still out on whether Elop saved or put a nail in Nokia's coffin by making the pivotal decision to adopt Microsoft's Windows Phone system as its smartphone platform in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's shares fell more than 60 percent during Elop's tenure as CEO, and its sales collapsed as it jumped from its long-held but outdated Symbian system to the largely untested and unknown Windows, choosing it over the more popular Android system by Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Nokia) only have 3 percent market share in smartphones. They lost 40 percent of their revenue in mobile phones in Q2. That's not a business on stable ground," said Hakan Wranne, an analyst at Swedbank, summing up Elop's legacy. "Of course we will never know what would've happened if they had chosen Android."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRAIL TO FINLAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps it could have been worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of Elop as Nokia CEO in 2010, making him the first non-Finn to lead the company, was seen by many at the company as a breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many who survived the massive job cuts - around 40,000 since his arrival - credited Elop for turning around a culture that many said lacked speed, decisiveness and a sensitivity towards demands of customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts credit him for speeding up product launches over the past year by eliminating unnecessary processes and holding individual executives more accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview in July, Elop said the company spent 22 months on the N8, which used the now-obsolete Symbian operating system and was launched shortly after he joined the company. With Windows phones, he got that down to six- to eight-month delivery cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Finns were relieved the Canadian was more understated than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer or other U.S. tech executives, bonding with his adopted countrymen over a love of ice hockey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many were impressed he answered 10 to 20 emails from customers each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is a nice guy. Everyone liked him. That's his strength," said one former Nokia employee who worked closely with Elop and asked not to be named. "He is very down-to-earth, he answers all of his email. His communication skills are very good, but he has got a sense for the dramatic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop's dramatic side came to the fore with his startling "Burning Platform" memo sent to staff shortly before he announced the company would adopt Microsoft's Windows Phone in early 2011, which essentially announced the death of Symbian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was an internal memo but he (Elop) knew it would get out given the situation at Nokia," said the former Nokia employee who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But outside the company it was broadly welcomed as the jump-start Nokia needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He (Elop) changed the way Nokia operated.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Retail stores in many markets have run out of Microsoft Corp's Xbox One consoles available for pre-orders, a senior company executive said, ahead of a major clash with Sony Corp's new lower-priced Playstation 4 this November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Retail stores in many

			nGenuis Voice | Video Manager Integrates with Microsoft Lync Server 
      2013 for Real-Time, End-to-End Service Delivery Management of Unified 
      Communications Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			NetScout&#174; 
      Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTCT) today announced nGenuis&#174;Voice | Video 
      Manager has been qualified for interoperability with Microsoft Lync&#8482;. 
      The integration of nGenius Voice | Video Manager with Microsoft Lync 
      Server enables real-time, end-to-end performance management of unified 
      communications (UC) service delivery that combines performance metrics 
      from endpoints, call path, and other critical UC elements. Together, 
      NetScout and Microsoft help IT organizations achieve a holistic view of 
      the Lync service delivery environment to optimize the management of 
      delivered services, protect the user experience, and reduce the total 
      cost of IT operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lync makes communications more collaborative and accessible regardless 
      of a user&#8217;s physical location, improving both service quality and 
      availability &#8211; two elements critical to maximizing business value. The 
      underlying delivery infrastructure for Lync can be complex and is often 
      comprised of many elements from different vendors distributed across 
      multiple locations. IT organizations must be able to see all components 
      across the network and service delivery environment supporting a Lync 
      deployment in real time to assure the optimal user experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      nGenius Voice | Video Manager is a UC performance management solution 
      that delivers always-on visibility into the entire Lync service delivery 
      infrastructure. nGenius Voice | Video Manager continuously monitors and 
      analyzes network, infrastructure, and IP communications from Lync 
      sessions, and provides actionable intelligence about the end-to-end 
      quality and performance of Lync services. The solution automates and 
      simplifies the identification and reporting of emerging Lync service 
      degradations. This allows IT to quickly triage critical issues and 
      proactively prevent future performance issues before they impact user 
      experience. Through real-time predictive and historical analysis, IT 
      organizations are able to reduce their mean time to repair for faster 
      problem resolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With Lync&#8217;s extensibility model, Microsoft enables partners to provide 
      applications that provide insight into service delivery performance,&#8221; 
      said Jon Morrow, Senior Program Manager for Lync Partner Engineering at 
      Microsoft. &#8220;Having met the requirements for Lync qualification, nGenius 
      Voice | Video Manager provides customers with a solution that can 
      maximize the availability and performance of Lync to meet growing 
      business needs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The nGenius solution enables IT organizations to simultaneously manage 
      the performance and delivery of data and UC services from a unified 
      platform leveraging common monitoring appliances. The nGenius solution 
      combines proactive service management with intelligent analytics to 
      enable IT staff to understand application-level behavior and its impact 
      on service quality. The solution delivers relevant and contextual 
      insight into the service delivery environment with unified and 
      aggregated service views. This provides situational awareness and early 
      response to help mitigate or prevent service disruptions, and allows IT 
      to precisely assure the end-to-end delivery of data, voice and 
      Telepresence services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Organizations are making significant investments in unified 
      communications tools. One of the barriers to successful UC adoption is 
      service performance that negatively impacts the user experience,&#8221; said 
      Steven Shalita, vice president, marketing, NetScout. &#8220;We help customers 
      implement a true unified service delivery management strategy that 
      enables customers to lower the total cost of IT operations by managing 
      the delivery of both business-critical data and UC services. With 
      NetScout, IT organizations can gain an enterprise-wide perspective of 
      the UC service delivery environment, enable a better view into actual 
      user experience, and simplify the end-to-end management of UC service 
      delivery.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby and Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/HELSINKI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - When a British
bookmaker installed Stephen Elop as favorite to take over the
soon-to-be-vacant CEO slot at Microsoft Corp last week,
most tech observers laughed it off as a publicity stunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft's purchase of Nokia's handset
business, announced late on Monday, has suddenly made Elop one
of the most visible candidates for the top spot at the company
where he once worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and others familiar with the board's thinking
reject any suggestion that the deal was done with Elop in mind,
and his track record at Nokia is decidedly mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, though, the understated, steely Canadian will
play a critical role in managing Microsoft's controversial entry
into the mobile handset market, and thus shape the future of the
software giant as it plunges headlong into the hardware
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper at least, 49-year-old Elop fits the role. He knows
broadly how Microsoft works, having spent nearly three years
there running the highly profitable Office unit, and has just
spent three years in the thick of the mobile war at Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is not enough time to cast him as an "insider" in
the minds of many looking to shake up insular Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are looking for Microsoft to go through some
dramatic change," said Kevin Walkush, an analyst at Jensen
Investment Management, which holds Microsoft shares. "He has a
very good understanding of what happens at Microsoft, and he has
made hard decisions in the face of big challenges. It's a pretty
strong combination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury is still out on whether Elop saved or put a nail in
Nokia's coffin by making the pivotal decision to adopt
Microsoft's Windows Phone system as its smartphone platform in
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's shares fell more than 60 percent during Elop's
tenure as CEO, and its sales collapsed as it jumped from its
long-held but outdated Symbian system to the largely untested
and unknown Windows, choosing it over the more popular Android
system by Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Nokia) only have 3 percent market share in
smartphones. They lost 40 percent of their revenue in mobile
phones in Q2. That's not a business on stable ground," said
Hakan Wranne, an analyst at Swedbank, summing up Elop's legacy.
"Of course we will never know what would've happened if they had
chosen Android."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRAIL TO FINLAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps it could have been worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of Elop as Nokia CEO in 2010, making him the
first non-Finn to lead the company, was seen by many at the
company as a breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many who survived the massive job cuts - around 40,000 since
his arrival - credited Elop for turning around a culture that
many said lacked speed, decisiveness and a sensitivity towards
demands of customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts credit him for speeding up product launches over
the past year by eliminating unnecessary processes and holding
individual executives more accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview in July, Elop said the company spent 22
months on the N8, which used the now-obsolete Symbian operating
system and was launched shortly after he joined the company.
With Windows phones, he got that down to six- to eight-month
delivery cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Finns were relieved the Canadian was more understated
than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer or other U.S. tech executives,
bonding with his adopted countrymen over a love of ice hockey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many were impressed he answered 10 to 20 emails from
customers each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is a nice guy. Everyone liked him. That's his strength,"
said one former Nokia employee who worked closely with Elop and
asked not to be named. "He is very down-to-earth, he answers all
of his email. His communication skills are very good, but he has
got a sense for the dramatic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop's dramatic side came to the fore with his startling
"Burning Platform" memo sent to staff shortly before he
announced the company would adopt Microsoft's Windows Phone in
early 2011, which essentially announced the death of Symbian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was an internal memo but he (Elop) knew it would get out
given the situation at Nokia," said the former Nokia employee
who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But outside the company it was broadly welcomed as the
jump-start Nokia needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He (Elop) changed the way Nokia operated. And he did a very
good job, he was fast at executing and changing the mind-set of
the company," said IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before he came to Microsoft in 2008, Elop was a fairly high
profile Chief Operating Officer at network equipment maker
Juniper Networks Inc and before that a president at
software firm Adobe Systems Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's got a technical background, he actually understands
engineering, he gets it," said Paul Murphy, formerly Elop's
chief of staff at Microsoft. "I've seen him interact with
customers, he's fantastic with customers in difficult
situations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less is known about Elop's stint as Chief Information
Officer of restaurant chain Boston Chicken from 1992 to 1998
when the company filed for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia deal is not expected to distract the special
committee from conducting a thorough search for a new CEO, said
one person with knowledge of the matter, hinting strongly that
Elop is not a shoo-in for the job, but admitting that he is a
probable candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People can point to his Nokia track record and say that he
failed, but he was really dealt a tough hand," said Walkush at
Jensen Investment Management. "He's demonstrated a lot of
leadership and ability."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Fitch said it may upgrade Nokia's speculative-grade debt rating after the company announced the sale of its handset business to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings said it placed Nokia's senior unsecured ratings of "BB-" on "Ratings Watch Positive" because of an expected improvement in its finances following the 5.4 billion euro ($7.2 billion) deal announced on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia has been struggling to reverse a decline in its cash position and fall in market share. In August, Fitch reaffirmed its "BB-" rating but said its long-term issuer default rating was negative, citing a lack of visibility in the devices and services (D) business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sale of the D business brings to a close a period of extreme stress in the credit profile of the handset industry's former leading manufacturer," Fitch said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch said Nokia's remaining operations, including Nokia Solutions &amp; Networks, a previous venture with Siemens which it bought out in early July, as well as a patent portfolio and navigation business, would hold strong capital and a significant net cash position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said a closure of the Microsoft deal would likely lead, at a minimum, to an affirmation of the current ratings at "BB-" with a stable outlook or a potential one-notch upgrade.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Fitch said
it may upgrade Nokia's speculative-grade debt rating
after the company announced the sale of its handset business to
Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings said it placed Nokia's senior unsecured
ratings of "BB-" on "Ratings Watch Positive" because of an
expected improvement in its finances following the 5.4 billion
euro ($7.2 billion) deal announced on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia has been struggling to reverse a decline in its cash
position and fall in market share. In August, Fitch reaffirmed
its "BB-" rating but said its long-term issuer default rating
was negative, citing a lack of visibility in the devices and
services (D) business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sale of the D business brings to a close a period of
extreme stress in the credit profile of the handset industry's
former leading manufacturer," Fitch said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch said Nokia's remaining operations, including Nokia
Solutions &amp; Networks, a previous venture with Siemens which it
bought out in early July, as well as a patent portfolio and
navigation business, would hold strong capital and a significant
net cash position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said a closure of the Microsoft deal would likely
lead, at a minimum, to an affirmation of the current ratings at
"BB-" with a stable outlook or a potential one-notch upgrade.
One notch up from "BB-" would be "BB", still speculative grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ritsuko Ando and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI/SEATTLE, Sept 3 (Reuters) - In an era when shiny
new tech start-ups can be worth tens of billions of dollars,
Microsoft's deal to acquire Nokia's mobile handset business for
5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion) is a modest one from a
strictly financial point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the deal is likely to go down as a major turning point
in the contemporary technology business, one that marks the end
of a Finnish company's unlikely run as world-beating tech icon
even as it shapes the future of Microsoft Corp - for
better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Finland, politicians and business leaders mourned the
fall of Nokia, while pensioners wondered what it all 
meant for them. In Seattle, the chatter centered on what the
deal might say about the race to succeed Microsoft Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer, who announced 10 days ago that he would
step down within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the global telecom industry, meanwhile, the deal signals
further consolidation, coming just a day after Verizon 
announced a $130 billion deal to buy Vodafone's stake in
its wireless unit. It could also help Microsoft achieve its
long-held ambition of becoming a major rival to Apple 
and Samsung in the global smartphone business,
though it will also put even more pressure on the company to
show that its massive investments in consumer devices make
sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia deal "unequivocally suggests they aren't exiting
the business and in fact are doubling down on mobile," said Todd
Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management,
which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can in all likelihood carve out a decent niche with
their scale as a fully integrated player, however investors are
questioning the merits," Lowenstein added. "The markets have
spoken volumes." Microsoft shares finished down 4.6 percent on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia and Microsoft have been joined at the hip since early
2011, when the Finnish company agreed to adopt Microsoft's
Windows Phone software for its smartphones - a big gamble for
Nokia, but one that came at a time when the company's market
share was already in a freefall and it had few good options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then Nokia has produced a series of Windows-powered
phones that were mostly well-reviewed by critics, though largely
shunned by customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been speculation from the start that Microsoft
might eventually buy Nokia, but many analysts thought Microsoft
had the best of both worlds - a committed hardware partner, but
none of the considerable downside risk that might go with owning
a phone-maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, though, friction developed, according to
a source familiar with the situation, especially after Microsoft
launched its Surface tablets last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each was trying to spend money on app developers, music
stores, all the parts critical to the ecosystem," said the
source. "It all came to a head at the end of last year,
beginning of this year - was this really the right way to work
or are we better as one entity?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions on an acquisition began in earnest in February,
after Ballmer approached Nokia for an "open dialogue." Ballmer
and Nokia board chairman Risto Siilasmaa met at the Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona. After a few hiccups the negotiations
kicked into high gear in July, with almost 50 board meetings on
the part of Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source close familiar with the negotiations said the
timing of the deal, which was called "Project Gold Medal" at
Microsoft, was influenced by Ballmer's announced departure, with
Nokia seeking to wrap it up before a new CEO was named. Nokia
officials were concerned that if it delayed it could end up with
facing a firesale down the road as its cash position worsened,
the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, moving ahead with a major strategic
acquisition even as it seeks a new CEO reaffirms its commitment
to being a broad-based "devices and services" company - a
strategy crafted by Ballmer and one which was at the heart of a
major reorganization announced just weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft called the Nokia deal "a huge leap
forward on our journey of creating a family of devices and
services that delight people and empower businesses of all
sizes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People close to the situation rejected the idea that the
transaction meant that Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, a former
Microsoft executive who will rejoin the company as head of the
devices and services division, would automatically succeed
Ballmer. But analysts said the move could make it harder to
bring in an outsider CEO who might want to revisit all aspects
of the  company's strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINLAND'S NATIONAL CHAMPION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's deal marks the breakup of a company almost
embedded in Finnish DNA, a once-proud symbol of Nordic
entrepreneurial engineering prowess and design. At its peak it
accounted for 40 percent of the world's mobile phones, a fifth
of Finland's exports and four percent of its GDP, and had a
market value of close to $300 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barely a decade ago, consumers talked about Nokia with the
same bated breadth as they do about Apple today, marvelling at
its sleek but practical designs. But its abrupt fall symbolises
the breakneck speed and unforgiving competition in consumer
electronics, where nimble rivals can quickly upset established
industry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia itself has had plenty of experience in reinvention
over its 148-year history. From its beginning as a paper
manufacturer in 1865, it grew to make everything from rubber
boots to televisions, and eventually its brand name was even
emblazoned on lavatory tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its modern incarnation began under Jorma Ollila, who headed
the cellphone unit beginning in 1990 and then, as chief
executive, transformed the Finnish conglomerate into a global
handset leader. Its brand name was often mistaken as Japanese,
something that at the time delighted a company whose home
country was harder to sell globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was something Finland hadn't had, this major consumer
brand," said Mikko Makipaa, an entrepreneur, recalling his days
at the company from 1996 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ollila was blamed for being late to recognise the threat
of Apple's iPhone and the smartphone revolution. A report by the
Research Institute of the Finnish Economy said Nokia developed
touch-screen phones three years before the iPhone and a tablet
as early as 2005, but they never reached the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop's appointment in 2010 was hailed for bringing Silicon
valley zip into the struggling company as rivals led by Apple
were gaining market share in high-end smartphones even as Asian
competitors were eating away at the cheaper, simpler end of the
handset market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Canadian with five children and an amateur pilot who had
previously headed Microsoft's business division, Elop was the
first non-Finn to head Nokia. At his first press conference -
broadcast live on Finnish TV - he played up his love for ice
hockey, a passion many Canadians share with Finns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His enthusiasm quickly endeared him to staff, but he was
also blunt. In a now-famous 2011 email to staff, he compared
Symbian - Nokia's then operating software - with a "burning
platform" that needed to be abandoned. It was dropped in favour
of a largely untested alternative from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in three jobs were cut, and one source who was there at
the time said the memo was ill-advised because it destroyed
sales of Symbian before the Windows phones were ready. Still, it
was mostly seen as the sort of bold stroke needed to rescue the
flailing company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Elop is viewed in a different light. "A Trojan horse,"
the widely-read tabloid Ilta-Sanomat declared in a column on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sounds like a betrayal to me," said Finnish pensioner
Paivi Rengman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, many in Finland saw the deal as a sign of deeper
malaise within the Finnish economy and its celebrated Nordic
welfare model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Finland, Nokia is emotional and symbolic. My generation
grew up with a Nokia in their pocket. We view the deal in
Finland as the end of an era," said Alexander Stubb, Finland's
minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia is not disappearing, and will now concentrate on its
networking equipment unit, navigation business and technology
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimists say it is not the first time Nokia has taken a big
bet. In the early 1990s it sold off businesses that accounted
for around 70 percent of its sales to focus on telecoms. That
followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, which halted a highly
profitable cross-border trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland also remains one of the few countries in the euro
zone with a triple-A credit rating. But its reputation as an
egalitarian society with top-notch education and health services
 belies worries about its once-mighty export manufacturers and 
rapidly ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a major challenge for Finland," said Tero
Kuittinen, an analyst at Alekstra. "Microsoft is unlikely to
keep any meaningful handset R or production in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2007, Finland had 60 percent of the global smartphone
market. That will now plunge to zero percent - a massive blow
for a country that bet so much on mobile technology," Kuittinen
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, Nokia's decline may have inoculated
Finland against a sudden shock. At its peak, Nokia accounted for
4 percent of Finnish GDP and supported myriad suppliers. Today
it contributes closer to 1 percent, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many former Nokia employees have helped to spawn a growing
IT industry, symbolised by fast-growing Rovio, maker of the
popular Angry Birds game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuittinen said that Rovio's Angry Birds empire has racked up
nearly 2 billion downloads while Supercell, another game
company, is getting close to $100 million in monthly revenue
from its two blockbusters, Hay Day and Clash of Clans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is that these two companies combined only have
700 or so employees," Kuittinen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for an upcoming generation, nostalgia about Nokia may
have been supplanted by straightforward realism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their share price is all that I'm interested in," said a
28-year-old business student named Aleksi, who declined to give
his last name. "I don't understand this crying about national
treasure being sold. People seem to think it's the year 2000.
Business is business. Nokia is not defining Finland."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the global tech business, the big question is to what
extent Nokia will define Microsoft. Activist shareholders, led
by ValueAct Capital, have urged the company to stop spending so
heavily on consumer products and instead return money to
shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's track record in both consumer devices and major
acquisitions does little to inspire confidence. Yet it remains
among the very few firms with the muscle to challenge the market
leaders in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I continue to believe that there is enough innovation in
devices, unlike some of our investors, that it will be a growth
opportunity in terms of the financial reward to the bold, to the
innovative who pursue it," Ballmer said Tuesday in explaining
the deal to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called the phone business "the best opportunity for
pursuing users in very, very large numbers." As Nokia learned
though, translating opportunity into success is the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WALTHAM, Mass., Sept. 4, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Repligen Corporation (Nasdaq:RGEN) announced today that it has received a $1 million milestone payment from Pfizer, Inc. under the terms of the companies' exclusive worldwide licensing agreement (the "Agreement") for the development of compounds to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This first milestone payment was triggered by completion of specific program activities and coincides with the successful completion of all transition obligations by Repligen. Repligen announced the Agreement in January of this year, at which time it received an upfront payment of $5 million. Repligen remains eligible to receive up to $64 million in additional success-based milestone payments, as well as royalties on any future sales of compounds developed under the Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Consistent with our strategic decision last August to focus on building Repligen's bioprocessing business while scaling back our investment in therapeutics, we out-licensed the SMA program and have successfully completed its transition to Pfizer," said Walter C. Herlihy, Ph.D., President and CEO of Repligen. "We believe the Agreement preserves the potential for the SMA program to deliver significant long-term upside for our shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Repligen originally in-licensed the SMA program from Families of SMA (FSMA), a patient organization dedicated to supporting research to advance therapies for SMA. FSMA funded and directed the preclinical development of the program's lead compound, RG3039, with an investment of more than $13 million. This was the first drug discovery program ever conducted specifically for SMA. The Muscular Dystrophy Association also provided critical support to Repligen's research and clinical efforts, including the conduct of a Phase 1b trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Spinal Muscular Atrophy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease in which a defect in the SMN1 (survival motor neuron) gene results in low levels of the protein SMN and leads to progressive damage to motor neurons. It is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality and the second most common inherited neuromuscular disease, with symptoms that typically emerge before the age of two. SMA is characterized by progressive muscle weakness leading to severe physical disability and often, early loss of life due to respiratory insufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today at World Water Week in Stockholm, The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) and 
      Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) announced the Company&#8217;s 
      support of new programs in four African countries - Kenya, Zambia, 
      Madagascar, and Mozambique. The funding, a total of $4.6MM from The 
      Coca-Cola Africa Foundation, will support sustainable solutions to clean 
      water and sanitation service delivery for at least 270,000 people in 
      urban and peri-urban areas. Activities to be supported include the 
      development of water kiosks and storage tanks for local communities, 
      sustainable water supply services and capacity building of local service 
      providers. The Coca-Cola funding will also be matched by WSUP partners, 
      local communities and governments. The programs are to be part of the 
      Company&#8217;s Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN), an effort providing at 
      least 2MM people with clean water access by the end of 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WSUP, a non-profit partnership between the private sector, NGOs and 
      research institutions, focuses on solving global problems of inadequate 
      water and sanitation in low-income urban communities. Highlights of the 
      work to be supported include a range of approaches that offer lasting 
      clean water and sanitation services in partnership with local water 
      utilities, businesses, authorities and the communities they service to 
      support government objectives, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Kenya - At least 45,000 people will benefit from the RAIN-WSUP 
        intervention in the Kiu, Mirera, Karagita, Kamere, Kwa Muhia and 
        Kasarani peri-urban settlements of Naivasha Municipality, next to the 
        internationally renowned Lake Naivasha in the Rift Valley Province. 
        The effort will establish water treatment, storage and distribution 
        networks to provide safe water to local communities affected by dental 
        and skeletal fluorosis, due to the high levels of fluoride in the 
        underground water. Water kiosks and storage tanks will be constructed 
        with a fluoride filtration system. The project will also rehabilitate 
        boreholes, expanding access to clean and affordable water to 
        low-income inhabitants. Sanitation improvement activities will include 
        the rehabilitation of yard latrine units, the development and 
        implementation of a sanitation marketing strategy, and the training of 
        artisans and community based enterprises in production of sanitation 
        products. Local women will take an active role in the project through 
        leadership roles and potential employment in local water and 
        sanitation enterprises.
      
			
				Zambia
					- The RAIN-WSUP project will provide equitable 
        and safe water access to the 63,000 people of Chainda and Bauleni, low 
        income peri-urban communities near Lusaka. The project will support 
        the development of a sustainable water supply service delivery model 
        by Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC), the municipal service 
        provider. Activities will include the improvement of the existing 
        water system, the training of LWSC staff and communities in the use of 
        newly introduced innovative pre-paid water dispensers, the 
        mobilization and engagement of the communities, improved sanitation 
        facilities and the establishment of new delegated management 
        structures. In addition, this project will promote women&#8217;s empowerment 
        by employing women as water vendors.
      
			
				Madagascar - The RAIN-WSUP project will expand service for low 
        income peri-urban communities of Antananarivo by building the capacity 
        of Jiro sy Rano Malagasy (JIRAMA), the local service provider, to 
        support their delivery of water and sanitation services sustainably on 
        a city-wide scale. Specific activities include the construction of 73 
        water kiosks and eight laundry blocks in the city&#8217;s seven Communes, 
        the training of the community in facility management, and the capacity 
        building of JIRAMA&#8217;s staff in Non-Revenue Water (NRW) prevention. The 
        project will benefit 142,000 people and contribute to improvements in 
        health, livelihoods, gender equality and reduced poverty. Women in the 
        community will be encouraged to take on leadership roles throughout 
        the development of the project and have the opportunity to generate 
        income through the newly-built laundry blocks.
      
			
				Mozambique - The RAIN-WSUP project will scale activities to 
        provide safe and sustainable drinking water to target peri-urban 
        communities of Maputo and build the capacity of &#193;guas da Regi&#227;o de 
        Maputo (AdeM), the water utility. Sanitation interventions will 
        include the development of communal and shared sanitation facilities, 
        the improvement of sanitation in schools and the implementation of 
        drainage improvements to realize the full health impacts of better 
        water and sanitation. An estimated 28,250 people will benefit from the 
        RAIN-WSUP project. Women will be included in all phases of the project 
        and opportunities for women&#8217;s employment in water stand-post 
        operations will be provided.

			About RAIN
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In response to the severe water challenges faced by the nearly 300 
      million Africans living without access to clean water, TCCAF introduced 
      the Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN) in 2009. RAIN recognizes the 
      water projects that TCCC and its bottling partners have already 
      supported on the continent (since 2005) and highlights TCCC&#8217;s new 
      investment of US$30-million over six years (2010 to 2015) to water 
      projects in Africa. RAIN aims to provide over 2 million people in Africa 
      with access to clean water by the end of 2015. RAIN is TCCC&#8217;s 
      contribution to helping Africa achieve the United Nation&#8217;s Millennium 
      Development Goals on clean water and sanitation access. TCCAF will 
      leverage this US$30-million investment and aims to attract 
      dollar-for-dollar match funding through 2015.

			Smithers Pira: Tetra Pak, Ikea, Procter  
      Gamble, HP and others to address the Pira Packaging Summit 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Smithers Pira have announced the agenda for their 4th 
      annual Pira Packaging Summit, held in association with Packaging News
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite difficult market conditions in Western Europe, there remain 
      added-value growth opportunities for the packaging industry, especially 
      in areas like barrier materials, with retailers and brand owners on the 
      lookout for advanced technological solutions able to extend shelf life 
      and enhance food flavours, etc. At the same time, greater demands are 
      being put upon the packaging industry to help their customers develop 
      effective sustainability strategies, but in all instances those that 
      adopt the right path in terms of innovation are likely to be rewarded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For firms to position themselves to take advantage of this growth 
      potential, executives need to understand how a wide range of drivers 
      will co-relate to create the packaging market of the future. The Pira 
      Packaging Summit is a leadership forum which brings together senior 
      decision-makers throughout the industry to discuss these key strategic 
      challenges and long term strategies for success.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Held in association with Packaging News, this year&#8217;s conference is 
      taking place 12-13 November, at the Millennium Mayfair, and precedes the 
      UK Packaging Awards, the biggest and most prestigious awards ceremony 
      for the packaging sector.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The programme focuses on the packaging business environment, featuring 
      latest Smithers Pira market forecasts to 2018, plus insights into the 
      impacts of MA, consumer drivers and economic trends on the packaging 
      competitive landscape, now and in the future. Communication and 
      collaboration is also a concurrent theme in this year&#8217;s agenda, 
      including case studies of partnerships along the supply chain from Tetra 
      Pak, Dow and Brueckner Maschinenbau.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to a snapshot of the current technical advances for 
      packaging, in the form of active and intelligent packaging and short-run 
      customisation opportunities, safety and sustainability of packaging will 
      be addressed by EUROPEN and Ikea, highlighting their views on the 
      sustainability impacts of packaging, alongside an overview of the impact 
      of GPPS metrics from Environmental Packaging International.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The conference will also feature extended time for debate and discussion 
      amongst speakers and attendees in targeted panel discussions, to address 
      supply chain challenges and future opportunities in packaging. Alongside 
      extensive networking opportunities with decision makers in your 
      industry, London is the place to be this November.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is expected
to advance maintenance at its 900,000 tonnes per year (tpy)
steam cracker in Singapore that feeds on naphtha and heavy
residue to around mid-September from October, trade and industry
sources said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when contacted, the company's spokeswoman said it was
not in Exxon's practice to discuss operational details of their
facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon operates two crackers that produce a total of 1.9
million tpy of ethylene, a feedstock for petrochemical products
including plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders said the shutdown, which will likely last between
four and six weeks, is not expected to impact the naphtha market
since Exxon's cracker is not solely dependent on the light end
feedstock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shutdown, however, coincides with Asia's top naphtha
importer Formosa's maintenance at its 1.03 million tpy No. 2
cracker in Mailiao, Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's acquisition of Nokia's handset business gives the software behemoth control of its main Windows smartphone partner, but leaves a question mark over the bigger business it has bought: Nokia's cheap and basic phones that still dominate emerging markets like India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has said he sees such phones - of which Nokia shipped more than 50 million last quarter - as an entree to more expensive fare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look at that as an excellent feeder system into the smartphone world and a way to touch people with our services even on much lower-end devices in many parts of the world," he said in a conference call to analysts on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts warn that's easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, said Jayanth Kolla, partner at Convergence Catalyst, an India-based telecom research and advisory firm, is that Microsoft simply lacks Nokia's retail and supply chain experience in the Finnish company's most important markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The devices business, especially the non-smartphones business in emerging markets, is a completely different dynamic," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kolla pointed to the need to manage tight supply chains, distribution, and building brands through word-of-mouth. "Microsoft doesn't have it in its DNA to run operations at this level," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is a case in point. Nokia has been there since the mid 1990s and the country accounted for 7 percent of its 2012 revenue while the United States generated just 6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Its India roots run deep: it has a presence in 200,000 outlets, 70,000 of which sell only its devices. One of its biggest plants in the world is in the southern city of Chennai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sure, Nokia has slipped in India as elsewhere: After nearly two decades as the market leader it was unseated by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in overall sales last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it still sold more of its more basic feature phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As recently as last October, market research company Nielsen ranked it the top handset brand. The Economic Times ranked it the country's third most trusted brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOYALTY RUNS DEEP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a land of frequent power cuts and rugged roads, the sturdiness and longer battery life of Nokia's phones have won it a loyal fan base - some of whom have stayed loyal when trading up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take Sunil Sachdeva, a Delhi-based executive, who has stuck with Nokia since his first phone. He has just bought his fifth: an upgrade to the Nokia Lumia smartphone running Microsoft's mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Technology-wise they are still the best," he said of Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft can't take such loyalty for granted. Challenging it and Samsung are local players such as Karbonn and Micromax, which are churning out smartphones running Google Inc's Android operating system for as little as $50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such players are also denting Nokia's efforts to build its Asha brand, touchscreen devices perched somewhere between a feature phone and a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia shipped 4.3 million Asha phones globally in the second quarter of this year, down from 5.0 million the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sales performance of the Asha line has been quite poor," said Sameer Singh, Hyderabad-based analyst at BitChemy Ventures, an investor in local startups. "With increasing competition from the low-end smartphone vendors, I'm unsure how long that business will last."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves the cheap seats. Singh estimates that the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa accounted for two-thirds of Nokia's feature phone volumes in the last quarter, at an average selling price of between 25 to 30 euros ($32.99 to $39.59).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see how Microsoft can really leverage this volume," he said. "The market is extremely price sensitive and margins are racing into negative territory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOO BIG TO IGNORE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quandary for Microsoft is that while the basic phone market may be declining, it may simply be too big to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at markets like India and Indonesia, more than 70 percent of the volume comes from the feature phone business," Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at Gartner said. "It's still a significant part of the overall market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that if Microsoft wants to herd this market up the value chain to its Windows phones, it needs to keep the Nokia and Asha brands afloat - while also narrowing the price gap between its smartphones and the feature phones and cheap smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has hinted that lowering prices of smartphones would be a priority. The Windows Phone series includes the top-end Lumia 1020, which comes with a 41-megapixel camera, while it also sells simpler models such as the Lumia 610 and 620 aimed at first-time smartphone buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The lower price phone is a strategic initiative for the next Windows Phone release," Terry Myerson, vice president of operating systems said on the same conference call, while declining to provide details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An option for Microsoft, analysts said, would be to shoe-horn services like Bing search, Outlook webmail and Skype, the Internet telephony and messaging application, into the lower-end phones as a way to drive traffic to those services and make the devices more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So you can bundle services with these low-end products and that way you can reach a wider audience," said Finland-based Nordea Markets analyst Sami Sarkamies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the meantime Microsoft needs to brace for assault on all fronts as emerging market rivals see an opportunity to eat further into Nokia's market share. In India, said Convergent Catalyst's Kolla, cheap local Android brands have been held back by Nokia's strong promotion of its mid-tier Asha brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, I expect them to pounce," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) has decided to get out of the student loan business, after the biggest U.S. bank concluded that competition from federal government programs and increased scrutiny from regulators had limited its ability to expand the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which already restricted student loans to existing Chase bank customers, will stop accepting applications for private student loans on October 12, at the end of the peak borrowing season for this school year, according to a memo from the company to colleges that was reviewed by Reuters on Thursday. Final loan disbursements are expected before March 15, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just don't see this as a market that we can significantly grow," said Thasunda Duckett, chief executive for auto and student loans at Chase, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not making more loans "puts us in a position to redeploy those resources, as well as focus on our No. 1 priority, which is getting the regulatory control environment strengthened," Duckett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's decision comes after Congress acted in mid-2010 to bypass the banks and have the government lend directly to students. The federal government now issues 93 percent of student loans. Banks and other private lenders have also come under pressure from regulators and politicians to offer more flexible repayment terms on student loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's portfolio has been shrinking by roughly $1 billion to $2 billion a year since then, and is a small fraction of its assets. The company's student loan portfolio at the end of June held $11 billion - less than 0.5 percent - of its $2.44 trillion of assets. Last year, Chase made education loans to 12,500 people for a total of about $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of students, however, still look to private lenders when they have exhausted their federal borrowing limit. Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said decisions like JPMorgan's show that the government's direct lending policies are leading to "less competition in the marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the government programs encourage students to take on more debt than they can afford because the loans, unlike those made by banks, do not require assessments of the ability to repay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many experts have said that the primary problem with student lending lies in how much college costs and in the sheer size of the debt taken on, not in who makes the loans and how they are structured and how much they cost in interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, others may fill in the gap. Other major lenders that remain in the business include SLM Corp (SLM.O), known as Sallie Mae; Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N); and Discover Financial Services (DFS.N). Both Wells and Discover said on Thursday that they would continue to make student loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny Ray, president of Discover Student Loans, said although competition from the government has taken business from lending for graduate studies, his bank found more demand from undergraduate students who have already reached their government borrowing limits and are still short of the money they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit unions could also use exits by banks such as JPMorgan as an opportunity to do more business. Many entered the market in 2010 and have made about $2 billion of student loans since then, according to Paul Gentile, executive vice president of the Credit Union National Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's decision follows a broader, ongoing review of businesses amid new regulations, heightened scrutiny and capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, the bank said it would exit physical commodities trading, as Wall Street's role in the trading of raw materials comes under political and regulatory pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, the bank said its private equity unit, One Equity Partners, would become independent, as it increased its focus on client businesses.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has
decided to get out of the student loan business, after the
biggest U.S. bank concluded that competition from federal
government programs and increased scrutiny from regulators had
limited its ability to expand the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which already restricted student loans to existing
Chase bank customers, will stop accepting applications for
private student loans on Oct. 12, at the end of the peak
borrowing season for this school year, according to a memo from
the company to colleges that was reviewed by Reuters on
Thursday. Final loan disbursements are expected before March 15,
2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just don't see this as a market that we can
significantly grow," said Thasunda Duckett, chief executive for
auto and student loans at Chase, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not making more loans "puts us in a position to redeploy
those resources, as well as focus on our No. 1 priority, which
is getting the regulatory control environment strengthened,"
Duckett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's decision comes after Congress acted in mid-2010
to bypass the banks and have the government lend directly to
students. The federal government now issues 93 percent of
student loans. Banks and other private lenders have also come
under pressure from regulators and politicians to offer more
flexible repayment terms on student loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's portfolio has been shrinking by roughly $1
billion to $2 billion a year since then, and is a small fraction
of its assets. The company's student loan portfolio at the end
of June held $11 billion - less than 0.5 percent - of its $2.44
trillion of assets. Last year, Chase made education loans to
12,500 people for a total of about $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of students, however, still look to
private lenders when they have exhausted their federal borrowing
limit. Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers
Association, said decisions like JPMorgan's show that the
government's direct lending policies are leading to "less
competition in the marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the government programs encourage students to take
on more debt than they can afford because the loans, unlike
those made by banks, do not require assessments of the ability
to repay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many experts have said that the primary problem with
student lending lies in how much college costs and in the sheer
size of the debt taken on, not in who makes the loans and how
they are structured and how much they cost in
interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, others may fill in the gap. Other major lenders
that remain in the business include SLM Corp, known as
Sallie Mae; Wells Fargo &amp; Co ; and Discover Financial
Services. Both Wells and Discover said on Thursday that
they would continue to make student loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny Ray, president of Discover Student Loans, said
although competition from the government has taken business from
lending for graduate studies, his bank found more demand from
undergraduate students who have already reached their government
borrowing limits and are still short of the money they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit unions could also use exits by banks such as
JPMorgan as an opportunity to do more business. Many entered the
market in 2010 and have made about $2 billion of student loans
since then, according to Paul Gentile, executive vice president
of the Credit Union National Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's decision follows a broader, ongoing review of
businesses amid new regulations, heightened scrutiny and capital
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, the bank said it would exit physical commodities
trading, as Wall Street's role in the trading of raw materials
comes under political and regulatory pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, the bank said its private equity unit, One Equity
Partners, would become independent, as it increased its focus on
client businesses. At the time, a source said the move was also
driven by the bank's decision to simplify its operating
structure.&lt;/p&gt;

      Trusts
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4391- 'A+/F1', Stable Outlook; DRIVERs, Series 4391 
      -'A+', Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4393 'F1+/F1'; DRIVERs, Series 4393 'F1+';
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'A+', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4391 
      PUTTERs and DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to 
      Citizens Property Insurance Corp SIFMA Floating Rate Senior Secured 
      Notes Series 2012A-3 (rated 'A+', Stable Outlook) that have been 
      deposited in the series 4391 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4391 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facilities provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      'A+/F1', Stable Outlook).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 'F1+/F1' ratings assigned to the series 4393 and 4394 PUTTERs are 
      based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to the State of Texas Tax 
      and Revenue Anticipation Notes Series 2013 (Notes; currently rated 'F1+' 
      by Fitch) deposited in the Trust and the liquidity facilities provided 
      by JPMorgan Chase  Co. for both series of PUTTERs. The 'F1+' rating 
      assigned to the series 4393 and 4394 DRIVERs is based solely on the 
      rating assigned by Fitch to the notes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4391, 4393 and 4394 PUTTERs based 
      on the liquidity facilities will expire on June 30, 2014, the expiration 
      date of the liquidity facilities, unless such date is extended or 
      earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs based on the liquidity 
      facilities reflects the short-term rating that Fitch maintains on the 
      bank providing liquidity support and will be adjusted upward or downward 
      in conjunction with the short-term rating of the bank, and, in some 
      cases, the long-term rating of the underlying bonds deposited in the 
      trust. The short-term ratings assigned to the series 4393 and 4394 
      PUTTERs based on the notes is exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the notes deposited in the trust and will reflect all changes to the 
      rating of the notes. The long-term ratings assigned to the series 4393 
      and 4393 PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the 
      creditworthiness of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will 
      reflect all changes to the underlying bond ratings.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds names of competitors, background on JPMorgan's regulatory
issues)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
will stop making student loans in October, according to a
document reviewed by Reuters on Thursday, after the biggest U.S.
bank concluded that competition from federal government programs
limits its ability to expand the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will stop accepting applications for private
student loans on Oct. 12, at the end of the peak borrowing
season for this school year, according to a memo from the
company to colleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move means less competition for remaining players in the
market, such as Wells Fargo &amp; Co and Discover Financial
Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just don't see this as a market that we can
significantly grow," said Thasunda Duckett, chief executive for
auto and student loans at Chase, in an interview on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not making more loans "puts us in a position to redeploy
those resources, as well as focus on our No. 1 priority, which
is getting the regulatory control environment strengthened," she
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was ordered by federal regulators in January to
strengthen its risk controls and its compliance with anti-money
laundering standards after the company came under intense
scrutiny following its $6.2 billion "London Whale" derivatives
loss. CEO Jamie Dimon vowed in April to make the company's
controls his number one priority and said the bank would scale
back some of its growth initiatives to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision follows the bank's move last year to make
education loans available only to existing Chase bank customers.
The retail bank has some 64 million customers and 5,657
branches. Last year, Chase made education loans to 12,500 people
for a total of about $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's student loan portfolio at the end of June held
$11 billion - less than 0.5 percent - of JPMorgan's $2.44
trillion of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The student loan business is not among those that JPMorgan
has publicly said are being probed by government authorities for
possibly illegal practices. Those under investigation include
mortgage banking, credit card collections, rate-setting for
floating-rate business loans and hiring for investment banking
in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chase portfolio includes $5 billion of private loans and
$6 billion of loans backed by government guarantees that were
granted under programs that have been discontinued. The
portfolio has been shrinking by roughly $1 billion to $2 billion
a year since mid-2010, when Congress acted to bypass the banks
and have the government lend directly to students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private lending for education declined sharply after the
financial crisis, falling from $23 billion in the 2007-08 school
year to $6 billion, or less than 10 percent of total student
loans, in 2011-12, according to data private lenders have cited
from The College Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exit by Chase means one less competitor for other
lenders still in the market. SLM Corp, often known as
Sallie Mae, Wells Fargo and Discover have bigger
portfolios, according to company disclosures and research by
stock analyst Moshe Orenbuch of CreditSuisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover has made student lending a key element of its
strategy to grow beyond its credit card business, according to
presentations the company has made to investors. To reduce the
chance of losses on the loans, the company disburses loan
proceeds directly to schools, seeks co-signers on loans and
emphasizes financing for four-year and graduate programs and
not-for-profit institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover made its big move into the market when it bought
student loans in 2010 from Citigroup as that company was
retreating from the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Chase memo to colleges, which the company plans to
send on Friday, the company said it will continue to process
loan applications received before Oct. 12. Final loan
disbursements are expected before March 15, 2014.

			Miami-Dade Residents Get Boot-Camp Fit with Coca-Cola Troops for 
      Fitness Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez and The Coca-Cola Foundation Announce Details of 
      a Grant to Hire Veterans and Inspire Healthier Living
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Two dozen veterans will be hired to kick-off Coca-Cola Troops for 
      Fitness throughout Miami-Dade with a grant to the Parks Foundation of 
      Miami-Dade. Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez announced the more than $190,000 
      grant awarded by The Coca-Cola Foundation and managed by the National 
      Recreation and Park Association (NRPA). Miami-Dade Parks, Recreation and 
      Open Spaces will oversee the roll out of Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness, a 
      military-style fitness program led by U.S. military veterans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness supports our county&#8217;s 'Live a Park Life at 
      Miami-Dade Parks' initiative which is designed to help people get fit in 
      unconventional ways,&#8221; said Mayor Gimenez. &#8220;Together with Coca-Cola, NRPA 
      and the Parks Foundation of Miami-Dade, we&#8217;re going to be able to create 
      new and fun ways for thousands of our residents to get fit and 
      rediscover the joy of being active.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, the grant will support nutrition and physical activity 
      programs offered at the county&#8217;s 13 community centers. By the end of 
      2016, more than 5,000 Miami-Dade residents will have increased access to 
      health and wellness programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Obesity is a complex issue that cannot be solved overnight. We must 
      work together with leaders like Mayor Gimenez and the Parks Foundation 
      of Miami-Dade to find workable solutions for a healthier community,&#8221; 
      said Sonya Soutus, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and 
      Communications, Coca-Cola North America Group. &#8220;Through Coca-Cola Troops 
      for Fitness, we are showing that getting fit can be fun for people of 
      all ages.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through a $3 million grant to NRPA, Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness will 
      roll out in 12 communities over the next three years. Miami-Dade County 
      will join Chicago and San Antonio as the third major U.S. metropolitan 
      area to implement Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness. Additional cities that 
      will activate Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness in 2013 include Atlanta, 
      Newark and Sacramento.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Active living and nutrition are keys to good health,&#8221; said Miami-Dade 
      County District Commissioner Jean Monestime. &#8220;Hiring our nation&#8217;s heroes 
      to lead this health and wellness initiative is a win-win.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Miami-Dade County&#8217;s Military Affairs Board, under the leadership of 
      Miami-Dade County Commissioner Jose &#8220;Pepe&#8221; Diaz, will work to spread the 
      recruitment message. The Board serves as an advocate for active duty, 
      reserve, retired, disabled and deceased military personnel in Miami-Dade 
      County.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among the first veterans hired is Laura Ortiz, an amputee and veteran 
      who served in the Army National Guard for eight years. Ortiz, who 
      received both Gold and Silver medals in U.S. Paralympic track events, 
      will serve as a fitness instructor. Ian Cummings, a U.S. Coast Guard 
      veteran who operates boot-camp style classes at Deerwood-Bonita Lakes 
      Park, will also be among the first hired.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;More and more, well-respected companies are keenly aware of the 
      economic, social and health benefits of investing in parks and parks 
      programming,&#8221; said Dick Anderson, President of the Parks Foundation of 
      Miami-Dade. &#8220;Thanks to Coca-Cola and NRPA, this opportunity will 
      directly impact the health and wellness of Miami-Dade residents and 
      enable our parks and recreation to continue providing leadership in 
      health and wellness.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
			BMC Software Reduces IBM&#174;* Mainframe 
      Software Operating Costs by More than 20 Percent
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Powerful BMC Cost Analyzer for zEnterprise Saves CIOs Big Money
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BMC Software (NASDAQ: BMC) today introduced a powerful new product 
      designed to save CIOs millions of dollars by slashing their IBM&#174; 
      mainframe software expenses by more than 20 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BMC Cost Analyzer for zEnterprise delivers easy-to-use predictive 
      analytics designed to help IT departments plan, report and reduce their 
      mainframe licensing charge (MLC) by identifying system peaks and 
      recommending preemptive cost-reduction strategies. After deploying the 
      BMC Cost Analyzer, a typical customer consuming 5,000 MIPS (million 
      instructions per second) -- at an annual cost of $3.6 million -- could 
      save $720,000 or more with the new BMC solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The proof is there, according to Swiss Re Group, a leading wholesale 
      provider of reinsurance, insurance and other insurance-based forms of 
      risk transfer. As a first adopter, Swiss Re has been active in the BMC 
      Cost Analyzer beta and development program. The company also is a member 
      of the BMC Mainframe Advisory council.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key Points to Know
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				IT pays Big Blue &#8216;Big Bucks&#8217;. IBM&#174; mainframe MLC 
        costs are increasing more than seven percent annually. A drill-down 
        reveals that the cost of core IBM&#174; software is 35 percent 
        or more &#8211; the largest single line item in today&#8217;s mainframe budget. 
        BMC Cost Analyzer can slash that by 20 percent or more.
      
			
				The razor&#8217;s edge is sharp. Management walks a fine line between 
        making manual cost adjustments and preserving digital services, all 
        with very limited transparency into the merit or success of MLC cost 
        management efforts.
      
			
				BMC mainframe innovation blitz. The company has released six 
        major new mainframe products in the past 12 months including BMC 
        Application Accelerator for IMS, BMC Workbench for DB2&#174;, 
        and BMC Control-M Workload Automation JCL Verify. BMC continues to 
        empower IT to align cost reduction strategies with digital services, 
        providing CIOs with better insight and leverage in cost negotiations. 
        With BMC, customers can reduce monthly mainframe costs and delay 
        upgrades by replacing existing competitive tools with innovative, 
        resource-efficient mainframe management solutions from BMC.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Supporting Perspectives
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Eduardo J. Ciliendo, Head of Mainframe &#8211; Swiss Re:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to be using such an innovative product. IBM&#174; 
      offers mainframe customers great flexibility with the variable MLC 
      model. Thanks to BMC we now have a tool to fully exploit this 
      flexibility. The power and insight of BMC Cost Analyzer for zEnterprise 
      is something customers have wanted for a long time. We believe the new 
      BMC mainframe cost analyzer technology will play an important role in 
      making the mainframe more visible to LOB executives that own Swiss Re's 
      critical business processes and in reducing their mainframe costs. &#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Jay Lipovich, Director of Solutions Marketing, BMC Software:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the launch of BMC Cost Analyzer for zEnterprise, BMC Software 
      again shows why it is the leader in low-cost mainframe management 
      solutions. BMC Cost Analyzer lets IT management take aim at reducing the 
      big cost item in the budget &#8211; monthly MLC costs. The solution gives them 
      the clarity to see what can be done, the accuracy to know just what will 
      happen, and the confidence to act in reducing mainframe costs.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STOCKHOLM, Sept. 5, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- &lt;/p&gt;  * Mediaroom is the world's most deployed IPTV platform, serving almost 13
    million consumer households
  * Acquisition confirms Ericsson as a world leader for cutting edge TV-over-IP
    delivery with a combined market share of around 25%
  * Deal represents a strategic addition to Ericsson's multi-screen offering

Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) has today completed the acquisition of Microsoft's
Mediaroom business and TV solution. Together with Ericsson's existing
capability, the acquisition places the firm as the world's largest, by market
share, and the most experienced provider of IPTV middleware technology and
solutions.

As the most deployed IPTV platform, with a global market share of around 25%,
Mediaroom-powered TV services are offered by nearly 60 of the world's leading
operators, delivering services to almost 13 million households, and close to 24
million set top boxes, throughout the world.

Per Borgklint, Senior Vice President and Head of Business Unit Support Solutions
at Ericsson said: "This acquisition places us even more securely at the heart of
an exciting and highly innovative industry. IPTV subscribers alone are predicted
to grow by more than 18% each year to reach 105 million subscribers and revenue
of USD 45 b. by 2015. By incorporating Mediaroom into our broad portfolio of
solutions we will ensure our customers have the ultimate partner as they
transform towards true TV Anywhere multi-screen services and optimized video
delivery in any network"

Alongside some of the largest and most innovative telecoms operator customers
and a world renowned telecoms video brand and solution, the acquisition brings
to Ericsson a skilled team with deep experience in the development and delivery
of innovative IPTV services.

Mediaroom is based in Mountain View, California, and is comprised of more than
400 people worldwide. The former Mediaroom business unit, including staff, will
be integrated into the Ericsson group under the Business Unit Support Solutions,
and will be called Ericsson Mediaroom as of today.

Today's closing follows the announcement on April 8, 2013, that Ericsson was
entering into an agreement to purchase Microsoft's Mediaroom business.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - A $410 million settlement by
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co of alleged manipulation in the power
market served the public interest more than an uncertain legal
fight to punish individual bank executives, a U.S. regulator has
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a reply to lawmakers' questions late last month, the
chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wrote that
it had to weigh a certain settlement with JPMorgan against the
costs and risks of taking the company to court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while FERC has sharpened its enforcement tools to curb
manipulation in the market, both the regulator and lawmakers
have said loopholes remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC and its sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, have not yet agreed how to share information,
something that is required by the 2010 Dodd Frank law, it said
in a separate letter to lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC blamed the CFTC - the derivatives markets supervisor -
for being unwilling to share certain data that is "critical" to
fight market manipulation, FERC said in the letter in response
to a request from three senators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senators had asked the two agencies for an update on how
they had improved their cooperation, after the FERC lost a court
battle against the CFTC in March over who had jurisdiction to
fine a futures trader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC said it was still reviewing the letter and would
withhold comment for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC FINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defending its decision on JPMorgan, FERC Chairman Jon
Wellinghoff said the immediate cash penalty and costs to the
bank's reputation were a valuable message to the market that the
regulator will not tolerate abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission concluded that, on balance, acceptance of
the settlement containing these substantial, immediate benefits
for ratepayers and the public was preferable to jeopardizing
those benefits through the considerable delay and uncertainty
posed by pursuing actions against individual JP Morgan
employees," he said in a letter dated Aug. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC alleged that JPMorgan used its position to exploit
loopholes in the California and Michigan power markets.
Specifically, according to the settlement, JPMorgan would
quickly move in and out of the market to make sure that it got
payed high rates for operating its power plants at low levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late July, a day after FERC announced its settlement, two
Democratic Senators asked whether the regulator could not have
gotten more concessions from the Wall Street giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned about whether the settlement includes
adequate refunds to defrauded ratepayers and also concerned that
the individual executives who sought to impede the Commission's
investigation will not be punished," Massachusetts senators
Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the settlement paperwork, FERC and the bank acknowledge
that JPMorgan's commodities chief Blythe Masters and other
executives were briefed on aspects of the power plants that were
losing money in operations but earning millions of dollars in
profits as parts of energy trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are conducting a criminal investigation
into whether JPMorgan employees tried to impede the FERC
investigation, according to multiple sources familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESPOO, Finland, Sept. 6, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- &lt;/p&gt;Nokia Corporation
Stock exchange release
September 6, 2013 at 18.40 (CET+1)

Espoo, Finland - On September 3, 2013 Nokia announced that, in connection with
its announcement to sell to Microsoft Corporation substantially all of its
Devices  Services business (the "Sale of the DS Business"), Microsoft had
agreed to make available to Nokia EUR 1.5 billion of financing in the form of
three EUR 500 million tranches of convertible bonds.

Today, Nokia announces that it has decided to draw down all of this financing
and thus Nokia will issue three tranches of senior unsecured convertible bonds,
each with a nominal value of EUR 500 million (the "Bonds"). Nokia's Board of
Directors decided today to issue the Bonds on the basis of the authorization
granted by the Annual General Meeting of Nokia held on May 7, 2013.

Nokia intends to use the proceeds of the offering to prepay financing raised for
the acquisition of the shares in NSN which was completed in August 2013 and for
general corporate purposes.

The key terms of the Bonds to be issued are as follows:

- The first tranche (the "2018 Bonds") matures in 5 years and has a 1.125% per
annum coupon payable semi-annually with an initial conversion price of EUR
3.9338.

- The second tranche (the "2019 Bonds") matures in 6 years and has a 2.5% per
annum coupon payable semi-annually with an initial conversion price of EUR
4.0851.

- The third tranche (the "2020 Bonds") matures in 7 years and has a 3.625% per
annum coupon payable semi-annually with an initial conversion price of EUR
4.2364.

If the Sale of the DS Business is completed, the Bonds will be redeemed and the
principal amount and accrued interest netted against the Sale of the DS
Business proceeds.

All the Bonds are issued at par and will be redeemed at par on the closing date
of the Sale of the DS Business. Should the Sale of the DS Business not be
completed, the Bonds will be redeemed at par on their respective maturity dates,
unless otherwise redeemed, purchased, converted or cancelled in accordance with
their terms.

The Bonds are expected to be issued on or about September 23, 2013.

Microsoft has agreed not to sell any of the Bonds or convert any of the Bonds to
Nokia shares prior to the closing of the Sale of the DS business.

Should the Sale of the DS Business not be completed, Microsoft would have the
right to sell the 2018 Bonds immediately. Microsoft has agreed not to sell any
of the 2019 Bonds prior to the second anniversary of their issuance date and any
of the 2020 Bonds prior to the third anniversary of their issuance date.

Microsoft has also agreed not to convert any of the 2018 Bonds and any of the
2019 Bonds into Nokia shares prior to the second anniversary of their issuance
date and for the 2020 Bonds prior to the third anniversary of their issuance
date, except in a change of control situation. Thereafter, the conversion right
continues until the date falling seven business days prior to the maturity date
of the relevant bond. If the Bonds are converted into Nokia shares by Microsoft,
Microsoft has agreed to vote according to recommendations of Nokia's Board of
Directors, save in circumstances where this would be construed as Microsoft
acting in concert with Nokia for purposes of the Finnish Securities Markets Act.

Nokia has the right to redeem all outstanding 2018 Bonds and 2019 Bonds after
the third anniversary of their issuance date plus 30 days if the volume weighted
average price of the Nokia shares is at least 130% of the then prevailing
conversion price for a specified period of time, and with respect to the 2020
Bonds Nokia has a similar right after the fourth anniversary of their issuance
date plus 30 days. Nokia will also have the right to redeem each tranche of
Bonds at any time if conversion rights are exercised and/or purchases (and
corresponding cancellations) and/or redemptions are effected in respect of 85%
or more in principal amount of such tranche of Bonds. The terms and conditions
of the Bonds provide for adjustments of the then applicable conversion price for
any dividends in cash or in kind as well as customary anti-dilution adjustments.

Nokia will make an application to include the Bonds for trading on the Open
Market (Freiverkehr) segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange as soon as
reasonably practicable following the issuance date of the Bonds.

The maximum number of shares which may be issued by Nokia upon conversion of all
the Bonds (based on the initial conversion price of each tranche) is
approximately 367.5 million, representing approximately 8.9 % of Nokia's shares
as calculated based on current amount of shares added with shares to be issued
upon conversion of all the Bonds.

business generally&#160; resulting from the announcement of the Sale of the DS
Business or from the terms that we have agreed for the Sale of the DS Business;

as we may forego other competitive alternatives for strategies or partnerships

from the implementation of the Sale of the DS Business, which will require
significant time, attention and resources of our senior management and others
within the company potentially diverting their attention from other aspects of
our business; 6) disruption and dissatisfaction among employees caused by the
plans and implementation of the Sale of the DS Business reducing focus and
productivity in areas of our business; 7) the amount of the costs, fees,
expenses and charges related to or triggered by the Sale of the DS Business;
8) any impairments or charges to carrying values of assets or liabilities
related to or triggered by the Sale of the DS Business; 9) potential adverse
effect on our business, properties or operations caused by us implementing the
Sale of the DS Business; 10) the initiation or outcome of any legal
proceedings, regulatory proceedings or enforcement matters that may be
instituted against us relating to the Sale of the DS Business; and, as well as
the risk factors specified on pages 12-47 of Nokia's annual report on Form 20-F
for the year ended December 31, 2012 under Item 3D. "Risk Factors." and risks
outlined in our most recent interim report. Other unknown or unpredictable
factors or underlying assumptions subsequently proving to be incorrect could
cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking
statements. Nokia does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except to the extent legally required.

		&lt;p&gt;The Bonds are expected to be issued on or about September 23, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has agreed not to sell any of the Bonds or convert any of the Bonds to Nokia shares prior to the closing of the Sale of the DS business.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Should the Sale of the DS Business not be completed, Microsoft would have the right to sell the 2018 Bonds immediately. Microsoft has agreed not to sell any of the 2019 Bonds prior to the second anniversary of their issuance date and any of the 2020 Bonds prior to the third anniversary of their issuance date.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also agreed not to convert any of the 2018 Bonds and any of the 2019 Bonds into Nokia shares prior to the second anniversary of their issuance date and for the 2020 Bonds prior to the third anniversary of their issuance date, except in a change of control situation. Thereafter, the conversion right continues until the date falling seven business days prior to the maturity date of the relevant bond. If the Bonds are converted into Nokia shares by Microsoft, Microsoft has agreed to vote according to recommendations of Nokia's Board of Directors, save in circumstances where this would be construed as Microsoft acting in concert with Nokia for purposes of the Finnish Securities Markets Act.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nokia has the right to redeem all outstanding 2018 Bonds and 2019 Bonds after the third anniversary of their issuance date plus 30 days if the volume weighted average price of the Nokia shares is at least 130% of the then prevailing conversion price for a specified period of time, and with respect to the 2020 Bonds Nokia has a similar right after the fourth anniversary of their issuance date plus 30 days. Nokia will also have the right to redeem each tranche of Bonds at any time if conversion rights are exercised and/or purchases (and corresponding cancellations) and/or redemptions are effected in respect of 85% or more in principal amount of such tranche of Bonds. The terms and conditions of the Bonds provide for adjustments of the then applicable conversion price for any dividends in cash or in kind as well as customary anti-dilution adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nokia will make an application to include the Bonds for trading on the Open Market (Freiverkehr) segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange as soon as reasonably practicable following the issuance date of the Bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The maximum number of shares which may be issued by Nokia upon conversion of all the Bonds (based on the initial conversion price of each tranche) is approximately 367.5 million, representing approximately 8.9 % of Nokia's shares as calculated based on current amount of shares added with shares to be issued upon conversion of all the Bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BROOKLYN PARK, Minn., Sept. 8, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeCare Dental is educating patients about the different orthodontic options available for teeth straightening and bite correction. While braces are the most common and popular choice for correcting orthodontic problems, the dental practice offers a variety of options in addition to traditional metal braces. These alternative options include clear plastic braces and Invisalign, which is popular with adult patients who need moderate teeth straightening. According to the dental team, adult patients who need braces may be able to use Invisalign instead, for less conspicuous but equally effective straightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Adult dental patients in need of orthodontics to correct improperly aligned teeth can now choose a non-metal braces option at WeCare Dental. In addition to traditional metal braces, the practice offers plastic braces and the clear aligner system known as Invisalign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"WeCare Dental offers a variety of orthodontics procedures to help correct bite problems and teeth misalignment," said the WeCare Dental team. "These options include popular alternatives to traditional metal braces, such as clear braces and Invisalign. These options are especially popular with adult patients who only require minor straightening in order to correct alignment problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Invisalign is a clear set of aligners worn by patients to move teeth towards their desired position. The aligners are custom-made for each patient and swapped out every three to four weeks with a new set. Since the aligners are clear and removable, patients can continue to eat, drink and smile as they normally would without fear of embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The WeCare Dental team stressed that braces are important for correcting orthodontic problems not only for aesthetic concerns, but also to prevent serious tooth crowding and bite problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"In addition to cosmetic dissatisfaction, improperly aligned teeth can also increase a patient's risk for oral health problems," said the WeCare Dental team. "For example, plaque build up, due to tooth overcrowding, is a common problem. Overcrowding makes brushing and flossing difficult and less effective. An underbite, overbite or open bite can also make it difficult for patients to chew foods or create speech impediments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The severity of oral health problems will impact which orthodontic treatments are available for a patient. For example, individuals with severe bite problems may need metal braces in order to correct an underbite or overbite. Headgear or other orthodontic devices may also be necessary, as determined by a diagnostic consultation with a dentist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	WeCare Dental is a full service family dentistry and orthodontics practice with locations in Brooklyn Park, Big Lake and Coon Rapids. Individuals who would like to learn more about teeth straightening, or who wish to schedule an appointment with a dentist, may do so by visiting http://www.wecaredentalus.com.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: WeCare Dental

services rather than software. Six weeks later, he announced his
retirement within a year, sending shares soaring. Ten days after
that, he unveiled a $7.2 billion purchase of Nokia's phone
business, a move that ate up the stock's recent gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters at
least, the casually dressed workers seem much more worried about
the far-reaching reorganization announced by Ballmer than the
multibillion-dollar Nokia acquisition, which has incensed many
investors who view it as a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The funniest thing I read on LinkedIn was, 'Two black holes
converge,'" said one Microsoft employee, who asked not to be
named, soon after the Nokia acquisition was announced. "But I
think there's some real potential here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The topic of Ballmer's retirement elicited a more complex
reaction from some Microsoft employees interviewed this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like Wall Street, there was initial euphoria with the
announcement for employees," said one 15-year veteran who has
worked in a number of units at the company, in response to
Ballmer's retirement and a change at the helm of a company that
no longer sets the pace for technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But he is as much a symptom as the actual problem. This
whole crazy re-org will still happen. And nothing will really
change." he said. "Among many of my fellow employees - both new
hires and long-timers - there is a recognition that Microsoft
has lost its way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined comment on the mood of its employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways the company aims to regain its stride is the
addition of Nokia's phone business, but that will likely
complicate an already complex reorganization that is just
getting under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The re-org is more unsettling for some people than
Ballmer's departure. Exactly how that shakes out is more
interesting," said another employee who asked not to be
identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is always a small percentage of people who do lose
their job, or get put into an awkward new role. For those
people, morale is very bad, of course. But whoever you talk to,
they all noticed that the stock went up on the Ballmer
(retirement) news. If sustained, that will make morale improve
broadly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOUR NEW GROUPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Ballmer's 'One Microsoft' vision - which will take
until the end of the year, at least, to complete - Microsoft's
five operating units, including the massive Windows and Office
businesses, are being realigned under four new functional
engineering groups, broadly covering operating systems, devices,
applications and the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, that means tearing up some existing units and
shifting thousands of staff around campus. The old Windows
business will largely go into the new operating systems unit,
but the Surface tablet unit will go into the new devices
organization, to be joined by Nokia's phones next year. Office
will be split between the applications and cloud units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most advertising and marketing staff are being taken out of
their traditional business units and grouped together under a
unified team. The software parts of Xbox will go to operating
systems while the hardware will go to the devices unit, but not
until after the Nov. 22 launch of the Xbox One console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the complexity, the full effects of the reorganization
may not be felt for several more months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess the re-org hasn't yet settled down in a big way,"
said Raman Shrama, 34, who works at Microsoft as a program
manager in the developer division, which helps outside firms
make apps to run on Microsoft's Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am personally not very impacted, because the division
that I am working in is largely unchanged," said Shrama at the
Overlake Transit Center used by thousands of Microsoft
commuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, he said, the mood at the company was good.   
"CEOs don't change every day. It's a big event, for sure. But I
haven't noticed a drop in morale, or anything like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Redmond campus has maintained its laid-back air
for the last few weeks. Crowds occasionally gather for
morale-building events on one of the artificial-turf soccer
fields. And in The Commons - the campus social hub - a few
hundred employees congregate upstairs for the rowdy 'Trivia
Tuesday' quiz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One 31-year-old contractor who works on the Office user
interface team said he was "very optimistic" about the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are so far behind on the mobile end of things. This is
the only hope we have for connecting to the younger generation,"
he said. "The PC market is declining so much. This might give us
a chance to find a new approach and a new corporate identity to
get behind. I don't think Ballmer was really that inspirational,
someone people believed in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 25-year-old software engineer in the Bing search
engine unit said she was "excited" about what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't expect a big change after his (Ballmer's)
retirement. Microsoft is a big company. A new CEO won't change
much," she said. "In the last company meeting, Steve talked
about the 'One Microsoft' spirit. People liked that idea.
Probably, the new CEO will continue that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) board, under fire for the bank's trading losses and myriad government probes, said on Monday that it was adding two directors and handing more power to its lead independent director, steps that give it extra supervision over Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics said the moves did not go far enough to rein in Dimon, who piloted the bank through the financial crisis but is struggling to improve his relationship with regulators in the aftermath of the meltdown. Dimon has played a key role in selecting board members in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new directors are Linda Bammann, a bank risk expert who worked for Dimon when she was at Bank One and JPMorgan, and Michael Neal, who until June was the chairman and CEO of General Electric Co's (GE.N) GE Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board of the largest U.S. bank said it was giving new powers to its lead independent director, Lee Raymond, including the right to call board meetings at any time and the right to preside over meetings that pertain to Dimon.

Neal, he added, worked for a too-big-to-fail financial company himself, which could make him less likely to challenge Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are just the wrong folks. There are plenty of outside perspectives they could have brought in. Instead, they didn't want to rock the boat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has for months been fending off shareholder complaints about Dimon's power over the board of directors, as well as the composition of the board. In May, a group of investors tried to strip Dimon of his chairman title, arguing that last year's London Whale trading losses revealed that he needed oversight from a separate chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon threatened to quit if he lost the title, and ended up winning a shareholder vote on the matter with a higher percentage of the vote than last year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and a major insurer have agreed to a $300 million settlement to resolve accusations that they forced homeowners into over-priced property insurance and entered into kickback arrangements that inflated the policies' prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit being settled - one of several targeting large U.S. banks over force-placed insurance - said that the improper practices unjustly enriched JPMorgan and insurer Assurant Inc by more than $1 billion since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Assurant did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which was in documents filed late on Friday in a Miami federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement will have no expected impact on our financials," JPMorgan spokeswoman Amy Bonitatibus said in a statement.

from several cases against banks pending in Miami federal court
that involve force-placed insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORS TARGET PRACTICE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have been under increasing scrutiny from regulators
over force-placed insurance, which is placed by a bank or other
mortgage lender to protect their interests in a property if the
homeowner's insurance lapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage agreements give lenders the right to force-place
insurance, but regulators have accused banks and insurance
companies of pushing up policy prices with improper commission
and reinsurance agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a spokesman for Assurant said the company
places insurance in accordance with the terms of the mortgage
and applicable regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement is subject to court approval and we are
unable to offer further comment while the matter is pending,"
Assurant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation's largest force-placed insurer, Assurant placed
about 1.3 million policies for JPMorgan Chase, collecting more
than $2.4 billion in force-placed premiums since 2008, according
to court documents filed by plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assurant in March agreed to pay $14 million to settle a
probe by the New York state insurance regulator over its
business arrangements with banks and mortgage servicers.
Assurant neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing when it settled
that investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEVERAL LAWSUITS PENDING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Department of Financial Services had accused
Assurant of paying commissions to banks and other mortgage
servicers that created an incentive for the banks to force-place
higher-priced policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, Assurant entered into agreements that let
reinsurance companies owned by banks take as much as 75 percent
of the profit for sharing risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement announcing that settlement, New York Governor
Andrew Cuomo said JPMorgan made about $600 million since 2006 by
taking 75 percent of the profits from the force-placed business
it gave Assurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National lawsuits over force-placed insurance are still
pending in Miami against Citigroup, Wells Fargo,
Bank of America and HSBC Bank (USA), part of
London-based HSBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A state-wide Florida lawsuit against Wells Fargo and QBE
Insurance Corp was settled in May for about $19

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Shares of Towers Watson &amp; Co (TW.N) jumped as much as 10 percent on Monday after IBM (IBM.N) said it will move its U.S. retirees to an insurance exchange owned by the employee benefits consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance exchanges help consumers compare insurance plans and enroll in coverage. They are the cornerstone of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform that aims to roll out insurance coverage to all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towers Watson said it operates the largest private Medicare exchange in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said on Friday it will shift its U.S. retirees off its company-sponsored health plan to Towers Watson's insurance exchange, Extend Health, saying the plan offered IBM retirees more choice and better value than the company could provide through existing group plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract, which will add about 110,000 members according to Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Ginocchio, is great news for the newly set up health insurance exchanges and a big win for Towers Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Towers Watson's exchange currently serves over 500,000 lives, primarily retirees.

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects paragraph 10 to say Time Warner Inc, not Time Warner
Cable, plans to transfer retirees to private insurance
exchanges)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept 9 (Reuters) - Shares of Towers Watson &amp; Co 
jumped as much as 10 percent on Monday after IBM said it
will move its U.S. retirees to an insurance exchange owned by
the employee benefits consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance exchanges help consumers compare insurance plans
and enroll in coverage. They are the cornerstone of President
Barack Obama's healthcare reform that aims to roll out insurance
coverage to all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towers Watson said it operates the largest private Medicare
exchange in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said on Friday it will shift its U.S. retirees off its
company-sponsored health plan to Towers Watson's insurance
exchange, Extend Health, saying the plan offered IBM retirees
more choice and better value than the company could provide
through existing group plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract, which will add about 110,000 members according
to Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Ginocchio, is great news for the
newly set up health insurance exchanges and a big win for Towers
Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Towers Watson's exchange currently serves over 500,000
lives, primarily retirees. IBM represents about 20 percent
growth by itself," SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Tobey
Sommer wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, skepticism about insurance exchanges remain, with
many top insurers preferring to watch from the sidelines until

afternoon trading at $90.38 on the New York Stock Exchange on
Monday.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) board, under fire for failing to prevent the $6 billion "London Whale" trading losses last year, on Monday named two new directors and gave more power to its lead independent director, but critics said the moves did not go far enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new directors include Linda Bammann, a bank risk expert who worked for JPMorgan's Chief Executive Jamie Dimon when she was at Bank One and JPMorgan. The other new director, Michael Neal, was until June the chairman and CEO of the GE Capital subsidiary of General Electric Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board of the largest U.S. bank also said it was giving new powers to its lead independent director, Lee Raymond, including the ability to call board meetings any time. Previously, Raymond could only call meetings of other independent directors. Raymond is the former chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some investors, Bammann is too close to Dimon, and the bank's steps to bolster the lead independent director role are undermined by the position being held by Raymond, a longtime Dimon backer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bringing in someone who was a former deputy of Jamie Dimon's is absolutely the wrong move," said Michael Pryce-Jones, a spokesman for CtW Investment Group, which had campaigned this year against the re-election of three directors, two of whom have since resigned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are just the wrong folks. There are plenty of outside perspectives they could have brought in. Instead, they didn't want to rock the boat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has for months been fending off shareholder complaints about Dimon's power over the board of directors, as well as the composition of the board. In May 2013, a group of investors tried to strip Dimon of his chairman title, arguing that the London Whale losses revealed that he needed oversight from a separate chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon threatened to quit if he lost his chairman title, and ended up winning a shareholder vote on the matter with a higher percentage of the vote than last year. But investors told Reuters before the vote that even if the CEO won the shareholder resolution, they would press for changes behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in July, two of the three directors that investors had complained about resigned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, has been under intense scrutiny from regulators and some shareholders since admitting in May 2012 that it would record trading losses from derivatives positions. The losses came to be known as the "London whale" trades because they were made by a trader based in the United Kingdom who took outsized positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANC ONE DAYS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bammann is expected to be formally elected on September 16, according to the announcement. Until July, she was a director of Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB), the housing finance agency known as Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp, which came under government receivership during the financial crisis. She was chief risk officer at Banc One Corp under Dimon and followed him to JPMorgan in 2004 when it acquired the smaller bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neal plans to join the board in January after retiring at the end of 2013 from GE, where he is vice chairman. He developed "deep knowledge of global financial services and markets" in 26 years at GE Capital, JPMorgan said in the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announced changes in board rules include having the independent lead director preside over meetings when the CEO has a conflict of interest, not just when the CEO is absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board will not annually rotate the lead independent director position, the announcement said. The previous presiding director was appointed annually, according to the company's last proxy statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters had reported last month that the bank was close to naming two new directors with expertise in risk and finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan were up about 1 percent at $52.93 in early afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Aman Shah in Bangalore; Editing by Sreejiraj Eluvangal, Lisa Von Ahn and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

			Goodwin Procter Expands Securities Litigation  White Collar Defense 
      Group with Addition of Derek Cohen in New York
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goodwin Procter, a national Am Law 50 firm, 
      announced today that Derek 
      A. Cohen has joined the firm&#8217;s New York office as a partner in its 
      Securities Litigation  White Collar Defense Group. Cohen joins Goodwin 
      from the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. where he served 
      as Deputy Chief of the Fraud Section for the DOJ&#8217;s Criminal Division and 
      Deputy Director of the Deepwater Horizon Task Force.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At Goodwin, Cohen will focus on white collar criminal investigations and 
      prosecutions, regulatory inquiries and lawsuits, internal corporate 
      investigations and complex commercial litigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In his role on the Deepwater Horizon Task Force, Cohen supervised the 
      criminal investigation and prosecutions in connection with the April 
      2010 Gulf Coast oil spill disaster that killed eleven men and caused 
      unprecedented environmental damage. His responsibilities included the 
      prosecutions of Transocean, Halliburton and BP, which resulted in the 
      largest criminal resolution in U.S. history. Cohen&#8217;s work on the 
      Deepwater Horizon investigation recently earned him the Attorney 
      General&#8217;s Award for Exceptional Service, the highest award in the 
      Department of Justice, as well as the FBI Director&#8217;s Award for 
      Excellence, one of the FBI&#8217;s most prestigious honors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prior to his tenure at the DOJ, Cohen was an Assistant United States 
      Attorney with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Philadelphia where he led a 
      national undercover investigation into stock manipulation and 
      prosecutions involving a dozen publicly traded companies. Cohen obtained 
      the conviction of the former CEO of National Lampoon and successfully 
      tried the former general counsel of one of the world&#8217;s largest 
      semi-conductor companies for insider trading. Before his service at the 
      DOJ, Cohen was a white collar criminal defense attorney in private 
      practice. He began his career at the Manhattan District Attorney&#8217;s 
      office, serving as an Assistant DA under Robert Morgenthau.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Derek&#8217;s extensive experience and accomplishments are a welcome addition 
      to our already deep talent pool of white collar attorneys,&#8221; said Richard 
      M. Strassberg, chair of Goodwin&#8217;s White Collar Crime  Government 
      Investigations group. &#8220;His insight as an experienced prosecutor will 
      provide immediate benefits to individuals and corporations facing 
      complex and high-stakes government investigations and prosecutions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cohen received his J.D., cum laude, from Boston University School 
      of Law and his B.A. from University at Albany, State University of New 
      York. He is admitted to practice in New York, New Jersey and the 
      District of Columbia, as well as before the U.S. District Court for the 
      Southern, Eastern and Western Districts of New York.

      Collar Crime  Government Investigations Practice has 
      successfully represented Fortune 500 companies and individual business 
      leaders in some of the United States&#8217; most high-profile cases. Goodwin&#8217;s

			JPMorgan Chase to Elect Linda Bammann and Michael Neal to Its Board 
      of Directors
		&lt;/p&gt;

			Company Also Announces Enhancements to Its Corporate Governance 
      Principles and Establishes the Role of Lead Independent Director
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced today that its Board of 
      Directors&#160;intends to elect Linda B. Bammann and Michael A. Neal as 
      directors of the company. Ms. Bammann is expected to be elected on 
      September 16, while Mr. Neal is expected to join the Board in January 
      2014, after he retires from his current position.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ms. Bammann has extensive experience in senior risk management roles, 
      having acted as Chief Risk Management Officer at Bank One Corporation 
      from 2001 until its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase, and as Deputy Head of 
      Risk Management at JPMorgan Chase before her retirement in 2005. Ms. 
      Bammann also served as a Director of The Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
      Corporation (Freddie Mac) from late 2008, after it entered 
      conservatorship, until July of this year, where she served as the Chair 
      of the board&#8217;s Business and Risk Committee. She was earlier&#160;also a Board 
      Member of the Risk Management Association and Chair of the Loan 
      Syndications and Trading Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Neal, currently a Vice Chairman of General Electric Company, served 
      as Chairman and CEO of GE Capital until June of this year. He intends to 
      retire from GE at the end of 2013 and will join JPMorgan&#8217;s Board shortly 
      thereafter. Mr. Neal has a deep knowledge of global financial services 
      and markets. He joined GE in 1979 and moved into GE Capital eight years 
      later. In his 26 years with GE Capital he has held a number of senior 
      operating positions, including President and Chief Operating Officer of 
      GE Capital and CEO of GE Commercial Finance prior to being appointed 
      Chairman and CEO of GE Capital in 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are extremely fortunate that Linda Bammann and Mike Neal will be 
      joining JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Board of Directors,&#8221; said Lee R. Raymond, the 
      Board&#8217;s Lead Independent Director. &#8220;Linda and Mike are proven leaders 
      and will bring outstanding risk, finance and management experience to 
      our Board and to our firm,&#8221; added Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of the 
      company. Ms. Bammann will also join the Board&#8217;s Risk Policy Committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase has long maintained outstanding corporate governance 
      practices and today announced additional enhancements to its Corporate 
      Governance Principles, including the establishment of a Lead Independent 
      Director role. The Lead Independent Director&#8217;s responsibilities continue 
      to include those formerly carried by the Board&#8217;s Presiding Director, but 
      will also include a number of additions and changes to further 
      strengthen and improve governance practices. Lee R. Raymond, formerly 
      Presiding Director, continues as Lead Independent Director.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Specifically, the Lead Independent Director&#8217;s role includes a number of 
      important responsibilities and authorities, many of which codify 
      existing best practices of our Board:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Lead Independent Director will have authority to call for a Board 
        meeting at any time, not just, as currently is the case, a meeting of 
        the independent directors.
      
			
        Lead Independent Director will preside over meetings when the CEO is 
        conflicted, not just when the CEO is absent.
      
			
        Lead Independent Director to approve the Board agenda for a meeting 
        and may add agenda items.
      
			
        Lead Independent Director to guide annual performance evaluation of 
        Chairman and CEO.
      
			
        Lead Independent Director to guide full Board consideration of CEO 
        succession issues.
      
			
        Lead Independent Director will facilitate communication between the 
        company&#8217;s management and independent directors.
      
			
        Lead Independent Director to meet one-on-one with the CEO after every 
        regularly scheduled Board meeting.
      
			
        Lead Independent Director will guide full Board consideration of 
        compensation of CEO.
      
			
        Lead Independent Director will guide annual self-assessment of full 
        Board.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other Board best practices include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Board will no longer rotate the Lead Independent Director position on 
        an annual basis.
      
			
        Directors, including the Lead Independent Director, will be available 
        for consultation with major shareholders and other constituencies 
        where appropriate.
      
			
        Executive sessions (without company management) will take place at 
        every regularly scheduled Board meeting.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby and Eric M. Johnson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Wash., Sept 8 (Reuters) - A mood of cautious
optimism tempered with a dash of anxiety has spread on Microsoft
Corp's leafy campus in the Seattle suburbs, as the
world's biggest software maker embarks on one of the most
tumultuous periods in its 38-year history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since mid-July, three interlocking events - all of them
considered highly unlikely six months ago - have unfolded in
quick succession, unsettling Microsoft managers and employees
and roiling its share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, CEO Steve Ballmer rejiggered top management as part
of an ambitious plan to remodel the company around devices and
services rather than software. Six weeks later, he announced his
retirement within a year, sending shares soaring. Ten days after
that, he unveiled a $7.2 billion purchase of Nokia's phone
business, a move that ate up the stock's recent gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters at
least, the casually dressed workers seem much more worried about
the far-reaching reorganization announced by Ballmer than the
multibillion-dollar Nokia acquisition, which has incensed many
investors who view it as a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The funniest thing I read on LinkedIn was, 'Two black holes
converge,'" said one Microsoft employee, who asked not to be
named, soon after the Nokia acquisition was announced. "But I
think there's some real potential here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The topic of Ballmer's retirement elicited a more complex
reaction from some Microsoft employees interviewed this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like Wall Street, there was initial euphoria with the
announcement for employees," said one 15-year veteran who has
worked in a number of units at the company, in response to
Ballmer's retirement and a change at the helm of a company that
no longer sets the pace for technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But he is as much a symptom as the actual problem. This
whole crazy re-org will still happen. And nothing will really
change." he said. "Among many of my fellow employees - both new
hires and long-timers - there is a recognition that Microsoft
has lost its way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined comment on the mood of its employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways the company aims to regain its stride is the
addition of Nokia's phone business, but that will likely
complicate an already complex reorganization that is just
getting under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The re-org is more unsettling for some people than
Ballmer's departure. Exactly how that shakes out is more
interesting," said another employee who asked not to be
identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is always a small percentage of people who do lose
their job, or get put into an awkward new role. For those
people, morale is very bad, of course. But whoever you talk to,
they all noticed that the stock went up on the Ballmer
(retirement) news. If sustained, that will make morale improve
broadly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOUR NEW GROUPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Ballmer's 'One Microsoft' vision - which will take
until the end of the year, at least, to complete - Microsoft's
five operating units, including the massive Windows and Office
businesses, are being realigned under four new functional
engineering groups, broadly covering operating systems, devices,
applications and the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, that means tearing up some existing units and
shifting thousands of staff around campus. The old Windows
business will largely go into the new operating systems unit,
but the Surface tablet unit will go into the new devices
organization, to be joined by Nokia's phones next year. Office
will be split between the applications and cloud units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most advertising and marketing staff are being taken out of
their traditional business units and grouped together under a
unified team. The software parts of Xbox will go to operating
systems while the hardware will go to the devices unit, but not
until after the Nov. 22 launch of the Xbox One console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the complexity, the full effects of the reorganization
may not be felt for several more months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess the re-org hasn't yet settled down in a big way,"
said Raman Shrama, 34, who works at Microsoft as a program

make apps to run on Microsoft's Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am personally not very impacted, because the division
that I am working in is largely unchanged," said Shrama at the
Overlake Transit Center used by thousands of Microsoft
commuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, he said, the mood at the company was good.   
"CEOs don't change every day. It's a big event, for sure. But I
haven't noticed a drop in morale, or anything like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Redmond campus has maintained its laid-back air
for the last few weeks. Crowds occasionally gather for
morale-building events on one of the artificial-turf soccer
fields. And in The Commons - the campus social hub - a few
hundred employees congregate upstairs for the rowdy 'Trivia
Tuesday' quiz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One 31-year-old contractor who works on the Office user
interface team said he was "very optimistic" about the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are so far behind on the mobile end of things. This is
the only hope we have for connecting to the younger generation,"
he said. "The PC market is declining so much. This might give us
a chance to find a new approach and a new corporate identity to
get behind. I don't think Ballmer was really that inspirational,
someone people believed in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 25-year-old software engineer in the Bing search
engine unit said she was "excited" about what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't expect a big change after his (Ballmer's)
retirement. Microsoft is a big company. A new CEO won't change
much," she said. "In the last company meeting, Steve talked
about the 'One Microsoft' spirit. People liked that idea.
Probably, the new CEO will continue that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Washington (Reuters) - A mood of cautious optimism tempered with a dash of anxiety has spread on Microsoft Corp's leafy campus in the Seattle suburbs, as the world's biggest software maker embarks on one of the most tumultuous periods in its 38-year history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since mid-July, three interlocking events - all of them considered highly unlikely six months ago - have unfolded in quick succession, unsettling Microsoft managers and employees and roiling its share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, CEO Steve Ballmer rejiggered top management as part of an ambitious plan to remodel the company around devices and services rather than software. Six weeks later, he announced his retirement within a year, sending shares soaring. Ten days after that, he unveiled a $7.2 billion purchase of Nokia's phone business, a move that ate up the stock's recent gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters at least, the casually dressed workers seem much more worried about the far-reaching reorganization announced by Ballmer than the multibillion-dollar Nokia acquisition, which has incensed many investors who view it as a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The funniest thing I read on LinkedIn was, 'Two black holes converge,'" said one Microsoft employee, who asked not to be named, soon after the Nokia acquisition was announced. "But I think there's some real potential here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The topic of Ballmer's retirement elicited a more complex reaction from some Microsoft employees interviewed this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like Wall Street, there was initial euphoria with the announcement for employees," said one 15-year veteran who has worked in a number of units at the company, in response to Ballmer's retirement and a change at the helm of a company that no longer sets the pace for technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But he is as much a symptom as the actual problem. This whole crazy re-org will still happen. And nothing will really change." he said. "Among many of my fellow employees - both new hires and long-timers - there is a recognition that Microsoft has lost its way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined comment on the mood of its employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways the company aims to regain its stride is the addition of Nokia's phone business, but that will likely complicate an already complex reorganization that is just getting under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The re-org is more unsettling for some people than Ballmer's departure. Exactly how that shakes out is more interesting," said another employee who asked not to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is always a small percentage of people who do lose their job, or get put into an awkward new role. For those people, morale is very bad, of course. But whoever you talk to, they all noticed that the stock went up on the Ballmer (retirement) news. If sustained, that will make morale improve broadly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOUR NEW GROUPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Ballmer's 'One Microsoft' vision - which will take until the end of the year, at least, to complete - Microsoft's five operating units, including the massive Windows and Office businesses, are being realigned under four new functional engineering groups, broadly covering operating systems, devices, applications and the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, that means tearing up some existing units and shifting thousands of staff around campus. The old Windows business will largely go into the new operating systems unit, but the Surface tablet unit will go into the new devices organization, to be joined by Nokia's phones next year. Office will be split between the applications and cloud units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most advertising and marketing staff are being taken out of their traditional business units and grouped together under a unified team. The software parts of Xbox will go to operating systems while the hardware will go to the devices unit, but not until after the November 22 launch of the Xbox One console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the complexity, the full effects of the reorganization may not be felt for several more months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess the re-org hasn't yet settled down in a big way," said Raman Shrama, 34, who works at Microsoft as a program manager in the developer division, which helps outside firms make apps to run on Microsoft's Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am personally not very impacted, because the division that I am working in is largely unchanged," said Shrama at the Overlake Transit Center used by thousands of Microsoft commuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, he said, the mood at the company was good.

&lt;p&gt;(Repeats to additional subscribers; no change to text)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEOUL, Sept 9 (Reuters) - South Korean financial regulators
are reviewing three foreign brokerages including Goldman Sachs
Group Inc's local unit for possible breach of domestic
capital markets regulations, a source at one of the regulators
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is investigating
whether Goldman Sachs sold foreign bonds in the domestic market
through its Hong Kong unit, which does not have any license to
sell such products directly in South Korea, the source told
Reuters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source declined to be identified due to the sensitivity
of the subject and because the probe is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSS said on Sunday that it was reviewing three foreign
brokerages, without identifying them in its brief statement. The
regulator is investigating their business practices to see if
they are following domestic capital markets regulations,
according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs representatives in Seoul declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators are focusing their review on Goldman's sale of
Malaysian state-backed securities to domestic investors
including Korea Investment Corp, the country's sovereign wealth
fund, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local operations of Credit Suisse Group AG and
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc are the other two foreign
brokerages being investigated, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse and RBS were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probe began in late August and is expected to last for
another week or so, according to the source.

      SYNNEX Corporation (NYSE: SNX), a leading business process services 
      company, announced today in a separate press release issued jointly by 
      SYNNEX and IBM (NYSE: IBM), that SYNNEX will acquire IBM&#8217;s worldwide 
      customer care services business. The acquisition will be combined with 
      Concentrix, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SYNNEX and a recognized leader 
      in providing platforms, people and services to support high-value 
      interactions at every stage of the customer lifecycle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, SYNNEX will pay a purchase 
      price of $505 million, consisting of approximately $430 million in cash 
      and $75 million in SYNNEX common stock. The transaction is expected to 
      add an estimated $120 million in earnings before interest, taxes, 
      depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and approximately $0.55 in fully 
      diluted earnings per share (EPS) excluding one-time charges and 
      integration costs in the first 12 months post the closing of the 
      transaction. The $405 million purchase price premium includes an 
      estimated 40-50% in intangible assets which will be amortized over two 
      to ten years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As client requirements for BPO have shifted towards high value business 
      outcomes, insights, and alternative delivery models, this transaction 
      accelerates Concentrix&#8217; geographic and industry reach with combined deep 
      expertise, scale, process innovation and continued investments in high 
      value industry platforms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This acquisition will make Concentrix a global Top 10 player in a 
      growing market,&#8221; stated Kevin Murai, President and CEO of SYNNEX 
      Corporation. &#8220;With our collective strengths in the CRM BPO market, this 
      strategic acquisition will create an even more compelling value 
      proposition for our clients and shareholders.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The new CRM BPO business will leverage the combined deep expertise, 
      scale, process innovation and investments in high value industry 
      platforms and assets to provide the customer experience and service 
      innovation you have come to expect from IBM,&#8221; said Lori Steele, general 
      manager, IBM Global Process Services. &#8220;The pace of
			change in 
      customer care requires constant innovation. This acquisition by SYNNEX 
      further enhances our mutual commitment to client satisfaction through 
      one of the world&#8217;s top customer experience BPO providers. Clients can 
      invest with confidence in the proven abilities of these two leaders to 
      deliver the best customer care solutions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am thrilled with the talent that will be coming over to Concentrix,&#8221; 
      said Chris Caldwell, President of Concentrix Corporation. &#8220;We have long 
      been committed to delivering high quality, innovative CRM BPO services 
      and this acquisition will significantly extend our portfolio and our 
      delivery capabilities.&#8221; Caldwell continued, &#8220;This is an important step 
      in our continued growth by providing a unique aggregation of world-class 
      customer engagement capabilities to our clients that we could only have 
      acquired from IBM.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SYNNEX will enter into a multi-year agreement with IBM in which 
      Concentrix will become an IBM preferred business partner for global 
      customer care BPO outsourcing services, providing an extended ecosystem 
      and delivery engine for Concentrix&#8217; and IBM&#8217;s extended partners and 
      solution providers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Once the transaction is complete, Concentrix will have approximately 
      45,000 employees servicing over 300 clients in over 40 languages through 
      over 50 delivery centers on six continents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction is expected to initially close in the coming months, 
      subject to the satisfaction of regulatory requirements and customary 
      closing conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Until the transaction is completed, the companies will continue to 
      operate independently.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, subject to SYNNEX&#8217; completion of its normal quarterly 
      close and reporting process, revenues for the third quarter ended August 
      31st are now estimated toward the high end of the prior 
      guidance range of $2.65-$2.75 billion. As announced on September 6, 
      2013, the Company will report its Q3 2013 earnings results and hold a 
      conference call on September 25th.

			Hanesbrands Reaffirms 2013 Guidance in Conjunction with Presentation 
      at Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company also Updates Progress of Maidenform Brands Acquisition; 
      Company Expects the Acquisition to Close by Oct. 8, 2013, Contingent 
      Upon Maidenform Stockholder Approval
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HanesBrands (NYSE:HBI), a leading marketer of everyday basic apparel 
      under world-class brands, today announced that it is reaffirming its 
      2013 financial guidance in conjunction with investor meetings and a 
      presentation and webcast Wednesday, Sept. 11, 2013, at the Goldman Sachs 
      Global Retailing Conference.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hanes reaffirmed its full-year 2013 guidance for sales of approximately 
      $4.55 billion; operating profit of $550 million to $575 million; EPS of 
      $3.50 to $3.65; and free cash flow of $450 million to $550 million. The 
      company&#8217;s guidance does not reflect any potential contributions or 
      impact from the acquisition of Maidenform Brands, Inc., which is 
      expected to close in the fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We continue to track to our expectations for significant margin 
      expansion in 2013 with strong year-over-year growth for operating 
      profit, EPS and cash flow,&#8221; Hanes Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
      Richard A. Noll said. &#8220;Back-to-school sales started softer than desired, 
      as many retailers have announced, but we saw sell-through trends for our 
      products improve in late August and early September. Our 
      Innovate-to-Elevate platforms continue to succeed and are driving margin 
      expansion.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noll and company Chief Financial Officer Richard D. Moss will meet with 
      investors and make a presentation on Wednesday at the Goldman Sachs 
      conference in New York City. The presentation, which will consist of 
      five to 10 minutes of company remarks followed by a Goldman 
      Sachs-moderated question-and-answer session, will be webcast live from 
      1:30 to 2:10 p.m. and will be accessible via the Hanes corporate 
      website, www.hanes.com/investors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company anticipates taking questions at the conference regarding the 
      progress of its proposed acquisition of Maidenform Brands (NYSE:MFB). 
      Hanes announced July 24, 2013, that it had entered into a definitive 
      agreement to acquire Maidenform Brands for $23.50 per share in an 
      all-cash transaction valued at approximately $575 million on an 
      enterprise-value basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The acquisition is expected to close by Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2013, pending 
      approval by Maidenform stockholders voting at a special meeting on 
      Thursday, Oct. 3, 2013, and satisfaction of other customary closing 
      conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The acquisition has already received regulatory clearance. Maidenform 
      announced Aug. 28, 2013, that it had been notified by the Premerger 
      Notification Office of the Federal Trade Commission of the early 
      termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
      Improvements Act of 1976.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously communicated, Hanes expects the acquisition to be 
      accretive to earnings per share in the first 12 months after closing and 
      is projected to deliver full benefits within three years of more than 
      $500 million in incremental annual sales, $0.60 in EPS, $80 million of 
      operating profit, and $65 million of free cash flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The acquisition of Maidenform would add to our momentum and true 
      earnings power of our business,&#8221; Noll said. &#8220;A reasonable goal for 2014 
      EPS is in the low $4 range, including a potential 10- to 15-cent 
      contribution from Maidenform.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Note on Non-GAAP Terms and Definitions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Free cash flow is not a generally accepted accounting principle measure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less net 
      capital expenditures. Free cash flow may not be representative of the 
      amount of residual cash flow that is available to the company for 
      discretionary expenditures since it may not include deductions for 
      mandatory debt-service requirements and other nondiscretionary 
      expenditures. The company believes, however, that free cash flow is a 
      useful measure of the cash-generating ability of the business relative 
      to capital expenditures and financial performance. For 2013 guidance, 
      net cash provided by operating activities is expected to be 
      approximately $500 million to $600 million and net capital expenditures 
      are expected to be approximately $50 million, resulting in expectations 
      for non-GAAP free cash flow of approximately $450 million to $550 
      million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hanes has chosen to provide this measure to investors to enable 
      additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance 
      and as a supplemental means of evaluating company operations. Non-GAAP 
      information should not be considered a substitute for financial 
      information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from 
      non-GAAP or other pro forma measures used by other companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This press release includes forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of 
      the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include 
      all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, 
      and can generally be identified by the use of words such as &#8220;may,&#8221; 
      &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; 
      &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;continue&#8221; or similar expressions. In particular, 
      among others, statements about 2013 guidance and the HanesBrands 
      acquisition of Maidenform (the &#8220;acquisition&#8221;), including the expected 
      impact on HanesBrands&#8217; sales, earnings, operating profit and free cash 
      flow, the anticipated funding of the acquisition and the expected timing 
      for closing the acquisition are forward-looking statements. 
      Forward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
      those projected in these statements. Where, in any forward-looking 
      statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or 
      events, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and 
      expectations of our management, expressed in good faith. However, there 
      can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or will 
      be achieved or accomplished, and actual results may differ materially 
      from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. A number of 
      important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from 
      those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, including, but not 
      limited to our ability to achieve expected synergies and successfully 
      complete the integration of Maidenform, events that could give rise to a 
      termination of the merger agreement or failure to receive necessary 
      approvals or funding for the acquisition, the outcome of any litigation 
      related to the acquisition, and the level of expenses and other charges 
      related to the acquisition and the funding thereof. For further 
      information regarding the risks associated with HanesBrands&#8217; and 
      Maidenform&#8217;s businesses, please refer to their respective filings with 
      the SEC and the proxy statement and other materials that have been filed 
      with the SEC by Maidenform in connection with the acquisition. There can 
      be no assurance that the acquisition will be completed, or if it is 
      completed, that it will close within the anticipated time period or that 
      the expected benefits of the acquisition will be realized. We believe 
      these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance 
      should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based 
      on current expectations. All forward-looking statements speak only as of 
      the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update or revise 
      forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or 
      circumstances that arise after the date made or to reflect the 
      occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Additional Information and Where to Find It
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Jefferies &amp; Co said the rally in the stock was
probably caused by the coal miner's attempts to control share
price by pushing out short sellers. "Today's price surge was
exacerbated by stock lenders recalling shares ... We believe
share prices are unsustainable," the analysts said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ENBRIDGE ENERGY MANAGEMENT LLC, $28.39, down 5

analysts' expectations due to weak sales in its consumer foods
business, which includes Chef Boyardee canned pasta, Hunt's
sauces and Slim Jim beef jerky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** AMICUS THERAPEUTICS, $2.81, up 10 pct (10:01
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biotechnology company said it has entered into a
collaboration with Biogen Idec to develop and
commercialize novel small molecules for the treatment of
Parkinson's disease. The collaboration includes funding by
Biogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** NANOSTRING TECHNOLOGIES INC, up 22 pct (10 a.m.
ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical device maker NanoString Technologies Inc 
said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its

relapsing. Prosigna testing services are

laboratories in the first quarter of 2014, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MODEL N INC, $9.87, down 33 pct (12:36 p.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue management software maker forecast revenue for
the year ending September 2014 below analysts' estimates on
Monday. Raymond James, Stifel Nicolaus and JP
Morgan cut their ratings on the stock on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Stifel said the company did not clearly
articulate a plan to cut expenses. Raymond James analysts said a
return to revenue growth could be delayed well into 2015 unless
the company quickly improved sales execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** NEUROCRINE BIOSCIENCES INC, $11.44, down 31 pct
(9:54 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said on Monday that a lower dose of its
experimental drug to treat a rare movement disorder did not meet
the main goal of a mid-stage clinical study.  
Cowen and Co cut its price target on the stock to $19 from $20
while MKM Partners cut its target to $13.50 from $17.00 and
Oppenheimer to $15 from $19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** URBAN OUTFITTERS INC, $38.25, down 10 pct (9:57
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teen apparel chain said in a regulatory filing on Monday
that percentage growth in its same-store net sales, including
online sales, was trending in the mid-single digit in the
current quarter. This forecast missed analysts' estimates.
Janney Capital Markets analyst Adrienne Tennant cut the price
target on the stock to $46 from $52, saying she expected the 9
percent growth of the second quarter to continue into this
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CYTORI THERAPEUTICS INC, $2.49, up 5 pct (9:56
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roth Capital Partners reinstated its "buy" rating on the
medical device maker's stock with a $10 price target, saying
positive data from the trials on Cytori's cell therapy for
chronic ischemic heart failure would boost its U.S. profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP LTD, $12.94, up 3 pct
(9:53 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded the chipmaker's stock to
"overweight" from "neutral", saying the company's product
development and execution over the last 18 months has spurred
growth in its mobile/wireless and storage markets. The
brokerage, expecting the company to control costs, raised its
price target on the stock to $16 from $14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** POLYCOM INC, $9.94, down 5.4 pct (3:01 p.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ron Myers, the company's senior vice president of Global
Channels, has left the videoconferencing company to pursue an
outside opportunity, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Jess Lubert
said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are disappointed by Mr. Myers' departure, as we believe
he built a strong channel organization and was well respected by
the company's partners," Lubert wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polycom's Chief Executive Andrew Miller stepped down in July
after irregularities were found in his expense submissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PALO ALTO NETWORKS INC, $48.47, up 3.3 pct (9:52
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The security software maker on Monday reported
better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter, citing a
rise in demand for its appliances and contributions from more
recurring subscription and maintenance services. 
 At least four brokerages raised their price targets on the
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** HD SUPPLY HOLDINGS INC, $22.14, down 10.5 pct
(9:51 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The construction products supplier reported a wider
quarterly loss for the second quarter due to expenses associated
with debt restructuring. The company also forecast fiscal 2013
results below analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** STARWOOD PROPERTY TRUST INC, $24.19, down 3 pct
(9:50 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which finances and manages commercial mortgage
loans, said it was offering 25 million shares in an underwritten
public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** L ENERGY INC, $3.06, up 5.5 pct (9:50 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coal miner's first-quarter profit more than doubled as
production was boosted by the acquisition of two mines in China
in November. Production rose 54 percent to 228,000 tons in the
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** FIVE BELOW INC, $47.12, up 15 pct (9:49 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialty value retailer reported better-than-expected
results for the second quarter due to a 6.6 percent increase in
same-store sales. The company also raised its full-year earnings
and revenue forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PVH CORP, $126.17, down 4.4 pct (9:48 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maker of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger clothes gave a
third-quarter sales and profit forecast that was below analysts'
estimates. The company characterized the global environment as
"challenging".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BLACKBERRY LTD, $11.01, down 4 pct (9:47 a.m.
ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian company's biggest shareholder has
approached several large Canadian investment funds about forging
a deal to take the smartphone maker private, but the proposal is
still "an airy-fairy, 'what if' kind of thing," according to a
source with direct knowledge of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MICROSOFT CORP, $32.05, up 1 pct (9:47 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least three of the top 20 investors in the company want a
turnaround expert to succeed Steve Ballmer as chief executive.
They have urged the technology giant's board to consider Ford
Motor Co Chief Executive Alan Mulally and Computer
Sciences Corp Chief Executive Mike Lawrie for the job,
several sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC, $3.81, up 3 pct (9:41
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chipmaker, targeting new markets as personal computer
sales decline, unveiled chips designed to run slot machines,
factory robots, airport signs, medical equipment and other
devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GULFPORT ENERGY CORP, $61.61, down 4 pct (10:05
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil and gas producer cut its third-quarter production
forecast to 12,250-12,750 barrels of oil equivalent per day
(boepd) from 14,000-15,000 boepd, citing pipeline infrastructure
delays and higher-than-anticipated downtime.

crossover SUVs aimed at the mass market, creating 1,700 jobs in
a British economy showing signs of resilience. The luxury
carmaker said the investment could create a further 24,000
supply chain jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CHRISTOPHER &amp; BANKS CORP, $6.34, up 7.6 pct
(10:19 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women's apparel retailer reported a
smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, boosted by stronger

second half of 2013 and post a profit in the fourth quarter, it

ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solar company said it has joined with energy services
provider Direct Energy to create an investment fund capable of
financing up to $124 million in solar projects for Direct
Energy's commercial and industrial customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** JINKOSOLAR HOLDING CO, $19.70, up 1.4 pct (9:38

ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons &amp; Co cut its rating on the midstream company's stock
to "underweight" from "neutral", citing lower storage contract
renewal rates and continued weakness in the company's fuels
marketing business and asphalt joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** YANZHOU COAL MINING, $10.40, up 9 pct (10:26 a.m.
ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Jefferies &amp; Co said the rally in the stock was
probably caused by the coal miner's attempts to control share
price by pushing out short sellers. "Today's price surge was
exacerbated by stock lenders recalling shares ... We believe
share prices are unsustainable," the analysts said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ENBRIDGE ENERGY MANAGEMENT LLC, $28.39, down 5
pct (10:23 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it expects to raise about $232 million from
an offering of about 8 million shares. The
company has 54.16 million shares outstanding, according to
Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CONAGRA FOODS INC, $31.75, down 5 pct (10:06 a.m.
ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company estimated its first-quarter profit below
analysts' expectations due to weak sales in its consumer foods
business, which includes Chef Boyardee canned pasta, Hunt's
sauces and Slim Jim beef jerky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** AMICUS THERAPEUTICS, $2.81, up 10 pct (10:01
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biotechnology company said it has entered into a
collaboration with Biogen Idec to develop and
commercialize novel small molecules for the treatment of
Parkinson's disease. The collaboration includes funding by
Biogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** NANOSTRING TECHNOLOGIES INC, up 22 pct (10 a.m.
ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical device maker NanoString Technologies Inc 
said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its
breast-cancer test, Prosigna, to assess the risk of the cancer
relapsing. Prosigna testing services are
expected to be available through qualified U.S. clinical
laboratories in the first quarter of 2014, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MODEL N INC, $9.87, down 33 pct (12:36 p.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue management software maker forecast revenue for
the year ending September 2014 below analysts' estimates on
Monday. Raymond James, Stifel Nicolaus and JP
Morgan cut their ratings on the stock on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Stifel said the company did not clearly
articulate a plan to cut expenses. Raymond James analysts said a
return to revenue growth could be delayed well into 2015 unless
the company quickly improved sales execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** NEUROCRINE BIOSCIENCES INC, $11.44, down 31 pct
(9:54 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said on Monday that a lower dose of its
experimental drug to treat a rare movement disorder did not meet
the main goal of a mid-stage clinical study.  
Cowen and Co cut its price target on the stock to $19 from $20
while MKM Partners cut its target to $13.50 from $17.00 and
Oppenheimer to $15 from $19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** URBAN OUTFITTERS INC, $38.25, down 10 pct (9:57
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teen apparel chain said in a regulatory filing on Monday
that percentage growth in its same-store net sales, including
online sales, was trending in the mid-single digit in the
current quarter. This forecast missed analysts' estimates.
Janney Capital Markets analyst Adrienne Tennant cut the price
target on the stock to $46 from $52, saying she expected the 9
percent growth of the second quarter to continue into this
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CYTORI THERAPEUTICS INC, $2.49, up 5 pct (9:56
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roth Capital Partners reinstated its "buy" rating on the
medical device maker's stock with a $10 price target, saying
positive data from the trials on Cytori's cell therapy for
chronic ischemic heart failure would boost its U.S. profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP LTD, $12.94, up 3 pct
(9:53 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded the chipmaker's stock to
"overweight" from "neutral", saying the company's product
development and execution over the last 18 months has spurred
growth in its mobile/wireless and storage markets. The
brokerage, expecting the company to control costs, raised its
price target on the stock to $16 from $14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PALO ALTO NETWORKS INC, $48.47, up 3.3 pct (9:52
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The security software maker on Monday reported
better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter, citing a
rise in demand for its appliances and contributions from more
recurring subscription and maintenance services. 
 At least four brokerages raised their price targets on the
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** HD SUPPLY HOLDINGS INC, $22.14, down 10.5 pct
(9:51 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The construction products supplier reported a wider
quarterly loss for the second quarter due to expenses associated
with debt restructuring. The company also forecast fiscal 2013
results below analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** STARWOOD PROPERTY TRUST INC, $24.19, down 3 pct
(9:50 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which finances and manages commercial mortgage
loans, said it was offering 25 million shares in an underwritten
public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** L ENERGY INC, $3.06, up 5.5 pct (9:50 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coal miner's first-quarter profit more than doubled as
production was boosted by the acquisition of two mines in China
in November. Production rose 54 percent to 228,000 tons in the
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** FIVE BELOW INC, $47.12, up 15 pct (9:49 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialty value retailer reported better-than-expected
results for the second quarter due to a 6.6 percent increase in
same-store sales. The company also raised its full-year earnings
and revenue forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PVH CORP, $126.17, down 4.4 pct (9:48 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maker of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger clothes gave a
third-quarter sales and profit forecast that was below analysts'
estimates. The company characterized the global environment as
"challenging".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BLACKBERRY LTD, $11.01, down 4 pct (9:47 a.m.
ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian company's biggest shareholder has
approached several large Canadian investment funds about forging
a deal to take the smartphone maker private, but the proposal is
still "an airy-fairy, 'what if' kind of thing," according to a
source with direct knowledge of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MICROSOFT CORP, $32.05, up 1 pct (9:47 a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least three of the top 20 investors in the company want a
turnaround expert to succeed Steve Ballmer as chief executive.
They have urged the technology giant's board to consider Ford
Motor Co Chief Executive Alan Mulally and Computer
Sciences Corp Chief Executive Mike Lawrie for the job,
several sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC, $3.81, up 3 pct (9:41
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chipmaker, targeting new markets as personal computer
sales decline, unveiled chips designed to run slot machines,
factory robots, airport signs, medical equipment and other
devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GULFPORT ENERGY CORP, $61.61, down 4 pct (10:05
a.m. ET)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil and gas producer cut its third-quarter production
forecast to 12,250-12,750 barrels of oil equivalent per day
(boepd) from 14,000-15,000 boepd, citing pipeline infrastructure
delays and higher-than-anticipated downtime.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Investors trimmed their
holdings of longer-dated Treasuries in the latest week after a
disappointing U.S. jobs report failed to   alter expectations
the Federal Reserve would pare its bond purchases next week,
according to a survey released on Tuesday by J.P. Morgan
Securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's $65 billion worth of Treasuries supply, plus a
mega bond offering from Verizon, also spurred investors
to reduce their longer-dated Treasuries holdings, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of investors who said on Monday that their
holdings of longer-dated U.S. government debt were greater than 
their holdings of portfolio benchmarks fell to 15 percent from
23 percent a week earlier, J.P. Morgan Securities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries, investors lower
the duration, or interest rate, risk to their portfolios in
anticipation of a market decline, which generally causes
longer-dated bonds to generate higher losses than shorter-dated
debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In J.P. Morgan's survey of its Treasuries clients, 62
percent said they were "neutral" in their duration on U.S.
government debt, or owned longer-dated Treasuries equal to their
benchmarks, matching last week's level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three percent of its Treasuries clients said they
were "short" in duration of Treasuries, or owning fewer
longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks, up from 15
percent a week earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of "shorts" exceeded "longs" in the latest week by
8 percentage points, which was the highest level of nets shorts
since June 24. A week ago, the share of longs topped shorts by 8
points, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early Tuesday trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields
 rose 4.5 basis points to 2.959 percent on upbeat
economic data from China and reduced likelihood on a U.S.
military strike against Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10-year note yield rose above 3 percent Friday, which
was the highest since July 2011, before the release of the
August payrolls data. The government reported U.S. employers
hired 169,000 workers, less than the 180,000 forecast by
economists polled by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists told Reuters after the latest jobs report they
now expect the Fed to begin paring its purchases of Treasuries
and mortgage-backed securities by $10 billion a month, down from
the $15 billion median in Friday's primary dealer poll and a
wider poll conducted in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank will hold a policy meeting on Sept
17-18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among active clients, viewed as making speculative bets in
Treasuries, 15 percent of active investors said they held more
longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks, down from 23
percent last week, while 31 percent said they were short in
duration versus their benchmarks, up from 15 percent last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-four percent of active investors said their
longer-dated Treasuries holdings matched benchmarks, down from
62 percent the prior week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan surveys 40 to 60 of its Treasuries clients
weekly, of which 60 percent are fund managers, 25 percent are
speculative accounts, and 15 percent are central banks and
sovereign wealth funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It asks 10 to 20 of its active clients each week about their
Treasuries holdings, of which 70 percent are speculative
accounts and the rest are money managers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The day-long Veterans Institute, co-sponsored by Heroes Work 
      Here and Disney Institute, is designed to help small- and mid-sized 
      companies build effective veteran-hiring programs of their own. The 
      event will feature experts from Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here, 
      government officials, veterans, and non-profit veterans service 
      organizations, who will share their experiences, best practices, and 
      tips for making a successful transition from the military to the 
      civilian workforce.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re incredibly proud of the veterans who work at Disney, and we fully 
      recognize the value, experience and skills they bring to our company,&#8221; 
      said Robert A. Iger, Chairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company. &#8220;Our Heroes 
      Work Here program not only helps us find and hire highly qualified 
      veterans, it also supports veterans and their families as they 
      transition out of the military. We&#8217;re happy to share what we&#8217;ve learned 
      with other organizations so that more of these modern-day heroes have 
      the tools and opportunities to build meaningful careers in the private 
      sector.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Veterans Institute is the latest effort in Disney&#8217;s long history 
      of respect and appreciation for the U.S. Armed Services, and it will 
      leverage the success of Heroes Work Here, which Disney launched 
      in March, 2012 with a commitment to hire more than 1,000 veterans by 
      2015&#8212;a goal the company has already surpassed. This past March, Disney 
      increased its hiring goal to create opportunities for another 1,000 
      former service members in the next two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights of the Veterans Institute workshop will include: an 
      inside look at Heroes Work Here; renowned keynote speakers, 
      panelists, Disney on-air talent and personalities; customized Disney 
      Institute courses; advice and insights from experts and elite veterans 
      support organizations; and stories from veterans about their own 
      transition to the civilian workforce.

			About Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Supporting the U.S. Armed Forces has long been a Disney tradition, and 
      Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here continues that proud legacy with a 
      company-wide initiative to hire, train and support military veterans. 
      Disney introduced the program in March, 2012 with a commitment to hire 
      at least 1,000 veterans by 2015. Having exceeded that goal in the first 
      year alone, with 1,300 veterans hired, the company announced in March, 
      2013 that it would create opportunities for another 1,000 former service 
      members over the next two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here initiative also features a public 
      awareness campaign to encourage employers across the U.S. to hire former 
      military service members. The campaign includes the free Veterans 
      Institute workshop at Walt Disney World on November 14, 2013, as 
      well as public service announcements 
      highlighting the skills and experience of veterans who work at Disney. 
      The PSAs direct viewers to the White House&#8217;s Joining Forces initiative (www.joiningforces.gov) 
      and have aired across Disney&#8217;s media properties including ESPN, ABC and 
      ABC Family, making more than 500 million impressions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third component of Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here initiative is 
      philanthropy. Disney&#8217;s philanthropic support of veteran and military 
      organizations has exceeded $1 million since the launch of Heroes Work 
      Here, and through the Disney VoluntEARS program, employees have 
      engaged in several service projects with veterans organizations in 
      communities around the country.

			AcadiaSoft Announces Real Time Collateral Messaging with IBM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AcadiaSoft Inc (&#8220;AcadiaSoft&#8221;) 
      is pleased to announce connectivity between its electronic messaging 
      solution, MarginSphere&#174;, and IBM &#174; Algo Collateral &#174; providing full two 
      way integration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Using the newly launched IBM Algo Collateral &#174; Open Connect &#174; adaptor, 
      margin calls can now be transferred directly to MarginSphere&#174; from the 
      IBM Algo Collateral &#174; workflow. The messaging solution implements 
      straight-through margining representing a seamless exchange through 
      automated processing of margin calls and related information. This 
      delivers tangible benefits in achieving operational efficiencies and 
      preparing for Dodd-Frank and EMIR requirements including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Speeding up margin call processing times
      
			
        Removing reliance on email for client communications
      
			
        Reducing need for dual-key entry
      
			
        Supporting greater user efficiency and cost reductions
      
			
        Providing clear and logical audit trail of all communications
      
			
        Supporting business growth across OTC, Cleared, Repo  Securities 
        Lending business
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			MarginSphere&#174; is the result of collaboration between AcadiaSoft 
      and several of the industry&#8217;s largest financial institutions. It is a 
      margin confirmation community where counterparties engaged in collateral 
      management electronically confirm margin calls, statements, 
      substitutions and interest statements. MarginSphere&#174; enables the reduced 
      reliance on and progressive elimination of emails for communicating and 
      agreeing margin events and information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Neil Murphy, Risk Analytics, IBM,
			commented: &#8220;The 
      collateral margin call process was largely unchanged in over 10 years 
      prior to the credit crisis, and like much of the OTC industry, was often 
      reliant on manual processes.
			Automation and systems 
      inter-operability are crucial steps to improve not only communications 
      between firms but also to support business growth, cost reductions and 
      reduce risk levels.
			We expect electronic messaging to replace 
      email as the standard for all collateral related communications.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chris Walsh, Chief Operating Officer of AcadiaSoft, commented: &#8220;MarginSphere&#174; 
      provides industry standard automation of the margin process &#8211; a critical 
      element of our clients regulatory and operational plans. We have a 
      significant number of clients, on both the buy and sell side, leveraging 
      the IBM application for collateral management.
			By collaborating 
      to create automation we believe we have created the right solution at 
      the right time &#8211; allowing these clients to satisfy regulatory 
      requirements and achieve new levels of efficiency.&#8221;

      Research and Markets: Mammography World Markets Report: Eli Lilly, GE 
      Healthcare, Novartis AG, Pfizer, Inc., Siemens Among Top Vendors
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/nbsvqr/mammography_world) 
      has announced the addition of the "Mammography 
      World Markets" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This study gives priority to those companies that are actively 
      developing and marketing clinical laboratory instrumentation, reagents 
      and supplies for performing diagnostic tests specifically related to 
      breast cancer surgery and screening mammograms. This focus is primarily 
      on the hospital market and freestanding-clinic segments and, separately, 
      on a description of the instruments, reagents and supplies marketed by 
      major companies in this segment. Other areas covered in this study 
      include what is generally characterized as digital imaging techniques 
      instruments and reagents, picture archiving communications systems 
      (PACS) or other data storage methods, or other medical imaging 
      technologies. The reader should consult other TriMark reports for a 
      detailed discussion of the important individual market segments related 
      to the mammography market, such as imaging methods, computer tomography, 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital X-ray.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mammograms are X-ray images of the breast produced from low radiation 
      X-rays (1-3 milligrays, or mGy).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The three types of mammography systems are:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      1) analog systems,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      2) computed tomography (CR) systems and
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      3) full-field digital mammography (FFDM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analog systems are the conventional types, and they use X-ray films 
      for capturing the breast images. The CR systems are also film-based, but 
      are retrofitted with digital detectors. In FFDM, the X-ray film is 
      replaced by solid-state detectors that convert X-rays into electrical 
      signals. The electrical signals are used to generate images of the 
      breast that can be viewed on a computer screen or printed on special 
      film similar to conventional mammograms. Additionally, the radiation 
      dose in FFDM is only 1.86 mGy radiation per view.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This report thoroughly reviews:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      1) existing and emerging mammography technologies,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      2) known risk factors for breast cancer,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      3) breast cancer treatments and drugs,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      4) types of mastectomy procedures,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      5) breast reconstruction surgery, and
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      6) funding for breast cancer research.

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman debacle cast shadow over Western banks' sukuk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Controversy over structure, use of funds raised&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* SocGen issue would be only second by major Western bank&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Malaysia jurisdiction will help it avoid controversy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Bank looking at wakala, other structures - source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bernardo Vizcaino and Al-Zaquan Amer Hamzah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI/KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 10 (Reuters) - With its plan to
issue up to 1 billion Malaysian ringgit ($305 million) of
Islamic bonds, Societe Generale appears to be avoiding missteps
made by Goldman Sachs in an ill-fated attempt to sell sukuk two
years ago - a positive sign for Western banks' efforts to move
into Islamic finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SocGen aims to issue the first tranche of its
sukuk programme by the end of this year in Malaysia, sources
familiar with the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be only the second big European bank to issue
sukuk, and the first to do so in Asia; the Middle East unit of
HSBC tapped the market in 2011 with a $500 million
issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs tried to follow HSBC in late 2011 with
a $2 billion sukuk programme, but its plan ran into controversy
among Islamic scholars and analysts, who questioned whether the
U.S. investment bank was obeying religious principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debacle threatened to hurt Islamic markets' acceptance
of Western banks in general. SocGen's less controversial plan
may now ease that worry, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it plans to issue in Malaysia's centralised
regulatory environment, the French bank has a clear set of rules
to follow which may help it to avoid the issues faced by
Goldman, said Aznan Hasan, an Islamic scholar who worked on
preparing the Goldman sukuk plan in 2011 and serves on both of
Malaysia's central sharia boards which supervise the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were two issues with Goldman Sachs - the first was
the use of the profit and the second was tradability. If Goldman
had managed to follow the instructions by the sharia scholars,
there would have been no issue at all," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTROVERSY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman registered its sukuk programme with the Irish Stock
Exchange in October 2011, setting up a special-purpose vehicle
in the Cayman Islands to issue a sukuk based on murabaha, a
common cost-plus-profit arrangement in Islamic finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan ran into criticism from some Islamic scholars and
analysts who suggested Goldman might use the proceeds of the
issue to conduct conventional banking, violating Islam's ban on
interest payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also concern that the issue might not trade at par
value on the Irish exchange, which would contravene sharia law's
prohibition on monetary speculation, and debate over whether the
underlying structure of the sukuk was murabaha or reverse
tawarruq, which has been ruled unacceptable by some Islamic
scholars as an effort to hide the use of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the situation was the way in which Goldman
arranged for sharia scholars to vet the issue. The prospectus
said eight scholars were "expected" to approve it, before all of
them had actually signed off on the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman insisted its planned sukuk complied with all Islamic
principles, and the instrument was eventually endorsed by 10
eminent scholars, according to the U.S. bank's sharia advisory
firm. According to regulatory filings, Goldman still maintains
its Cayman Islands vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a public issue of sukuk never went ahead and the
prospectus on the Irish exchange is now well past its 12-month
validity period - making Goldman's plan a public relations
headache for the U.S. firm, and a missed opportunity for the
Islamic finance industry to increase its credibility by engaging
with a top global institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CENTRALISED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SocGen has declined to comment on its own plan, but initial
signs are that it will manage to avoid many or all of the
pitfalls which tripped up Goldman. So far, news of SocGen's
issue has not prompted nearly as much debate in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaysia has developed a centralised approach to Islamic
finance, with issuers required to obtain the approval of a
sharia board at the central bank and products needing to be
vetted by a sharia board at the securities commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the approval of those two boards is granted, other
scholars will find it hard to challenge the SocGen sukuk - and
even if objections are raised in the Gulf, a large pool of
southeast Asian investors, comfortable with Malaysia's
regulatory approach, are likely to buy the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the proposed SocGen sukuk...in our regulatory
framework, it mentions clearly that any issuance of sukuk shall
be used for sharia-compliant purposes. This is built into our
regulation, so the issue would not arise at all," Hasan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the matter said SocGen had obtained a
green light from the Malaysian central bank for the issue and
was now seeking approval from the securities commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The structure is still being worked on as SocGen is after
the highest possible rating for better pricing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the structures being considered by SocGen is wakala,
an arrangement in which one party acts as agent for another, the
source said. In a wakala sukuk, certificates are issued by an
originator to buy specific assets which are given to the agent,
who charges a fee for his services. The originator undertakes to
buy the assets on maturity at an agreed price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HSBC sukuk of 2011 used the wakala structure, which has
been favoured by many scholars over murabaha because of its
clearer link to the assets backing the structure. It is also
tradable, making it popular for interbank transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HSBC issued sukuk before and they used this to grow their
own sharia-compliant businesses. If SocGen wants to issue a
sukuk in Malaysia, they have to comply with that ruling as
well," said Hasan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they use a structure that is tradable in nature, for
example a sukuk ijara, wakala or musharaka, there shall be no
issue with tradability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from SocGen's sukuk would be used to buy
sharia-compliant assets in Dubai, where the bank's private
banking operations for the Middle East are based, said the
source. Sukuk issued under the programme could carry tenors
ranging from five to ten years, said a second source with
knowledge of the matter.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - At least three of the top 20 investors in Microsoft Corp want a turnaround expert to succeed Steve Ballmer as chief executive and have urged the technology giant's board to consider Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally and Computer Sciences Corp CEO Mike Lawrie for the job, several sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special committee of the board, which is conducting the CEO search, and its advisers have been meeting with shareholders after Ballmer's surprise decision late last month to retire within a year, the sources said. It could name a CEO as soon as the end of this year, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one such meeting, Microsoft said it started with a list of about 40 people, including internal and external candidates, and has been narrowing it down, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't clear whether the Microsoft board had reached out to any of the potential candidates suggested by investors or whether it was even considering them. The names of other candidates in the mix could not be learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined comment on Monday. Lawrie and Mulally could not be reached for comment. But last week, Mulally told Reuters that he was "absolutely focused on serving our Ford."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources requested their identity as well as those of the investors be kept anonymous because the discussions were private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search for a new chief executive of the world's largest software maker is one of the most closely watched developments in the technology sector this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft remains highly profitable, but it has struggled to gain traction in the mobile device business against rivals such as Apple Inc and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, the company unveiled a deep reorganization to transform into a "devices and services" leader, but has so far failed to convince investors that its strategy will work. In a sign that shareholders had already lost confidence in Ballmer, Microsoft's shares rose 7 percent after news of his planned retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft said it would buy Nokia's phone business and license its patents for 5.44 billion euros ($7.1 billion). Shares of the software company fell as much as 6 percent as investors protested the acquisition of an underperforming and marginalized unit that made a $3 billion operating loss in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move also brings Stephen Elop, who ran Microsoft's business software division before jumping ship in 2010, back to the company, positioned as another candidate to succeed Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chairman and co-founder Bill Gates, who is still the company's largest shareholder with a 4.8 percent stake and is on the four-member special committee, will likely have a veto on the new CEO choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates, who has focused his day-to-day activities on philanthropy for the last five years, has not given any indication of what kind of CEO he favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TURNAROUND MEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are attracted to Mulally and Lawrie because both have histories of successfully turning around companies, although the Ford CEO is more widely known thanks to his dramatic reversal of the No. 2 U.S. automaker, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a succession plan at Ford outlined last November, Mulally, 68, is expected to stay on as CEO until at least the end of 2014. But people with knowledge of the matter said the executive may step down sooner than planned if he finds an appealing new role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no change from what we announced in November: Alan Mulally plans to continue to serve as Ford's president and CEO through at least 2014," Ford spokesman Jay Cooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A role as the head of Microsoft would allow him to follow up his seven-year tenure as Ford's CEO with another high-profile job. It would also bring him back to Seattle, where he lived during his nearly four decades at Boeing Co and still has a home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other candidate on investors' radar is Lawrie, a long-time IT executive who engineered a complex fix at UK-based Misys Plc, a financial software company, before joining Computer Sciences in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer Sciences, which is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround plan under Lawrie, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrie also spent nearly three decades at IBM, where he worked alongside John Thompson, Microsoft's lead independent director who is heading the special committee, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Lawrie worked for about a year as a general partner of activist investor ValueAct Capital, a Microsoft shareholder that had pressed for Ballmer's ouster and has been offered a seat on the company's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM EXPERIENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Ballmer was more a salesman than a technology specialist, a choice of Mulally, who comes from outside the technology sector, would be a radical departure for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major precedent for such a move was IBM's successful hiring of Louis Gerstner, a manager from the financial industry who turned around the struggling computer company between 1993 and 2002. John Sculley, who went from PepsiCo to lead Apple from 1983 to 1993, was not regarded as being very successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its problems, Microsoft is not yet in such a dire predicament as IBM was in the early 1990s. Microsoft reported a profit of $22 billion last year, despite falling sales of PCs, which are still the key to its main businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its online and mobile computing efforts do not make money. Its Bing search engine and other online ventures have lost almost $3 billion in the last two years alone, and last quarter the company took a $900 million write-down on the value of unsold Surface tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite billions of dollars of investment, Windows phones still have less than a 4 percent global market share, according to the latest figures from research firm IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle and Deepa Seetharaman in Detroit; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) may settle probes by U.S. regulators into its credit card debt collection practices and sales of identity-theft products within weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank based in the U.S., had previously disclosed the credit card and identity-theft product investigations. Reuters' source, who declined to be identified by name, said talks about a settlement have been on and off for months but have heated up recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fine of less than $80 million for both matters is planned by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to Bloomberg News, which on Wednesday reported the possibility of a settlement being reached as early as next week.

      Levi  Korsinsky announces that a class action lawsuit has been 
      commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of 
      Florida on behalf of investors who purchased Walter Investment 
      Management Corp. (&#8220;Walter&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NYSE:WAC) commons stock 
      during the period between May 9, 2012 and June 6, 2013.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented and/or failed to 
      disclose that: a) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over 
      financial accounting; b) the Company&#8217;s financial statements contained 
      false and misleading statements; c) the Company failed to disclose 
      material weaknesses in the internal controls of its recent acquisition, 
      Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;RMS&#8221;); d) the Company had overstated 
      the value of RMS; and e) as a result of the foregoing, all statements at 
      relevant times were materially false and misleading.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On March 18, 2013, the Company disclosed that it had identified a 
      material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. On 
      this news, the Company&#8217;s shares fell 20% to close at $32.98 on March 19, 
      2013. On June 6, 2013, the Company reported that it had discovered a 
      failure to record certain estimated liabilities to investors relating to 
      servicing error by RMS and, therefore, RMS&#8217; financial statements should 
      no longer be relied upon.

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago said that Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA will work with U.S. company Chevron (CVX.N) to develop an offshore natural gas field, one of three that span the Caribbean countries' maritime border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal follows six years of binational talks about how to share the reserves fairly. Venezuela wants to develop its neglected natural gas fields, in part to feed demand for electricity that is straining its hydropower production network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PDVSA-Chevron joint venture will explore the largest of the shared fields, the Loran-Manatee bloc, Venezuela's Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez said at the signing ceremony on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Loran-Manatee field has proven reserves of just over 10 trillion cubic feet (tcf); under the agreement 73.75 percent belongs to Venezuela and the rest to Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela was allocated 64 percent of the second-largest bloc, Cocuina Manakin, which has 0.74 tcf of reserves, Ramirez said, while Trinidad and Tobago has 84 percent of the third, the 0.31 tcf Dorado-Kapot field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minister did not specify when the joint venture would start work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate response from Chevron to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron currently participate in six onshore and offshore production projects in the country, in partnership with PDVSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, PDVSA will build a gas pipeline of about 170 miles from the Loran-Manatee bloc to the Paria Peninsula on the Venezuelan coast. That area is the focus of a high profile but long delayed Venezuelan offshore natural gas project called Mariscal Sucre, where reserves are estimated at 14.7 tcf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's gas projects have languished for years, stalled by low domestic market prices and industry fears of expropriations by the government of the late socialist leader Hugo Chavez that left PDVSA struggling to attract partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez nationalized almost all the OPEC nation's oil industry during his 14-year rule.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 11 (Reuters) - The liquefied natural gas market looks
to be tight in the years ahead given a shortage of new projects
lined up, partly due to rising costs as demand for contractors
to do the work has surged, Chevron Corp's vice chairman
said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Australian LNG export capacity already has been
scrapped, while Chevron was forced to add $15 billion to the
price tag for its huge Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rising costs of contracting will impact the economics
of projects, and could temper the industry's willingness to
invest," George Kirkland, who runs the U.S. company's oil and
gas production arm, said of the industry in general. "The supply
is there. Really the question then becomes: can we bring it to
market?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With another large Western Australia LNG export project due
to start up for Chevron at Wheatstone in 2016 - less than two
years after Gorgon - and with the most advanced one in Western
Canada at Kitimat, Kirkland said his company felt pleased it
moved fast enough to meet growing Asian demand for natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cycle time for LNG plants between front-end engineering
design (FEED) work and first gas shipments could run up to eight
years, Kirkland said in a lunchtime address to investors at the
Barclays CEO Energy-Power conference in New York. Plus, entering
that FEED stage represented a $1 billion commitment, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirkland saw Canada as a better opportunity for LNG plants
than Chevron's home country, simply because it had a long and
unbroken tradition of exporting energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was speaking right before the U.S. government gave its
approval for exports from a proposed fourth LNG export facility
at Cove Point, Maryland, on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for meeting Asian demand with gas closer to home, he cast
doubt on the most ambitious assumptions about shale in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Chevron was encouraged by early assessments of its own
interests there, Kirkland said on a recent trip to China he had
heard talk generally of a "considerable reduction in the
potential" in the country overall, following early estimates
that it had more shale gas than anywhere else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Time will truly tell, as it always tells in our business,"
Kirkland said. "I always get reminded that we have views, and
those views get turned around later, both up and down."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Pfizer's IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed Pfizer Inc.'s (Pfizer's) Issuer Default 
      Rating (IDR) at 'A+'. The rating actions apply to approximately $36.7 
      billion of consolidated debt outstanding as of June 30, 2013. The Rating 
      Outlook is Stable. A full list of Pfizer's ratings can be found at near 
      the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch believes Pfizer's narrowing strategic focus on human branded 
      pharmaceuticals will improve long-term profitability and growth, 
      offsetting the negative effect of a less-diversified business model.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The company's patent cliff is becoming less steep as a smaller 
      percentage (roughly 20%) of branded revenues are exposed to patent 
      expiration in the next three years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --One of Pfizer's at-risk branded products, Enbrel, is a biologic drug, 
      which Fitch expects will lose less market share to biosimilar 
      competition than the 80%-90% that typically occurs with generic 
      competition to small molecule drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Pfizer is making decent progress in developing and commercializing a 
      pipeline of the new drugs; the company has launched four new therapies 
      (one of which is Eliquis, a product co-developed and co-marketed with 
      Bristol-Myers Squibb) during the last two years for uses in treating 
      cancer, preventing strokes and treating inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Despite the company's recent drug launches, Fitch expects Pfizer will 
      generate relatively flat organic revenues through 2016. Fitch's 
      expectation incorporates the anticipated performance of Pfizer's mature, 
      new and expected-to-be launched products, moderate macroeconomic 
      headwinds and the beneficial demand effects of the Affordable Care Act 
      (ACA).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch anticipates Pfizer will generate strong free cash flow (FCF) and 
      maintain solid liquidity during the intermediate term, with significant 
      international cash balances and adequate access to the credit markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy cash 
      towards acquisitions and share repurchases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch forecasts that Pfizer will operate with total debt leverage 
      ranging between 1.5 times (x) and 1.7x, driven by relatively flat EBITDA 
      generation and debt levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NARROWING STRATEGIC FOCUS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes Pfizer's sharpening strategic focus on human branded 
      pharmaceuticals, while decreasing the diversity of its product 
      portfolio, will enable the company to improve the productivity of its 
      core operations, including research  development, marketing and 
      manufacturing. This should result in improved profitability and topline 
      growth over the longer term. Fitch believes Pfizer is strongly committed 
      to the more narrowly focused business model as evidenced by the recently 
      completed divestiture of its Animal Health business (Zoetis) in the 
      second quarter of 2013, and the sale of its nutritional business in 
      November 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MODERATING PATENT CLIFF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company's patent cliff is appreciably less steep than it was in 
      2012. Over the next three years, around 20% of the company's drug 
      portfolio is at-risk of losing market exclusivity, including the loss of 
      market exclusivity for two of its five-bestselling medicines - Celebrex 
      (approximately 5% of expected 2013 total firm sales) and Enbrel 
      (approximately 7% of expected 2013 of total firm sales). The main U.S. 
      patent for Celebrex expires in December 2015, and the base patent for 
      Enbrel expires internationally beginning in 2014. Pfizer does not have 
      rights to Enbrel in the U.S., but does receive alliance revenues from 
      Amgen for sales in the region. The profitability of this agreement for 
      Pfizer drops off significantly after Oct. 31, 2013, due to the terms of 
      the contract with Amgen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not expect that Enbrel will face as serious a competitive 
      threat from biosimilar alternatives as Celebrex will with generic 
      substitutes. Enbrel is a biologic, and Fitch does not think a generic 
      biologic that is automatically interchangeable with Enbrel will emerge 
      in the E.U. or U.S., given the industry's currently limited level of 
      technological expertise in replicating biologics and only modest 
      regulatory experience in the U.S. Therefore, Fitch expects competitive 
      challengers will require significant research and marketing investments, 
      making steep price discounts and drastic market share gains by 
      competitors unlikely in the first few years following Enbrel's patent 
      expiry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PIPELINE SUCCESSES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Helping to mitigate the anticipated revenue challenges from patent 
      expiries, Pfizer has added new revenue sources over the past two years, 
      including Xalkori (cancer), Eliquis (blood clots) Xeljanz (arthritis) 
      and Bosulif (cancer). The company is also making progress on late-stage 
      pipeline candidates, such as tafamidis (polyneuropathy) and dacomitinib 
      (cancer), while also conducting clinical trials that could expand the 
      use of currently marketed products to additional treatment indications. 
      Also in April 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration designated 
      Pfizer's investigation drug, palbociclib, for expedited development and 
      review for the treatment of breast cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EXPECTED FLAT ORGANIC REVENUES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects the net effect of existing product sales, lost sales due 
      to patent expirations and the ramp up of recently introduced products 
      will result in relatively flat organic revenues through 2016. Fitch's 
      revenue forecast assumes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Moderate uptake of recently launched products;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Celebrex's loss of market exclusivity in December 2015;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Enbrel's loss of European exclusivity in 2015;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The declining contribution of U.S./Canada sales of Enbrel beginning in 
      November 2013;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Persisting weak macroeconomic trends;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --A modest demand tailwind from the expected increase in the rolls of 
      the insured in 2014 from the Affordable Care Act.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STRONG CASH FLOW EXPECTED
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch forecasts $9 billion to $10 billion of FCF (cash flow from 
      operations minus capital expenditures minus dividends) for Pfizer in 
      2013. The forecast incorporates relatively durable legacy margins 
      supported by a stable sales mix and a strong focus on cost control. In 
      addition, aggregate pricing growth across the company's product 
      portfolio is expected to be supportive for margins in the near term. 
      During 2014-2015, Fitch projects annual FCF of $6 billion - $8 billion 
      if the company does not increase operational leverage during a period of 
      relatively flat revenues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SOLID LIQUIDITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has solid liquidity through strong FCF generation and ample 
      access to the credit markets. FCF for the latest 12 months (LTM) ending 
      June 30, 2013 was $8.35 billion. At the end of the period, Pfizer had 
      approximately $32.7 billion in cash/short-term investments (largely held 
      outside the U.S.) and full availability on its $7 billion revolver, 
      maturing on April 18, 2017.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch views Pfizer's debt maturity schedule as manageable and expects 
      the company to refinance upcoming maturities with additional borrowings. 
      Pfizer has approximately $1.3 billion of debt maturing in 2013, $3.8 
      billion in 2014, $3.1 billion in 2015, $4.2 billion in 2016 and $22.6 
      billion thereafter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AGGRESSIVE CASH DEPLOYMENT TO PERSIST
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes Pfizer will continue to aggressively deploy cash towards 
      acquisitions and share repurchases with the relative intensity between 
      the two options will likely be driven by the relative returns to 
      shareholders. In addition, Fitch expects that Pfizer will remain 
      committed to an increasing dividend over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STABLE LEVERAGE ANTICIPATED
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Stable Outlook incorporates Fitch's anticipation that Pfizer will 
      operate with total debt leverage ranging between 1.5x and 1.7x, driven 
      by relatively flat profitability and debt levels. FCF and cash on hand 
      should be sufficient to fund targeted acquisitions and share repurchases 
      without requiring incremental debt issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a 
      positive rating action include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --If Pfizer were to durably maintain gross debt leverage in the range of 
      1.0x to 1.3x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --If the company sustained strong operational performance through the 
      current patent cliff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a 
      negative rating action include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --If pressure on operations were significant enough to result in 
      sustained gross debt leverage greater than 1.7x. Operational pressure 
      would most likely originate from weaker than expected demand for 
      pharmaceuticals in developed healthcare markets, unfavorable clinical 
      developments regarding Pfizer's pipeline of new drug therapies, and/or 
      increased pricing pressure by payors, particularly with respect to new 
      drug launches.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --If Pfizer pursues a transaction (acquisitions/share repurchases) that 
      places pressure on gross leverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DEBT ISSUE RATINGS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed Pfizer Inc.'s ratings as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IDR at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper program at 'F1';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Credit facility at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings apply to roughly $28 billion of debt (excluding subsidiary 
      debt) outstanding at June 30, 2013. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has also assigned the following ratings to Pfizer's consolidated 
      subsidiaries as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyeth LLC
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IDR at 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings apply to roughly $7.3 billion of subsidiary debt outstanding 
      at June 30, 2013. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The subsidiary's senior unsecured notes were affirmed at 'A+'. The 
      ratings on these notes were previously listed under Pfizer and have now 
      been moved to Wyeth LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pharmacia Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IDR at 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings apply to roughly $1.4 billion of subsidiary debt outstanding 
      at June 30, 2013. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The subsidiary's senior unsecured notes were affirmed at 'A+'. The 
      ratings on these notes were previously listed under Pfizer and have now

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An Exxon Mobil Corp subsidiary is being charged by the Pennsylvania attorney general for spilling more than 50,000 gallons of wastewater at a natural gas well site in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Personal 3D Printers: Market Forecast and Market 
      Share Analysis: 2013-2022 Featuring the Top 10 Companies such as 
      Microsoft, Staples and UPS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/zz52w7/personal_3d) 
      has announced the addition of the "Personal 
      3D Printers: Market Forecast and Market Share Analysis: 2013-2022" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Almost 70,000 personal 3D printers will be sold in 2013, with personal 
      3D printing being hailed by some as the next big thing - almost as 
      disruptive as the personal computing revolution itself. Big name 
      companies - Microsoft, Staples and UPS - are also making investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      But the other side of the 3D printing story is that it is not yet clear 
      what 3D personal printing is good for and many suppliers of these 
      machines are small companies with limited resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With all this in mind this new report from SmarTech provides the first 
      thorough market analysis of the personal 3D printer space. It offers an 
      in-depth discussion of applications where we believe personal 3D 
      printers can generate new business revenues and includes a ten-year 
      (volume and value) forecasts of personal 3D printers with breakouts by 
      application. Also included in this report are 10-year projections of 
      software, 3D scanners and services used in the personal 3D printer 
      sector.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report also provides SmarTech's assessment of the market shares of 
      all the leading suppliers of personal 3D printers, along with a 
      discussion of the strategies of the key firms influencing this market. 
      Likely long-term financing trends for the 3D personal printing sector 
      are also discussed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report will be invaluable to product marketing and business 
      development executives in the 3D printing sector, as well as the 
      investment community.

			New IBM SmartCloud Offering Leverages Desktone&#8217;s Multi-tenancy for 
      Security and Compliance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Desktone, Inc., the pioneer of Desktops as a Service (DaaS), today 
      announced a new DaaS service available immediately on IBM SmartCloud for 
      Government, for federal government agencies and departments. By 
      delivering the Desktone Platform, the industry&#8217;s leading multi-tenant 
      desktop virtualization platform purpose-built for Service Providers, via 
      IBM SmartCloud, IBM is providing the security and compliance the 
      government requires along with the high-performing desktop environment 
      demanded by mobile workforces.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IBM SmartCloud services are renowned for helping the federal government 
      operate smarter and more efficiently. We&#8217;re thrilled IBM has selected 
      Desktone to extend those services to DaaS,&#8221; said Peter McKay, CEO, 
      Desktone. &#8220;By combining IBM&#8217;s secure data center delivery with 
      Desktone&#8217;s unique multi-tenancy and security capabilities, we&#8217;re 
      addressing the government&#8217;s stringent needs for control, savings and 
      flexibility.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      DaaS has unique requirements&#8212;including massive scalability, resiliency 
      and the ability to securely handle multiple geographies and 
      tenants&#8212;which can&#8217;t be met by porting traditional virtual desktop 
      technologies to the cloud. Desktone&#8217;s DaaS technology was built from the 
      ground up for cloud delivery and Service Providers. Unlike other 
      approaches, Desktone employs true multi-tenancy, which enables the 
      superior security required by the federal government. Desktone&#8217;s 
      multi-tenancy delivers a shared, unified platform for all end-customers, 
      with dedicated desktops and completely secure separation across five 
      critical levels: meta-data, storage, networking, directory services and 
      compute.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - On a sunny summer morning last
month, a quiet Sacramento suburb was suddenly shaken by an
explosion at the Elk Grove refinery, a small industrial plant
that produces asphalt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local firefighters rushed to battle the blaze, which was
generating a "substantial" plume of black smoke and alarming
local residents living just a few hundred feet away. A number of
them called 911 to report the incident, said Consumnes Fire
Department Deputy Chief John Michelini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None knew that the 181,000 gallons of flaming asphalt inside
the roughly 50-foot tank wasn't owned by operator Paramount
Petroleum Corp, or even its parent company Alon USA Energy
, the refining and retail firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the asphalt in the tanks likely belonged to Goldman
Sachs, one of the biggest commodity traders on Wall Street,
according to the terms of its contract with Alon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know it's called Paramount Petroleum, but other than
that it doesn't matter," said Michelini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For regulators and lawmakers, it may matter a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though quickly extinguished with no impact beyond some
damage to the tank itself, the Aug. 15 fire highlights the kind
of real-world risk that some in Washington fear may be
jeopardizing Wall Street's powerhouses following a decade of
aggressive expansion into physical commodity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, the issue has quietly smoldered in
the background. This summer, it erupted with unexpected ferocity
as lawmakers and mass media pressed the question of why
financial titans should be so deeply involved in commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is fast approaching an inflection point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a powerful Senate banking committee prepares a second
hearing to demand an explanation from the Federal Reserve in
late September, the nation's top banking overseer is soon
expected to make clear the future role it sees for banks trading
in oil tankers and pallets of copper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley, the so-called "Wall
Street refiners" who helped create the modern oil market, are
expecting to find out whether they will continue to enjoy much
wider commodity-related activities than their peers, including
the ability to own and operate assets as they like. A five-year
grace period to sell or adapt their business following their
conversion to regulated banks runs out on Sept. 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are anxious for word on the Fed's surprise July
announcement that it was "reviewing" a landmark 2003 order that
first allowed commercial banks to trade in - but not to own
assets related to - physical markets. Neither the Fed nor the
banks have provided any timing or details on that process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a fair amount of political pressure on the Fed to
carve back some of these activities," said, Charles Horn, bank
regulatory lawyer and partner at Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is all coming together" this month, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FED INVITED TO TESTIFY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since early July, Wall Street's involvement in physical
commodity trading has come under a harsh spotlight, as lawmakers
and regulators debate whether they want so-called "too big to
fail" banks involved in risky commercial industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers have focused on whether or not banks can be
trusted to behave correctly in markets like oil that have a
direct impact on the real economy, focusing on accusations that
some banks and big trading companies that own metal warehouses
have inflated aluminum prices. The banks deny those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger concern for banking regulators is the reverse:
whether real-world markets create large and unquantifiable
financial risks that banks can't manage. Incidents like the
Exxon Valdez spill, or even this summer's oil-train tragedy in
Canada, can have multibillion-dollar consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Elk Grove, Goldman's commodity trading division J Aron
stores asphalt and other oil products through a so-called
"supply and offtake" agreement with Alon USA. Through the deal
Goldman helps supply and finance purchases of crude oil for
Alon's refineries in the United States, and assists with the
marketing of everything from gasoline to asphalt at the plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what, if any, liability J Aron might bear
simply because it holds title to hold in Alon's tanks. Neither
the bank nor Alon would comment on the incident, or who held
title to the asphalt in storage on Aug. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire, which caused a seam at the top of the tank to
rupture, has been deemed accidental, caused by a mechanical
error in the heating system, Michelini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE COMMON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, as such deals between banks and refineries become more
common due to the high price of oil, the large volumes of crude
oil the banks need to ship may increase the risk of them being
involved in an accident or spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, for example, is importing more
than 260,000 bpd of crude oil this year to supply refiners in
Philadelphia and Minnesota, most of it arriving on big tankers
from Nigeria or on trains from Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, banks have struggled to maintain
once-robust profit margins in the commodity markets due to
flattening prices, moribund volatility, rising capital
requirements, proprietary trading limits and an exodus of
talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks are not waiting to see what happens with the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will sell or spin off its physical commodities
trading, the bank announced in late July just days before it
reached a $410 million settlement with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) over allegations of power market
manipulation in the Midwest and California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley has also been looking at a potential sale of
its commodity arm since last year, although those efforts appear
to have cooled as the bank awaits the Fed's verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year Goldman looked at selling its Metro
International warehouses, but now says it is keeping the unit as
a "merchant" investment operated at arm's length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRESH HEARING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate Banking Committee has invited the Federal Reserve
and other regulators to testify at a hearing on Wall Street's
role in physical commodity trading, tentatively scheduled for
Sept. 24 - just three days after the five year anniversary of
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's conversion to bank holding
companies at the peak of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also marks the end of the grace period the Fed granted
the pair to conform their businesses to the Bank Holding Company
Act, which bars banks from owning physical commodity assets like
pipelines, metals warehouses, and oil storage tanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The close nature of the two dates has led some to speculate
that the Federal Reserve may make an announcement on its review
soon, to get out in front of a grilling on the Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether it's before or during the hearing, I'm sure the Fed
will be prepared to have something to say," said a U.S. attorney
who specializes in banking regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no way I'd go into a potentially hostile hearing
like that with nothing to say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve declined to comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FED SPLIT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with the matter say that regulators,
including the Federal Reserve, are split over how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve General Counsel Scott Alvarez, a Fed veteran
who is considered a regulatory dove, is believed to favor a
narrow legal interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act that
"grandfathers" the right of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to
keep owning and operating physical commodity assets due to their
long history of operating in these markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is not a view uniformly held across the Fed, with
some senior officials expressing doubts about whether the banks
they oversee should be allowed to ship tankers of crude oil or
operate power plants, in case a major accident leaves them with
huge liabilities that threaten their financial soundness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saule Omarova, a visiting law professor at Cornell
University, testified at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in
July about risks she sees from Wall Street's involvement in
physical commodities trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's difficult to predict just how much damage a major oil
spill could do to a bank," Omarova said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But financial markets don't know how to assess the risks of
a bank being involved in an oil spill. How would their
counterparties react? Could it have an effect on the stability
of the financial system? One of the lessons of the financial
crisis is that the extent of the risks present in the system
aren't always clear until it's too late."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheapness of European banks is overstated by traditional
valuation methods once new regulatory rules are taken into

relative value within the sector, analysts at JPMorgan say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the sector looks cheap on both a price-to-earnings and
a price-to-book value, valuations are not attractive in European
banking as a whole, as these measures do not take into account
banks' leverage, they write in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe banks on a sector basis are not particularly
cheap... However, we see material risk-reward opportunities as
valuation gaps between stocks are quite material and hence there
is relative value within the banking sector."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's top picks include UBS, Deutsche Bank
, Societe Generale, UniCredit,
Caixabank, Nordea and Danske, as
JPMorgan takes the view that "the market is not yet pricing in
the improved capital structure, funding profile and 'real cash
flow' generation of some of the Eurobanks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cautious outlook for emerging markets prompts JPMorgan to
downgrade HSBC to 'neutral' from 'overweight'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Santander is upgraded to 'neutral' from
'underweight', "despite its material EM exposure due to
underperformance against peers and Eurobanks in the past three
months, some stabilization in Brazil and a more stable and
predictable Spanish domestic banking environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters messaging

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - With its plan to issue up to 1 billion Malaysian ringgit ($305 million) of Islamic bonds, Societe Generale appears to be avoiding missteps made by Goldman Sachs in an ill-fated attempt to sell sukuk two years ago - a positive sign for Western banks' efforts to move into Islamic finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SocGen (SOGN.PA) aims to issue the first tranche of its sukuk program by the end of this year in Malaysia, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be only the second big European bank to issue sukuk, and the first to do so in Asia; the Middle East unit of HSBC (HSBA.L) tapped the market in 2011 with a $500 million issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS.N) tried to follow HSBC in late 2011 with a $2 billion sukuk program, but its plan ran into controversy among Islamic scholars and analysts, who questioned whether the U.S. investment bank was obeying religious principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debacle threatened to hurt Islamic markets' acceptance of Western banks in general. SocGen's less controversial plan may now ease that worry, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it plans to issue in Malaysia's centralized regulatory environment, the French bank has a clear set of rules to follow which may help it to avoid the issues faced by Goldman, said Aznan Hasan, an Islamic scholar who worked on preparing the Goldman sukuk plan in 2011 and serves on both of Malaysia's central sharia boards which supervise the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were two issues with Goldman Sachs - the first was the use of the proceeds and the second was tradability. If Goldman had managed to follow the instructions by the sharia scholars, there would have been no issue at all," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTROVERSY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman registered its sukuk program with the Irish Stock Exchange in October 2011, setting up a special-purpose vehicle in the Cayman Islands to issue a sukuk based on murabaha, a common cost-plus-profit arrangement in Islamic finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan ran into criticism from some Islamic scholars and analysts who suggested Goldman might use the proceeds of the issue to conduct conventional banking, violating Islam's ban on interest payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also concern that the issue might not trade at par value on the Irish exchange, which would contravene sharia law's prohibition on monetary speculation, and debate over whether the underlying structure of the sukuk was murabaha or reverse tawarruq, which has been ruled unacceptable by some Islamic scholars as an effort to hide the use of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the situation was the way in which Goldman arranged for sharia scholars to vet the issue. The prospectus said eight scholars were "expected" to approve it, before all of them had actually signed off on the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman insisted its planned sukuk complied with all Islamic principles, and the instrument was eventually endorsed by 10 eminent scholars, according to the U.S. bank's sharia advisory firm. According to regulatory filings, Goldman still maintains its Cayman Islands vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a public issue of sukuk never went ahead and the prospectus on the Irish exchange is now well past its 12-month validity period - making Goldman's plan a public relations headache for the U.S. firm, and a missed opportunity for the Islamic finance industry to increase its credibility by engaging with a top global institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CENTRALISED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SocGen has declined to comment on its own plan, but initial signs are that it will manage to avoid many or all of the pitfalls which tripped up Goldman. So far, news of SocGen's issue has not prompted nearly as much debate in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaysia has developed a centralized approach to Islamic finance, with issuers required to obtain the approval of a sharia board at the central bank and products needing to be vetted by a sharia board at the securities commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the approval of those two boards is granted, other scholars will find it hard to challenge the SocGen sukuk - and even if objections are raised in the Gulf, a large pool of southeast Asian investors, comfortable with Malaysia's regulatory approach, are likely to buy the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the proposed SocGen sukuk...in our regulatory framework, it mentions clearly that any issuance of sukuk shall be used for sharia-compliant purposes. This is built into our regulation, so the issue would not arise at all," Hasan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the matter said SocGen had obtained a green light from the Malaysian central bank for the issue and was now seeking approval from the securities commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The structure is still being worked on as SocGen is after the highest possible rating for better pricing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the structures being considered by SocGen is wakala, an arrangement in which one party acts as agent for another, the source said. In a wakala sukuk, certificates are issued by an originator to buy specific assets which are given to the agent, who charges a fee for his services. The originator undertakes to buy the assets on maturity at an agreed price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HSBC sukuk of 2011 used the wakala structure, which has been favored by many scholars over murabaha because of its clearer link to the assets backing the structure. It is also tradable, making it popular for interbank transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HSBC issued sukuk before and they used this to grow their own sharia-compliant businesses. If SocGen wants to issue a sukuk in Malaysia, they have to comply with that ruling as well," said Hasan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they use a structure that is tradable in nature, for example a sukuk ijara, wakala or musharaka, there shall be no issue with tradability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from SocGen's sukuk would be used to buy sharia-compliant assets in Dubai, where the bank's private banking operations for the Middle East are based, said the source. Sukuk issued under the program could carry tenors ranging from five to ten years, said a second source with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story corrects quote to read "proceeds" instead of "profit" in seventh paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andrew Torchia)&lt;/p&gt;

issue up to 1 billion Malaysian ringgit ($305 million) of
Islamic bonds, Societe Generale appears to be avoiding missteps
made by Goldman Sachs in an ill-fated attempt to sell sukuk two
years ago - a positive sign for Western banks' efforts to move
into Islamic finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SocGen aims to issue the first tranche of its

of Western banks in general. SocGen's less controversial plan
may now ease that worry, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it plans to issue in Malaysia's centralised
regulatory environment, the French bank has a clear set of rules
to follow which may help it to avoid the issues faced by
Goldman, said Aznan Hasan, an Islamic scholar who worked on

Malaysia's central sharia boards which supervise the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were two issues with Goldman Sachs - the first was

Exchange in October 2011, setting up a special-purpose vehicle
in the Cayman Islands to issue a sukuk based on murabaha, a
common cost-plus-profit arrangement in Islamic finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan ran into criticism from some Islamic scholars and
analysts who suggested Goldman might use the proceeds of the
issue to conduct conventional banking, violating Islam's ban on
interest payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also concern that the issue might not trade at par
value on the Irish exchange, which would contravene sharia law's
prohibition on monetary speculation, and debate over whether the
underlying structure of the sukuk was murabaha or reverse
tawarruq, which has been ruled unacceptable by some Islamic
scholars as an effort to hide the use of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the situation was the way in which Goldman

prospectus on the Irish exchange is now well past its 12-month
validity period - making Goldman's plan a public relations
headache for the U.S. firm, and a missed opportunity for the
Islamic finance industry to increase its credibility by engaging
with a top global institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CENTRALISED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SocGen has declined to comment on its own plan, but initial
signs are that it will manage to avoid many or all of the
pitfalls which tripped up Goldman. So far, news of SocGen's
issue has not prompted nearly as much debate in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaysia has developed a centralised approach to Islamic
finance, with issuers required to obtain the approval of a
sharia board at the central bank and products needing to be
vetted by a sharia board at the securities commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the approval of those two boards is granted, other
scholars will find it hard to challenge the SocGen sukuk - and
even if objections are raised in the Gulf, a large pool of

ranging from five to ten years, said a second source with

			Kettenbach Visalys Temp Provisional Restorative Receives 
      5-Plus-Rating From THE DENTAL ADVISOR
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Excellent properties &#8211; Visalys&#174; Temp was 
      designated as an Editors&#8217; Choice product by THE DENTAL ADVISOR. 
      Visalys&#174; Temp provisional restorative material 
      made by Kettenbach, was awarded 5 pluses. The benefits of the product 
      made from a new monomer free of BPA includes excellent esthetics, easy 
      high final hardness, short setting time, easy trim, finishing, polishing 
      and resistance to fracture.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			THE DENTAL ADVISOR, a leading research publication, has been 
      publishing since 1984. It had broadened its mission from simply 
      providing objective information to the marketplace, to improving the 
      level of products and care available to the patient. THE DENTAL ADVISIOR 
      has provided the dental profession with evidence-based and clinically 
      relevant&#160;information&#160;on dental restorative products, infection control 
      products and dental equipment. The Editors' Choice award signifies a 
      unique, significant product. The editors review each product and 
      clinical evaluation article and then select the award.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kettenbach recently received the Editors&#8217; Choice award for Visalys&#174; 
      Temp, a two-component BPA free resin based on a multifunctional acrylic 
      composite. It can be used to make highly aesthetic temporary crowns, 
      partial crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays, and veneers including long-term 
      provisionals. Dentists can make provisional restorations with Visalys&#174; 
      Temp that are remarkably stable and fracture resistant due to its 
      unique, new monomer structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tests demonstrate a particularly strong, aesthetic and comfortable 
      result
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Scientific studies at the University of Erlangen, as well as extensive 
      clinical practice tests, prove that Visalys&#174; Temp has 
      excellent mechanical properties in comparison with leading competitor 
      products. The stability and fracture resistance of a crown and bridge 
      material are defined by six main parameters: bending strength, impact 
      strength, diametral tensile strength, elastic modulus, fatigue factor, 
      Barcol hardness. In an independent in vivo market study, dentists 
      rated provisional restorations made of Visalys&#174; Temp as being 
      clearly more break-resistant than other manufacturers&#8217; temporaries; 90 
      percent of those surveyed said they would switch to Visalys&#174; 
      Temp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, the material is easy-to-use and guarantees superior 
      aesthetic results in addition to stability. The smooth surface ensures a 
      pleasant feeling in the mouth and impedes plaque formation. Visalys&#174; 
      Temp can be precisely milled and minimizes dust formation. Its natural 
      fluorescence and translucency are optimal for restorations of front 
      teeth. Visalys&#174; Temp also contains no bisphenol A, a 
      substance suspected of impairing health.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - On a sunny summer morning last month, a quiet Sacramento suburb was suddenly shaken by an explosion at the Elk Grove refinery, a small industrial plant that produces asphalt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local firefighters rushed to battle the blaze, which was generating a "substantial" plume of black smoke and alarming local residents living just a few hundred feet away. A number of them called 911 to report the incident, said Consumnes Fire Department Deputy Chief John Michelini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None knew that the 181,000 gallons of flaming asphalt inside the roughly 50-foot tank wasn't owned by operator Paramount Petroleum Corp, or even its parent company Alon USA Energy, the refining and retail firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the asphalt in the tanks likely belonged to Goldman Sachs, one of the biggest commodity traders on Wall Street, according to the terms of its contract with Alon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know it's called Paramount Petroleum, but other than that it doesn't matter," said Michelini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For regulators and lawmakers, it may matter a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though quickly extinguished with no impact beyond some damage to the tank itself, the August 15 fire highlights the kind of real-world risk that some in Washington fear may be jeopardizing Wall Street's powerhouses following a decade of aggressive expansion into physical commodity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, the issue has quietly smoldered in the background. This summer, it erupted with unexpected ferocity as lawmakers and mass media pressed the question of why financial titans should be so deeply involved in commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is fast approaching an inflection point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a powerful Senate banking committee prepares a second hearing to demand an explanation from the Federal Reserve in late September, the nation's top banking overseer is soon expected to make clear the future role it sees for banks trading in oil tankers and pallets of copper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley, the so-called "Wall Street refiners" who helped create the modern oil market, are expecting to find out whether they will continue to enjoy much wider commodity-related activities than their peers, including the ability to own and operate assets as they like. A five-year grace period to sell or adapt their business following their conversion to regulated banks runs out on September 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are anxious for word on the Fed's surprise July announcement that it was "reviewing" a landmark 2003 order that first allowed commercial banks to trade in - but not to own assets related to - physical markets. Neither the Fed nor the banks have provided any timing or details on that process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a fair amount of political pressure on the Fed to carve back some of these activities," said, Charles Horn, bank regulatory lawyer and partner at Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is all coming together" this month, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FED INVITED TO TESTIFY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since early July, Wall Street's involvement in physical commodity trading has come under a harsh spotlight, as lawmakers and regulators debate whether they want so-called "too big to fail" banks involved in risky commercial industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers have focused on whether or not banks can be trusted to behave correctly in markets like oil that have a direct impact on the real economy, focusing on accusations that some banks and big trading companies that own metal warehouses have inflated aluminum prices. The banks deny those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger concern for banking regulators is the reverse: whether real-world markets create large and unquantifiable financial risks that banks can't manage. Incidents like the Exxon Valdez spill, or even this summer's oil-train tragedy in Canada, can have multibillion-dollar consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Elk Grove, Goldman's commodity trading division J Aron stores asphalt and other oil products through a so-called "supply and offtake" agreement with Alon USA. Through the deal Goldman helps supply and finance purchases of crude oil for Alon's refineries in the United States, and assists with the marketing of everything from gasoline to asphalt at the plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what, if any, liability J Aron might bear simply because it holds title to hold in Alon's tanks. Neither the bank nor Alon would comment on the incident, or who held title to the asphalt in storage on August 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire, which caused a seam at the top of the tank to rupture, has been deemed accidental, caused by a mechanical error in the heating system, Michelini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE COMMON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, as such deals between banks and refineries become more common due to the high price of oil, the large volumes of crude oil the banks need to ship may increase the risk of them being involved in an accident or spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, for example, is importing more than 260,000 bpd of crude oil this year to supply refiners in Philadelphia and Minnesota, most of it arriving on big tankers from Nigeria or on trains from Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, banks have struggled to maintain once-robust profit margins in the commodity markets due to flattening prices, moribund volatility, rising capital requirements, proprietary trading limits and an exodus of talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks are not waiting to see what happens with the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will sell or spin off its physical commodities trading, the bank announced in late July just days before it reached a $410 million settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) over allegations of power market manipulation in the Midwest and California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley has also been looking at a potential sale of its commodity arm since last year, although those efforts appear to have cooled as the bank awaits the Fed's verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year Goldman looked at selling its Metro International warehouses, but now says it is keeping the unit as a "merchant" investment operated at arm's length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRESH HEARING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate Banking Committee has invited the Federal Reserve and other regulators to testify at a hearing on Wall Street's role in physical commodity trading, tentatively scheduled for September 24 - just three days after the five year anniversary of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's conversion to bank holding companies at the peak of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also marks the end of the grace period the Fed granted the pair to conform their businesses to the Bank Holding Company Act, which bars banks from owning physical commodity assets like pipelines, metals warehouses, and oil storage tanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The close nature of the two dates has led some to speculate that the Federal Reserve may make an announcement on its review soon, to get out in front of a grilling on the Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether it's before or during the hearing, I'm sure the Fed will be prepared to have something to say," said a U.S. attorney who specializes in banking regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no way I'd go into a potentially hostile hearing like that with nothing to say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve declined to comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FED SPLIT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with the matter say that regulators, including the Federal Reserve, are split over how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve General Counsel Scott Alvarez, a Fed veteran who is considered a regulatory dove, is believed to favor a narrow legal interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act that "grandfathers" the right of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to keep owning and operating physical commodity assets due to their long history of operating in these markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is not a view uniformly held across the Fed, with some senior officials expressing doubts about whether the banks they oversee should be allowed to ship tankers of crude oil or operate power plants, in case a major accident leaves them with huge liabilities that threaten their financial soundness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saule Omarova, a visiting law professor at Cornell University, testified at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in July about risks she sees from Wall Street's involvement in physical commodities trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's difficult to predict just how much damage a major oil spill could do to a bank," Omarova said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But financial markets don't know how to assess the risks of a bank being involved in an oil spill. How would their counterparties react? Could it have an effect on the stability of the financial system? One of the lessons of the financial crisis is that the extent of the risks present in the system aren't always clear until it's too late."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Josephine Mason and Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Jim Marshall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - On a sunny summer morning last
month, a quiet Sacramento suburb was suddenly shaken by an
explosion at the Elk Grove refinery, a small industrial plant

commodity trading has come under a harsh spotlight, as lawmakers
and regulators debate whether they want so-called "too big to

common due to the high price of oil, the large volumes of crude
oil the banks need to ship may increase the risk of them being
involved in an accident or spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, for example, is importing more
than 260,000 bpd of crude oil this year to supply refiners in
Philadelphia and Minnesota, most of it arriving on big tankers

trading, the bank announced in late July just days before it
reached a $410 million settlement with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) over allegations of power market
manipulation in the Midwest and California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley has also been looking at a potential sale of
its commodity arm since last year, although those efforts appear
to have cooled as the bank awaits the Fed's verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year Goldman looked at selling its Metro
International warehouses, but now says it is keeping the unit as
a "merchant" investment operated at arm's length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRESH HEARING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate Banking Committee has invited the Federal Reserve
and other regulators to testify at a hearing on Wall Street's
role in physical commodity trading, tentatively scheduled for
Sept. 24 - just three days after the five year anniversary of
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's conversion to bank holding
companies at the peak of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also marks the end of the grace period the Fed granted
the pair to conform their businesses to the Bank Holding Company
Act, which bars banks from owning physical commodity assets like
pipelines, metals warehouses, and oil storage tanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The close nature of the two dates has led some to speculate
that the Federal Reserve may make an announcement on its review
soon, to get out in front of a grilling on the Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether it's before or during the hearing, I'm sure the Fed
will be prepared to have something to say," said a U.S. attorney
who specializes in banking regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no way I'd go into a potentially hostile hearing
like that with nothing to say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve declined to comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FED SPLIT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with the matter say that regulators,
including the Federal Reserve, are split over how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve General Counsel Scott Alvarez, a Fed veteran
who is considered a regulatory dove, is believed to favor a
narrow legal interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act that
"grandfathers" the right of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to
keep owning and operating physical commodity assets due to their
long history of operating in these markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is not a view uniformly held across the Fed, with
some senior officials expressing doubts about whether the banks

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) plans to spend an additional $4 billion and commit 5,000 extra employees to fix risk and compliance issues after a slew of investigations by regulatory authorities, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will spend $1.5 billion on managing risk and complying with regulations and plans to add $2.5 billion to its litigation reserves in the second half of the year, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will also increase its risk-control staff by 30 percent, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said on Monday that it would add more than $1.5 billion to its legal reserves in the third quarter and 3,000 people had been added to control functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 2,000 assigned to the bank's various business lines are also working on compliance issues, a person familiar with the matter who would not provide the total cost told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in April in his annual letter to shareholders that the bank's first priority had become fixing its control and compliance issues. He warned then that the company was forgoing some business investment projects to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the company called the effort "unprecedented" and said it now involves 23 different work streams, including remedial work on the capital plan it had submitted to the Federal Reserve earlier this year and actions the government ordered in January to fix its controls, abide the Bank Secrecy Act and fight money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Journal quoted Dimon as saying in an interview that the work "will make us stronger in the long run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been under intense scrutiny from regulators since May 2012 when Dimon announced that the company was losing billions of dollars in a corporate office in London on derivatives trades that were far worse than he knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon initially called news reports of possible losses by a trader known as the "London Whale" a "tempest in a teapot". The positions ultimately cost more than $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the derivatives debacle, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies have developed investigations into subjects including energy trading, possibly bribery in hiring practices in China, possibly fraudulent sales of mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multiple probes are driving the higher costs for litigation, the company said on Monday. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said then that the legal tab was still being calculated and promised to provide more details when the company next reports quarterly results on October 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company spent about $5 billion, pre-tax, on litigation in each of the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year JPMorgan's legal costs are likely to reach similar levels, analyst Charles Peabody of Portales Partners has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported $21.3 billion in net income for 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra and David Henry in New York; Editing by Jean Yoon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is laying off dozens of contract and freelance writers from its MSN news and entertainment portal as the giant software company seeks to reshape itself as a devices and services company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the company confirmed the layoffs but declined to specify the number or comment further. A person familiar with the situation said the cuts could affect more than 100 people in all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pruning of MSN writers, who contribute end edit columns, blogs and features to the site, comes just two months after Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced a radical reorganization of the company, which is only now starting to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's online services unit, chiefly consisting of the Bing search engine and MSN portal, is in line for a shake-up as it has never been profitable and has lost almost $3 billion in the last two years alone. Some investors have pressed for a sale of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSN was merged with Bing Apps, which also produces news, weather and other content, in the July reorganization under new head Brian MacDonald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While MSN is cutting its contractor budget, it is also planning to increase spending on full-time employees, MacDonald told the Seattle Times and later confirmed to Reuters, without giving any further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSN site has been stagnating for the past year, with its U.S. monthly unique visitors stuck at about 116 million, while the more popular Yahoo Inc and AOL Inc portals are growing faster, according to figures from industry research firm Comscore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft beefed up its MSN news operation only a year ago in preparation for the launch of Windows 8. The company wanted to grow its ability to generate online content after last summer's sale of its 50 percent stake in news website MSNBC.com to longtime partner NBCUniversal, now majority-owned by Comcast Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift away from using freelance writers means MSN will likely rely more on external sources such as NBC, Associated Press and Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is
laying off dozens of contract and freelance writers from its MSN
news and entertainment portal as the giant software company
seeks to reshape itself as a devices and services company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the company confirmed the layoffs but
declined to specify the number or comment further. A person
familiar with the situation said the cuts could affect more than
100 people in all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pruning of MSN writers, who contribute end edit columns,
blogs and features to the site, comes just two months after
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced a radical reorganization
of the company, which is only now starting to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's online services unit, chiefly consisting of the
Bing search engine and MSN portal, is in line for a shake-up as
it has never been profitable and has lost almost $3 billion in
the last two years alone. Some investors have pressed for a sale
of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSN was merged with Bing Apps, which also produces news,
weather and other content, in the July reorganization under new
head Brian MacDonald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While MSN is cutting its contractor budget, it is also
planning to increase spending on full-time employees, MacDonald
told the Seattle Times and later confirmed to Reuters, without
giving any further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSN site has been stagnating for the past year, with its
U.S. monthly unique visitors stuck at about 116 million, while
the more popular Yahoo Inc and AOL Inc portals
are growing faster, according to figures from industry research
firm Comscore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft beefed up its MSN news operation only a year ago
in preparation for the launch of Windows 8. The company wanted
to grow its ability to generate online content after last
summer's sale of its 50 percent stake in news website MSNBC.com
to longtime partner NBCUniversal, now majority-owned by Comcast
Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift away from using freelance writers means MSN will
likely rely more on external sources such as NBC, Associated
Press and Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

      Broadlook Technologies announces release of the next generation of 
      Broadlook&#8217;s CRM Data Quality Suite for Microsoft Dynamics
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Product suite features a powerful set of tools to improve contact data 
      quality and sales productivity for users of Microsoft Dynamics CRM, 
      addressing the question &#8220;How do I ensure I have relevant and fresh 
      contact data whenever I need it?&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Broadlook Technologies, Inc., today announced the immediate availability 
      of the next generation of their&#160;CRM 
      Data Quality Suite for&#160;the Microsoft Dynamics CRM platform. This 
      cloud-based solution, allowing users to mine the Internet for contact 
      information, has been integrated seamlessly into the Dynamics ecosystem 
      to help users achieve peak sales and positive customer experience by 
      ensuring quality contact and list integrity throughout all stages of the 
      sales, marketing and customer support cycle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Data quality is a key success factor for CRM implementations and can 
      directly impact campaign effectiveness, especially in the business to 
      business (B2B) market where keeping up with rapid market, business and 
      organizational change is important to maintaining contact and list 
      integrity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The correlation between data quality in CRM systems and peak sales and 
      marketing performance is well documented. Noted research firm SiriusDecisions 
      has indicated salespeople can spend as much as 29% of their time 
      searching the Internet for contact information rather than directly 
      engaged in selling activities 1, while &#8220;a strong organization 
      can realize nearly 70 percent more revenue than an average organization 
      purely based on data quality.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Broadlook data apps are a critical part of our lead generation and 
      marketing strategy,&#8221; commented John Gravely, CEO of ClickDimensions, 
      the leading choice for marketing automation in the Dynamics CRM 
      community, and a Microsoft Dynamics CRM Solution of the Year winner. &#8220;The 
      ClickDimensions sales team and sales processes are built around our use 
      of Broadlook&#8217;s best of breed contact data intelligence and data quality 
      applications.
			Broadlook has been a key to our rapid growth.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CRM data quality is impacted by natural data decay, ongoing manual data 
      entry and updates, frequent list uploads and lack of data standards. 
      Broadlook&#8217;s comprehensive CRM Data Quality Suite addresses these issues 
      head-on, operates natively within the Dynamics environment and is 
      powerful, affordable and easy to use:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Contact Capture for Dynamics streamlines the importing of 
        individual and group contacts, allowing users to copy, paste and parse 
        contact information from any digital source, eliminating the need for 
        manual typed entries into the system;
      
			
				Shield for Dynamics allows users to create and enforce 
        enterprise-wide normalization standards through a web-based interface, 
        assuring compliance with internal normalization, CRM, Business Rules 
        and Data Governance policies;
      
			
				Multi-Merge for Dynamics offers a new interface for 
        intelligently selecting master record data and merging multiple 
        records in duplicate groups, providing a solution that is far more 
        versatile than the native Dynamics feature;
      
			
				Profiler for Dynamics enables automatic maintenance, enrichment 
        and discovery of contact level data. Using the Internet as a 
        data-mining resource and Dynamics workflow engines to automatically 
        keep contact list data relevant and fresh, Broadlook&#8217;s flagship 
        application presents contact information directly within Dynamics CRM 
        through the Profiler Grid.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With this release of our CRM Data Quality Suite for Microsoft 
      Dynamics, and its ease of installation, with just a few clicks any 
      enterprise using Dynamics CRM&#160;can have the world&#8217;s most powerful contact 
      data technology at their fingertips, seamlessly integrated in Dynamics&#8221; 
      said Donato Diorio, CEO of Broadlook. &#8220;Industry analysts and members 
      of the VC community have anticipated data science and management tools 
      would go mainstream and become business-ready in the coming years. With 
      the release of our CRM Data Quality Suite, we&#8217;ve shown that time is now.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Broadlook&#8217;s CRM Data Quality Suite is designed for users asking the 
      question &#8220;How do I ensure I have relevant and fresh contact data 
      whenever I need it?&#8221; and can be directly installed by end-user sales and 
      marketing organizations or through Microsoft Dynamic partners who are 
      providing their customers complete solutions.

			Rigrodsky 
       Long, P.A. , including former Special Assistant United States

      Management Corp. (&#8220;Walter Investment&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NYSE: WAC) 
      of an upcoming deadline involving a securities fraud class action 
      lawsuit commenced against the Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle 
      District of Florida on behalf of all persons or entities that purchased 
      the common stock of Walter Investment between May 9, 2012 and June 6, 
      2013, inclusive (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;), alleging violations of the 
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against the Company and certain of its 
      officers (the &#8220;Complaint&#8221;). If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you 
      must move the Court no later than September 23, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you purchased shares of Walter Investment during the Class Period, or 
      purchased shares prior to the Class Period and still hold Walter 
      Investment, and wish to discuss this action or have any questions 
      concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact Timothy

      A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other 
      class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead 
      plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member&#8217;s claim is 
      typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member 
      will adequately represent the class. Your ability to share in any 
      recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to 
      serve as a lead plaintiff. Any member of the proposed class may move the 
      court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may 
      choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

      While Rigrodsky 
       Long, P.A. did not file the Complaint in this matter, the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept. 12, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz Grossman Hufford Dahlstrom  Gross LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft" or the "Company") (Nasdaq:MSFT) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, and docketed under 13-cv-12266, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of Microsoft between April 18, 2013 and July 18, 2013 both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). This class action seeks to recover damages against the Company and certain of its officers and directors as a result of alleged violations of the federal securities laws pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you are a shareholder who purchased Microsoft securities during the Class Period, you have until October 11, 2013 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, x237. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and number of shares purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Microsoft is the world's largest software company, primarily as a result of its near-monopoly Windows personal computer ("PC") operating system software and its Microsoft Office collection of productivity programs. In addition, the Company produces a wide range of software for desktop computers and servers and is active in Internet search with its Bing search engine; the video game market with its Xbox and Xbox 360 products; the digital services market with its Microsoft Network, or MSN; and in mobile phones via its Windows Phone operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business and operations. Specifically, Defendants: (a) employed devices, schemes, and artifices to defraud; (b) made untrue statements of material fact and/or omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading; and (c) engaged in acts, practices, and a course of business which operated as a fraud and deceit upon the purchasers of the Company's common stock during the Class Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On July 18, 2013, Microsoft issued a press release announcing that its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 had been adversely impacted by a $900 million charge related to a write-down in the value of its Surface RT inventory. In truth, however, the value of such inventory was materially impaired by March 31, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On this news, Microsoft shares fell $4.04 approximately 11.4% to close at $31.40 per share on July 18, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and San Diego, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 70 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Robert S. Willoughby

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Media giant Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) will increase its share buybacks to $6 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2014, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo told investors on Thursday, sending shares up 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Disney has been buying back about $4 billion in shares annually, Rasulo said at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference. He said Disney can boost the buybacks while maintaining its credit rating. The company may borrow some cash "to provide capital at the tail end of that plan," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's fiscal year begins in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares jumped 3.3 percent to $66.06 on the New York Stock Exchange after Rasulo's remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasulo also said Disney will limit its spending on big films that are not part of established franchises. Rasulo previously projected Disney will lose up to $190 million in its expensive summer movie bomb "The Lone Ranger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have learned there needs to be a cap on tentpole non-franchise movies," he said. "Going forward you will see a cap on spending on those movies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Chizu Nomiyama)&lt;/p&gt;

 will increase its share buybacks to $6 billion to $8
billion in fiscal 2014, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo told
investors on Thursday, sending shares up 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Disney has been buying back about $4 billion
in shares annually, Rasulo said at a Bank of America Merrill
Lynch conference. He said Disney can boost the buybacks while
maintaining its credit rating. The company may borrow some cash
"to provide capital at the tail end of that plan," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's fiscal year begins in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares jumped 3.3 percent to $66.06 on the New York
Stock Exchange after Rasulo's remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasulo also said Disney will limit its spending on big films
that are not part of established franchises. Rasulo previously
projected Disney will lose up to $190 million in its expensive
summer movie bomb "The Lone Ranger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have learned there needs to be a cap on tentpole
non-franchise movies," he said. "Going forward you will see a
cap on spending on those movies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is
laying off dozens of contract and freelance writers from its MSN
news and entertainment portal as the giant software company
seeks to reshape itself as a devices and services company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the company confirmed the layoffs but
declined to specify the number or comment further. A person
familiar with the situation said the cuts could affect more than
100 people in all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pruning of MSN writers, who contribute end edit columns,
blogs and features to the site, comes just two months after
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced a radical reorganization
of the company, which is only now starting to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's online services unit, chiefly consisting of the
Bing search engine and MSN portal, is in line for a shake-up as
it has never been profitable and has lost almost $3 billion in
the last two years alone. Some investors have pressed for a sale
of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSN site has been stagnating for the past year, with its
U.S. monthly unique visitors stuck at about 116 million, while
the more popular Yahoo Inc and AOL Inc portals
are growing faster, according to figures from industry research
firm Comscore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft beefed up its MSN news operation only a year ago
in preparation for the launch of Windows 8. The company wanted
to grow its ability to generate online content after last
summer's sale of its 50 percent stake in news website MSNBC.com
to longtime partner NBCUniversal, now majority-owned by Comcast
Corp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 12 (IFR) -    JP Morgan is working on a
securitisation of part of its portfolio of equity release
mortgages, according to two people familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bought a portfolio of these mortgages, which are loans to
allow people, usually in retirement, to unlock the value of
their properties, from Northern Rock in January 2008 for
GBP2.2bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mortgages were transferred to a JP Morgan subsidiary
called Papilio UK Equity Release Mortgages Ltd in April, which
is registered to the address of Structured Finance Management in
35 Great St Helen's Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wrote to customers in May, telling them that it would not
be extending further lending against their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An RMBS trader said that he would feel extremely nervous
about taking equity release paper without taking advice from
life insurance actuaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This paper does not pay down like a normal RMBS. The
drivers of prepayment are death, not interest rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity Release Mortgages are a rare asset class in the UK.
The only regular shelf was Norwich Union/Aviva's Equity Release
Funding, which last issued in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			EDF Renewable Energy Signs Turbine Supply Agreement with General 
      Electric
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EDF Renewable Energy today announced it has executed a Turbine 
      Supply Agreement (TSA) with General Electric (GE) for up to 200 
      megawatts of wind turbine generators. The agreement covers the supply of 
      GE 1.85 MW models for U.S. wind projects beginning construction in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first turbines under the TSA will be deployed at the Hereford Wind 
      Project in the Texas Panhandle. EDF Renewable Energy and Lincoln 
      Renewable Energy (LRE), a developer of wind and solar projects, have 
      executed a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, under which EDF 
      Renewable Energy will acquire from LRE the first phase (200 MW) of the 
      Hereford project as well as an option agreement for a total of up to 500 
      MW. Additionally, the company has successfully secured a long-term hedge 
      on the first phase of this project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The execution of the turbine supply agreement, along with the closing 
      of a long-term hedge, are important elements of our near-term U.S. wind 
      business plan,&#8221; commented Ryan Pfaff, Executive Vice President of EDF 
      Renewable Energy. &#8220;The deal can largely be credited to our long-term 
      relationships with both GE and our hedge provider, and the confidence 
      amongst the parties that each will deliver on its respective 
      commitments.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EDF Renewable Energy&#8217;s U.S. portfolio spans 16 states with 4,000 MW of 
      developed projects and an installed capacity of 1,962 MW.

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4294 and 4324 Trusts
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4294- 'AAA/F1', Stable Outlook; DRIVERs, Series 4294 
      -'AAA', Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4324- 'AA+/F1', Stable Outlook; DRIVERs, Series 4324 
      -'AA+', Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AAA', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4294 
      PUTTERs and DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to 
      State of Maryland General Obligation Bonds, State and Local Facilities 
      Loan of 2013, First Series B Tax-Exempt Refunding Bonds (rated 'AAA', 
      Stable Outlook) that have been deposited in the series 4294 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA+', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4324 
      PUTTERs and DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to 
      Alaska Housing Finance Corporation General Housing Purpose Bonds, 2005 
      Series B-2 (rated 'AA+', Stable Outlook) that have been deposited in the 
      series 4324 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs is based on the 
      liquidity facilities provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 'A+/F1', 
      Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4294 PUTTERs 
      will expire on April 10, 2014 and the 'F1' rating assigned to the 4324 
      PUTTERs will expire on June 5, 2014, the expiration dates of the 
      liquidity facilities, unless such dates are extended or earlier 
      terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

      The credit default swap (CDS) market seems to be reacting favorably to 
      Microsoft's plans to acquire Nokia Oyj, according to the latest case 
      study from Fitch Solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the $7.2 billion acquisition on announcement on Sept.3, CDS 
      spreads on Nokia have tightened 59%, while Microsoft remains largely 
      illiquid. Additionally, the cost of credit protection on Nokia's debt is 
      now at 'BB+' levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      That said, CDS liquidity for Nokia remains high. Trading in the third 
      global percentile, 'Nokia is trading with more CDS liquidity than 97 
      percent of Fitch's CDS pricing universe, signaling still-high market 
      uncertainty over future pricing,' said Director Diana Allmendinger.

&lt;p&gt;ZURICH, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' offices in
Zurich were inspected by a labour watchdog following a complaint
by an employee group that it kept inadequate records of working
hours and overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Switzerland's finance industry, which generates 6 percent
of the Alpine nation's gross domestic product, the financial
crisis has piled additional pressure on employees in a
traditionally fast-paced industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zurich's labour inspectorate said on Thursday it had carried
out an on-site check on Wednesday at Goldman Sachs' Zurich
offices, where nearly all of the U.S. investment bank's staff of
about 100 in Switzerland are based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bank employee lobby group, the Schweizerischer
Bankpersonalverband, informed the labour authority of what the
group said was possible abuse of trust-based working hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust-based work refers to employees, typically of a higher
rank and pay grade, for whom the firm is not required to keep
strict timekeeping of work hours under labour law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lobby group, which represents about 10-15 percent of
Swiss bank employees, mainly lower-paid staff, said it has
reason to believe Goldman Sachs had not properly documented work
hours and overtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important to us that banks comply with rules
governing working hours in Switzerland," Denise Chervet, the
head of the organisation, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The labour watchdog did not elaborate on details of the
inspection, citing privacy laws. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint falls in a grey area for Swiss labour law
after a pilot project devoted to regulating trust-based working
hours in banking ended with no conclusive guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, labour law has focused on sectors such as
construction, cleaning and temporary work, where allegations of
violations are more commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanctions for firms which repeatedly violate labour law and
refuse to negotiate with labour representatives include fines
and blacklisting for public tenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent suicides of two top executives in Switzerland has
led to calls from experts for scrutiny of how heavy workloads,
full schedules and extensive overseas travel can exact an
extreme personal toll on those involved.&lt;/p&gt;

			TechSoup Global Launches Service to Scale Donations of Microsoft 
      Office 365 for Nonprofits
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Collaboration with Microsoft aims to help nonprofits, charities, 
      and NGOs in up to 90 countries create more mission-driven impact
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechSoup Global announced today that, in partnership with Microsoft, it 
      has launched a new service on its platform to quickly and reliably 
      verify if an organization is a registered non-governmental organization 
      (NGO) and qualified to receive donations of Microsoft Office 365 for 
      Nonprofits. This service enables Microsoft to scale its donation of 
      Office 365 for Nonprofits, available in 41 countries immediately and in 
      up to 90 countries by July 2014.&#160;TechSoup Global&#8217;s worldwide network of 
      partner NGOs ensures that these validation services are scalable, 
      reliable, and consistent, while being appropriately tailored to the 
      local context.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Office 365 for Nonprofits breaks down geographic boundaries and enables 
      NGOs worldwide to work how they need to, allowing them to focus on what 
      matters &#8212; helping more people and effecting more change. To obtain 
      web-based Office 365 donations, NGOs can request them directly from 
      Microsoft at www.microsoft.com/office365nonprofits. 
      Qualified organizations gain access to Office applications and documents 
      from virtually anywhere, backed by industry-leading security features 
      and a 99.9 percent financially backed
			uptime guarantee.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rebecca Masisak, CEO of TechSoup Global, commented: &#8220;Many corporations, 
      foundations, and individuals would like to more easily engage the 
      world&#8217;s estimated 10 million nonprofits, charities, and NGOs. But 
      reaching valid organizations can be time-consuming and expensive. 
      Microsoft and TechSoup Global partnered more than a decade ago to create 
      an innovative giving platform for software that has now become a global 
      ecosystem for easy sharing of resources at scale, including donations of 
      products and services, educational content, money, and volunteer time as 
      well as technology.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ms. Masisak continued, &#8220;We are excited about this new service as we 
      expect to it to significantly expand the resource flow to NGOs working 
      in local communities around the world. We see NGOs as contributors to 
      this ecosystem as well, bringing their own communities of experts to a 
      global dialogue on the world&#8217;s most pressing social problems and the 
      resources that can make a difference.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lori Harnick, general manager of Citizenship and Public Affairs at 
      Microsoft, commented: &#8220;Office 365 for Nonprofits is a new, critical 
      investment Microsoft is making into the global nonprofit community. Our 
      collaboration with TechSoup Global allows us to rapidly scale and extend 
      the benefits of our Office 365 for Nonprofits donation program across 
      the globe, helping nonprofits streamline their IT so they can focus on 
      doing more good.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the past 25 years &#8212; through working with NGOs, corporate donors, 
      and engaged individuals &#8212; TechSoup Global has built a set of unique 
      capabilities that it now offers back to the sector&#8217;s stakeholders at 
      scale. They include a global social-sector dataset of 540,000 qualified 
      organizations and two decades of experience in building scalable and 
      replicable validation processes that adhere to strict security and 
      quality standards and that have facilitated more than US$3.8 billion of 
      technology product philanthropy.

      Research and Markets: Microsoft's Nokia Acquisition and Its Impacts on 
      Smart Handheld Devices
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/rw5f8v/microsofts_nokia) 
      has announced the addition of the "Microsoft's 
      Nokia Acquisition and Its Impacts on Smart Handheld Devices" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On September 2013, Microsoft announced that it would purchase Nokia's 
      mobile phone business for US$ 7.2 billion. This acquisition of hardware 
      manufacturer by an operating system developer is similar to Google's 
      approach to buying Motorola Mobility in 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nokia has cooperated closely with Microsoft for years and through the 
      deal, Microsoft aims to pump more resources into its Windows Phone 
      platform. This report pinpoints whether the deal can help Microsoft and 
      Nokia compete against two major mobile platforms, Android OS and iOS, 
      and examines the influence of the deal on the future smart handheld 
      device industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key Findings:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      1. Microsoft will immediately gain capabilities in mobile phone hardware 
      design and manufacturing, as well as WCDMA (Wideband Code Division 
      Multiple Access) and LTE patents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      2. Microsoft aims to increase its control over hardware, thereby 
      enhancing the degree of software and hardware integration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      3. After acquiring Nokia, Microsoft would adopt Apple's closed model.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      4. Wearable smart devices might put Microsoft and Nokia in an advantage 
      with the synergy created by combining their respective software and 
      hardware ecosystems through the deal.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil
 will export the first ever crude cargo from the giant
Kashagan field in Kazakhstan at the end of October, traders said
and a loading plan showed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loading plan for the Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
shipping oil from Kazakhstan to Russia's Black Sea, showed Exxon
exporting the cargo on Oct 30-31 with 93,500 tonnes of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kashagan, the world's most expensive oil field, began
pumping on Wednesday, a decade behind the initial schedule and
after an estimated $50 billion in spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from Exxon, the consortium includes Royal Dutch Shell
, Total and ENI as well as Kazakh,
Chinese and Japanese firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Disney's IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) assigned 
      to The Walt Disney Company (Disney) and its subsidiaries. The Rating 
      Outlook remains Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of 
      this release. Approximately $15 billion of debt outstanding as of June 
      30, 2013 is affected by Fitch's action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch believes Disney has the financial flexibility and capacity at 
      the current rating level to accommodate the company's decision to 
      increase the level of share repurchases in a manner neutral to its 
      credit profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation that the company's share 
      repurchase and MA activity will likely exceed free cash flow (FCF) 
      generation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Disney is uniquely positioned to capitalize and monetize franchises 
      and brands across the company's various business segments and platforms, 
      providing Disney with a sustainable competitive advantage relative to 
      its peers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Disney is well positioned to address the secular threats and 
      opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms 
      and continued audience fragmentation across the media and entertainment 
      landscape.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings reflect the company's leading market positions within its 
      core businesses. Further, Disney has a very consistent investment 
      strategy that is centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property 
      and content that is leverageable across Disney's various platforms 
      (cable and broadcast network, studio, parks and resorts, and consumer 
      products). Disney is uniquely positioned, relative to its peers to 
      capitalize and monetize its internally or externally developed 
      franchises and brands, which in turn strengthens Disney's operating and 
      credit profile and provides the company with a sustainable competitive 
      advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney's operating profile positions the company to generate meaningful 
      levels of FCF (defined as cash flow from operations less capital 
      expenditures and dividends), providing the company with considerable 
      financial flexibility at the current ratings. Disney's investment cycle 
      within its Parks and Resort segment is winding down, which will benefit 
      the company's FCF generation. Fitch anticipates that Disney will 
      generate in excess of $4 billion of annual FCF during the ratings 
      horizon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial 
      policy as the company increases the level of share repurchases during 
      fiscal 2014 to range between $6 and $8 billion. Given the strength of 
      Disney's underlying businesses, strong liquidity position, and Fitch's 
      FCF expectations, Disney has the financial flexibility to accommodate 
      the higher level of share repurchases in a manner consistent with its 
      current ratings. Additionally, the company maintains an appropriate 
      balance between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of 
      dividends and share repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of 
      its business in Fitch's estimation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain 
      consistent and within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. 
      Consolidated leverage of 1.27x as of the LTM period ended June 30, 2013 
      is in line with fiscal year-end 2012 metrics. Going forward Fitch 
      believes leverage will range between 1.2x and 1.4x during the ratings 
      horizon after consideration for a modest increase in debt levels related 
      to the higher level of share repurchases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks underlines the company's 
      ratings, and its operating profile continues to benefit from the 
      stability, recurring dual-stream revenue profile and high operating 
      margin characteristics attributable to its cable network business. 
      Disney's cable networks generate a greater portion of total revenue and 
      EBITDA, resulting in incremental stability in the total revenue and free 
      cash flow profile. Rising programming costs, particularly sports 
      programming, and Disney's ability to pass the higher costs onto 
      multi-channel video programming distributors (MPVDs) will remain a 
      significant risk to the company's operating profile. However, Fitch 
      believes that Disney is in a strong position to retain pricing power 
      going forward as its collection of top tier cable networks continue to 
      command audience and ratings and be a must-carry for the MVPDs. In 
      addition Disney has in large part, successfully matched the tenor of its 
      long-term sports programming rights with the terms of its various 
      affiliation agreements with the MVPDs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the company's businesses, 
      particularly Parks  Resorts (31% of Disney's year-to-date revenue), 
      consumer products (8%), and the advertising portion of broadcast and 
      cable networks (19%). Should macroeconomic volatility return, Fitch 
      expects these cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure but that 
      the company's credit and financial profile will likely remain within 
      expectations for the current ratings. The ratings incorporate Fitch's 
      expectation that the Studio Entertainment business, similar to that of 
      its peers, will remain volatile and low margin, given the hit-driven 
      nature. The decline of home entertainment sales, which is the window in 
      which many films become profitable, is becoming less of a concern amid 
      the growth of higher-margin digital distribution, and should be 
      accommodated within current ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney is well positioned to address the secular threats and 
      opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms 
      and continued audience fragmentation across the media and entertainment 
      landscape. The alternative distribution platforms generate incremental 
      demand for high high-quality content across all major end-markets 
      (broadcast, cable networks and subscription video on demand) and that 
      large, well-capitalized content providers, such as Disney, will remain 
      crucial to the industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and 
      is supported by significant FCF generation as well as $6 billion of 
      aggregate available borrowing capacity (as of June 30, 2013) under three 
      credit facilities. Commitments under these credit facilities support the 
      company's $6 billion commercial paper program and expire during March 
      2014 ($1.5 billion), February 2015 ($2.25 billion) and June 2017 ($2.25 
      billion). In addition the company had approximately $3.9 billion of cash 
      on hand as of June 30, 2013. Scheduled maturities (pro forma for the 
      announced redemption of the company's 4.5% notes due Dec. 2013) are well 
      laddered and manageable considering FCF generation expectations and 
      access to capital markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Approximately $460 million of debt is scheduled to mature during fiscal 
      2014 followed by approximately $2 billion annually during fiscal 2014 
      and fiscal 2015. Fitch does not expect debt reduction going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the 
      intermediate term. However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit 
      public commitment to more conservative leverage thresholds could result 
      in upgrade consideration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with 
      discretional actions of Disney's management rather than by operating 
      performance reflecting the company's significant financial flexibility. 
      Decisions that increase leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a 
      credible plan to reduce leverage will likely lead to a negative rating 
      action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total debt at June 30, 2013 was $15.0 billion and consisted of:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$50.0 million of CP;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$13.2 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from 
      December 2013 - 2093;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$273 million of debt related to Hong Kong Disneyland (Disneyland Paris 
      debt is no longer outstanding after Disney refinanced it with 
      intercompany debt in September 2012), which is non-recourse back to 
      Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption that the 
      company would back the loan payments;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Approximately $1.5 billion of foreign currency-denominated debt, 
      including the debt related to the acquisition of UTV.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms Disney's ratings as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walt Disney Company
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper at 'F1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ABC Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IDR at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney Enterprises, Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IDR at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the 
      lack of any material restrictions on movements of cash between the 
      entities) and treats the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari 
      passu. Fitch recognizes the absence of upstream guarantees from the 
      operating assets and that debt at Disney Enterprises is structurally 
      senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch does not distinguish 
      the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A' 
      category-investment grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial 
      policies and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt 
      Disney Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings 
      if we viewed there to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to 
      non-investment grade (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery 
      prospects would be more relevant).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer for a former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co employee who worked with "the London Whale" Bruno Iksil, has been trying to convince U.S. prosecutors that his client was the unwitting victim of manipulation by his superiors, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negotiations, which have taken place privately and only involved a handful of lawyers in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office, are part of former employee Julien Grout's bid to have criminal charges of fraud against him dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 14, prosecutors accused Grout, who was Iksil's deputy in the bank's Chief Investment Office in London, of trying to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses by marking positions in a credit derivatives portfolio at falsely inflated prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a meeting with prosecutors late last month, Grout's lawyer Edward Little argued Grout did not know the prices were wrong, the source said. Instead, based on the instructions he was given by superiors, including Iksil, Grout recorded prices he thought were correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the source said, prosecutors offered Grout the chance to talk to them directly and tell them whatever he knew without the risk of further incrimination. He declined, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government still has the option not to pursue the charges against Grout. But if a grand jury votes to indict him, the opportunity for the charges to be dismissed will vanish. Prosecutors are expected within the next month to seek indictments against Grout and his former boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, who was also charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prove in criminal court Grout committed fraud, prosecutors will have to show he knew the prices of the trades he was entering were too high and that he consciously decided to record incorrect prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trades in question were part of a series of outsized positions Bruno Iksil took in an illiquid market for credit derivatives, leading other traders to nickname him "the London Whale." When news of the JPMorgan traders' big bets became public early last year, the bank was forced to quickly unwind the trades, incurring a $6.2 billion loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said an internal investigation found evidence that someone might have tried to deliberately hide the mounting losses from others in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted its own investigation. Iksil struck a deal with U.S. authorities and agreed to become a cooperating witness for prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors eventually charged Martin-Artajo and Grout with fraud and conspiracy to falsify books and records. Iksil was not charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is running out for Grout's team to get prosecutors on their side. U.S. authorities will need an indictment against Martin-Artajo to proceed with his extradition from Spain, where he was arrested and released in August, and Grout was likely to indicted at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the source familiar with the meetings, Grout's lawyer told prosecutors Grout was simply following orders that Martin-Artajo and Iksil gave him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal complaint against Grout describes pressure Martin-Artajo put on Grout in February 2012 to "defend the positions," especially just before a month-end review of the group's profit-and-loss reports by senior bank executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint said that Grout began marking the positions "at a price more favorable to the CIO's profits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But communication records released to the public earlier this year at the end of an investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations show the chain of command that was in place while Grout was making the marks. On March 23, 2012, Iksil and Grout chatted online and discussed the prices that needed to be entered into the trading book at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All that I am asking you to do is tell Javier what you see," Iksil told Grout in the online chat. "That's it and he decides what we show."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining prices in the illiquid market is a fairly subjective exercise because there is no central clearing mechanism for the credit derivatives Iksil was trading. Convention in the industry has been to mark the price of a position at the midpoint between the prices at which market participants are willing to sell or buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grout's lawyer further argued that Grout believed there was a conspiracy on Wall Street to squeeze JPMorgan in the derivatives market, according to the source. The belief that they were being squeezed - possibly by traders in other parts of JPMorgan - was something Iksil eventually described in a complaint he filed to JPMorgan's compliance department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same March 23, 2012 chat, Iksil and Grout discussed gathering evidence to show dealers taking the opposite sides of their trades were deliberately quoting unfavorable prices to them to try to hurt their positions. Grout collected examples, including emails and chats they had exchanged with traders at other firms, they thought would show others at the bank how they had been treated unfairly in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors offered Grout the chance to meet with them for a proffer session, a special set of interviews during which he would be able to tell them whatever he knew without the risk of incriminating himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Grout declined the offer, the source said, because if prosecutors were to go ahead with their case against him the proffer session would have served as a preview to his defense arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Emily Flitter; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Grant McCool)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Emily Flitter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - A lawyer for a former JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co employee who worked with "the London Whale"
Bruno Iksil, has been trying to convince U.S. prosecutors that

He plans to step down as chairman of the bank next year, and
also plans to leave the PNC board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rohr's experience in finance and risk will help General
Electric, CEO Jeff Immelt said in a release. Rohr was elected by

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp,
the No. 2 U.S. oil company, signed an accord on Friday that
could lead to the end of civil lawsuits seeking $17.5 billion in
damages for a November 2011 oil spill, the company's lawyer in
Brazil, Oscar Couto, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement includes about 300 million reais ($130
million) in compensatory actions for the 3,600 barrel spill, in
the ocean northeast of Rio de Janeiro. Of the total, 95 million
reais are for social and environmental projects unrelated to
Chevron's own operations, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the signature of the accord, which commits Chevron to
unprecedented measures to prevent new incidents and
compensations for the spill in the Frade Field, the two lawsuits
could be resolved," the prosecutor's office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits are the largest environmental action in
Brazilian history. The spill did no discernable ecological
damage, never came close to Brazil's coast and injured no one,
the country's petroleum regulator said in a 2012 report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criminal charges were dropped in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron executives were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd, which was Chevron's drilling
contractor at Frade at the time of the spill, also signed the
accord but is not involved in the  settlement. Chevron said in
late 2012 that it would take full responsibility for the
accident. If the lawsuits are dismissed, Transocean will be
freed from the potential penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement, also signed by environmental protection
agency Ibama and oil regulator ANP, will monitor Chevron's
performance in the future, Gisele Porto, the prosecutor
responsible for the case, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is all so much easier when the company in question comes
to you and says they want to work things out; that's what
Chevron did," she said. "Otherwise this case could have dragged
out over years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron now expects that a judge will dismiss the lawsuits,
said Rafael Jaen Williamson, a Chevron spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced an interesting coupon today: The company will pay $200 or more for your used iPad. There&#8217;s just one catch. The $200 comes in the form of a gift card to the Microsoft store.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s actually a great deal, if you&#8217;re looking to move to a Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use the coupon to help buy a Surface RT, which starts at $349, or a Surface Pro, which starts at a significantly more painful $799. Or since the coupon is good for &#8220;other cool products&#8221; at the Microsoft store, you can get all prepped for your&#160;upgrade to the powerful new Xbox One when it ships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the interesting part is actually not the trade-in program.&#160;That makes perfect sense: Microsoft wants to promote its own tablets, which have seen less-than-spectacular sales results. And it&#8217;s a bold business move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interesting part is two words in the &#8220;How to redeem this offer&#8221; instructions: &#8220;Bring in your gently used iPad 2, 3, or 4 and get a minimum of a $200 gift card to the Microsoft store.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those two words, which dash the hopes of thousands who were planning to pick up a broken iPad for a couple of bucks at a local flea market, indicate that Microsoft has some kind of plan for the&#160;potentially tens of thousands of iPads that it might soon find itself in possession of. A plan, clearly, beyond simply destroying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what would that plan be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, as a competing smartphone, tablet, and operating system vendor, can hardly turn around and sell them. That would contribute to Apple&#8217;s iPad market share and essentially buoy the market for iPads by adding yet another viable after-market sales outlet for the once-shiny iDevices &#8230; without even guaranteeing that Microsoft gets a Surface sale, since people can use the coupon for anything in the Microsoft store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The options range from overseas sales &#8212; most likely, but still problematic &#8212; to selling them for parts and components, which would be challenging at best and not very profitable at worst &#8230; to simply selling them for their gold, silver, platinum, and other precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are unlikely options, because in the fine print, Microsoft says that the iPads should come with power cords and &#8220;cannot be password protected.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another clue comes &#8212; as do all good clues &#8212; in more of the fine print. The coupon program, it seems, is being run by CE Exchange, an electronics buyback and trade-in company. On that company&#8217;s website, CE Exchange says that &#8220;most electronic devices we receive &#8230; are refurbished &#8230; for repurposing and reuse.&#8221; Often, companies like this ship products overseas and sell them in developing countries at a significant discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m not sure how that&#8217;s going to help Microsoft long-term if the program just recycles old iPads to new owners. But you can bet that Microsoft has done the math and believes that it will help sell more Surface tabs as well as get a few iPads out of the North American market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Microsoft for comment, and the company said this is part of its Recycle for Rewards program, but did not say what would actually happen to the traded-in iPads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - A lawyer for a former JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co employee who worked with "the London Whale"
Bruno Iksil has been trying to convince U.S. prosecutors to drop
criminal charges against his client, Julien Grout, a source
familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 14, prosecutors accused Grout, who was Iksil's
deputy in the bank's Chief Investment Office in London, of
trying to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses
by marking positions in a credit derivatives portfolio at
falsely inflated prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a meeting with prosecutors late last month, Grout's
lawyer Edward Little argued Grout did not know the prices were
wrong, the source said. Instead, based on the instructions he
was given by superiors, including Iksil, Grout recorded prices
he thought were correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the source said, prosecutors offered Grout the
chance to talk to them directly and tell them whatever he knew
without the risk of further incrimination. He declined, the
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government still has the option not to pursue the
charges against Grout. But if a grand jury votes to indict him,
the opportunity for the charges to be dismissed will vanish.
Prosecutors are expected within the next month to seek
indictments against Grout and his former boss, Javier
Martin-Artajo, who was also charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trades in question were part of a series of outsized
positions Iksil took in an illiquid market for credit
derivatives. When news of the JPMorgan traders' big bets became
public early last year, the bank was forced to quickly unwind
the trades, incurring a $6.2 billion loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After conducting an internal investigation, JPMorgan said it
found evidence that someone might have tried to deliberately
hide the mounting losses from others in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted its own
investigation. Iksil struck a deal with U.S. authorities and
agreed to become a cooperating witness for prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors eventually charged Martin-Artajo and Grout with
fraud and conspiracy to falsify books and records. Iksil was not
charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the source familiar with the meetings, Grout's
lawyer told prosecutors Grout was simply following orders that 
Martin-Artajo and Iksil gave him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyer further argued that Grout believed there was a
conspiracy on Wall Street to squeeze JPMorgan in the derivatives
market, which does not have a centralized system for reporting
prices, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the source said, prosecutors offered Grout the
chance to meet with them for a proffer session, a special set of
interviews during which he would be able to tell them whatever
he knew without the risk of incriminating himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Grout declined the offer, the source said, because if
prosecutors were to go ahead with their case against him the
proffer session would have served as a preview to his defense
arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is running out for Grout's team to get prosecutors on
their side. U.S. authorities will need an indictment against
Martin-Artajo to proceed with his extradition from Spain, where
he was arrested and released in August. Observers were expecting
Grout to be indicted at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM, Netherlands, Sept. 13, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IBC Booth #1.D73&#160;-- Envivio (Nasdaq:ENVI), a leading provider of software-based video processing and delivery solutions, today announced integration of advanced features to the Envivio Halo&#8482; network media processor and Envivio Muse&#8482; transcoders, including Microsoft PlayReady Premium content protection and Civolution forensic watermarking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Envivio and Microsoft are longstanding industry partners and have now teamed up to integrate Microsoft PlayReady server technology and first party ports for Android and iOS with Envivio Halo network media processors. Advanced content protection scenarios requiring key rotation are now possible across a variety of adaptive bitrate (ABR) formats, notably MPEG-DASH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We are thrilled to continue to innovate in the delivery of premium video for service providers, using Microsoft PlayReady DRM technology to extend reach and enable compelling business models," said Hayete Gallot, senior director, PlayReady business of Microsoft Corp. "Envivio Halo offers a broad and advanced feature set, and the integration with PlayReady facilitates deployment of advanced services for customers seeking to monetize multi-screen and deliver the best user experience possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Content protection is critical to avoid illegal redistribution of video assets and maintain revenue streams for operators. Civolution's NexGuard forensic watermarking solution, combined with the Envivio Muse transcoder and Halo Experience Server, enables watermarking for live Internet or over-the-top (OTT) services. It allows service providers to easily identify streaming sessions without impacting the viewer's experience. Each user receives video with a unique and personalized watermark, which can be detected during illegal redistribution of the stream leading to the identification of the source of content theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"The NexGuard forensic watermarking solution helps protect content streamed across a wide range of devices, by ensuring that potential leaks are attributed to an individual," said Jean-Michel Masson, senior vice president of watermarking solutions, Civolution. "The combination of our watermark pre-processing and Envivio's scalable, versatile end-to-end video processing solution is especially valuable to help service providers protect high value, premium services such as live sports events and exclusive programming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Our focus on enhancement of our Muse and Halo product lines adds value for our customers and takes their any-screen services to the next level with more advanced functionality that enables service monetization," said Boris Felts, Envivio vice president of products. "Civolution and Microsoft are key industry partners, and the capabilities now possible with the integration of these watermarking and DRM technologies improve our operator customers' abilities to monitor and protect their premium services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Envivio's full range of any-screen solutions will be featured at Envivio's booth #1.D73 at IBC 2013, taking place in Amsterdam, September 13-17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

five criminal counts over their alleged roles in JPMorgan's
chief investment office in trying to hide part of a $6.2 billion
trading loss by mismarking the values of positions in a credit
portfolio they managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud,
conspiracy, making false filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, and falsifying books and records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government wants the men to forfeit proceeds traceable
to their alleged offenses, including compensation from the
largest U.S. bank. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge
Lorna Schofield in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Martin-Artajo did not immediately respond to

General Assembly in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the United Nations' "host country," the United States has a policy of issuing visas for members of delegations, in line with a 1947 pact with the United Nations, regardless of disputes with individual countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf declined comment on whether Bashir would get a visa - such applications are confidential under U.S. law - she and other U.S. officials made no secret of their hostility to a visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such a trip would be deplorable, cynical and hugely inappropriate," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told reporters in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be more appropriate for him to present himself to the ICC and travel to The Hague," she added, referring to the International Criminal Court, where Bashir face 10 charges as an "indirect" perpetrator according to the court's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bashir is accused of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Five counts of crimes against humanity: murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Two counts of war crimes: pillaging and intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- And three counts of genocide: genocide by killing, genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm, and genocide by deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about a target group's physical destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the 1947 U.N. Headquarters Agreement establishing the world body's base in New York, the United States is generally expected to grant visas to officials traveling to the United Nations "without charge and as promptly as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the United States does sometimes refuse entry to government officials and professionals from Iran with which it has had no diplomatic ties since 1980 and which it accuses of seeking nuclear weapons, a charge Tehran denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting By Susan Cornwell and by Lou Charbonneau at the United Nations; Editing by Christopher Wilson and Mohammad Zargham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) agreed on Monday to buy about half of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's (CM.TO) Aeroplan Visa (V.N) credit card portfolio in a deal that will see both banks issue the popular and lucrative rewards card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement, which drove shares of Aeroplan loyalty program operator Aimia (AIM.TO) to a five-year high, averts a potential legal battle between the two banks and also eliminates uncertainty over the future of the card that could have seen customers flee to other banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's safe to say that TD is the winner from this (of the two banks)," said Gavin Graham, chief strategy officer at Integris Pension Management Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TD, Canada's second-largest bank, will pay C$162.5 million ($157.59 million) to CIBC to acquire about 550,000 cardholder accounts, representing about C$3 billion in card balances and C$20 billion in annual retail spending, TD said. It will also become the card's primary issuer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIBC, the country's No. 5 lender, will receive an additional payment from Aimia and will keep the remaining 630,000 Aeroplan accounts held by existing banking customers. It will also continue to issue the card under the 10-year deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESOLVES AEROPLAN BATTLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal resolves a months-long battle for control of the lucrative Aeroplan card, which allows customers to earn points that can be cashed in for flights on Air Canada (ACb.TO) and its partner airlines, as well as other goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIBC has been the card's main issuer for more than two decades, but lost that role earlier this year, after Aimia could not come to terms on an extension with CIBC and instead entered into a partnership with TD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIBC had a right to match the terms of TD's deal, but said the deal was structured in a way that attempted to nullify that right. Last month, the banks said they were in talks for a compromise deal, although CIBC noted that if an agreement were not reached it retained its rights to exercise legal options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TD Chief Executive Ed Clark told Reuters that doing a deal allowed TD to acquire card customers upfront, rather than having to entice them to come to the bank and risk losing them to competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's kind of "jump ball" in the marketplace to see who's going to win those customers," said Clark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(So) you've got to spend a lot of marketing dollars and try to win every one of those customers over, whereas here, they're automatically your customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TD, which plans to launch five new Aeroplan cards in Canada and the United States, said the deal would contribute 10 Canadian cents per share to earnings next year on an adjusted basis and would contribute about 15 Canadian cents a share in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TD has been bulking up its credit card business for the last several years and with this deal will unquestionably be the market leader in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business offers higher margins and return on equity than traditional lending, and TD's increased exposure comes as Canadian consumer loan growth slows amid a cooling housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital analyst John Aiken said the fact that TD would be acquiring customers rather than having to win them over was positive, but said the negative in the deal was that TD would not be the sole Aeroplan Visa issuer in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not believe that this was the original vision when TD initially pursued the contract with Aimia," he said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIBC RETAINS HALF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CIBC, analysts said the deal was a better outcome than the potential of losing the entire Aeroplan portfolio, which had seemed a possibility after TD reached its deal with Aimia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the bank said the agreement will trim its earnings by about 45 Canadian cents a share on an annual basis, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, CIBC disclosed that the Aeroplan card portfolio generated 95 Canadian cents per share in profit over the 12 months ended July 31, or about 12 percent of the bank's overall profit during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on a conference call, CIBC CEO Gerry McCaughey deflected questions from analysts about why CIBC was unable to reach a deal with Aimia to extend its partnership before TD entered the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The discussions that went on over the last very long period of time, as to our renewal on a unilateral basis with Aimia, are moot at this point," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to maintaining half of the Aeroplan portfolio, CIBC plans to launch a new flight rewards card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of TD were up 1.4 percent at C$91.14, while CIBC was up 1 percent at C$81.92.

final settlement of probes into its London Whale derivatives
loss and expects to pay about $700 million, according to source
familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      protection product &#8211; &#8220;Chase Identity Protection&#8221; &#8211; to its credit-card 
      customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kirby McInerney has learned that the Office of the Comptroller of the 
      Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are preparing to 
      bring enforcement actions and fines against JPMorgan Chase stemming from 
      the bank&#8217;s deceptive practices. The bank reportedly duped credit card 
      customers into buying the identity-theft protection product by 
      misrepresenting that it was &#8220;free&#8221; and &#8220;mandatory&#8221; and that it would 
      improve their credit scores. Customers were charged approximately $12 
      per month for the purported product, which customers were told would 
      monitor their credit for suspicious activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase marketed Chase Identity Protection as the bank&#8217;s own 
      product. Nevertheless, it is believed that the product was actually 
      provided by a separate company that &#8220;partnered&#8221; &#8211; and shared a majority 
      of the revenue &#8211; with the bank. Kirby McInerney is investigating the 
      misleading sales tactics as well as the financial arrangements between 
      JPMorgan Chase and the third-party vendor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      If you are a JPMorgan Chase credit card customer who has been charged 
      for Identity Theft Protection, if you have information or would like to 
      learn more about these potential claims, or if you wish to discuss these 
      matters or have any questions concerning this announcement or your

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has named R. Martin Chavez to become chief information officer when Steven Scopellite, a 28-year veteran of the bank's technology group, retires at year-end, according to internal memos on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez is now co-chief operating officer of Goldman's equities business. He is known for his technological and analytical skills, having overseen the creation in the 1990s of an internal software platform that is now called Marquee, but was first called "Marty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another memo, Goldman said it will promote Don Duet and Paul Walker to co-heads of technology, reporting to Chavez, who will in turn report to Chief Administrative Officer Jeffrey Schroeder. Duet most recently served as chief operating officer of Goldman's technology division, while Walker has been global head of risk and strategy for prime services since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As markets and regulations evolve, Marty will lead our efforts to ensure that we deploy effective and innovative technology to address our clients' needs," said the memo, signed by Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman confirmed the memos' contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to Goldman's technology leadership come as Wall Street undergoes sweeping technological changes in response to new regulations, as well as pressure to cut costs while improving speed, quality and service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have been spending billions of dollars to upgrade technology to allow more trading to take place electronically. For instance, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank, spends $8 billion a year, or about 12 percent of its annual expenses, on systems and technology alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, even as the industry spends on upgrades, a spurt of technological woes have cost banks, brokers and exchanges millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the latest incidents occurred in August, when Goldman itself lost tens of millions of dollars on a series of erroneous equity options trades. Four employees were put on leave as a result of the embarrassing error, which stemmed from a problem with new code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRAT TO CIO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez joined Goldman in 1993 as a senior energy "strat" - internal parlance for a quantitative analyst. In addition to overseeing the bank's technology as CIO, he will share responsibility for overseeing the quantitative analysts' group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez holds a bachelor's degree in biochemisty and a master's degree in computer science from Harvard University, as well as a doctorate in medical information sciences from Stanford University. He took a hiatus from Goldman from 1997 until 2005, during which time he founded two technology companies and headed energy derivatives at Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became a managing director upon returning to Goldman and was named partner in 2006. He sits on the bank's management committee and on its Steering Committee on Regulatory Reform, which coordinates the bank's response to new regulations. Chavez also represents Goldman as a director of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scopellite joined Goldman in 1986 as a software engineer and has been a chief information officer since 2007. He was named managing director in 1998 and partner in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other big banks have also made changes to technology leadership recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) named Moira Kilcoyne and Steve Lieblich as co-heads of global technology and data, and Phil Davies as global head of operations, replacing Stephen Daffron, who retired as head of all three areas. The following month, former JPMorgan CIO Guy Chiarello left for First Data Corp. The bank named Mike Ashworth as interim CIO while searching for a permanent replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) replaced Marc Gordon with Laurie Readhead as CIO in April 2012, while Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N) CIO Kevin Rhein has been in that role since 2011. Citigroup Inc's (C.N) comparable role is held by Don Callahan, head of operations and technology, who joined the bank in 2007. Citi recently appointed a former General Electric Co (GE.N) CIO to its board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story was fixed to correct the name of the school at which Chavez earned master's degree to Harvard from MIT in the 11th paragraph. In the last paragraph, corrects to say that Marty Lippert is not Citigroup's CIO and that Don Callahan is effectively CIO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz, Paritosh Bansal and Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has applied for a U.S. visa to attend the opening of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the State Department said on Monday, adding that he should not make the trip because he is accused of war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the United States had received Bashir's application to attend the U.N. meeting, but "we would condemn any effort by him to do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She declined to comment on whether the visa would be granted but said before Bashir goes to U.N. headquarters, he should present himself to the International Criminal Court in the Hague, which has indicted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Susan Cornwell; editing by Christopher Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Building off a successful U.S. launch in February, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: 
      JPM) announced today three upcoming Code for Good Challenges. The Code 
      for Good Challenges bring together college students studying technology 
      to develop solutions to challenges faced by nonprofits during an intense 
      two-day event.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Code for Good Challenge has quickly become a recognizable event on 
      a global scale,&#8221; noted CIO Mike Ashworth. &#8220;These events are a tremendous 
      boost not only for the nonprofits and the students who put their skills 
      to the test, but to JPMorgan Chase. We get to see some really talented 
      students demonstrate their skills. It&#8217;s a great recruiting opportunity 
      for us.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The series of U.S.-based events will take place in New York, Delaware 
      and Ohio and a fourth event is scheduled for London. Dates of the first 
      U.S. events:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Ohio: October 4 &#8211; 5, 2013
      
			
        New York: October 18 &#8211; 19, 2013
      
			
        Delaware: November 1 &#8211; 2, 2013
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Participants at each event will be placed into teams and tasked with 
      working together to creatively solve a challenge faced by a local 
      nonprofit organization. JPMorgan Chase technologists will also be 
      involved, advising participants throughout the course of the event. A 
      panel of judges will determine the winning team, which will be announced 
      at the culmination of the 2-day event.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      College students majoring in a technology-related field at universities 
      who would like the opportunity to put their coding skills to use for a 
      good cause, should apply by visiting http://techcareers.jpmorgan.com/techcareers/us/opportunities/codeforgood 
      and selecting the event they wish to participate in.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The deadline to apply for the three U.S. events is September 22nd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The U.S. series was kicked off in February at the firm&#8217;s New York City 
      Headquarters and continued in Columbus, Ohio and Newark, Delaware. 
      Students from over 40 different universities joined with 6 nonprofit 
      organizations to create innovative technology solutions for the social 
      sector, coding overnight for over 24 hours. On the second day of each 
      event, a panel of judges determined the winning team.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In New York, the winning team was made up of Syracuse and Cornell 
      students who created a solution that was both a web and mobile app 
      designed to help track in-kind tools and machinery during relief efforts 
      in times of disaster with off-line capabilities. Their solution 
      supported Team Rubicon, which mobilizes military veterans and first 
      responders to rapidly deploy emergency response teams and provide 
      disaster relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Delaware, students from the Rochester Institute of Technology, 
      University of Delaware and University of Pennsylvania designed a mobile 
      app to benefit the United Way of Delaware. The app will enable residents 
      of Delaware to access key information about their more than 2,000 
      services in times of emergency and on weekends when the office is closed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Ohio, a team of students from Miami University of Ohio and Ohio State 
      University developed an app for the community Shelter Board, a 
      Columbus-based nonprofit that aims to alleviate homelessness in the 
      city. The app allows for cross-agency collaboration, and helps The 
      Community Shelter Board track homeless camps and individuals living in 
      places not meant for human habitation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While a single winning team was recognized at each event, the creations 
      of the other participating teams will not go unused. JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 
      Technology for Social Good team continued to build and implement various 
      components of the solutions developed during the Code for Good 
      Challenges as a part of their Force for Good program by leveraging their 
      technology analyst and intern program participants.

			Goldman Sachs Asset Management Launches New Real Return Solution in a 
      Mutual Fund
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expansion of central bank balance sheets around the globe has 
      prompted concerns about inflation. For investors, inflation has 
      historically been a complex issue to manage. This risk is meaningful 
      because even a modest increase in inflation can erode portfolio value. 
      With the launch of the Goldman Sachs Multi-Asset Real Return Fund (Class 
      A Shares: GHRAX) (the &#8220;Fund&#8221;), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. 
      (&#8220;GSAM&#8221;) provides investors access to a dynamic, multi-asset class 
      solution that seeks to help individuals achieve real return over 
      inflation. The Fund provides exposure to inflation-sensitive asset 
      classes, including opportunistic fixed income, commodities, and select 
      equity sectors. This diversified strategy seeks to perform well across 
      most market environments, and specifically, seeks to provide real return 
      during periods of rising and high inflation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Protecting personal wealth through investing in strategies that deliver 
      consistent, real returns is central to many individual clients&#8217; 
      investment objectives, and GSAM has nearly two decades of experience 
      managing multi-asset portfolios with this focus,&#8221; said Samantha 
      Davidson, the Fund&#8217;s co-portfolio manager. &#8220;The GS Multi-Asset Real 
      Return Fund seeks to build upon this experience and deliver an 
      inflation-sensitive solution in a mutual fund format to help investors 
      position themselves for the medium- to long-term environment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Samantha Davidson, Raymond Chan, and Chris Lvoff from GSAM&#8217;s Global 
      Portfolio Solutions (&#8220;GPS&#8221;) team are the Fund&#8217;s co-portfolio managers. 
      As of June 30, 2013, GPS, GSAM&#8217;s multi-asset class team, currently 
      manages over $20 billion for a diverse set of clients globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We continue to focus on meeting the needs of our clients, and 
      outcome-oriented solutions are a critical part of every individual&#8217;s 
      portfolio strategy,&#8221; said James McNamara, Managing Director and 
      President of Goldman Sachs Mutual Funds. &#8220;Unexpected inflation may pose 
      a significant risk to investors&#8217; wealth, and the GS Multi-Asset Real 
      Return Fund seeks to address this threat.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fund is offered in Class A and Class C Shares, both with $1,000 
      minimum initial investments. It also offers Institutional, Class R and 
      Class IR Shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Goldman Sachs Asset Management is the asset management arm of The 
      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS), which oversees $955 billion in 
      assets under supervision as of June 30, 2013.1 Goldman Sachs 
      Asset Management has been providing discretionary investment advisory 
      services since 1988 and has investment professionals in all major 
      financial centers around the world. The company offers investment 
      strategies across a broad range of asset classes to institutional and 
      individual clients globally. Founded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is a leading 
      global investment banking, securities and investment management firm 
      that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and 
      diversified client base that includes corporations, financial 
      institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Diversification does not protect an investor from market risk and 
      does not ensure a profit.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fund Risk Considerations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Goldman Sachs Multi-Asset Real Return Fund seeks long-term 
      real return by investing in inflation sensitive assets (i.e., 
      investments that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser, are 
      expected to perform favorably in rising or high inflationary 
      environments). The Fund invests primarily in a portfolio of equity, 
      fixed income and commodity asset classes (the &#8220;Underlying Asset 
      Classes&#8221;), including derivatives that provide exposure to the Underlying 
      Asset Classes. Derivative instruments may involve a high degree 
      of financial risk. These risks include the risk that a small movement in 
      the price of the underlying security or benchmark may result in a 
      disproportionately large movement, unfavorable or favorable, in the 
      price of the derivative instrument; risk of default by a counterparty; 
      and liquidity risk. The Fund&#8217;s equity investments are subject to market 
      risk, which means that the value of its investments may go up or 
      down in response to the prospects of individual companies, particular 
      industry sectors and/or general economic conditions. Investing in 
      real estate investment trusts (REITs) involves certain unique risks 
      in addition to those risks associated with investing in the real estate 
      industry in general. REITs whose underlying properties are concentrated 
      in a particular industry or geographic region are also subject to risks 
      affecting such industries and regions. The securities of REITs involve 
      greater risks than those associated with larger, more established 
      companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements 
      because of interest rate changes, economic conditions and other factors. 
      The Fund may also invest in fixed income securities, which are subject 
      to the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit 
      and interest rate risk. The Fund may invest in non-investment 
      grade securities, which involve greater price volatility and present 
      greater risks than higher rated fixed income securities. The value of 
      the Fund&#8217;s treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) 
      generally fluctuates in response to inflationary concerns, and as 
      inflationary concerns decrease, TIPS become less valuable. Any guarantee 
      on U.S. government securities applies only to the underlying 
      securities of the Fund if held to maturity and not to the value of the 
      Fund&#8217;s shares. Foreign and emerging market investments may be 
      more volatile and less liquid than investments in U.S. securities and 
      are subject to the risks of currency fluctuations and adverse economic 
      and political developments. Exposure to the commodities markets 
      may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in 
      traditional securities. The Fund&#8217;s investments in pooled investment 
      vehicles (including other investment companies, exchange-traded 
      funds, master limited partnerships (MLPs) and publicly traded 
      partnerships (PTPs)) subject it to additional expenses. Investments 
      in MLPs are subject to certain risks, including risks related to 
      limited control and limited rights to vote, potential conflicts of 
      interest, cash flow risks, dilution risks, limited liquidity and risks 
      related to the general partner&#8217;s right to force sales at undesirable 
      times or prices. MLPs are also subject to risks relating to their 
      complex tax structure, including the risk that a distribution received 
      by the Fund from an MLP is treated as a return of capital, which may 
      increase the Fund&#8217;s tax liability and require the Fund to restate the 
      character of its distributions and amend shareholder tax reporting 
      previously issued, and the risk that an MLP could lose its tax status as 
      a partnership, resulting in a reduction in the value of the Fund&#8217;s 
      investment in the MLP and lower income to the Fund. Risks of PTPs may 
      include potential lack of liquidity and limitations on voting and 
      distribution rights.

			Nintex Workflow for Microsoft Office 365 Now Available
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Nintex Supports Microsoft Office 365 by Extending Business Process 
      Automation to a Brand New Platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Nintex, 
      a world leader in workflow software, today announced the availability of 
      Nintex Workflow for Microsoft Office 365. Now users can scale and build 
      advanced workflows on a powerful cloud platform. Nintex Workflow for 
      Office 365 is available immediately in the SharePoint Store and Nintex 
      Forms for Office 365 will be available in the coming weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These versions of Nintex Workflow and Nintex Forms are developed 
      specifically for the Office 365 platform and cater to its unique 
      capabilities. Nintex&#8217;s software extends Microsoft SharePoint Online, 
      enabling users to collaborate on processes in the cloud or in a hybrid 
      environment. Users can get started in seconds to automate approval 
      routing, employee onboarding, forms processing and expense handling, all 
      in the cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Customers have already started ordering the new software. Add Value 
      Technologies, a Brazilian company, top Citrix partner and infrastructure 
      application delivery service to Latin America, is an early adopter of 
      Nintex Workflow for Office 365. Previously, Add Value Technologies was 
      managing different lists for various departmental processes and unable 
      to integrate workflow activities for a dynamic and unified view of data 
      across departments. This created additional work for managers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We were looking for a quick and easy solution to eliminate departmental 
      silos and automate processes like administrative tasks, marketing 
      communications, invoicing, vendor contracts and customer relationship 
      management,&#8221; said Leandro Aparicio, owner at Add Value Technologies. 
      &#8220;With the support of Entercomms, a Nintex partner, we were able to 
      realize the benefits of adopting Nintex Workflow for Office 365. We are 
      now looking forward to taking advantage of the low infrastructure cost 
      of Office 365 along with complementary capabilities of Nintex to 
      streamline our everyday processes.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is just the beginning for Nintex and Office 365,&#8221; said Mike 
      Fitzmaurice, vice president of product technology at Nintex. &#8220;We will 
      continue to innovate on this new platform and help customers make the 
      most of their investment, unlocking new capabilities and delivering 
      workflow to virtually anyone, anytime, anywhere. Nintex is wherever our 
      customers are doing work.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nintex Workflow for Office 365 enables users, developers and IT 
      professionals to automate processes quickly and easily, without 
      sacrificing power or manageability. Nintex Forms for Office 365 is an 
      easy-yet-powerful way to build and manage forms that are web-aware, 
      SharePoint-aware, mobile-aware, and can kick-start workflows. Both 
      products allow business applications to be built in a browser, using the 
      familiar drag-and-drop experience. Customers are now able to create a 
      whole new range of business solutions and connect cloud services 
      including Yammer, Twitter, SkyDrive, Bing, and a host of virtual 
      machines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings has assigned Turkey-based Coca-Cola 
Icecek A.S.'s (CCI; BBB/Stable) planned bond issue an expected senior unsecured 
rating of 'BBB(EXP)'. The rating is aligned with CCI's Long-term Issuer Default 
Ratings (IDR). The final rating for the bonds is contingent upon receipt of 
final documents conforming to information already received by Fitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned USD denominated bond will be raised by the holding company Coca-Cola 
Icecek A.S. Similar to the USD300m private placement it issued earlier this 
year, it will not benefit from guarantees from the company's subsidiaries and 
will rank as a senior unsecured obligation pari passu with its other financial 
debt. It will also benefit from a change of control and a cross-acceleration 
clause. We caution that the definition of principal subsidiary does not 
currently capture in the cross acceleration clause the debt of any of the 
company's foreign operations, such as Coca-Cola Beverages Pakistan Ltd. However, 
as the business of the foreign operations grows, there is scope in future for 
the larger ones, such as Coca-Cola Beverages Pakistan Ltd, to fall into the 
relevant thresholds set by the definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEY RATING DRIVERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pari Passu Debt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCI is targeting sizing its issue at an amount sufficient to cover all of its 
debt maturing in 2014. In addition to achieving a substantial improvement in its 
liquidity position, the issue will also enable CCI to shift the majority of its 
debt to the holding company Coca-Cola Icecek A.S., thus reducing any structural 
subordination among its debt instruments. Whilst as of end June 2013 this 
company was the borrower of approximately two-thirds of group debt, pro-forma 
for the bond issue the main other borrower in the group besides CCI will be the 
Pakistan joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior Ranking Debt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debt of Coca-Cola Beverages Pakistan Ltd - which is 49.49% but fully 
consolidated - and other operating subsidiaries should account for no more than 
approximately 20% of CCI's consolidated debt post bond issuance. Although not 
all guaranteed by CCI, Fitch considers the debt of these operating subsidiaries 
as ranking ahead of debt of the holding company. Prior ranking debt will however 
be viewed as negligible due to the fact that overall it should account for only 
approximately 0.2x EBITDA, which is well under the threshold of 2x considered by 
Fitch as critical to determine subordination issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong Coca-Cola Bottler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCI is the sixth-largest independent bottler in the Coca-Cola system and a key 
vehicle for The Coca Cola Company Inc.'s (TCCC, A+/Stable) expansion into the 
Middle East and Central Asia. Since 2007, CCI has been investing heavily in 
terms of capex and M to grow TCCC's franchise in these regions. Thanks to 
strong and growing cash flow from operations, these investments have had limited 
adverse effects on CCI's credit metrics. The ratings reflect the resilience of 
CCI's results to economic cycles and the company's leverage policy to maintain a 
net debt/EBITDA ratio of around 1.5x-2.0x.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volumes, Mix Drive Growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCI's performance should continue to benefit from consistent volume and price 
growth, driven by a young population, relatively low soft drinks penetration in 
its countries of operations and the ability to push sales growth, particularly 
in Turkey, on the more profitable "immediate consumption" channel. Although 
volume growth has been easing in Turkey since 2011, EBITDA has maintained growth 
rates of at least high single digits. Moreover, rapid expansion of its 
international business has enabled an improvement in profit margins driven by 
greater scale and operating efficiencies achieved. We expect CCI's international 
presence to remain a key underpinning factor of the group's profitability in 
2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robust Performance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012 consolidated net revenue per case (+7.3% in Turkey and +2% in the 
international segment) increased by 8.6% mainly due to higher prices and better 
packaging and category mix. Better quality of sales together with lower costs 
from 2011's highs, contributed to an improved EBITDA margin in 2012 of 16.2%, 
the highest level since 2009 and more in line with the profitability shown by 
other Coca-Cola bottlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sufficient Liquidity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should this debt issue not proceed, Fitch believes CCI has access to multiple 
sources of funding. Liquidity was supported by cash of TRY615m at end-Q213, 
approximately USD900m and USD500m in undrawn foreign exchange and uncommitted 
bank lines, respectively, as well as strong relationships with both local and 
international banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forex Exposure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the majority of CCI's debt denominated in dollars and euros at end-June 
2013, cash flow remains generated mainly in Turkish lira. However, this depends 
on the EBITDA contribution of the international segment, which is growing. The 
company will consequently remain vulnerable to unexpected and/or sharp 
depreciation of the lira. CCI has proven its ability to recover its targeted 
credit metrics after periods of sharp TRY depreciation, as in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings Incorporate Implied TCCC Support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratings include embedded support from TCCC due to its influence over major 
decisions, moderate operational and strategic ties (CCI represents an entry 
point to fast-growing markets) and demonstrated operational support and 
oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RATING SENSITIVITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a 
negative rating action include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A material permanent deterioration in free cash flow (FCF) generation or large 
acquisition leading to lease-adjusted net debt/EBITDAR above 2.5x and funds from 
operations (FFO) adjusted net debt above 2.8x-3.0x for an extended period along 
with FFO interest coverage below 6x.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, CCI's rating could be downgraded should Fitch perceive that CCI has 
become strategically or operationally less significant to TCCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event of a sharp devaluation of the Turkish lira, Fitch will examine the 
group's willingness and timing to undertake any necessary cash preservation 
measures such as dividend and capex reduction (as observed in 2009).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive: As the highest rated corporate in Turkey, an upgrade of the IDRs is 
unlikely due to CCI's limited scale, diversification and forex exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the end of the Acceptance Period, on 11 September 2013, 24:00 hrs 
      (local time at Frankfurt am Main) (the &#8220;Reference Date&#8221;), the 
      share capital of the Target Company amounted to EUR&#160;88,522,939.00 and 
      was divided into 88,522,939 KDH Shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the Reference Date Vodafone Group Plc, Newbury, England (&#8220;Vodafone&#8221;), 
      a person acting jointly with the Bidder within the meaning of section 2 
      para. 5 Wp&#220;G, held 3,782,179 KDH Shares; this corresponds to 
      approximately 4.27% of the share capital and voting rights of the Target 
      Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the Acceptance Period the Takeover Offer has been accepted for a

      Bidder and persons acting jointly with the Bidder plus the number of 
      KDH&#160;Shares for which the Takeover Offer has been accepted until the 
      Reference Date amounts to 67,702,103 KDH Shares. This corresponds to

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Section 13.1 of the Offer Document of the Takeover Offer 
      and the agreements which come into existence as a result of accepting 
      the Takeover Offer are subject to the completion conditions listed in 
      Sections 13.1.1 to 13.1.3 of the Offer Document.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following completion conditions of Sections 13.1.1 to 13.1.3 of the 
      Offer Document are fulfilled at expiry of the Acceptance Period:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        the completion condition according to Section 13.1.2 of the Offer 
        Document is fulfilled. The aggregate amount of (i) tendered KDH Shares 
        (including the KDH Shares for which the acceptance of this Takeover 
        Offer has been declared in the Acceptance Period but only become 
        effective after the end of the Acceptance Period by re-booking the KDH 
        Shares to ISIN&#160;DE00KD88872 as set out in the Offer Document) for which 
        the right of withdrawal has not been validly exercised in accordance 
        with the Offer Document, plus (ii) all further KDH&#160;Shares held by the 
        Bidder or any member of Vodafone Group, plus (iii) all further KDH 
        Shares attributable to the Bidder or any member of Vodafone Group in 
        accordance with section 30 Wp&#220;G, plus (iv) all further KDH Shares for 
        which the Bidder or any member of Vodafone Group has entered into an 
        agreement outside of the Takeover Offer giving them the right to 
        required the transfer of title to such KDH Shares, amounts to 
        67,702,103 KDH Shares at expiry of the Acceptance Period; this 
        corresponds to approximately 76.48% of the share capital and voting 
        rights of the Target Company. The minimum acceptance threshold of 75% 
        of all KDH Shares issued at the time of the expiry of the Acceptance 
        Period has therefore been exceeded.
      
			
        the completion condition according to Section 13.1.3 of the Offer 
        Document is fulfilled. The daily closing value of the MDAX (ISIN 
        DE0008467416), as determined by Deutsche B&#246;rse&#160;AG, Frankfurt am Main, 
        Germany and published on their website was 14.833,52&#160;points on 
        10&#160;September 2013 and 14.877,96&#160;points on 11&#160;September&#160;2013. The 
        completion condition in Section 13.1.3 of the Offer Document, 
        according to which the daily closing value of the MDAX on at least one 
        of the last two trading days of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange of the 
        Acceptance Period as determined by Deutsche B&#246;rse AG, Frankfurt&#160;am 
        Main, Germany and published on their website is above 11.366,00 points 
        is therefore fulfilled.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Takeover Offer is only subject to the completion conditions in 
      Sections 13.1.1 of the Offer Document (Merger control clearance) which 
      has not yet been fulfilled. Thus, the settlement of the Takeover Offer 
      and the crediting of the offer consideration will occur no later than 
      seven banking days after the publication of the fulfilment of all 
      completion conditions or after the publication of the result of the 
      Takeover Offer pursuant to Section 23 para. 1 sentence 1 no. 3 Wp&#220;G, 
      whichever occurs later.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp released an
emergency software fix for Internet Explorer on Tuesday after
hackers exploited a security flaw in the popular Web browser to
attack an unknown number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker said on its website it released the
software, known as a "Fix It," as an emergency measure to
protect customers after learning about "extremely limited,
targeted attacks" that made use of the newly discovered bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the attacks took advantage of an undiscovered
flaw, or "zero day" vulnerability in industry parlance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-sponsored hacking groups are often willing to pay
hundreds of thousands of dollars for zero-day vulnerabilities in
widely used software such as Internet Explorer, according to
security experts who track that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They typically use them on small numbers of carefully
selected, high-value targets, to keep such flaws secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Microsoft issues a warning about a zero-day bug, other
groups of hackers involved in massive cyber-crime operations,
such as identity theft, rush to reverse-engineer the Fix Its so
they can build computer viruses that also exploit the same
vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security experts said Internet Explorer users should either
immediately install the Fix It or stop using the browser until
Microsoft can put out an update, which will be automatically 
installed through its Windows Update program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the Fix It out, I'm sure any attacker who is a bit
sophisticated can figure out what the flaw is and implement a

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are still investigating JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's "London Whale" trading scandal for potential criminal wrongdoing, according to people familiar with the probe, in a sign that an expected $700 million regulatory settlement may not put the issue to rest for the largest U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in New York and FBI agents are piecing together the events that led JPMorgan to restate its 2012 first-quarter earnings and eventually reveal more than $6 billion of losses from enormous bets a group of London-based traders made on illiquid credit derivatives, according to several sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the continuing criminal investigation was first reported by Reuters on Tuesday. Meanwhile, a source told Reuters the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved its portion of the civil settlement in a split vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators are focusing on whether people inside the bank had more detailed knowledge about the potential losses than the bank had expressed in its early public statements about the matter, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two former bank employees - Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout - have already been charged with trying to hide some of those losses by deliberately giving inaccurate values to the sophisticated securities involved in the trades. Authorities are trying to determine whether Martin-Artajo and Grout and others working with them had felt pressured to minimize the losses, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the trader whose large bets earned him the nickname "London Whale," has signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors and has not been charged with any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has said its previous statements have been truthful regarding the events related to the London Whale trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our senior executives said what they believed to be true at the time," Mark Kornblau, a bank spokesman, said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news of the continuing criminal investigation into the bank's actions underscores the extent of legal and regulatory troubles facing JPMorgan and its chief executive, Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is facing probes by various government agencies into areas that include possible bribery in hiring practices in China, and potentially fraudulent sales of mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the "Whale" scandal, Dimon faced a bruising battle with some shareholders to retain his chairman title and has since been under pressure to improve the bank's relationship with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a memo to employees on Tuesday, Dimon said the bank is braced for more legal and regulatory scrutiny in the coming weeks and months. He outlined a series of steps JPMorgan has taken to improve operations, including devoting "unprecedented" resources to fix its risk, legal and compliance operations. Dimon said he has also begun meeting personally with regulators to improve relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has added 4,000 staff to its control group since 2012 - three quarters of them this year - and increased spending on those efforts by about $1 billion. The bank's control group includes risk, compliance, legal, finance, technology, oversight and control and audit functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Never before have we focused so much time, effort, brainpower, technological power and money on a single, enterprise-wide objective," Dimon said in the memo, which was reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SETTLEMENT TALKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the criminal investigation comes after a source said on Monday that the bank was nearing a deal with regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, to settle their probes into the "Whale" scandal for at least $700 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a split vote late last week, the SEC approved its portion of the settlement with J.P. Morgan, according to people familiar with the matter. Mary Jo White, the SEC chairman, and Daniel Gallagher, an SEC commissioner, both recused themselves. Most votes by the commission are unanimous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White withdrew because JPMorgan was among her clients when she worked as a defense attorney at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton. Gallagher's former firm, WilmerHale, also did work for JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is too early to say whether any additional charges will be brought or whether the bank itself will face any criminal liability. But federal prosecutors did not participate in settlement talks between the bank and its regulators, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Justice Department is saying, 'We don't want to buy a pig in a poke. We want to know what the scope of the issues are before we say you're done, we have no more business with you on this issue,'" said Samuel Buell, a professor at Duke University Law School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHALE PROBE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, at an August press conference announcing the criminal complaint against Martin-Artajo and Grout, said his office was continuing to investigate the trading losses.

Grout is facing similar charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors say the two deliberately reported inflated values for Iksil's derivatives positions to try to hide the losses they were suffering from higher-ups in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men are living in Europe and federal authorities aim to extradite them to New York for trial. Martin-Artajo's lawyer recently said he would fight extradition from Spain.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp raised its quarterly dividend by 22 percent and renewed its $40 billion share buyback program, extending an olive branch to investors who are expected to grill its outgoing CEO on Thursday about a costly foray into mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surprisingly big hike takes Microsoft's dividend yield to around 3.4 percent, ahead of major tech corporations such as International Business Machines Corp and Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may not satisfy activist investment firm ValueAct Capital and its supporters, mainly other big investment funds, analysts said. Some investors held out hope for a bigger slice of the company's $70 billion cash hoard, now that ValueAct has an option to take a seat on the software giant's board and exert greater influence over the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ValueAct has not publicized its goals. But people familiar with the fund's thinking say it questions Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's leadership and the wisdom of buying Nokia Corp's handset unit to delve deeper into the low-margin hardware business, and that it wants higher dividends and share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares finished 0.39 percent higher at $32.93 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I expected ValueAct to push for a big lump-sum payment like they have in the past," said Fort Pitt Capital analyst Kim Forrest, who has not spoken with the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And this is Microsoft saying no."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hotly anticipated investor meeting on Thursday will give shareholders their first chance to quiz management on who may replace Ballmer, who announced plans to retire within a year after ValueAct pressed for his ouster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how hard ValueAct pushed Microsoft to share more of its $70 billion cash hoard. ValueAct CEO Jeffrey Ubben declined to comment about Microsoft during an industry event in New York on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, investors have called on Microsoft to return cash to shareholders rather than invest in peripheral projects, and limit its focus to serving enterprise customers with its vastly profitable Windows, Office and server products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, it announced plans to buy Nokia's phone business and license its patents for 5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion), a hefty investment that some criticized as a foray into a field already dominated by Apple and Google Inc hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has lost almost $3 billion on its Bing search engine and other Internet projects in the last two years alone, not counting a $6 billion write-off for its failed purchase of online advertising agency aQuantive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors want a clearer picture of where Microsoft's investments in devices will take the company in coming years, especially as its cash cows, Windows and Office software, come under attack from Apple and Google in the mobile market, and the likes of Evernote and Box begin to develop productivity software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They really need to address what Microsoft will look like in a few years, and what the end goal is," Forrest said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ONE COMPANY TO RULE THEM ALL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer announced his move just weeks after unveiling a 'One Microsoft' vision focused on hardware and cloud-based services. But poor sales of the Surface tablet, on top of its years-long failure to make money out of online search or smartphones, have cast doubt on the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest questions hanging over Microsoft is who will take the helm once Ballmer exits, and whether the successor will hew to his vision. Several sources have said top investors in the company are seeking a turnaround expert from within or without, and have proposed CEOs like Ford Motor Co's Alan Mulally or Computer Sciences Corp's Mike Lawrie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia acquisition also brings former, well-regarded Microsoft executive Stephen Elop, who had headed the Finland-based company, back into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's dividend and buyback declaration will help appease some investors for the time being, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will raise its regular dividend, payable on December 12 to shareholders of record on November 21, to 28 cents per share and authorized a new share buyback program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 5-cent increase, worth about $400 million a quarter, was about 3 cents more than analysts had expected.

&lt;p&gt;* Raises quarterly dividend to 28 cents per share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Investors set to quiz management on Thursday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares rise 0.39 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chandni Doulatramani and Edwin Chan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp raised its
quarterly dividend by 22 percent and renewed its $40 billion
share buyback program, extending an olive branch to investors
who are expected to grill its outgoing CEO on Thursday about a
costly foray into mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surprisingly big hike takes Microsoft's dividend yield
to around 3.4 percent, ahead of major tech corporations such as
International Business Machines Corp and Apple Inc
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may not satisfy activist investment firm ValueAct
Capital and its supporters, mainly other big investment funds,
analysts said. Some investors held out hope for a bigger slice
of the company's $70 billion cash hoard, now that ValueAct has
an option to take a seat on the software giant's board and exert
greater influence over the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ValueAct has not publicized its goals. But people familiar
with the fund's thinking say it questions Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer's leadership and the wisdom of buying Nokia Corp's
 handset unit to delve deeper into the low-margin
hardware business, and that it wants higher dividends and share
buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares finished 0.39 percent higher at $32.93 on
the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I expected ValueAct to push for a big lump-sum payment like
they have in the past," said Fort Pitt Capital analyst Kim
Forrest, who has not spoken with the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And this is Microsoft saying no."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hotly anticipated investor meeting on Thursday will give
shareholders their first chance to quiz management on who may
replace Ballmer, who announced plans to retire within a year
after ValueAct pressed for his ouster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how hard ValueAct pushed Microsoft to share
more of its $70 billion cash hoard. ValueAct CEO Jeffrey Ubben
declined to comment about Microsoft during an industry event in
New York on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, investors have called on Microsoft to return cash
to shareholders rather than invest in peripheral projects, and
limit its focus to serving enterprise customers with its vastly
profitable Windows, Office and server products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, it announced plans to buy Nokia's phone business
and license its patents for 5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion), a
hefty investment that some criticized as a foray into a field
already dominated by Apple and Google Inc hardware and
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has lost almost $3 billion on its Bing search
engine and other Internet projects in the last two years alone, 
not counting a $6 billion write-off for its failed purchase of
online advertising agency aQuantive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors want a clearer picture of where Microsoft's
investments in devices will take the company in coming years,
especially as its cash cows, Windows and Office software, come
under attack from Apple and Google in the mobile market, and the
likes of Evernote and Box begin to develop productivity
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They really need to address what Microsoft will look like
in a few years, and what the end goal is," Forrest said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ONE COMPANY TO RULE THEM ALL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer announced his move just weeks after unveiling a 'One
Microsoft' vision focused on hardware and cloud-based services.
But poor sales of the Surface tablet, on top of its years-long
failure to make money out of online search or smartphones, have
cast doubt on the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest questions hanging over Microsoft is who
will take the helm once Ballmer exits, and whether the successor
will hew to his vision. Several sources have said top investors
in the company are seeking a turnaround expert from within or
without, and have proposed CEOs like Ford Motor Co's Alan
Mulally or Computer Sciences Corp's Mike Lawrie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia acquisition also brings former, well-regarded 
Microsoft executive Stephen Elop, who had headed the
Finland-based company, back into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's dividend and buyback declaration will help appease
some investors for the time being, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will raise its regular dividend, payable
on Dec. 12 to shareholders of record on Nov. 21, to 28 cents per
share and authorized a new share buyback program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 5-cent increase, worth about $400 million a quarter, was
about 3 cents more than analysts had expected. The new share
repurchase program, with no expiration date, would replace
another set to expire on Sept. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ranks fourth on Wall Street in terms of actual
cash payouts, behind Apple, Exxon Mobil and AT Inc
. In terms of dividend yield, it ranks fourth among U.S.
information technology companies, lagging only Intel Corp
, Seagate Technology and Microchip Technology
Inc, according to S Dow Jones Indices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view this as a further indication that things are
changing at Microsoft with respect to corporate governance that
we believe could benefit shareholders over the next six to 12
months," Nomura Securities analyst Rick Sherlund said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow had expected an
accelerated or expanded share buyback plan. The slightly
bigger-than-expected dividend increase may signal a willingness
to bow to investors' demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A major open question is the timeframe over which the
company plans to utilize the new $40 billion authorization, as
that will dictate whether the level of the annual buyback is
changing," Lenschow wrote on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the size of the new buyback program appears on the
lower end of investor expectations, which we had pegged at close
to $50-60 billion, the lingering question around the timeframe
of the program makes the comparison to expectations flawed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan said on Tuesday it had applied for a U.S. visa to let its president travel to the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite international arrest warrants against him over charges of masterminding war crimes in Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington earlier said it had received the application, calling the request "deplorable" given Omar Hassan al-Bashir's indictment by the International Criminal Court (ICC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior State Department official said Bashir would "not receive a warm welcome" if he were to travel to the U.N. meeting. The official said Bashir had applied for a visa to attend the opening of the annual U.N. General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am not going to speak to the specifics of this case, but typically as a host nation the United States is generally obligated to admit foreign nationals, but visas broadly speaking can be restricted," the official added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trip to the United States could be risky for Bashir, who has limited his travel mostly to African neighbors and Arab allies since the court ordered member countries in 2009 and 2010 to detain him if he entered their territories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is not a member of the Hague-based ICC so would not be legally bound to hand the president over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Washington has led calls for Bashir to face international justice over the bloodshed in the now decade-old conflict in the western region of Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has also transferred ICC suspects to the court before. When Bosco Ntaganda handed himself in to the U.S. Embassy in the Rwandan capital Kigali in March, officials put the Congolese warlord on a plane to The Hague within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the international war crimes court could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudan dismisses the ICC charges, says reports of mass killings in Darfur have been exaggerated, and refuses to recognize the court which it says is part of a Western plot against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. CRITICISM DISMISSED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The foreign ministry took the necessary measure to obtain a visa for the president of the republic and his delegation," the Sudanese ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said Bashir planned to meet several African leaders on the sideline of the U.N. session in New York, where debates start next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry dismissed criticism of the application from U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. government is not qualified morally, politically or legally to give any lessons or recommendations respecting international law or human rights," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. was obliged to grant a visa under the 1947 U.N. Headquarters Agreement establishing the world body's base in New York, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudan's visa request comes at a time of rising African hostility to the ICC due to a perception that prosecutors disproportionately target African leaders, a charge the ICC denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainly non-Arab tribes took up arms in Darfur in 2003 against the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum, complaining of neglect and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflict has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced about 2 million, according to human rights groups and U.N. officials. Sudan says the numbers are overblown. The ICC issued arrest warrants against Bashir in 2009 and 2010 to face charges of orchestrating war crimes and genocide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ulf Laessing; Additional reporting by Thomas Escritt in The Hague and Lesley Wroughton in Washington; Writing by Tom Perry and Ulf Laessing; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan said on Tuesday it had applied for a U.S. visa to let its president travel to the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite international arrest warrants out against him over charges of masterminding war crimes in Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington earlier said it had received the application, calling the request "deplorable" given Omar Hassan al-Bashir's indictment by the International Criminal Court (ICC). It did not comment on whether a visa would be granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trip to the United States could be risky for Bashir, who has limited his travel mostly to African neighbors and Arab allies since the court ordered member countries in 2009 and 2010 to detain him if he entered their territories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is not a member of the Hague-based ICC so would not be legally bound to hand the president over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Washington has led calls for Bashir to face international justice over the bloodshed in the now decade-old conflict in the western region of Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has also transferred ICC suspects to the court before. When Bosco Ntaganda handed himself in to the U.S. embassy in the Rwandan capital Kigali in March, officials put the Congolese warlord on a plane to The Hague within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the international war crimes court could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudan dismisses the ICC charges, says reports of mass killings in Darfur have been exaggerated, and refuses to recognize the court which it says is part of a Western plot against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. CRITICISM DISMISSED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The foreign ministry took the necessary measure to obtain a visa for the president of the republic and his delegation," the Sudanese ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said Bashir planned to meet several African leaders on the sideline of the U.N. session in New York, where debates start next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry dismissed criticism of the application from U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. government is not qualified morally, politically or legally to give any lessons or recommendations respecting international law or human rights," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. was obliged to grant a visa under the 1947 U.N. Headquarters Agreement establishing the world body's base in New York, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudan's visa request comes at a time of rising African hostility to the ICC due to a perception that prosecutors disproportionately target African leaders, a charge the ICC denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainly non-Arab tribes took up arms in Darfur in 2003 against the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum, complaining of neglect and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflict has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced about 2 million, according to human rights groups and U.N. officials. Sudan says the numbers are overblown. The ICC issued arrest warrants against Bashir in 2009 and 2010 to face charges of orchestrating war crimes and genocide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ulf Laessing; Additional reporting by Thomas Escritt in The Hague; Writing by Tom Perry and Ulf Laessing; Editing by Andrew Heavens)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the largest U.S. bank is bracing for more legal and regulatory scrutiny in the coming weeks and months, but outlined a series of steps the company has taken to improve operations in a memo to employees on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
has increased its spending on control efforts by about $1
billion and added 3,000 employees this year alone to handle
mounting legal, risk and compliance issues, Chief Executive
Jamie Dimon said in a memo sent to employees on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who has come under pressure to improve the bank's
relationship with regulators, said he now personally meets with
bank examiners "on a regular basis" and held town hall meetings
in May and June for examiners from top U.S. regulators and staff
who regularly deal with those examiners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our control agenda is priority No. 1," Dimon said in the
memo, which was obtained by Reuters. He encouraged staff to
continue "facing our issues and rolling up our sleeves to fix
them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has come under fire since last year, when a large,
money-losing derivatives trade came to light, eventually costing
the bank more than $6 billion and leading to the indictment on
Monday of two ex-employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is also facing probes from the U.S. Department of
Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other
government agencies that are looking into subjects including
energy trading, possible bribery in hiring practices in China,
and possibly fraudulent sales of mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan said on Tuesday it had applied for a U.S. visa for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, despite the International Criminal Court arrest warrant out against him over charges of masterminding genocide and war crimes in Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudan's government said the visa would let the president attend the U.N.

			New England Patriots, New England Revolution, UnitedHealthcare to 
      Build Playground at Waltham Housing Authority&#8217;s Prospect Hill Terrace
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Hundreds of volunteers will build a 2,576-square-foot playground 
        in eight hours
			
			
				Playground is one of three UnitedHealthcare will build along the 
        East Coast in one day
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      More than 200 UnitedHealthcare employees, the New England Patriots 
      Charitable Foundation and the New England Revolution Charitable 
      Foundation will team up with Bentley University, Brandeis University and 
      the Waltham Housing Authority to build a new playground at Prospect Hill 
      Terrace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new 2,576-square-foot playground in Waltham will include a spiral 
      slide, monorail, rock-climber and many other components. The 
      playground&#8217;s design is based on drawings created by Waltham children who 
      participated in a &#8220;design day&#8221; event in July.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is one of three playgrounds UnitedHealthcare is building today as 
      part of its &#8220;Do Good. Live Well.&#8221; program, an employee-volunteer 
      initiative to help prevent obesity. Hundreds of UnitedHealthcare 
      volunteers will build other playgrounds Union Beach, N.J., and Dix 
      Hills, N.Y.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As we work with UnitedHealthcare on our fourth playground together, we 
      continue to build upon our mission of encouraging children to live 
      healthy lifestyles,&#8221; said Josh Kraft, president, New England Patriots 
      Charitable Foundation. &#8220;We hope the playground will enrich the lives of 
      children at Waltham&#8217;s Prospect Hill Terrace and demonstrate to all 
      involved the benefits of volunteering.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;UnitedHealthcare is a fantastic partner of the New England Revolution, 
      and we&#8217;re very excited to participate in its employee volunteer program 
      for this project,&#8221; said Brian Bilello, president, New England 
      Revolution. &#8220;We look forward to working together to construct a 
      playground that will help the children of Prospect Hill Terrace 
      participate in healthy activities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;UnitedHealthcare&#8217;s employee volunteers are honored to help build a 
      playground that will give local children a safe place to play and 
      exercise outdoors with their friends and family,&#8221; said Stephen Farrell, 
      president and CEO, UnitedHealthcare Employer  Individual of New England.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prospect Hill Terrace is the largest public housing development in 
      Waltham, with 144 units for low-income families. The new playground will 
      complement a new community center also being unveiled at Prospect Hill 
      Terrace. Bentley University and Brandeis University students will manage 
      the community center programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re happy this playground build is happening at the same time we&#8217;re 
      creating a new community center in Prospect Hill Terrace,&#8221; said Walter 
      McGuire, executive director, Waltham Housing Authority. &#8220;Its mission to 
      improve the lives of our residents and the greater Waltham community 
      through enriching and sustainable academic and social programs for 
      children, teenagers, and adults correlates well with this project.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The volunteers are working with KaBOOM!, a national nonprofit 
      organization dedicated to giving kids the childhood they deserve by 
      bringing play to those who need it most. The Waltham playground, one of 
      more than 150 such projects led by KaBOOM this year, will be the 12th 
      playground created by KaBOOM! and UnitedHealthcare.

&lt;p&gt;* Exxon mostly involved in offshore Libya drilling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Not clear if it will abandon Libya blocks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shell suspended Libya drilling last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lin Noueihed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil, the world's
largest publicly-traded energy company, said on Tuesday it would
cut back its staff and operations in Libya as growing
instability no longer justified a major presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is not a major investor in Libya's oil and gas
sector, Exxon's move highlights growing concern among
international oil companies that the returns on offer in Libya
may not justify the security and political risks that have grown
since the 2011 uprisings that swept the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The security and business situation means we can no longer
justify maintaining a large office presence in Libya,"
ExxonMobil spokesman Patrick McGinn told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not giving up on seeking to develop a business in
Libya. There are many ways in which ExxonMobil could add value
and we welcome discussion with Libya of any mutually beneficial
investment opportunities that may arise once the security
situation stabilizes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-based oil firm, which is mostly involved in
offshore exploration in Libya, declined to say how many staff
would leave or to give more details about its decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strikes by disgruntled workers, separatists and local
militia have all but paralysed Libya's oil exports over the past
two months, pushing up global crude oil prices and costing
Western companies such as Italy's Eni and U.S. Marathon
 hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil was one of several international oil companies
that scrambled to return to Libya after United Nations sanctions
imposed on Muammar Gaddafi's government over the 1988 Lockerbie
bombing were lifted in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In bidding rounds opening up territory that had been off
limits for years, oil companies accepted some of the industry's
tightest exploration and production terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTHERS WARY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC member Libya has reserves of over 40 billion barrels
but analysts have warned that some of the toughest terms in the
business, coupled with security concerns, could deter investors
and the oil minister said last year the country was seeking to
improve terms for foreign companies in the next round of bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011 following months of war and
sanctions but Libya's new rulers have struggled to impose their
authority in a country awash with guns and local militia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell suspended drilling and abandoned
exploration on two Libya blocks last year due to disappointing
results and other firms have postponed exploration due to
concerns about safety since the 2011 war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marathon is considering the sale of its stake in a key
Libyan oil consortium, sources told Reuters in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear if Exxon would abandon the blocks it won in
Libya as it scales back its presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, ExxonMobil was awarded a license to explore
Contract Area 44 offshore in the Cyrenaica Basin to the
resource-rich east of Libya, returning to the North African
country for the first time since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, ExxonMobil said it was planning to greatly
expand its operations in Africa and named Libya as one of the
promising new markets on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, it won licenses to explore in Contract Areas 20 and
21, in deep waters off the central Sirte Basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deepwater drilling began in 2009 but the following year,
Exxon announced that its well was not commercially viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya took the first steps towards restarting oil output
from some Western fields on Monday but production in the east of
the country remains largely offline.&lt;/p&gt;

        plan design and modeling, customer segmentation and targeting, call 
        planning, sales force sizing, territory alignments, and quota setting.

      &#8220;Erich is both a brilliant consultant who is well respected and an ideal 
      leader to grow Synygy&#8217;s consulting services group,&#8221; said Mark A. 
      Stiffler, Synygy&#8217;s CEO. &#8220;Synygy has a long history of being a trusted 
      sales performance advisor to large sales organizations beginning more 
      than twenty-two years ago and, with the moves we are making now, is 
      well-positioned to tackle the challenges facing our clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The appointment of Mr. Sachse is the latest in a series of planned and 
      completed executive personnel changes to cement Synygy&#8217;s position as a 
      leader in the development and delivery of high-value professional 
      services that improve the effectiveness and performance of sale 
      operations departments and selling organizations at the largest 
      companies throughout the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier in the year, Scott Cawood was promoted to President of 
      Professional Services. Last month, Synygy welcomed Sharon O'Shea to the 
      company as Vice President, Marketing. And this month, Arturo Bentin was 
      promoted to Vice President, Technology Enablement Services; John 
      Ristuccia was promoted to Vice President, Software Support Services; and

experimental injectable drug met the main and secondary goals of
a clinical study testing the product's safety and efficacy in
reducing double chin. Over 1,000 patients from the United States
and Canada were enrolled in two late-stage studies for
evaluating the drug against a placebo, Kythera said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** OUTERWALL INC, Monday close $55.97, down 20 pct
after market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operator of the Redbox video rental kiosks slashed its

outlook for the price and sales volume of potash and phosphate
on Monday, saying crop nutrient markets had softened in the wake
of the breakup of the Belarusian Potash Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakup of BPC in July and the decision by the main
player Uralkali OAO to pursue a volume-first strategy
weakened potash prices and caused some buyers to delay new
purchases because of uncertainty. BPC was one of the world's two
biggest potash trading companies, along with North America's
Canpotex Ltd - owned by Mosaic, Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc
 and Agrium Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CLEAN ENERGY FUELS CORP, Monday close $12.43, up

planes, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on
Tuesday, a decision that should end years of political wrangling
over ballooning costs and delays. The decision is a boost for
Lockheed Martin and Washington, which had urged the Netherlands
in April not to turn to other suppliers because of fears of
rising costs in a project that has been blighted by technical
faults and delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, Monday close $53.14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial services company is close to settling civil

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - In a dispute stemming from a lengthy legal battle over Amazon rain forest pollution, arbitrators ruled that Chevron had already settled claims for damages in agreements with Ecuador despite a $19 billion award against the oil company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international tribunal, acting under The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration, said in a ruling on Tuesday that Ecuador opted not to pursue damages beyond the country's 1995 and 1998 release agreements with Texaco - a company bought by Chevron in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those releases "also preclude any third person making a claim," according to the decision, which was made available on a Chevron website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is only the latest ruling in Chevron's favor by the three-person tribunal, which operates under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel ruled in February that Ecuador's government should have stopped plaintiffs in the case from going to courts in Brazil, Argentina and Canada to try to collect the $19 billion, awarded by an Ecuadorean court in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That judgment came 18 years after Texaco was first accused in a New York court of polluting the rain forest and sickening people there, for whom the lawsuit was filed. The case was later moved to Ecuador after Texaco sought such a transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chevron argues that evidence it uncovered through U.S. courts proves fraud by lawyers for the Ecuadorean plaintiffs, allegations the lawyers deny. The tribunal will consider those claims in a process due to begin in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company is pursuing racketeering and fraud charges against the lawyers for the Ecuadorean plaintiffs, in a case due to go to trial in New York next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company launched the international tribunal action in 2009, charging that Ecuador had breached a trade agreement with the United States by not ensuring a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ecuador's attorney general contends the tribunal has no jurisdiction because Quito's bilateral trade agreement with Washington took effect five years after Texaco ended operations in Ecuador in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, even sought to annul his country's investment protection treaty with the United States because of damages found against Ecuador - including $1.8 billion it was ordered to pay to Occidental Petroleum Corp for seizure of its assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ecuador attorney general's office did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. But just this week, Correa criticized Chevron on a visit in the Amazon town of Shushufindi, after visiting a field once operated by Texaco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not only did they cause this pollution to save a few dollars, but also they did not remediate it. They misled Ecuador and the world, they misled the residents and the Ecuadorean state," Correa told reporters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. fraud and racketeering case is Chevron Corp v. Steven Donziger et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-0691.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco and Alexandra Valencia in Quito; Editing by Kenneth Barry)&lt;/p&gt;

			The Coca-Cola Foundation Awards $1 Million Grant to 
      Army Historical Foundation&#8217;s Campaign to build National Museum of the 
      United States Army
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Grant used to help fund Museum&#8217;s Experiential Learning Center
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Coca-Cola Foundation, the philanthropic arm of The 
      Coca-Cola Company, awarded a $1 million grant to The Army Historical 
      Foundation to help build the National Museum of the United States Army&#8217;s 
      Experiential Learning Center, a
			unique state-of-the-art 
      interactive resource area featuring geography, science, technology, 
      engineering, and mathematics (G-STEM) educational programs for middle 
      and high school students. The National Army Museum will be constructed 
      at Fort Belvoir, Va. More than 750,000 visitors are expected to visit 
      the museum annually, including many families and school groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola&#8217;s iconic role as an important World War II morale 
      builder at home and throughout the European and Pacific theaters is 
      legendary,&#8221; said MG John P. Herrling (USA-Ret.), Executive Director of 
      the Museum&#8217;s capital campaign, in announcing the gift. &#8220;We appreciate The 
      Coca-Cola Foundation&#8217;s generosity as much today as the War 
      Department appreciated Coca-Cola&#8217;s wartime effort to ensure Coke 
      was accessible to our troops.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Experiential Learning Center (ELC) invites visitors to take part&#8212;and 
      be trained in&#8212;real-world Army simulations. Upon entering the ELC, 
      participants will be briefed on their mission, proceeding step-by-step 
      with virtual Army representatives to complete their task. Completion of 
      the mission will be followed by a debrief, evaluating participants&#8217; 
      actions throughout the operation. Though targeted primarily to students, 
      the simulations will include interactive components suitable for all age 
      groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;One of our Foundation priorities is to build sustainable communities 
      through unique education and enrichment opportunities,&#8221; said Lori George 
      Billingsley, Vice President, Community Relations, Coca-Cola North 
      America Group. &#8220;Through this grant to the National Museum of the United 
      States Army, we not only support an interactive learning experience, but 
      we continue to honor our nation&#8217;s heroes.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In awarding the grant, The Coca-Cola Foundation enjoys the 
      distinction of being the first non-defense-related organization entered 
      in the Museum&#8217;s Five-Star Circle of Distinction reserved for 
      donors of $1 million or more.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2004 PNC1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 16 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2004-PNC1 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates (JPMCC 2004-PNC1). A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are due to stable performance of the pool. Fitch 
      modeled losses of 2.3% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the 
      original pool balance total 6.2%, including $51.2 million (4.7% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 
      17 loans (13%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes one specially 
      serviced asset (1.7%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the September 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 35.2% to $711.1 million from $1.1 
      billion at issuance. Seventeen loans (30.4%) are currently defeased. 
      Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes H through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to Fitch's modeled losses is a 236 unit 
      multifamily property (0.9%) located in Arlington, TX. The most recent 
      occupancy reported by the master servicer is 62% as of March 2013 and 
      the property is not producing sufficient income to meet its debt service 
      obligations, although the loan remains current.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to expected losses is a 47,367 square 
      foot (sf) medical center (0.8%) located in Corona, CA. The property is 
      not producing sufficient income to meet its debt service obligations and 
      occupancy was 45% as of December 2012. Per a November inspection, the 
      third floor is damaged due to vandalism while occupied units remain in 
      good condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings on the class A-1A through E notes are expected to be stable 
      as the credit enhancement remains high. The class F and G notes may be 
      subject to further downgrades as losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$16 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$426.2 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$160.9 million class A-1A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$28.8 million class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$13.7 million class C at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$17.8 million class D at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11 million class E at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$16.5 million class F at 'CCCsf'; RE 100%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11 million class G at 'CCsf'; RE 95%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$9.2 million class H at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class J at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class K at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class L at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class M at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class N at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class P at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-1 and A-2 notes have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the 
      class NR notes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has previously withdrawn the rating on the interest-only class X 
      certificates.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Power market veteran Paul
Posoli has returned to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. after a
sabbatical to help advise on the bank's planned sale of its
commodities business, according to an internal bank memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posoli, who helped build a formidable gas and power trading
division at Bear Stearns before it was bought by JPMorgan, will
serve on the bank's management team in an advisory capacity. His
previous role running the global gas, power, coal and emissions
business will remain with John Anderson, the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His decision to return, in and of itself, is a vote of
confidence in the value of the business that we have built,"
according to the memo from global commodities chief Blythe
Masters, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Posoli is expected
to be part of the new entity's management team after the sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Sept. 18, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc) elected three new trustees to its ranks today: Richard Baptie, a Senior Vice President of Hathaway Dinwiddie and head of their Southern California office; Director and producer Tim Disney, a principal of Blu Homes; and urban strategist Enrique Pe&#241;alosa, formerly the mayor of Colombia's capital, Bogot&#225;.
			
	"SCI-Arc has extended the political reach and intellectual capacity of its board of trustees by adding Tim Disney, Richard Baptie, and Enrique Pe&#241;alosa to its board," said SCI-Arc Director Eric Owen Moss. "Disney brings a supportive interest in art and design along with expertise in housing pre-fabrication; Baptie is an alumnus and long-time advocate for architecture education, and a builder with a unique reputation for constructing large and complex urban projects; and Pe&#241;alosa brings an international political pedigree and an expertise in Latin American urbanism to the SCI-Arc community.&#160;Welcome all."
			
	SCI-Arc's Board is chaired by land-use attorney Jerry Neuman. It now includes 25 members, among them noted individuals such as Rick Carter, William Fain, Frank Gehry, Tom Gilmore, Thom Mayne, Kevin Ratner, and Ted Tanner.
			
	"As one of the highest ranked architectural institutions in the country and among the foremost thought leaders in the world in the areas of planning, design and the built environment, we believe it is important to have a Board that reflects that same stature," stated Neuman. "Dick, Tim and Enrique more than fit that bill, they personify it and I am proud to have them join the school as Trustees."
			
	The SCI-Arc trustees unanimously elected Baptie, Disney and Pe&#241;alosa to the board at their quarterly meeting held September 18th on the school's campus in downtown Los Angeles.
			
			Richard Baptie is a Senior Vice President and head of the Southern California office of Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company. He is currently the Principal-in-Charge of the Emerson College construction project in Hollywood and a large office complex for an entertainment company in Glendale, among other duties. He has been involved as a leader in many notable projects in Southern California including The Getty Center, The Reagan Library Air Force One Pavilion and the 2000 Avenue of the Stars project. Baptie joined Hathaway Dinwiddie in 1985, having studied Architecture at SCI-Arc. He received his Bachelor's Degree in Economics from California State University, Los Angeles. Involved in the community, Baptie is on the Board of Directors of the Los Angeles Business Council, The Kidspace Museum, past President of the USC Architectural Guild and has served on the capital campaigns for the Music Center and the Downtown YMCA.
			
			Tim Disney has written, directed or produced 15 feature films, documentaries, and television programs. From 1992 &#8211; 2000, he served as Chairman and CEO of Virtual World Entertainment, a leading developer and operator of 3D gaming and simulation technology. Disney was a founding investor and currently serves on the Board of Directors of Blu Homes Inc., the leading manufacturer of green pre-fab housing. He also serves as President of The Rowena Group, a private investment firm, and as a Director of Shamrock Capital Advisors, a leading private equity investor in the fields of media, entertainment, and communications. A graduate of Harvard University with a degree in Fine Arts, Disney serves as a Trustee of California Institute of the Arts. He co-founded the international aid organization World Connect, and serves on the Board of several other charitable organizations.
			
			Enrique Pe&#241;alosa is an urban strategist whose vision and proposals have significantly influenced policies in numerous cities throughout the world. He currently is President of the Board of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy of New York. As Mayor of Colombia's capital city of Bogot&#225; from 1998 to 2001, Pe&#241;alosa profoundly transformed the city, turning it into an international example for improvements in quality of life, public spaces, mobility and equity. He implemented a model giving priority to children and public spaces and restricting private car use, building schools and libraries in the poorest neighborhoods, as well as adding hundreds of miles of protected bicycle paths, sidewalks, pedestrian streets, bicycle highways, greenways, and parks. Pe&#241;alosa has lectured all over the world in governmental, academic and citizens' forums, and his ideas have been featured in many of the world's most important media.

			The JPMorgan Chase Foundation and the Cities for Financial 
      Empowerment Fund Announce Major Nationwide Effort in Support of 
      Under-Banked Households
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			$1.15 million grant will advance a unified approach to helping 
      low-income individuals across the country access safe banking 
      opportunities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The JPMorgan Chase Foundation and Cities for Financial Empowerment (CFE) 
      Fund today announced the creation of Bank On 2.0, a new effort to 
      create a unified, national approach to delivering safe, affordable 
      banking products and services to low-income and under-banked people 
      through municipal programs across the country. The CFE Fund&#8217;s mission is 
      to help cities design financial empowerment strategies and embed them 
      into local government programs to improve the financial capability of 
      low- and moderate-income households. The JPMorgan Chase Foundation&#8217;s 
      $1.15 million seed funding commitment is a two-year grant that will 
      complement the CFE Fund's raising of matching funds from other partner 
      organizations, including other financial institutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bank On 2.0 will build on the grassroots success of a wide array 
      of Bank On and related banking access programs in cities across the 
      country, like San Francisco and Seattle. Bank On programs have already 
      connected tens of thousands of under-banked people to safe and 
      affordable financial products at institutions, ranging from local 
      community banks to global financial institutions. Bank On 2.0 
      will identify best practices and build a national, evidence-based 
      strategy that will help people, who might otherwise be subject to costly 
      alternative financial services, access basic, safe, and affordable bank 
      services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ultimate goal is to create a national approach and infrastructure 
      that includes products, services, best practices, resources and other 
      technical assistance that will facilitate local municipal efforts to 
      connect unbanked and under-banked residents to safe and affordable 
      mainstream banking services. By developing comprehensive, proven models, Bank 
      On 2.0 will help individuals successfully navigate the financial 
      system, enhancing their ability to build savings, assets and reach 
      overall financial stability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Thirty-five million people are managing their finances largely outside 
      the financial mainstream, having to rely upon costly, fringe products 
      and services to cash their paychecks and pay their bills. This makes it 
      practically impossible to stabilize their family finances, let alone 
      build their futures,&#8221; said Jonathan Mintz, President of the CFE 
      Fund and Co-Chair of the Cities for Financial Empowerment Coalition. 
      &#8220;With JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s tremendous support, and learning from a diverse 
      and committed group of practitioners and funders, we will bring 
      municipal banking access programs to their full national potential to 
      address this significant and compelling challenge.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Janis Bowdler, Managing Director, Consumer Financial Empowerment 
      and Affordable Housing, JPMorgan Chase Foundation, said, &#8220;Expanding 
      access to the banking system is critical to helping people improve their 
      financial stability and economic security. We are excited to work with 
      leaders across the U.S. to identify and scale solutions that work to 
      help low-and moderate-income families make sound financial decisions and 
      build their assets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cities have worked on a number of local strategies and partnerships to 
      increase access to banking products and services. However, research has 
      shown that in order to reach scale and enhance impact, elements of the 
      Bank On programs need to be standardized and best practices should be 
      identified and replicated. In addition, many cities have had successful 
      results in pilot programs that match safe bank accounts with regular 
      flows of public money, such as subsidized job programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am incredibly proud of what has been achieved thus far through the 
      Bank On movement, and I am excited that we have this opportunity to 
      expand safe banking opportunities for the millions of people that remain 
      in need,&#8221; said Jos&#233; Cisneros, Treasurer for the City and County 
      of San Francisco and Co-Chair of the Cities for Financial Empowerment 
      Coalition. &#8220;When we created Bank On San Francisco, we proved that with 
      the right products and municipal outreach, unbanked individuals and 
      families can succeed in the financial mainstream and avoid using 
      predatory check cashers and payday lenders. Bank On 2.0 will 
      allow the CFE Fund to design and test strategies that expand the 
      integration of financial access into municipal programs across the 
      country.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Cities are uniquely able to wield programs, resources, and local 
      politics to achieve large-scale victories for their residents in need of 
      greater financial stability,&#8221; added Mintz, who also serves as Mayor 
      Michael R. Bloomberg&#8217;s Commissioner of the New York City Department of 
      Consumer Affairs. &#8220;But cities could not achieve these accomplishments 
      without the close cooperation of private supporters of municipal 
      efforts, federal partners looking for real impact on the ground, and the 
      many innovative city administrations determined to make a difference.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other key stakeholders in Bank On 2.0 will include local, 
      regional, and global financial institutions; federal agencies and 
      regulators; national nonprofit and advocacy organizations; faith-based 
      organizations; and the twelve CFE Coalition cities, which represent more 
      than 19 million people.

      The CFE Fund supports municipal efforts to improve the financial 
      stability of households by leveraging opportunities unique to local 
      government. By translating cutting edge experience with large scale 
      programs, research, and policy in cities of all sizes, the CFE Fund 
      assists mayors and other local leaders to identify, develop, fund, 
      implement, and research pilots and programs that help families build

			International Arbitration Tribunal Finds Chevron Not Liable for 
      Environmental Claims in Ecuador
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An international arbitration tribunal yesterday issued a Partial 
      Award in favor of Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and its subsidiary, Texaco 
      Petroleum Company (TexPet). The Tribunal found that the Settlement and 
      Release Agreements that the government of Ecuador entered into with 
      TexPet released TexPet and its affiliates of any liability for all 
      public interest or collective environmental claims. The Lago Agrio 
      plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers have repeatedly admitted, and the relief in the Lago 
      Agrio judgment makes clear, that their claims are exclusively collective 
      and not individual. The arbitration stems from the government of 
      Ecuador&#8217;s interference in the ongoing environmental lawsuit against the 
      company and its courts&#8217; failure to administer justice in a trial that 
      has been marred by multiple instances of fraud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The game is up. This award&#160;by an eminent international 
      tribunal&#160;confirms that the fraudulent claims against Chevron should not 
      have been brought in the first place. It is now beyond question that 
      efforts by American plaintiffs lawyers and the government of Ecuador to 
      enforce this fraudulent judgment violate Ecuadorian, U.S., and 
      international law," said Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice president and general 
      counsel. &#8220;Continuing to support this fraud only increases the government 
      of Ecuador's growing liability to Chevron and we urge Ecuador to 
      reconsider its position and pursue a more responsible course."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Convened under the authority of the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment 
      Treaty and administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The 
      Hague, the Tribunal found that the Settlement and Release Agreements 
      that the Government of Ecuador entered into with TexPet in 1995 and 1998 
      released TexPet and its affiliates of any liability for all public 
      interest or collective environmental claims. In its decision, the 
      Tribunal found that: 1) Chevron and TexPet are &#8220;Releasees&#8221; under the 
      1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release; 2) Chevron can 
      invoke and enforce its contractual rights as a Releasee; and 3) the 
      Government settled all public interest or collective environmental 
      claims, including collective claims asserted by third parties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This Award comes after the Tribunal&#8217;s February 2013 finding 
      that Ecuador is in breach of its obligation to &#8220;take all measures 
      necessary to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement&#8221; of the 
      Lago Agrio judgment&#8212;an obligation 
      that the Tribunal had imposed on Ecuador in 2011, and reinforced 
      and expanded in 2012, but which Ecuador has continuously ignored. In prior 
      rulings, the Tribunal put the Republic of Ecuador on notice that if 
      Chevron&#8217;s arbitration ultimately prevails, &#8220;any loss arising from the 
      enforcement of (the judgment) may be losses for which the (Republic) 
      would be responsible to (Chevron) under international law.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next arbitration hearing regarding the collusion between the 
      Ecuadorian courts and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and their lawyers is 
      scheduled for January 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron filed the international 
      arbitration claim against the government of Ecuador on September 23, 
      2009, claiming violations of Ecuador&#8217;s obligations under the United 
      States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty, investment agreements, and 
      international law. Chevron&#8217;s subsidiary, TexPet, participated until 1992 
      as a minority member of a consortium that explored for and produced oil 
      under contracts with Ecuador and Ecuador's government-owned oil company, 
      Petroecuador. Through the arbitration, Chevron seeks to hold Ecuador 
      accountable for the denial of justice that occurred through the Lago 
      Agrio court&#8217;s actions during the litigation and the issuance of the 
      fraudulent $19 billion judgment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Open 
      Networking Foundation (ONF), a non-profit organization dedicated to 
      accelerating the adoption of open Software-Defined Networking (SDN), 
      today announced that it will co-host the second J.P. 
      Morgan SDN Forum with J.P. Morgan Equity Research analyst Rod Hall 
      on Sept. 25 at the Sheraton Palo Alto Hotel located in Palo Alto, Calif.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The J.P. Morgan SDN Forum provides a venue for networking companies to 
      join together and discuss SDN trends and the potential for SDN to change 
      the competitive landscape of networking. The event program consists of 
      both panel discussions and presentations from networking companies and 
      venture capitalists.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;SDN and its underlying technologies offer a disruptive approach to 
      networking, and we&#8217;re excited to co-host an event with J.P. Morgan that 
      brings together companies and key influencers helping to shape the SDN 
      movement,&#8221; said Dan Pitt, executive director of the Open Networking 
      Foundation. &#8220;Without collaborative opportunities to discuss trends, 
      innovation, and end-user requirements, the commercialization and global 
      deployment of SDN would prove difficult. It is ONF&#8217;s mission to 
      accelerate the adoption of open SDN, and we will continue to do so 
      through a wide gamut of initiatives and activities that promote open SDN 
      technologies and standards.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A panel comprised primarily of newer, innovative companies involved in 
      the SDN movement will be moderated by ONF&#8217;s silicon SDN expert Martin 
      Izzard on Sept. 25 at 9:15 a.m. Titled &#8220;The Place of Silicon in SDN,&#8221; 
      this panel will examine the degree to which silicon and existing 
      networking systems can and will support SDN, as well as silicon&#8217;s future 
      market role. Panelists include:

      implementation, and deployment of open SDN and the OpenFlow&#8482; protocol. 
      ONF encourages innovation in the SDN space through a variety of 
      opportunities and activities including the drafting of implementable

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has made an impassioned plea to investors to support his vision of the world's largest software company as a unified devices and services powerhouse in his swan song before Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who in August said he planned to step down within 12 months, told investors and analysts in an annual meeting on Thursday that Microsoft had a bright future, despite missteps under his 13-year tenure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have the tools. There's economic upside here. In the long run, we are almost uniquely poised to seize the opportunity," he said, in a typically high-volume presentation. "Today I'm speaking as an investor. You all own Microsoft stock, cheer for it, for God's sake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who took over from co-founder Bill Gates as CEO in 2000, did acknowledge that under his leadership the company was too focused on Windows to realize that Apple Inc's iPhone was revolutionizing computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there's one thing I regret, there was a period in the early 2000s when we were so focused on what we had to do around Windows that we weren't able to redeploy talent to the new device form factor called the phone," said Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After losing ground to Apple and Google Inc in mobile and internet arenas for the last 10 years, Ballmer in July launched an ambitious reorganization focused on "devices and services." He announced his retirement only six weeks later amid pressure from some discontented shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said the top layers of that reorganization had taken effect, but the new functionally organized groups were at different stages in working out exactly how they will be structured. The company had no comments on the progress of the board's search for a new CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really was a fundamental shift from running a set of separate business units where we tried to make connection points to running a company that is essentially one integrated entity," said Ballmer, attempting to explain his vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During four hours of presentations, which were interrupted for about half an hour due to a power cut, Microsoft executives expanded on Ballmer's idea, explaining how the company would continue its push into making its own hardware - following the deal to buy phone maker Nokia - and would stress services rather than products, while keeping individual consumers in mind rather than chiefly concentrating on businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi Lu, the executive in charge of applications and services, hinted that Microsoft's popular Office suite of applications would at some point be available on the iPad, a market that one analyst put at $2.5 billion a year. He said Microsoft was currently working on "touch first" versions - as opposed to traditional keyboard and mouse versions - of core Office applications such as Outlook, Word and Excel which would at some point feature on devices running Windows, and would be available on other platforms when they were ready and "financially sensible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood explained that Microsoft would start reporting quarterly financial data in five new blocks based around themes rather than products such as Windows or Office. Hood said the new reporting structure - which essentially separates consumer and commercial business, and then divides revenue streams between hardware and software licensing - would begin at its next earnings in October, and was aimed at giving more insight into the company's economic approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer closed the presentations, in Bellevue, Washington, on an optimistic note as he prepared to transition from CEO to an interested bystander who owns 4 percent of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company needs to produce every day. We've got a little headwind but we've got plenty of upside," he said. "The ultimate measure of a place has got to be what happens with profits. As a shareholder I will hold us accountable for continuing to focus in on good short-term results and at the same time making investments that give us an opportunity to generate someday another $10, $15, $20, $25 billion of incremental profit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby and Edwin Chan; Editing by Gary Hill and Christopher Cushing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's planned auction of its biggest-ever oil discovery attracted only a quarter of the interest expected by the government after many of the large, wealthy oil companies with experience in the region declined to sign up for the sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), BP Plc (BP.L), BG Group Plc (BG.L), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and other investor-owned oil companies choosing to stay away, Asian state-owned companies, such as India's Oil &amp; National Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC.NS), Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional, or Petronas PETR.UL, and China's CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK), dominate the list of 11 companies that agreed to pay the 2.05 million real ($931,818) registration fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magda Chambriard, head of Brazilian petroleum regulator ANP, said on Thursday that she had expected "more than 40" companies to bid for Libra, which holds an estimated 8 billion to 12 billion barrels of oil, enough to supply all world oil demand for three to five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a surprise, the area is extremely promising and there are not any opportunities in the world like this," said Paulo Roberto da Costa, an oil industry consultant and former head of refining at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras (PETR4.SA), Brazil's state-run oil company. "I expected a much larger number because of its potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale will be Brazil's first under a 2010 production-sharing law that sought to strengthen the Brazilian government's control over substantial new offshore oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Brazil also finding it hard to attract private investment in highway, port, rail and airport projects, the lower-than-expected interest could revive criticism that the Workers' Party-led government of Dilma Rousseff is unsympathetic to the needs of investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rights to explore for and produce oil from the area will be given to the company or group that offers the largest share of output to the government for sale on its own account. Petrobras will also have to take a minimum 30 percent stake in any winning group, and the law requires that Petrobras run exploration and production in the area as Libra's operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some suggest the new rules and Petrobras' slower-than-expected development of other big fields nearby are to blame for the lukewarm interest. Others voiced concerns that the area might not be as promising as billed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that companies with important production in the area didn't even sign up for the auction says to me that not everyone is convinced that Libra will live up to its potential," said Wagner Freire, a Rio de Janeiro geologist, oil industry consultant and former head of geophysics at Petrobras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon and the others staying out is also a comment on Petrobras," he added. "Strategically, I don't think they want the trouble of dealing with Petrobras and the government. You can get good oil assets elsewhere without that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNINGS COME TRUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the rules were changed in 2010, many oil industry experts said the production-sharing model would reduce interest in Brazil's "subsalt" province, an area in the Campos and Santos basins where new fields were being discovered beneath thousands of meters of water, sub-sea rock and an ancient layer of salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction will also require that the government get about 75 percent of the oil produced after costs are recovered. That means that Brent crude must remain at about $110 a barrel for Libra to make money, said Enrique Sira, senior director of research at IHS CERA told Reuters in Houston. Brent closed at $108.82 a barrel on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local content rules requiring most equipment and services to be built or sourced in Brazil will also increase costs and delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Libra is a great opportunity, but also a big challenge," Sira said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Rodrigo Viga Gaier and Jeb Blount&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Brazil's planned auction
of its biggest-ever oil discovery attracted only a quarter of
the interest expected by the government after many of the large,
wealthy oil companies with experience in the region declined to
sign up for the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Exxon Mobil Corp, BP Plc, BG Group Plc
, Chevron Corp and other investor-owned oil
companies choosing to stay away, Asian state-owned companies,
such as India's Oil &amp; National Gas Corp Ltd,
Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional, or Petronas, and
China's CNOOC Ltd, dominate the list of 11 companies
that agreed to pay the 2.05 million real ($931,818) registration
fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magda Chambriard, head of Brazilian petroleum regulator ANP,
said on Thursday that she had expected "more than 40" companies
to bid for Libra, which holds an estimated 8 billion to 12
billion barrels of oil, enough to supply all world oil demand
for three to five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a surprise, the area is extremely promising and
there are not any opportunities in the world like this," said
Paulo Roberto da Costa, an oil industry consultant and former
head of refining at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras
, Brazil's state-run oil company. "I expected a much
larger number because of its potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale will be Brazil's first under a 2010
production-sharing law that sought to strengthen the Brazilian
government's control over substantial new offshore oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Brazil also finding it hard to attract private
investment in highway, port, rail and airport projects, the
lower-than-expected interest could revive criticism that the
Workers' Party-led government of Dilma Rousseff is unsympathetic
to the needs of investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rights to explore for and produce oil from the area will be
given to the company or group that offers the largest share of
output to the government for sale on its own account. Petrobras
will also have to take a minimum 30 percent stake in any winning
group, and the law requires that Petrobras run exploration and
production in the area as Libra's operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some suggest the new rules and Petrobras'
slower-than-expected development of other big fields nearby are
to blame for the lukewarm interest. Others voiced concerns that
the area might not be as promising as billed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that companies with important production in the
area didn't even sign up for the auction says to me that not
everyone is convinced that Libra will live up to its potential,"
said Wagner Freire, a Rio de Janeiro geologist, oil industry
consultant and former head of geophysics at Petrobras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon and the others staying out is also a comment on
Petrobras," he added. "Strategically, I don't think they want
the trouble of dealing with Petrobras and the government. You
can get good oil assets elsewhere without that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNINGS COME TRUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the rules were changed in 2010, many oil industry
experts said the production-sharing model would reduce interest
in Brazil's "subsalt" province, an area in the Campos and Santos
basins where new fields were being discovered beneath thousands
of meters of water, sub-sea rock and an ancient layer of salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction will also require that the government get about
75 percent of the oil produced after costs are recovered. That
means that Brent crude must remain at about $110 a
barrel for Libra to make money, said Enrique Sira, senior
director of research at IHS CERA told Reuters in Houston. Brent
closed at $108.82 a barrel on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local content rules requiring most equipment and services to
be built or sourced in Brazil will also increase costs and
delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Libra is a great opportunity, but also a big challenge,"
Sira said. "Local content requirements, costs structure,
Brazilian exploration and production industry structure and
regulation could substantially diminish its value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low growth and high inflation in Brazil could also hurt, he
said, adding that they expect Brazilian oil industry costs to
rise at more than double the world average by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the rules were released for the Libra auction, more
than 200 requests for changes were made and turned down by
Chambriard, who said the area's size and potential meant that
the government could charge almost whatever it wanted for the
rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Libra is beyond any possible comparison nowadays to other
fields," she said during an August trip to Houston to promote
the auction. "If companies participate, it is because they see
potential value. This is the biggest auction in 30 to 40 years
around the globe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil, which expects to get about $400 billion in royalties
and other taxes from Libra over 30 years, sees the new rules,
which apply to all new development in the Campos and Santos
basins near Rio de Janeiro, as a way to gain more control over
natural resources and finance improvements in health care and
education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil rights in the rest of Brazil will continue to be sold on
a concession basis, where oil companies own all the output, but
pay a royalty of at least 10 percent on everything produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The registered bidders include five state-led or state-owned
oil companies: Petrobras, India's Oil &amp; National Gas Co,
Malaysia's Petronas, Colombia's Ecopetrol SA, China's
CNOOC and China National Petroleum Corp, the ANP said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sixth state-owned company, China's Sinopec,
will take part through its minority joint ventures with the
Brazilian units of Spain's Repsol SA and Portugal's
Galp Energia SGPS SA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-state-owned companies are Japanese trading company
Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd, France's Total SA and
Anglo-Dutch oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the companies that have signed up, only three, Repsol,

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - It's $1 billion in payouts that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co most likely wants to forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In agreements with regulators totaling $1 billion and made public on Thursday, the nation's biggest bank settled four civil investigations into its "London Whale" trading scandal and two more into the wrongful billing of credit-card customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals, which involve five authorities from the United States and one from the UK, are a milestone in the company's push to clean up its legal affairs but leave JPMorgan exposed to additional costs and embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank still faces criminal probes into the trading scandal, its conduct during an energy trading investigation, sales of mortgage securities in the United States and possible bribery in China. Investigators are also looking into its role in setting benchmark interest rates known as LIBOR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlements include $920 million of penalties for JPMorgan's London Whale trading scandal, which Chief Executive Jamie Dimon at first dismissed as a "tempest in a teapot" and ultimately resulted in $6.2 billion in losses. The deals included an admission of wrongdoing, which has been rare in past settlements made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second set of settlements includes $80 million of payments for billing of credit-card customers for identity-theft protection services that they did not receive. The deals, made with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, come after the company issued $309 million of refunds to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Comptroller of the Currency also on Thursday ordered JPMorgan to improve its consumer debt-collection practices. That order did not include financial penalties and involved allegations made public more than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London Whale deals, reached with the UK's Financial Conduct Authority and the U.S. Federal Reserve, SEC and Comptroller of the Currency, resolve the biggest civil probes into the trading debacle. The deals include citations against JPMorgan for poor risk controls and failure to inform regulators about deficiencies in risk management identified by bank management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal took on the London Whale nickname that hedge funds had given to Bruno Iksil, a trader at JPMorgan's Chief Investment Office in London, for the enormous size of the positions he took for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADMITTING THE FACTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By coordinating the announcements, the regulators delivered a round $1 billion punishment in a single day. Regulators have been criticized by lawmakers and the public for not bringing more cases or sending Wall Street executives to jail for financial crisis-era misdeeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal follows a decision by the SEC to allow fewer firms to settle without admitting or denying the facts of cases. In August, the SEC reached a settlement with hedge fund manager Philip Falcone, its first big case to include an admission of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But George Canellos, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division, cautioned in a statement that officials will not demand admissions in all future settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon and other JPMorgan executives had already admitted mistakes in the Whale debacle. Starting the day Dimon disclosed in May 2012 that the Whale trades were losing billions of dollars, he has apologized for the "tempest in a teapot" remark. He also testified before Congress that bank was "stupid" in handling the trades at its Chief Investment Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enforcement actions left some people dissatisfied because they did not blame any individuals specifically for wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, issued a statement pointing out that his panel had found that "senior bank executives made a series of inaccurate statements." He said there is still time for other civil and criminal investigations to hold people accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at Clarke Silverglate in Miami, said, "Somebody else has to answer for this conduct rather than just paying money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has said that JPMorgan executives did not intend to mislead anyone about the Whale losses, which the bank concluded were initially understated by its traders. Two traders have been indicted on conspiracy and fraud charges and Iksil has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, in a statement issued by the company on Thursday, said, "We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Dimon told shareholders that fixing risk controls had become bank's top priority and that some projects aimed at building the company's business had been put aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan called the Whale settlements "a major step in the firm's ongoing efforts to put these issues behind it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deals leave unresolved other issues that have helped drive the bank's legal costs to $5 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company continues to face a criminal probe by U.S. prosecutors into the London Whale scandal, despite Dimon's public insistence that no bank executives intentionally misled investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as JPMorgan was hailing the settlements, it said it had received a legal notice that the staff of another regulator, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, intends to recommend an enforcement action against the bank for its derivatives trading in the London Whale debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of Massachusetts is also investigating, the bank said. And, despite the Comptroller of the Currency's order on debt collections, a group of 13 states is investigating those practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are seeing the regulators ratchet up the heat on the banks," said analyst Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. "If you are too big to manage, they are going to make you pay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has been under intense scrutiny from the U.S. government since May 2012, when Dimon disclosed the mounting loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's civil penalties follow orders in January from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve directing JPMorgan to improve its risk control systems and step up its anti-money launder safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total penalties, which are among the highest ever paid by a bank, are well short of the $1.92 billion that London-based HSBC agreed to pay last year to settle money laundering charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fines are determined by laws governing the amount each agency can impose for each violation of a rule, and then are fine-tuned through negotiations between the regulators and the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Aruna Viswanatha and Emily Stephenson in Washington; Editing by Matthew Goldstein, John Wallace and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal
Reserve directing JPMorgan to improve its risk control systems
and step up its anti-money launder safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total penalties, which are among the highest ever paid
by a bank, are well short of the $1.92 billion that London-based
HSBC agreed to pay last year to settle money laundering
charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fines are determined by laws governing the amount each
agency can impose for each violation of a rule, and then are
fine-tuned through negotiations between the regulators and the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission was pretty darn pumped about its $200 million settlement Thursday with JPMorgan Chase, part of the banks $920 million resolution of regulatory claims stemming from losses in the notorious London Whale proprietary trading. And why not? As George Cannellos, the co-director of enforcement, said in a statement, JPMorgans $200 million civil penalty is one of the largest in SEC history. The agency also showed that its serious about its new policy of demanding admissions of liability from some defendants. For those of us accustomed to the SECs neither admit nor deny boilerplate, its startling to see the words publicly acknowledging that it violated the federal securities laws in an SEC settlement announcement. So lets permit Cannellos some chest-thumping: The SEC required JPMorgan to admit the facts in the SECs order  and acknowledge that it broke the law  because JPMorgans egregious breakdowns in controls and governance put its millions of shareholders at risk and resulted in inaccurate public filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the SEC changed its policy in June, enforcement officials had insisted that defendants wouldnt settle with the agency if they had to admit liability because they feared the collateral consequences of their admissions in private shareholder class actions. JPMorgan is in the midst of fierce litigation with its shareholders, who claim the bank lied about its Chief Investment Office in public filings dating back to 2010. So you might assume that the banks SEC admissions seal their win, and now its just a matter of how big a check JPMorgan will have to write to settle the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you look closely at what JPMorgan actually admitted, youll see that the SEC settlement wont be of much use to shareholders in the class action. Dont misunderstand me: JPMorgan is extremely unlikely to escape from the private shareholder case without paying a lot of money. Thats not because of the SEC settlement, however. As Ill explain, the banks lawyers did a very good job of tailoring JPMorgans admissions to the SEC to minimize their impact in the class action. In fact, I suspect that future SEC defendants are going to look at the JPMorgan settlement as a model for how to quench regulators thirst for blood without spilling a drop in parallel shareholder litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the class action, which launched in June 2012, JPMorgan has all but conceded that CEO Jamie Dimon and CFO Douglas Braunstein misspoke when they brushed aside questions about London Whale Bruno Iksils losses in the CIO portfolio during an April 13, 2012, call with analysts. Dimon himself has since admitted that he was wrong to characterize the losses as a tempest in a teapot. JPMorgan has also already said in corrective filings with the SEC that its internal controls over the CIOs financial reporting were inadequate. So the big disputes in the shareholder case involve whether Dimon, Braunstein and other senior JPMorgan officials knowingly misrepresented London Whale losses and bank internal controls, and how far back their supposed deception goes. The time frame is of huge significance because it impacts the total losses shareholders can claim. Only shareholders who bought or sold stock during the class period are entitled to damages; in a longer class period, JPMorgan is exposed to more claimants and bigger damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholder lawyers from Bernstein Litowitz Berger  Grossmann, Grant  Eisenhofer, and Kessler Topaz Meltzer  Check contend that the bank began deceiving shareholders about under-supervised, high-risk proprietary trading by CIO officials as long ago as February 2010, in its public account of the purpose and activities of the office. According to shareholders, every filing thereafter that described the CIOs careful hedging trades and JPMorgans exemplary internal controls was a lie. The class has cited reports on JPMorgans proprietary trading by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a Senate subcommittee to argue that Dimon, Braunstein and former CIO chief Ina Drew knew or should have known that their public statements about the office and its trades were false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgans lawyers at Sullivan  Cromwell, meanwhile, are trying to limit the class period to a mere month in 2012, from the April 13 teleconference with analysts to the banks corrective disclosure to the SEC on May 10. Theyve argued in a motion to dismiss the shareholder case that statements before 2012 arent false just because the CIO subsequently lost money. Even accepting plaintiffs inaccurate characterizations of those trades as bets or proprietary, allegations of a few trades over a multi-year period do not come close to supporting plaintiffs claim that the entire CIO  which managed hundreds of billions of dollars in assets for JPMorgan  functioned as a secret high-risk trading desk between 2010 and 2012, the bank asserted. Try as plaintiffs might to lengthen the putative class period by challenging all of JPMorgans quarterly SEC filings dating back to February 2010, this case is really about statements made in April 2012. And theres no evidence, according to JPMorgans filings in the class action, that Dimon or Braunstein deliberately deceived shareholders in those comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the SEC had extracted admissions that JPMorgan officials knowingly promulgated false statements or even that JPMorgan committed disclosure violations in SEC filings in 2010 or 2011, shareholder lawyers would be in a distinctly better position when they appear next Thursday before U.S. District Judge George Daniels of Manhattan to argue that their case should not be dismissed. But JPMorgan made no such concessions in its settlement with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the bank admitted only to making inaccurate statements in documents it filed with the SEC on April 13, 2012, and on May 10, 2012, in violation of Section 13 of the Exchange Act of 1934. Theres no admission about filings before the first quarter of 2012, so shareholders get no boost in their arguments for a longer class period. And Section 13 says nothing about the state of mind of the officials who certified the inaccurate statements. A Section 13 admission does not help shareholders prove that JPMorgan engaged in securities fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the SEC settlement can arguably be read to support JPMorgans contention in the class action that Dimon and Braunstein didnt knowingly mislead investors in April 2012. The consent order is full of juicy details about what the bank did to investigate the CIO in April and early May, including the failure of senior officials to keep the audit committee informed. The pre-2012 failure to detect CIO losses, however, arguably suggests that Dimon and Braunstein were insufficiently informed  rather than deceptive  when they spoke to analysts that April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, shareholder lawyers are going to do their best to trumpet JPMorgans admissions when Judge Daniels hears arguments next week on the banks motion to dismiss their class action. And obviously, JPMorgan would rather that it didnt have to concede that it violated securities laws. My point is simply that the banks admissions wont materially change the arguments either side can make at the class action hearing. JPMorgans SEC admission will in all likelihood not mean billions of dollars in increased exposure to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doomsday, in other words, has not yet arrived for defendants facing parallel SEC and private shareholder claims. Unless Judge Daniels proves me to be way off the mark, JPMorgan has shown that its possible to give the SEC an admission that will permit the agency to look tough without conceding much, if anything, in private litigation. Every case is different, of course, but Section 13 could be turn out to be a popular exit strategy for defendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Aruna Viswanatha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - U.S. bank regulators on
Thursday ordered JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to correct its debt
collection and other credit card procedures and to refund more
than $300 million to customers harmed by the bank's practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate orders, regulators faulted the largest U.S. bank
by assets for errors in how it pursued credit-card debts in
court, and for charging customers for credit-monitoring services
they never received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The orders, which include $80 million in penalties against
JPMorgan, came the same day the bank agreed to pay $920 million
in penalties to resolve the biggest civil probes of its "London
Whale" derivatives trading losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the settlements do not end the various investigations
of the bank, they allow JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to
resolve some of the multitude of legal issues weighing on his
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency ordered the bank to refund $309
million to about 2 million customers charged for the
credit-monitoring services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OCC also ordered the bank to review past debt
collections and compensate customers affected by errors. It did
not provide details of how extensive the debt-collection
problems were. That order did not include financial penalties,
but left the door open to future fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, JPMorgan said the collection issues affected
less than 1 percent of customers. It also said it stopped filing
collection lawsuits in 2011 and has not restarted them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate statement, the bank said it stopped enrolling
customers in credit-monitoring products in mid-2012, had
refunded affected customers, and will discontinue the products
by the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any mistakes like these are regrettable and we are
committed to ensuring our partners and vendors hold themselves
to the same high standards that our customers expect of us,"
Bill Wallace, who heads JPMorgan operations for consumer and
community banking, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the OCC's debt collection order, the bank is
required to review all related litigation, excluding home loans,
dating back to January 2009. A spokesman for the agency said the
affected borrowers number in the "hundreds of thousands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OCC also faulted the bank for its compliance with the

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Only 11 oil companies paid the fee required to qualify for a planned October 21 auction of Brazil's biggest ever oil discovery, the country's petroleum regulator said on Thursday, noting that almost four times that many companies had been expected to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep-pocketed international companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), BP Plc (BP.N) and BG Group Plc (BG.N) plan to stay away from bidding for the giant Libra offshore oil prospect near Rio de Janeiro, Magda Chambriard, head of Brazil's oil regulator ANP, told reporters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chambriard said she had expected more than 40 companies to bid for Libra, the first Brazilian area to be sold under a 2010 "production-sharing" law that requires investors in the area to give the Brazilian government a share of output to sell on its own account. BP and BG have large oilfield investments close to Libra, and Exxon failed to find oil nearby several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a surprise, the area is extremely promising and there are not any opportunities in the world like this," said Paulo Roberto da Costa, an oil industry consultant and former head of refining at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, Brazil's state-run oil company. "I expected a much larger number because of its potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's government, which expects to get $400 billion from Libra over 30 years, sees the new rules, which apply to all new development in the Campos and Santos basins near Rio de Janeiro, as a way to gain more control over natural resources and finance improvements in health care and education. ID: nE5N0F70FG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil rights in the rest of Brazil will continue to be sold on a concession basis, where oil companies own all the output, but pay a royalty of at least 10 percent on everything produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the production-sharing system Petrobras will have to take a minimum 30 percent stake in any winning group and direct the development of the area as the group's operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To secure a spot at the auction, companies were required to pay 2.05 million reais ($931,818) by the end of Wednesday. The payment also gives them bidding information. Companies that make offers will also have to provide additional financial guarantees before the auction. At previous auctions some companies that have paid the initial fee have later declined to make bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To buy the Libra rights, the winning company or group will have to pay at least 15 billion reais ($7.8 billion) up front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libra, with an estimated 8 billion to 12 billion barrels of recoverable oil, enough for three to five months of world consumption, is one of the largest oil prospects ever sold at auction. Libra is expected to produce 1 million barrels a day, half of Brazil's current output, within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Thursday, Chambriard said that at least 12 companies had paid the initial entry fee. The ANP press office said the actual number was 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANP is expected to publish a complete list of preliminary participants later on Thursday, the regulator's press office said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 2.20 Brazilian reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Roberto Samora; Writing by Jeb Blount; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Litigation over Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) role in the spectacular rise and fall of eToys Inc finally ended on Thursday with court approval of a $7.5 million settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online toy seller's IPO in 1999 became a poster child for the excesses of the dot-com bubble. The stock quadrupled when it began trading, but two years later the company was in bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was brought by creditors of eToys, who alleged that Goldman Sachs underpriced the stock to ensure a huge pop in price on the first day of trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The litigation slowly worked through multiple appeals in New York state courts but never went to trial. The two sides struck a settlement earlier this year, on the eve of arguments in New York's Court of Appeals to overturn a dismissal of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath, who is overseeing the company's Chapter 11 case in Wilmington, Delaware, approved the agreement, calling it a good result for creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She refused to seal the terms of the deal, as Goldman Sachs had sought. The investment bank claimed the settlement contained information that could be misused if made public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Trustee, the part of the Department of Justice that oversees bankruptcy cases, objected. "It's not the secret formula for Coca-Cola," Mark Kenney, a lawyer for the U.S. Trustee, said in court on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Waltrath ruled that the settlement would be made public, the terms of the deal were not immediately available. Lawyers taking part in a later hearing over fees in the case said the settlement was $7.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IPO OF eToys, at the time, was the fifth-biggest debut in history, giving a start-up with just $35 million in revenue a bigger market capitalization than Toys 'R' Us, which at the time had $11 billion in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creditors alleged the IPO enriched favored clients of the investment bank who had access to the stock at the IPO price of $20 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had the IPO been priced more closely to the $75 per share where it traded on the first day, eToys would have raised hundreds of millions of dollars more than it did, the creditors argued. Starved of capital, the company filed for bankruptcy when it was unable to build the warehouses needed to meet growing customer demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tom Hals; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp, BP Plc and BG Group Plc 
decided not to make bids for the giant offshore Libra oil
prospect that Brazil plans to auction on Oct. 21, Magda
Chambriard, head of Brazil's oil regulator ANP, said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions by the three international giants - two of
which, BP and BG, already have large investments in Brazil near
Libra - have helped frustrate Chambriard's expectation that more
than 40 companies would take part in the auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of yesterday's deadline, less than 40 companies had paid
the 2.05 million real ($931,818) fee to guarantee a spot at the
auction, Chambriard told reporters in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Thursday, Chambriard said that at least 12
companies had paid the initial entry fee. The ANP will publish a
complete list of preliminary participants on Thursday, the
regulator's press office said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANP said Libra holds 8 billion to 12 billion barrels of
recoverable oil, enough to supply all current world oil needs
for three to five months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - U.S. bank regulators ordered
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to improve its debt collection
practices, as the bank also agreed to pay $920 million in
penalties to resolve liabilities from its "London Whale"
derivatives trading losses last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order, made public on Thursday, addresses errors in how
the bank pursued credit-card debts in court, but does not
provide details of how extensive the problems were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
does not include financial penalties, and it allows JPMorgan
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to resolve another of the multitude
of legal issues weighing on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the action still leaves the door open for regulators to
fine the bank over the issue down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enforcement action requires the largest U.S. bank by
assets to review the accounts of customers affected by the
mistakes and compensate those borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is required to review all of its debt collection
litigation outside of home loans dating back to January 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OCC also faulted the bank for its compliance with the
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and ordered it to improve its
policies governing benefits for armed services members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That act allows members of the military to postpone or
suspend financial obligations such as outstanding credit card
debt payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had disclosed in August that it had expected the
action from the OCC, and said other regulators including the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were also investigating the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State enforcement authorities have also been investigating
the bank for its debt collection practices. In May, California's
attorney general sued JPMorgan and accused it of filing faulty
documents when seeking to collect on some credit card debt in
the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Rob Cox and Antony Currie
The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first rule in banking, even before know thy customer, is never aggravate your regulator. JPMorgan is usefully illustrating the importance of this dictum by paying through the nose for embarrassing the many agencies charged with overseeing the largest U.S. bank by assets. Though the many fines the firm is paying are unlikely to cost Chief Executive Jamie Dimon his job, they provide a useful lesson in the importance of hubris management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $700 million JPMorgan may disgorge this week to regulators over the &#8220;London Whale&#8221; trade is the rancid cherry on the cake that Dimon has baked with shareholders&#8217; flour and sugar &#8211; after chiding his overseers for years and then making them look stupid. A series of bad bets on illiquid securities by traders in the group&#8217;s chief investment office took a $6 billion bite out of JPMorgan&#8217;s revenue last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the existence of the trades made it look as though the bank&#8217;s regulators were dosing Ambien on the job. Indeed, rival banks puzzled every quarter over JPMorgan&#8217;s ability to squeeze out an extra $1 billion or so from its holdings of what were supposedly low-risk, liquid securities. That bank examiners holed up in JPMorgan&#8217;s offices missed this was mystifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding insult to embarrassment is Dimon&#8217;s propensity to lash out publicly at regulators. In June 2011, he publicly hectored Ben Bernanke on whether the Federal Reserve had properly conducted a cost-benefit analysis of financial reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as soon as JPMorgan slipped, and exposed its weaknesses as a risk manager, it was no surprise that the many Dimon-bruised regulators went on the warpath. With the current settlement, and another $2.5 billion JPMorgan may add to its legal reserves by December, the bank will have set aside some $21 billion in the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even pathetic Bank of America has racked up just $15 billion of litigation reserves since 2010. All else being equal, JPMorgan would have made an extra 21 percent in profit between 2010 and 2012, and would have boosted its 2012 return on equity to 13.5 percent from 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has run a far sturdier ship than his money-center rivals, once all the non-litigation losses from the crisis are folded in. But the mounting legal tab rather undermines any claims of propriety. It also suggests a simple lesson: don&#8217;t bite the hand that regulates.&lt;/p&gt;

			Comindware Brings Business Process Management Capabilities to 
      Microsoft Outlook Users
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New functionality in Comindware Tracker&#174; introduces advanced workflow 
      and process management tools into today&#8217;s most utilized collaboration 
      and messaging technology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Comindware, 
      a leading provider of adaptive business process management software, 
      today unveiled Comindware 
      Tasks for Outlook, an enhancement to its flagship product, 
      Comindware Tracker&#174;. Designed to bring robust business process 
      management (BPM) functionality into the Outlook environment, Comindware 
      Tasks for Outlook allows users to streamline day-to-day tasks, improve 
      productivity and increase project-based collaboration within Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Seeking to gain cross-company visibility and management control of 
      various processes, tasks and projects, organizations have historically 
      turned to consultants, custom business process solutions or costly, 
      complex software &#8211; all of which fail to deliver results. Comindware 
      Tracker was developed to address this need by providing flexible, 
      real-time visibility and adaptive control of unpredictable processes 
      happening within organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Many traditional BPM tools don&#8217;t support the workflow already in place 
      at an organization, and one of the biggest obstacles to process 
      management adoption and usage is changing employee behaviors and making 
      the solution easy to access and use,&#8221; said Max Tsypliaev, founder, 
      president and chief executive officer of Comindware. &#8220;Our new Microsoft 
      Outlook tool was designed to breakdown this barrier by allowing users to 
      stay within their Outlook environment to manage and execute business 
      processes. By leveraging a familiar user interface, Comindware Tasks for 
      Outlook helps organizations reduce the learning curve typically 
      associated with BPM technology so that organizations can quickly and 
      easily gain greater visibility and control.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given that Microsoft Outlook remains the most common work environment 
      for organizations around the world, Comindware Tasks for Outlook brings 
      this robust functionality to organizations&#8217; existing enterprise software 
      investments. With this updated functionality, Microsoft Outlook users 
      now can effectively incorporate adaptive BPM concepts into the system 
      with fast implementation and instant process setup.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Comindware Tracker with Outlook enhancements was designed to easily 
      adapt to an organization&#8217;s specific processes that require constant 
      adjustments. With its easy-to-use graphical workflow builder and 
      award-winning ElasticData technology, organizations striving to 
      streamline unpredictable processes are now able to update them in 
      real-time without redeployment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pricing  AvailabilityComindware Tracker with 
      Comindware Tasks for Outlook is available immediately. Pricing varies 
      based on deployment size.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 19 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co the biggest
U.S. bank, will pay approximately $920 million in penalties to
regulators in two countries to settle some of its potential
liabilities from its $6.2 billion London Whale derivatives loss

&lt;p&gt;The penalties include $300 million to the U.S. Office of the

$200 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and
137.6 million pounds ($219.74 million) to the United Kingdom's

cited for failing to tell its board of directors and regulators
about deficiencies in its risk management systems that had been
identified by management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			JP Energy Development LP Agrees to Acquire Wildcat Permian Services 
      LLC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JP Energy Development LP (&#8220;JP Energy&#8221;), an affiliate of JP 
      Energy Partners LP, has agreed to acquire all of the equity 
      interests in Wildcat Permian Services LLC (&#8220;Wildcat&#8221;) from Wildcat 
      Midstream Mesquite, LLC and Approach Midstream Holdings, LLC, an 
      affiliate of Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX). The transaction is 
      expected to close late in the third quarter or early in the fourth 
      quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wildcat owns and operates a long-term contracted oil pipeline system 
      consisting of approximately 50 miles of high-pressure, steel pipeline in 
      Crockett and Reagan Counties, Texas, with throughput capacity of 100,000 
      Bbls/d, truck terminals and LACT bay facilities, multiple receipt points 
      and 40,000 Bbls of crude oil storage. JP 
      Energy provides an integrated platform of crude oil gathering, 
      transportation and marketing services to producers and refiners in the 
      Mid-Continent area, and the acquisition of Wildcat will extend JP 
      Energy&#8217;s reach into the rapidly growing southern Midland Basin, and 
      will further diversify JP 
      Energy&#8217;s portfolio of transportation and storage assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In connection with the acquisition of Wildcat, JP 
      Energy and Approach will enter into a revised crude oil purchase 
      agreement under which JP 
      Energy will purchase and transport Approach&#8217;s crude oil production 
      from approximately 110,000 acres in Crockett and Schleicher Counties, 
      Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;JP Energy is excited to partner with Approach and to extend and 
      diversify our portfolio into the Permian Basin,&#8221; stated J. Patrick 
      Barley, JP Energy&#8217;s President and CEO. &#8220;Approach&#8217;s management team has a 
      proven track record of developing unconventional oil and gas properties 
      in formations like the prolific Wolfcamp shale oil play.&#8221;

			Research and Markets: Global Tablet OS Market 2013 Report Featuring 
      Apple, Google, Microsoft, And Others
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/5dft43/global_tablet_os) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Tablet OS Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global Tablet Operating System (Os) Market To Grow At A CAGR Of 35.2 
      Percent Over The Period 2012-2016
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with 
      inputs from industry experts. It covers the market in the Americas, and 
      the EMEA and APAC regions; it also covers the Global Tablet OS market 
      landscape and its growth prospects in the coming years. The report also 
      includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the researchers' team said: 
      One of the main trends witnessed in the Global Tablet OS market is the 
      increased RD spending by various vendors. The global tablet OS vendors 
      such as Apple and Google have already invested a considerable amount of 
      time and money in the RD departments for developing upgraded versions 
      of their operating systems. This is being done to provide better 
      functionality and a unique experience to the end-consumers. The RD 
      investments by these vendors have enabled them to capture a significant 
      market share and gain a competitive edge over the other vendors in the 
      Global Tablet OS market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main factors driving the market is 
      the increasing need for user-friendly platforms for tablets. With the 
      changing consumer behaviour and the increasing need for mobile 
      applications, the tablet OS vendors are focussing on developing a 
      platform that can be easily support browsing and can be easily accessed 
      by the end-users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges is the 
      preference for OS that supports free applications. Some of the existing 
      operating systems do not support free applications and therefore could 
      result in a shifting of consumer preference for other OS that suit their 
      requirements.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) retained its position as No. 1 investment bank by revenues for the first half of 2013 and took the top spot in all three categories: fixed income, equities and advisory, a survey showed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment bank revenues were $13.1 billion in the first half of 2013, putting it ahead of Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Citi (C.N), which all shared second place in analytics firm Coalition's league table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is being investigated over its multibillion-dollar "London Whale" derivatives losses in 2012 and is expected to announce a settlement with regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, as early as Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is also facing investigations by various government agencies that include possible bribery in hiring practices in China and potentially fraudulent mortgage securities sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remained in first place in fixed income commodities and currencies rankings, with revenues of $7.6 billion. Citi came in second, followed by Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It improved on its 2012 ranking to take the top spot in equities, alongside Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and UBS (UBSN.VX). Each earned $2.7 billion in revenue from their equities divisions in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advisory and origination, Bank of America joined JPMorgan as the top ranked investment bank with first half revenue of $2.8 billion. Goldman Sachs was third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Citi showed the most improvement year-on-year, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total investment banking revenues reached $86.8 billion in the first half, a slight increase from last year's figure of $85.5 billion, Coalition estimated last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm tracks the performance of the world's top 10 investment banks and says its study is based on public information from banks' results and independent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Clare Hutchison; Editing by Louise Ireland)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - A recent shouting match between senior bankers involved in Hong Kong's second-largest IPO so far this year illustrates the competitive squeeze on banks from Chinese companies offering incentives ahead of lucrative initial public offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a routine September 6 meeting of around 20 underwriters to China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co Ltd's (6863.HK) planned $1.3 billion IPO, tempers flared between two bankers from HSBC (HSBA.L) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N), said people who were at the meeting and others briefed on the incident. One said the row escalated to the point where the Goldman banker threatened to have his HSBC rival fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies are putting pressure on banks to woo so-called 'cornerstone' investors - big institutional names who agree to buy shares and hold them, thus boosting the offer's order book and profile. To better attract these investors, companies are increasing the incentives to banks that bring them in before the IPO, offering underwriters the promise of bigger financial rewards and more prominent roles on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the company issuing stock, creating competitive tension is meant to ensure banks earn their underwriting fees, particularly in a market where banks are starved for choice. But investment bankers say the tactic can backfire, and could further jeopardize an already fragile stock offering market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPO volumes in Hong Kong have nearly doubled since last year to $5.3 billion, but proceeds are well below the peaks of 2-3 years ago. Last year was Hong Kong's worst for new listings since the global financial crisis in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You get too many banks appointed on the transactions and the roles of these banks, and the economics, aren't really determined until a very late stage," said Philippe Espinasse, a former equity capital markets banker at both UBS and Nomura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What happens is you have a whole bunch of banks running around trying to get cornerstone orders without any coordination. They all come to the issuer saying: 'Look what we've got. We did more than the others.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers shouting at each other is hardly new, and for the Huishan IPO's four joint global coordinators - Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Goldman, HSBC and UBS (UBSN.VX) - there's as much as $39 million at stake in commissions and incentive fees, Thomson Reuters calculations show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the row to play out as and where it did is rare, said the people who were there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOO MUCH CREDIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue was the credit HSBC said it should earn for its efforts in the cornerstone process compared to the other banks, the people said, noting HSBC had played a significant role in bringing in notable investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, such credit can involve a bank being put in charge of investor meetings, a greater financial cut, or playing a lead role in the company's post-IPO stock trading. According to a person briefed on the meeting, tensions were building as bankers felt HSBC was seeking more credit than it deserved. Words were exchanged on the matter by the HSBC banker, prompting the Goldman outburst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second, more junior, HSBC banker joined in and, after further exchanges, she said: "Do you know who my father is? Do you know who my grandfather is?" That's the kind of talk normally associated with the many so-called 'princelings' employed in the financial industry, although one of those involved with the IPO said the banker does not have family ties to China's political elite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC and Goldman declined to comment. Neither of the bankers was available for comment. A spokeswoman for Huishan, which those familiar with the incident said was not present at the meeting, did not return calls and emails seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huishan on Thursday priced its offer at HK$2.67 per share, at the top of its marketing range, raising $1.3 billion in the second biggest Hong Kong IPO so far this year, said a person with direct knowledge of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When business is difficult and there aren't enough IPOs getting done, obviously it makes it all the more important for bankers to try and grab a piece of any action," said Espinasse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Denny Thomas; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infraware already dominates the market for office software applications on Android devices and says it now has a killer strategy to extend that domination to Apple Inc handsets as well by giving its best-selling Polaris app away for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contest between the $250 million Korean minnow and the $270 billion U.S. titan illustrates how small firms can outwit lumbering technology majors like Microsoft Corp, which has been criticized for being too slow to transfer its great advantage in office software to mobile platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we're trying to do is add cloud-based services and make the Polaris app seamlessly accessible through multiple devices, then offer it for free," Infraware chief executive Kwak Min-cheol told Reuters in an interview in Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at Microsoft, they earn over 15 trillion won ($13.8 billion) with Office products and they charge monthly usage fees...Our app has great compatibility with Office and it will come for free for many devices. I'm pretty confident this will have a major destructive impact on the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android users may not have noticed, but the app most of them use to read and create Microsoft Office files is not made by the U.S. firm that pioneered office software. It's made by the relatively unknown Korean firm headed by 38-year-old Kwak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global smartphone market is seen growing to nearly 1 billion units this year, with those operating on the Android system accounting for around 70 percent, according to analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infraware's Polaris Office app has become the most popular mobile office product since it launched in 2011, on the back of pre-installment deals with major Android carriers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, LG Electronics Inc and HTC Corp, which pay license fees to the Korean firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has logged 500 million unit sales so far, or about 5.4 copies every second worldwide. Installed on more than 60 percent of all Android devices, it is also one of the top-ranked business apps in the iTunes app store, selling for $12.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Infraware plans to offer a new, cloud-based version of Polaris for free across all platforms, throwing down the gauntlet to Microsoft's Office 365. Currently the only cloud-based office solution that works on all platforms from Windows desktop to Android and iPhone, Office 365 costs either $9.99 a month or $99.99 for an annual subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infraware's strategy for the free version of Polaris is to keep Microsoft at bay, protect its dominance of the Android office app market and enhance its brand recognition in the hope of making money from its other paid products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOBILE MICROSOFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Office 365 was on target to generate annual sales of $1.5 billion this year, and the versions for iPhone and Android made "great mobile companions" for the company's heavy-hitting desktop Office team of Word, Excel and PowerPoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Office 365 is the fastest growing product in Microsoft's history," the company told Reuters in a statement when asked if the firm was late to the mobile office market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committed to adding new, incremental value for Office 365 subscribers, and Office Mobile for iPhone and Android phones is only the latest example of that commitment in action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say Microsoft was slow to join the mobile revolution and its efforts to catch up with the Windows Phone and the Surface tablet have failed to take off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially working on the assumption that a native Office suite would be a great differentiator for its phones and tablets, Microsoft now seems to have abandoned that belief in regard to phones, if not tablets like the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst has suggested Microsoft is giving up $2.5 billion in Office revenue a year by not putting the software on iPad, amid an internal debate over how the Seattle-based company should structure its business in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One side wants the focus to be devices such as the Windows Phone, while the other says the goal should be to sell services such as Office on as many platforms as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not constrained by such dilemmas, Infraware's Kwak says the free Polaris Office Link app will be launched later this year in South Korea and early next year in other markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ON A ROLL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to support from Android manufacturers, Infraware's operating profit in the first half of this year nearly quadrupled to a record 9.5 billion won ($8.76 million) and margins expanded to 37 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares have doubled in the past 12 months, and the firm expects revenue to rise more than 20 percent this year. Three analysts rate Infraware's stock a "buy" or "strong buy", according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's not enough yet. With a software product that's this successful, I think it has to make much more money. I'm not satisfied yet," Kwak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backed by money he made developing software programs for IT firms during his college vacation, Kwak set up Infraware in 1997 with two interns. The firm hit the jackpot with Polaris after it bought a small document solution developer with 30 staff members for just 10 billion won in 2009. Infraware now employs 635 people, mainly engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Document solutions were the only missing part for us, as our main products at the time were mobile browsing and email solutions," Kwak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he's done gate-crashing the tech majors' office app party, Kwak intends to diversify into other services such as mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infraware's games portfolio already includes the popular sword-and-sandals role-playing game "Sefirah," and it plans to publish up to five new games around the end of the year, Kwak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another iron in the fire is Tizen-based smartphones, which run on a mobile operating system that Samsung and Intel Corp are co-developing to challenge Android. Infraware's Polaris app generator (PAG) promises to transform almost all Android apps and games to run on the Tizen handsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in SEATTLE; Editing by Stephen Coates)&lt;/p&gt;

			Vodafone Vierte Verwaltungs AG D&#252;sseldorf: Notification
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			NON-BINDING ENGLISH TRANSLATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On 30 July 2013, Vodafone Vierte Verwaltungs AG (formerly Vodafone 
      Vierte Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH), D&#252;sseldorf, Germany (the &#8220;Bidder&#8221;), 
      published the offer document (the &#8220;Offer Document&#8221;) for its 
      voluntary public takeover offer (the &#8220;Takeover
			Offer&#8221;) to 
      the shareholders of Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, Unterf&#246;hring, 
      Deutschland (&#8220;KDH&#8221;), to acquire all non-par value bearer shares 
      (ISIN DE000KD88880) in KDH (collectively the &#8220;KDH Shares&#8221; and 
      individually &#8220;KDH Share&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pursuant to Section 16 para. 2 sentence 1 of the German Securities 
      Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und &#220;bernahmegesetz 
      &#8211; &#8222;Wp&#220;G&#8220;) all shareholders of KDH that have not accepted the 
      Takeover Offer may still do so until 30 September 2013, 24:00 hrs (local 
      time at Frankfurt am Main) according to the provisions of the Offer 
      Document. Those KDH Shares for which the Takeover Offer has validly been 
      accepted are referred to as &#8220;Tendered KDH Shares&#8221;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			I. Notification regarding the fulfilment of all completion conditions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pursuant to Section 13.1 of the Offer Document the Takeover Offer and 
      the agreements which come into existence as a result of accepting the 
      Takeover Offer were subject to the completion conditions set out in 
      Sections 13.1.1 to 13.1.3. The last outstanding completion condition in 
      Section 13.1.1 of the Offer Document (Merger control clearance) has now 
      been fulfilled. On 20 September 2013, the transaction has been declared 
      compatible with the internal market in accordance with the EU Merger 
      Regulation by the EU-Commission. Thereby, all completion conditions of 
      the Takeover Offer are fulfilled.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			II. Termination of the stock exchange trading in Tendered KDH Shares
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The stock exchange trading in Tendered KDH Shares on the regulated 
      market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (cf. Section 11.8 of the Offer 
      Document) is expected to end after regular stock exchange trading hours 
      on 7 October 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			III. Settlement of the Takeover Offer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the settlement of the Takeover Offer Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, 
      Frankfurt am Main, as central settlement agent for the Takeover Offer, 
      has to transfer the offer consideration to the depository banks 
      simultaneously with transfer of title to the Tendered KDH Shares 
      pursuant to Section&#160;11.6 of the Offer Document. Settlement of the 
      Takeover Offer is expected to occur on 14 October 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As the settlement of the Takeover Offer will therefore take place 
      following the annual general meeting of KDH on 10 October 2013 the 
      shareholders of KDH will pursuant to Section 4 of the Offer Document 
      first receive the dividend resolved upon in the annual general meeting 
      of KDH, which was announced to amount to EUR&#160;2.50 per KDH Share. By way 
      of the settlement of the Takeover Offer the shareholders in KDH having 
      accepted the Takeover Offer will receive EUR 84.50 per KDH Share from 
      the Bidder.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IV. Domination and profit and loss transfer agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, the Bidder has approached KDH in order to enter into negotiations 
      on the conclusion of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement 
      pursuant to Sections 291 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz 
      &#8211; AktG).

&lt;p&gt;KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's government on Friday moved closer to a new shale gas deal for the country when a regional council approved its draft for a production-sharing agreement with U.S. energy company Chevron (CVX.N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputies in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region had sent the draft back to the government a month ago, pressing for guarantees that the environment would be adequately protected during exploration and for a commitment to allocate 10 percent of any gas produced for local consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interfax news agency said on Friday deputies had voted 62-to-1 in favor of an amended government draft, with 11 abstentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an absolutely positive outcome," Fuel Minister Eduard Stavitsky told Reuters by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval of a second council in the neighboring Lviv region is required before the government can go ahead and sign an agreement with Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ivano-Frankivsk has given its go-ahead for the project. Now it's the turn of Lviv," Stavitsky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron wants to tie up a deal to explore the Olesska shale field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) has already signed a $10 billion deal for shale exploration and extraction at the Yuzivska field in the east of the ex-Soviet republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kiev government sees shale gas development as important for easing its dependence on costly gas imports from Russia which weigh heavily on its economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But deputies had expressed concerns over the ecological consequences of shale exploration in the mountainous forest region which is known for tourist resorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "fracking" process, in which water and chemicals are used to break up rock, sandstone and shale deposits to release gas, has sparked opposition from environmentalists elsewhere in Europe who fear it could pollute underground water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stavitsky said the deputies demand for 10 percent of the gas to be earmarked for local consumption had been met. "The condition about the 10 percent was agreed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from shale gas exploration, Ukraine is hoping to find alternative energy sources through off-shore exploration and liquefied gas deliveries from other foreign suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Pavel Polityuk; writing By Richard Balmforth; editing by Jason Neely)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KIEV, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Ukraine's government on Friday
moved closer to a new shale gas deal for the country when a
regional council approved its draft for a production-sharing
agreement with U.S. energy company Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputies in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region had sent the
draft back to the government a month ago, pressing for
guarantees that the environment would be adequately protected
during exploration and for a commitment to allocate 10 percent
of any gas produced for local consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interfax news agency said on Friday deputies had voted
62-to-1 in favour of an amended government draft, with 11
abstentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an absolutely positive outcome," Fuel Minister
Eduard Stavitsky told Reuters by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval of a second council in the neighbouring Lviv
region is required before the government can go ahead and sign
an agreement with Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ivano-Frankivsk has given its go-ahead for the project. Now
it's the turn of Lviv," Stavitsky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron wants to tie up a deal to explore the Olesska shale
field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell has already signed a $10 billion
deal for shale exploration and extraction at the Yuzivska field
in the east of the ex-Soviet republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kiev government sees shale gas development as important
for easing its dependence on costly gas imports from Russia
which weigh heavily on its economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But deputies had expressed concerns over the ecological
consequences of shale exploration in the mountainous forest
region which is known for tourist resorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "fracking" process, in which water and chemicals are
used to break up rock, sandstone and shale deposits to release
gas, has sparked opposition from environmentalists elsewhere in
Europe who fear it could pollute underground water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stavitsky said the deputies demand for 10 percent of the gas
to be earmarked for local consumption had been met. "The
condition about the 10 percent was agreed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from shale gas exploration, Ukraine is hoping to find
alternative energy sources through off-shore exploration and
liquefied gas deliveries from other foreign suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry and Emily Flitter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept 19 (Reuters) - It's $1 billion in payouts that JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co most likely wants to forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In agreements with regulators totaling $1 billion and made
public on Thursday, the nation's biggest bank settled four civil
investigations into its "London Whale" trading scandal and two
more into the wrongful billing of credit-card customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals, which involve five authorities from the United
States and one from the UK, are a milestone in the company's
push to clean up its legal affairs but leave JPMorgan exposed to
additional costs and embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank still faces criminal probes into the trading
scandal, its conduct during an energy trading investigation,
sales of mortgage securities in the United States and possible
bribery in China. Investigators are also looking into its role
in setting benchmark interest rates known as LIBOR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlements include $920 million of penalties for
JPMorgan's London Whale trading scandal, which Chief Executive 
Jamie Dimon at first dismissed as a "tempest in a teapot" and
ultimately resulted in $6.2 billion in losses. The deals
included an admission of wrongdoing, which has been rare in past
settlements made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second set of settlements includes $80 million of payments
for billing of credit-card customers for indentity-theft
protection services that they did not receive. The deals, made 
with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, come after the company
issued $309 million of refunds to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Comptroller of the Currency also on Thursday ordered
JPMorgan to improve its consumer debt-collection practices. That
order did not include financial penalties and involved
allegations made public more than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London Whale deals, reached with the UK's Financial
Conduct Authority and the U.S. Federal Reserve, SEC and
Comptroller of the Currency, resolve the biggest civil probes
into the trading debacle. The deals include citations against
JPMorgan for poor risk controls and failure to inform regulators
about deficiencies in risk management identified by bank
management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal took on the London Whale nickname that hedge
funds had given to Bruno Iksil, a trader at JPMorgan's Chief
Investment Office in London, for the enormous size of the
positions he took for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADMITTING THE FACTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By coordinating the announcements, the regulators delivered
a round $1 billion punishment in a single day. Regulators have
been criticized by lawmakers and the public for not bringing
more cases or sending Wall Street executives to jail for
financial crisis-era misdeeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal follows a decision by the SEC to allow fewer firms
to settle without admitting or denying the facts of cases. In
August, the SEC reached a settlement with hedge fund manager
Philip Falcone, its first big case to include an admission of
wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But George Canellos, co-director of the SEC's enforcement
division, cautioned in a statement that officials will not
demand admissions in all future settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon and other JPMorgan executives had already admitted
mistakes in the Whale debacle. Starting the day Dimon disclosed
in May 2012 that the Whale trades were losing billions of
dollars, he has apologized for the "tempest in a teapot" remark.
He also testified before Congress that bank was "stupid" in
handling the trades at its Chief Investment Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enforcement actions left some people dissatisfied
because they did not blame any individuals specifically for
wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, issued a
statement pointing out that his panel had found that "senior
bank executives made a series of inaccurate statements." He said
there is still time for other civil and criminal investigations
to hold people accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who is now a 
partner at Clarke Silverglate in Miami, said, "Somebody else has
to answer for this conduct rather than just paying money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has said that JPMorgan executives did not intend to
mislead anyone about the Whale losses, which the bank concluded
were initially understated by its traders. Two traders have been
indicted on conspiracy and fraud charges and Iksil has agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, in a statement issued by the company on Thursday,
said, "We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our
mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and
worked to fix them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Dimon told shareholders that fixing risk controls
had become bank's top priority and that some projects aimed at
building the company's business had been put aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan called the Whale settlements "a major step in the
firm's ongoing efforts to put these issues behind it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deals leave unresolved other issues that have helped
drive the bank's legal costs to $5 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company continues to face a criminal probe by U.S.
prosecutors into the London Whale scandal, despite Dimon's
public insistence that no bank executives intentionally misled
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as JPMorgan was hailing the settlements, it said it had
received a legal notice that the staff of another regulator, the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, intends to recommend
an enforcement action against the bank for its derivatives
trading in the London Whale debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of Massachusetts is also investigating, the bank
said. And, despite the Comptroller of the Currency's order on
debt collections, a group of 13 states is investigating those
practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are seeing the regulators ratchet up the heat on the
banks," said analyst Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. "If
you are too big to manage, they are going to make you pay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has been under intense scrutiny from the U.S.
government since May 2012, when Dimon disclosed the mounting
loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's civil penalties follow orders in January from the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal
Reserve directing JPMorgan to improve its risk control systems
and step up its anti-money launder safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total penalties, which are among the highest ever paid
by a bank, are well short of the $1.92 billion that London-based
HSBC agreed to pay last year to settle money laundering
charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fines are determined by laws governing the amount each
agency can impose for each violation of a rule, and then are
fine-tuned through negotiations between the regulators and the
bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The "London Whale" trading scandal, once dismissed as a "tempest in a teapot" by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co CEO Jamie Dimon, is costing the largest U.S. bank $920 million in penalties and a rare public admission of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlements with four U.S. and British regulators, made public on Thursday, resolve the biggest civil probes of the bank's $6.2 billion of Whale derivatives trading losses last year. Criminal investigations are still under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank called the settlements, "a major step in the firm's ongoing efforts to put these issues behind it." It was cited for poor risk controls and failure to inform regulators about deficiencies in risk management that it knew about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deals, hard fought in the case of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which narrowly approved its settlement with a split vote, do not clear up the legal problems some individuals at the bank might face as the SEC continues its investigation. They also leave unresolved other issues that have helped drive the bank's legal costs to $5 billion a year and undermined Dimon's hold on his job, as well as his influence on the banking industry and its regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaction to the settlements in Washington appeared mixed, with lawmakers responsible for financial oversight expressing a range views about whether enough had been done to hold JPMorgan accountable for the Whale scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's board recently changed its rules to give more power to directors other than Dimon after some shareholders cited the risk-control problems to argue that Dimon should not be both board chairman and chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company continues to face a criminal probe by U.S. prosecutors into the derivatives debacle, despite Dimon's public insistence that no bank executives intentionally misled investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a person familiar with the matter said the SEC is still investigating individuals and they are not considered lower-level people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole issue of misinforming investors and the public is conspicuously absent from the SEC findings and settlement," said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who chairs the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our PSI investigation showed that senior bank executives made a series of inaccurate statements that misinformed investors and the public as the London Whale disaster unfolded. Other civil and criminal proceedings apart from this settlement are continuing, so there is still time to determine any accountability on that matter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Representative Maxine Waters, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, praised the settlements, saying they sent a "powerful message to Wall Street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as JPMorgan was hailing the settlements, it said it had received a legal notice that the staff of another regulator, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, intends to recommend an enforcement action against the bank for its derivatives trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of Massachusetts is also investigating, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This certainly isn't a closure on the Whale," said analyst Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For a BREAKINGVIEWS column, "JPMorgan's management failings beggar belief," click on [ID:nL2N0HF0VC])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE WHALE BRUNO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the trader whose big bets earned him the nickname London Whale, has signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors and has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Two other traders who worked with Iksil in London, Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout, have been criminally charged by U.S. prosecutors over their role in the scandal, accused of trying to hide the mounting losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The penalties announced Thursday include $300 million to be paid to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, $200 million to the Federal Reserve, $200 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and 137.6 million pounds ($219.74 million) to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total penalty is one of the highest ever paid by a bank, but is well short of the $1.92 billion that London-based HSBC Holdings Plc agreed to pay last year to settle money laundering charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penalties are determined by laws governing the amount each agency can charge in penalties for each violation of a rule, then are fine-tuned through negotiations between the regulators and the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said in a statement issued by the company: "We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Canellos, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in statement: "At its core, today's case is about transparency and accountability, and JPMorgan's admissions are a key component in that message."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canellos said the bank admitted that it "broke the law - because JPMorgan's egregious breakdowns in controls and governance put its millions of shareholders at risk and resulted in inaccurate public filings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Piwowar, the newest Republican member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, voted against approving the JP Morgan settlement in a split 2-1 vote, according to people familiar the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the closed-door meeting last week, Piwowar said he was concerned that the SEC was fining the company, which could hurt shareholders, rather than taking action against top executives at the bank, one of those people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Jo White, who currently chairs the SEC, and Republican Commissioner Daniel Gallagher, whose prior employers did legal work for the bank, were recused from voting on JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the SEC has said it is continuing its Whale investigation, a JPMorgan spokesman said SEC staff told the bank it did not anticipate bringing any action against Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also faces other investigations that include possible bribery in hiring practices in China and potentially fraudulent sales of mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are seeing the regulators ratchet up the heat on the banks," said Portales Partners' Peabody. "If you are too big to manage, they are going to make you pay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed down 1.2 percent at $52.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTENSE SCRUTINY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has been under intense scrutiny from the U.S. government since May 2012, when Dimon disclosed the firm was losing billions of dollars on derivatives deals that had been questioned a month earlier in news reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon initially criticized those reports as a "tempest in a teapot." He has repeatedly apologized for that remark and said the bank was "stupid" in handling the trades from a London desk of the bank's Chief Investment Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dimon is not cited by name in the SEC's administrative order, the regulatory filing notes he is included in its references to "senior management." It does not, however, point blame at any single top executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal investigations are focusing on whether people inside the bank had more detailed knowledge about the potential losses than the bank acknowledged in its early public statements, sources familiar with the probe have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's civil penalties follow orders in January from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve directing JPMorgan to improve its risk control systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Dimon said in a letter to shareholders that fixing risk controls was the bank's top priority, and that some projects aimed at building the company's business would have to be put aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement announcements reveal some new details about the scandal, which has been the subject of congressional hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the Chief Investment Office's own assessment of the value of its credit derivatives made other bank officials so uncomfortable that one unnamed senior investment banking executive consulted an outside lawyer before signing documents that would go in the company's public financial reports, according to the SEC's order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many of the settlement details came out previously in a congressional report on the trading scandal or in the criminal indictments against Martin-Artajo and Grout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Thursday, bank regulators ordered JPMorgan to improve its consumer debt-collection practices. The order, from the Comptroller of the Currency, does not include financial penalties. Some of the issues go back to allegations made public more than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the OCC order, JPMorgan still faces an investigation from a group of 13 states over its debt-collection practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry and Emily Flitter in New York and Aruna Viswanatha and Sarah Lynch in Washington; Editing by Matthew Goldstein, John Wallace and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry and Emily Flitter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept 19 (Reuters) - The "London Whale" trading scandal, once
dismissed as a "tempest in a teapot" by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 CEO Jamie Dimon, is costing the largest U.S. bank $920
million in penalties and a rare public admission of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settlements with four U.S. and British regulators, made
public on Thursday, resolve the biggest civil probes of the
bank's $6.2 billion of Whale derivatives trading losses last
year. Criminal investigations are still under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank called the settlements, "a major step in the firm's
ongoing efforts to put these issues behind it." It was cited for
poor risk controls and failure to inform regulators about
deficiencies in risk management that it knew about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deals, hard fought in the case of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, which narrowly approved its
settlement with a split vote, do not clear up the legal problems
some individuals at the bank might face as the SEC continues its
investigation. They also leave unresolved other issues that have
helped drive the bank's legal costs to $5 billion a year and
undermined Dimon's hold on his job, as well as his influence on
the banking industry and its regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaction to the settlements in Washington appeared mixed,
with lawmakers responsible for financial oversight expressing a
range views about whether enough had been done to hold JPMorgan
accountable for the Whale scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's board recently changed its rules to give more
power to directors other than Dimon after some shareholders
cited the risk-control problems to argue that Dimon should not
be both board chairman and chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company continues to face a criminal probe by U.S.
prosecutors into the derivatives debacle, despite Dimon's public
insistence that no bank executives intentionally misled
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a person familiar with the matter said the SEC is still
investigating individuals and they are not considered
lower-level people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole issue of misinforming investors and the public is
conspicuously absent from the SEC findings and settlement," said
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who chairs the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our PSI investigation showed that senior bank executives
made a series of inaccurate statements that misinformed
investors and the public as the London Whale disaster unfolded.
Other civil and criminal proceedings apart from this settlement
are continuing, so there is still time to determine any
accountability on that matter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Representative Maxine Waters, the ranking Democrat on
the House Financial Services Committee, praised the settlements,
saying they sent a "powerful message to Wall Street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as JPMorgan was hailing the settlements, it said it had
received a legal notice that the staff of another regulator, the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, intends to recommend
an enforcement action against the bank for its derivatives
trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of Massachusetts is also investigating, the bank
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This certainly isn't a closure on the Whale," said analyst
Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For a BREAKINGVIEWS column, "JPMorgan's management failings
beggar belief," click on )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE WHALE BRUNO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the trader whose big bets earned him the
nickname London Whale, has signed a cooperation agreement with
prosecutors and has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Two
other traders who worked with Iksil in London, Javier
Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout, have been criminally charged by
U.S. prosecutors over their role in the scandal, accused of
trying to hide the mounting losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The penalties announced Thursday include $300 million to be
paid to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, $200
million to the Federal Reserve, $200 million to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission and 137.6 million pounds
($219.74 million) to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total penalty is one of the highest ever paid by a bank,
but is well short of the $1.92 billion that London-based HSBC
Holdings Plc agreed to pay last year to settle money
laundering charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penalties are determined by laws governing the amount each
agency can charge in penalties for each violation of a rule,
then are fine-tuned through negotiations between the regulators
and the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said in a statement issued by the company: "We have
accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the
start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Canellos, co-director of the SEC's enforcement
division, said in statement: "At its core, today's case is about
transparency and accountability, and JPMorgan's admissions are a
key component in that message."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canellos said the bank admitted that it "broke the law -
because JPMorgan's egregious breakdowns in controls and
governance put its millions of shareholders at risk and resulted
in inaccurate public filings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Piwowar, the newest Republican member of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, voted against approving the
JP Morgan settlement in a split 2-1 vote, according to people
familiar the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the closed-door meeting last week, Piwowar said he was
concerned that the SEC was fining the company, which could hurt
shareholders, rather than taking action against top executives
at the bank, one of those people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Jo White, who currently chairs the SEC, and Republican
Commissioner Daniel Gallagher, whose prior employers did legal
work for the bank, were recused from voting on JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the SEC has said it is continuing its Whale
investigation, a JPMorgan spokesman said SEC staff told the bank
it did not anticipate bringing any action against Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also faces other investigations that include
possible bribery in hiring practices in China and potentially
fraudulent sales of mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are seeing the regulators ratchet up the heat on the
banks," said Portales Partners' Peabody. "If you are too big to
manage, they are going to make you pay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed down 1.2 percent at $52.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTENSE SCRUTINY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has been under intense scrutiny from the U.S.
government since May 2012, when Dimon disclosed the firm was
losing billions of dollars on derivatives deals that had been
questioned a month earlier in news reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon initially criticized those reports as a "tempest in a
teapot." He has repeatedly apologized for that remark and said
the bank was "stupid" in handling the trades from a London desk
of the bank's Chief Investment Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dimon is not cited by name in the SEC's administrative
order, the regulatory filing notes he is included in its
references to "senior management." It does not, however, point
blame at any single top executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal investigations are focusing on whether people
inside the bank had more detailed knowledge about the potential
losses than the bank acknowledged in its early public
statements, sources familiar with the probe have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's civil penalties follow orders in January from the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal
Reserve directing JPMorgan to improve its risk control systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Dimon said in a letter to shareholders that fixing
 risk controls was the bank's top priority, and that some
projects aimed at building the company's business would have to
be put aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement announcements reveal some new details about
the scandal, which has been the subject of congressional
hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the Chief Investment Office's own assessment of
the value of its credit derivatives made other bank officials so
uncomfortable that one unnamed senior investment banking
executive consulted an outside lawyer before signing documents
that would go in the company's public financial reports,
according to the SEC's order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many of the settlement details came out previously in a
congressional report on the trading scandal or in the criminal
indictments against Martin-Artajo and Grout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Thursday, bank regulators ordered JPMorgan to
improve its consumer debt-collection practices. The order, from
the Comptroller of the Currency, does not include financial
penalties. Some of the issues go back to allegations made public
more than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the OCC order, JPMorgan still faces an investigation
from a group of 13 states over its debt-collection
practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS/PARIS (Reuters) - Venezuela has arrested three National Guard officials for alleged involvement in smuggling 1.3 tonnes of cocaine on an Air France flight from Caracas to Paris, the South American nation's public prosecutor's office said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seizure of the cocaine haul valued at as much as 200 million euros ($270.19 million) comes as Washington is again accusing Venezuela of failing to adequately fight trafficking of cocaine from neighboring Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public prosecutors will charge a first sergeant, a second sergeant and a first lieutenant for "allegedly committing crimes established by Venezuelan law," the prosecutor's office said, without offering details of what charges it would file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that authorities in Paris had detained six people, three of whom are Italian and three British.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugs were stashed in suitcases that were registered under false names that did not correspond to passengers on the flight to Charles de Gaulle airport, French police sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French Interior Minister Manuel Valls estimated the cocaine shipment had a value of 50 million euros, while police and legal sources said the street value of the drug could be as much as 200 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This marks the biggest seizure of cocaine ever made in mainland France as part of a judicial investigation," Valls told reporters on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French authorities said the drugs were found earlier this month but details of the raid were only released over the weekend.

&lt;p&gt;(Recasts with Venezuela arrests)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CARACAS/PARIS, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Venezuela has arrested
three National Guard officials for alleged involvement in
smuggling 1.3 tonnes of cocaine on an Air France flight from
Caracas to Paris, the South American nation's public
prosecutor's office said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seizure of the cocaine haul valued at as much as 200
million euros ($270.19 million) comes as Washington is again
accusing Venezuela of failing to adequately fight trafficking of
cocaine from neighboring Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public prosecutors will charge a first sergeant, a second
sergeant and a first lieutenant for "allegedly committing crimes
established by Venezuelan law," the prosecutor's office said,
without offering details of what charges it would file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that authorities in Paris had detained six people,
three of whom are Italian and three British.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugs were stashed in suitcases that were registered
under false names that did not correspond to passengers on the
flight to Charles de Gaulle airport, French police sources told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French Interior Minister Manuel Valls estimated the cocaine
shipment had a value of 50 million euros, while police and legal
sources said the street value of the drug could be as much as
200 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This marks the biggest seizure of cocaine ever made in
mainland France as part of a judicial investigation," Valls told
reporters on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French authorities said the drugs were found earlier this
month but details of the raid were only released over the
weekend. Venezuelan authorities said the drugs were seized on
Sept 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air France said it was still trying to find out how the
drugs were smuggled on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pending the results of these investigations, immediate
measures have been taken to enhance our checks of baggage and
goods on departure from certain sensitive destinations," the
airline said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRANSIT COUNTRY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug enforcement experts say Venezuela's location on South
America's Caribbean and Atlantic seaboards makes it a preferred
route for planes and ships carrying Colombian cocaine to the
United States and Europe via Central America and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has for over a decade accused Venezuela of
turning a blind eye to drug smuggling, and has described several
high-ranking military officials and ruling party allies as drug
"kingpins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House said in an annual report this month that
Venezuela, along with Bolivia and Myanmar, had not made
substantial efforts during the last 12 months to meet its
obligations under global counter-narcotics agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government of President Nicolas Maduro, who won an
election in April that followed Hugo Chavez's death from cancer,
calls such criticism a politically motivated smear campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says anti-narcotics cooperation has actually improved
since 2005, when Chavez kicked out the U.S. drug enforcement
agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Venezuelan security forces working with Colombian
authorities and U.S. and British intelligence agencies caught
one of the most-wanted Colombian kingpins - Daniel "Crazy"
Barrera - during an operation in a Venezuelan border city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7402 euros)

&lt;p&gt;Sept 22 (Reuters) - General Electric Co shares are
poised to outperform the broad stock market, after lagging
behind for more than a decade, as its business outgrows the
economies where it operates, financial newspaper Barron's

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp unveiled faster, more powerful versions of its Surface tablet computer on Monday in an effort to boost poor sales of its flagship hardware product and mount a stronger challenge to Apple Inc's iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surface is key to Microsoft's plan to reinvent itself as a devices and services company, but the revamp comes less than a year after it brought out its own computers for the first time and failed to put a dent in the market. It has racked up only $853 million in sales while generating a $900 million charge for unsold inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an event in New York, Microsoft unveiled two new machines and a range of accessories promising faster processing, better battery life and more apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Surface 2, which runs on a low-power chip designed by ARM Holdings Plc, starts at $449 for the 32 GB version, not including a snap-on keyboard starting at $120. That is slightly less than Apple's latest wifi-only 32GB iPad, which costs $599.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Surface Pro 2, which runs on an Intel Corp chip and is aimed more at the lightweight laptop market, starts at $899 for the 64 GB version, not including keyboard. Apple's cheapest 128 GB MacBook Air costs $999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial reaction was tepid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see much incentive for people to buy these devices. Yes, they are cheaper than the iPads, but is that enough reason?" said Jack Gold, a technology analyst at J. Gold Associates. "It seems like Microsoft is just maintaining the traditional PC mantra - keep upgrading the chip and hardware a little bit every year at a slightly lower price. I think they needed to do something that was innovative beyond the first generation, and I don't see that in these devices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were steady at $32.82 on Nasdaq, while Apple shares rose 4 percent after reporting strong sales of its new iPhone 5s and 5c models and offering a more optimistic financial forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an added incentive, Microsoft is taking advantage of its other products, offering customers free Skype calling to landlines in more than 60 countries for one year and 200 GB of free storage for two years on SkyDrive, its online 'cloud' storage product that competes with Google Drive and Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Surface 2 comes preloaded with a stripped-down version of Office, including Outlook email. Surface Pro 2 can run the full, standard version of Office, but the software must be bought separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hugely popular Office suite is the Surface's one unique selling point over Apple, as Microsoft has not released full, custom-designed Office apps for the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What should be the 'killer app' is Microsoft Office," said Avi Greengart, an analyst at Current Analysis, who was more optimistic about the new Surface products. "The Surface Pro has a place as an ultra-portable notebook replacement. If you value the touch screen form factor at that price point, it's a reasonable option."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also introduced a range of thinner, backlit keyboards which double as covers, plus a new Power Cover which adds life to the battery, which will be available early next year. It also unveiled a docking station for the Intel-based Surfaces, so they can be hooked up to a desktop monitor, also available next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about Microsoft making sure people understand Microsoft is here and will be part of the future of computing," said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner. "But I think the competition is still very tough."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new machines will be available for sale online, in Microsoft stores and at a few third-party retailers in the United States and most other major markets, except Japan, on October 22. It will be available in China in early November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sinead Carew in New York and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by John Wallace, Jeffrey Benkoe and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

			Mayor 
      Kevin Johnson joined Coca-Cola to unveil a substantial program to help 
      bolster the city&#8217;s health and fitness initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Totaling $192,500, the grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation to the 
      National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) will be used by the City 
      of Sacramento&#8217;s Department of Parks and Recreation (SPDR). The grant 
      will help the city to marshal fitness resources for neighborhoods 
      through multiple initiatives
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness program, the funding will 
      help to offer programs and classes instructed by 14 military veterans at 
      five recreation centers. The veterans will lead walking workouts, 
      gardening for health, heart-healthy dance, exercise boot camp, Taiji, 
      golf to good health, and healthy nutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Together with Mayor Johnson, we are making health and wellness programs 
      accessible to every Sacramentan,&#8221; said Rick Frazier, Chief Product 
      Supply and Service Officer, Coca-Cola Refreshments. &#8220;We believe this 
      initiative can create real results by encouraging and helping people of 
      all ages to exercise and learn to live a balanced lifestyle.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mayor Kevin Johnson said access to nutrition education and physical 
      activity programs in underserved neighborhoods is a high priority for 
      his office.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This project will provide health and fitness resources across the city 
      of Sacramento. It will reach the communities that need it most while 
      providing employment opportunities for our nation&#8217;s heroes,&#8221; he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The parks programs are described as:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Walk and Talk with a Vet
				
					
            Weekly walking workouts led by a veteran

				Taiji (Tai Chi)
				
					
            Tai Chi was originally created as a martial art. Practicing Tai 
            Chi can improve one&#8217;s health, reduce tension and reduce blood 
            pressure and heart problems.

      Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness helps demonstrate the commitment of The 
      Coca-Cola Foundation and The Coca-Cola Company to promote balanced

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is preparing to sue JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co over mortgage bonds it sold in the run-up to the financial crisis, a sign the bank's legal troubles are not yet over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit, first reported by Reuters, could come as early as Tuesday, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony and Justice Department spokeswoman Adora Andy Jenkins declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank disclosed in August that federal prosecutors in California were conducting criminal and civil investigations into the bank's mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those investigations, government lawyers have concluded that JPMorgan committed civil violations of securities laws in offering mortgage bonds from 2005 to 2007 that were backed by subprime and other risky residential mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected charges come less than one week after the largest U.S. bank paid $1 billion to resolve investigations into its "London Whale" trading scandal and issues surrounding the wrongful billing of credit-card customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear whether the new charges would be civil, criminal or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the cases earlier told Reuters that the probes in the Eastern District of California involve mortgage bonds offered by JPMorgan itself and not those by companies it bought during the crisis such as Washington Mutual or Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case underscores the limits on JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon's ability to draw a line under the bank's mounting regulatory headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the bank has attempted to move past major liability involving its London Whale trades, it continues to face a criminal probe and a lawsuit from the derivatives regulator over the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected DOJ case is not the only U.S. probe involving the bank's mortgage-backed securities business. Prosecutors in Philadelphia and New Jersey are also working on cases, related in part to the bank's Bear Stearns unit, which it acquired in 2008 at the behest of the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman also sued the bank last October over mortgage-backed securities packaged and sold by Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TASK FORCE CASES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newest case comes almost two years after President Barack Obama announced a task force to probe the misconduct that fueled the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and after Attorney General Eric Holder has promised to bring big cases involving the mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department has faced withering criticism for bringing few marquee cases against major financial firms or their executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, the DOJ and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Bank of America Corp and accused it of investor fraud in the sale of $850 million of residential mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Bank of America is also scheduled to go to court to defend a separate U.S. case involving loans the bank's Countrywide unit sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aruna Viswanatha in Washington and Emily Flitter and David Henry in New York; Editing by Gary Hill and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sinead Carew and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
 unveiled faster, more powerful versions of its Surface
tablet computer on Monday in an effort to boost poor sales of
its flagship hardware product and mount a stronger challenge to
Apple Inc's iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Surface is key to Microsoft's plan to reinvent itself as
a devices and services company, but the revamp comes less than a
year after it brought out its own computers for the first time
and failed to put a dent in the market. It has racked up only
$853 million in sales while generating a $900 million charge for
unsold inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an event in New York, Microsoft unveiled two new machines
and a range of accessories promising faster processing, better
battery life and more apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Surface 2, which runs on a low-power chip designed
by ARM Holdings Plc, starts at $449 for the 32 GB
version, not including a snap-on keyboard starting at $120. That
is slightly less than Apple's latest wifi-only 32GB iPad, which
costs $599.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Surface Pro 2, which runs on an Intel Corp 
chip and is aimed more at the lightweight laptop market, starts
at $899 for the 64 GB version, not including keyboard. Apple's
cheapest 128 GB MacBook Air costs $999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial reaction was tepid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see much incentive for people to buy these devices.
Yes, they are cheaper than the iPads, but is that enough
reason?" said Jack Gold, a technology analyst at J. Gold
Associates. "It seems like Microsoft is just maintaining the
traditional PC mantra - keep upgrading the chip and hardware a
little bit every year at a slightly lower price. I think they
needed to do something that was innovative beyond the first
generation, and I don't see that in these devices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were steady at $32.82 on Nasdaq, while
Apple shares rose 4 percent after reporting strong sales of its
new iPhone 5s and 5c models and offering a more optimistic
financial forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an added incentive, Microsoft is taking advantage of its
other products, offering customers free Skype calling to
landlines in more than 60 countries for one year and 200 GB of
free storage for two years on SkyDrive, its online 'cloud'
storage product that competes with Google Drive and Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Surface 2 comes preloaded with a stripped-down version
of Office, including Outlook email. Surface Pro 2 can run the
full, standard version of Office, but the software must be
bought separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hugely popular Office suite is the Surface's one unique
selling point over Apple, as Microsoft has not released full,
custom-designed Office apps for the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What should be the 'killer app' is Microsoft Office," said
Avi Greengart, an analyst at Current Analysis, who was more
optimistic about the new Surface products. "The Surface Pro has
a place as an ultra-portable notebook replacement. If you value
the touch screen form factor at that price point, it's a
reasonable option."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also introduced a range of thinner, backlit
keyboards which double as covers, plus a new Power Cover which
adds life to the battery, which will be available early next
year. It also unveiled a docking station for the Intel-based
Surfaces, so they can be hooked up to a desktop monitor, also
available next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about Microsoft making sure people understand
Microsoft is here and will be part of the future of computing,"
said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner. "But I think the
competition is still very tough."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new machines will be available for sale online, in
Microsoft stores and at a few third-party retailers in the
United States and most other major markets, except Japan, on
Oct. 22. It will be available in China in early November.&lt;/p&gt;

			Company Marks Physical Activity Milestone with Opening of Newest Live 
      Positively Fitness Center in Asbury Park, N.J.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This summer, millions of people were inspired to move and groove with 
      Coca-Cola as part of its Get The Ball Rolling initiative. Today 
      Coca-Cola has reached its goal to inspire 3 million Americans to 
      rediscover the joy of being active in communities across the country 
      since May.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For Coca-Cola, inspiring moments of happiness is part of our heritage 
      and our future. What&#8217;s more fun than families and friends delighting in 
      the joy of being active?&#8221; said Stuart Kronauge, General Manager, 
      Sparkling Beverages, Coca-Cola USA. &#8220;While we teamed up with communities 
      across the country this summer to get people moving more, we&#8217;re far from 
      done. We plan to continue using our unequaled reach to inspire healthy 
      and happy living.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company, with The Coca-Cola Foundation, inspired more than 3 million 
      people to get their &#8220;fun&#8221; on. It helped make activities and sports gear 
      available in communities across the country all summer long.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the Company&#8217;s efforts to keep the movement going includes the 
      grand opening of a new Live Positively Fitness Center at Asbury 
      Park Middle School in New Jersey. Together, Coca-Cola Americas President 
      Steve Cahillane, Governor Chris Christie and fitness icon Jake Steinfeld 
      showcased the facility today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Asbury Park&#8217;s Live Positively Fitness Center is equipped with strength 
      training machines, cardiovascular gear and interactive exercise games 
      customized for middle school students. It&#8217;s one of 100 such facilities 
      that will open at schools around the country over five years. The 
      fitness centers are expected to facilitate 5 million workouts. Center 
      locations are focused on areas with high childhood obesity rates and 
      areas that have few places for children to access state-of-the-art 
      equipment. Participating schools are selected by the National Foundation 
      for Governors&#8217; Fitness Councils and the American College of Sports 
      Medicine. Funding is provided through a grant from The Coca-Cola Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The health of our children is vital to the health of our future and 
      that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve declared war on childhood obesity,&#8221; said Steinfeld to a 
      crowd of students and community leaders. &#8220;We are providing schools with 
      tools to improve fitness, benefit academics and combat obesity. We can 
      overcome any challenge&#160;when we work together to inspire and motivate 
      students. The partners who joined forces today bring this idea to life.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The Asbury Park Live Positively Fitness Center is one of 12 locations 
      opening in 10 days across Delaware, Georgia, New Jersey and West 
      Virginia. The centers are part of Get the Ball Rolling activities 
      that helped inspire more than 3 million Americans to move this summer. 
      Other activities included:

        Families, teens and young adults received 100,000 free soccer balls at

&lt;p&gt;The French Competition Authority announced the agreement with Visa and Mastercard in the wake of proposed legislation from the European Commission that banks and payment firms limit the fees they charge on card payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Card companies have waged a 20-year battle with the EU's executive, which enforces antitrust rules in the 28-country bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the French regulator said that its remit was transactions within France, rather than the cross-border European transactions that are governed by the EU's regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Visa and Mastercard will cut interbank fees to around 0.28 percent of the transaction value from about 0.5 percent currently, and will also reduce cash-machine fees to 0.55 euros ($0.74) per withdrawal from 0.75 and 0.60 respectively, the competition authority said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement also comes after several moves by the French watchdog to cut bank customers' fees in France.

      MSCI Launches Two MSCI Market Neutral Barra Factor Indices Licensed to 
      J.P. Morgan
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Indices Created in Consultation with J.P. Morgan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MSCI 
      Inc. (NYSE:MSCI), a leading provider of investment decision support 
      tools worldwide, announced today that it has launched two new MSCI 
      Market Neutral Barra Factor Indices targeting two fundamental Barra 
      style factors: Momentum and Volatility. Created in consultation with, 
      and licensed to, J.P. Morgan, the new indices are designed to reflect 
      the performance of a theoretically &#8220;pure&#8221; single factor return for a 
      given region, while remaining investable, replicable and with controlled 
      turnover.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The MSCI Europe Market Neutral Barra Momentum Index targets high 
      exposure to the momentum factor across European developed markets, with 
      low exposure to all other market factors including country, industry and 
      other style factors (such as size, value, growth and more). Similarly, 
      the MSCI Europe Market Neutral Barra Volatility Index targets high 
      exposure to the volatility factor, with low exposure to all other 
      factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to have had J.P. Morgan&#8217;s input in developing these new 
      indices,&#8221; said Baer Pettit, Managing Director and Global Head of the 
      MSCI Index Business. &#8220;By leveraging the combined strengths of our MSCI 
      index and Barra analytics products, MSCI can provide institutional 
      investors with a unique set of tools in an environment where they are 
      increasingly observing style factors as important drivers of equity 
      market risk and return.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rui Fernandes, Managing Director and head of Equity Derivatives 
      Structuring at J.P. Morgan said, &#8220;We are excited to license these 
      indices to create products that fill an important product gap, allowing 
      investors to access Barra style factors in an investable format.&#8221;

			JPMorgan Chase, the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation and partners 
      announce successful capital raise for first-of-its-kind investment 
      product
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A new investment fund structured by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) and 
      the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation will, for the first time, allow 
      individual and institutional investors the opportunity to finance 
      late-stage global health technologies that have the potential to save 
      millions of lives in low-income countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With $94 million committed by a pioneering group of investors &#8211; 
      including anchor support from Grand Challenges Canada (funded by the 
      Government of Canada), the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and 
      Development (acting through KfW) and the Children&#8217;s Investment Fund 
      Foundation &#8211; the Global Health Investment Fund (&#8220;GHIF&#8221; or the &#8220;Fund&#8221;) 
      will help advance the most promising interventions to fight challenges 
      in low-income countries such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and 
      maternal and infant mortality. To help mitigate the risk of investing in 
      the clinical development of new technologies, the Gates Foundation and 
      the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency have committed 
      to partially offset potential losses in the Fund, which will seek a 
      financial return for investors by targeting high-impact technologies 
      with public health applications in both developed and emerging markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Global Health Investment Fund demonstrates the potential for 
      innovative collaborations and thoughtful financial structures to 
      mobilize new sources of capital for social challenges,&#8221; said Jamie 
      Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase  Co. &#8220;This product brings a 
      diverse group of investors together around the shared objective of 
      developing life-saving technologies in a financially sustainable way.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LHGP Asset Management (&#8220;Lion&#8217;s Head&#8221;), a London-based asset manager 
      specializing in sustainable development, will be responsible for 
      originating, managing and exiting GHIF portfolio investments. In 
      addition to the anchor supporters, the Fund&#8217;s investor group includes 
      organizations such as the International Finance Corporation, 
      GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, The Pfizer Foundation, Storebrand and JPMorgan 
      Chase, in addition to qualified individuals and family offices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We invest in global health because we know that when health improves, 
      life improves by every measure,&#8221; said Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill  
      Melinda Gates Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Private sector financing for global health research and development is 
      more important than ever. Philanthropy, government funding and 
      pharmaceutical industry support have built a remarkable pipeline of 
      global health innovations&#8212;with as many as 200 new products currently 
      under development&#8212;but late-stage clinical trials are costly and 
      development expenses are outpacing charitable support. Traditional 
      investment capital can play a meaningful role in solving this problem, 
      particularly when it is supplied by investors who include the expected 
      social impact of their activities in their return calculations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This innovative fund is mobilizing financing for medical advances that 
      could potentially save millions of lives,&#8221; said World Bank President Jim 
      Yong Kim. &#8220;It shows that we can align the needs of investors with the 
      need for cures for diseases which cause so much suffering in developing 
      countries."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The GHIF will invest in new drugs and vaccines, emerging diagnostic 
      tools, child-friendly formulations of existing products, expanding 
      manufacturing capacity and other applications that will help bring 
      affordable technologies to those most in need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Innovation and investment in global health research and development are 
      the way forward in tackling pressing health challenges and delivering 
      meaningful results for those most in need around the world,&#8221; said the 
      Hon. Christian Paradis, Canada&#8217;s Minister of International Development. 
      &#8220;This Fund is blazing the trail, and Canada is proud to have played a 
      key role in its establishment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Millions of children die each year or suffer from debilitating 
      conditions because the right treatment does not exist for them,&#8221; said 
      Jamie Cooper-Hohn, Chair of the Children&#8217;s Investment Fund Foundation 
      (CIFF). &#8220;Relatively little investment goes to the development of new 
      drugs, vaccines and diagnostics specifically targeted at children in 
      developing countries where child mortality is most dire. CIFF is very 
      pleased to be a major investor into the Global Health Investment Fund, 
      which promises to deliver new finance and focus to this neglected area.&#8221;

        Although this is the first investment fund dedicated to global health 
        RD, we hope this will serve as a pilot for future funds of this type 
        in global health and other sectors.&#8221;
      
			
				Charlotte Petri Gornitzka, Director General, Swedish International 
        Development Cooperation Agency (Sida): &#8220;Sweden and Sida are 
        excited to be part of this groundbreaking initiative where private 
        capital is put to work for development. It shows the magnitude of 
        results that can be reached when aid, business and philanthropy work 
        hand in hand.&#8221;
      
			
				Dr. Norbert Kloppenburg, KfW Executive Board member: "Thanks to 
        the Fund, more people will have access to improved health care&#8212;while 
        at the same time a financial return will be generated for investors. 
        The projects supported by the fund will improve the health status of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, facing several investigations into its mortgage practices, is seeking a global settlement with U.S. government authorities in multiple jurisdictions, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations have resumed with the U.S. Department of Justice after federal prosecutors in California delayed a plan to file a lawsuit there on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global settlement would cover probes of JPMorgan's mortgage business, as well as investigations of similar operations it inherited from other banks during the financial crisis. The investigations include civil and criminal authorities from the DOJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California case involved the sale of bonds backed by subprime mortgages and other risky home loans between 2005 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California negotiations initially broke down over the amount the bank would pay as a penalty, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Department of Housing and Urban Development took issue on Tuesday with a report in another publication that the agency was seeking a $20 billion settlement from the bank over its mortgage practices. The housing agency said that was "categorically false."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The department takes the allegations against JPMorgan Chase seriously and has been involved in multi-party negotiations to reach a settlement. However, no one at this agency - including the secretary - ever floated a $20 billion settlement figure," HUD general counsel Helen Kanovsky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned California litigation did not involve HUD, and that agency's involvement in the talks suggest that both the bank and the government want to resolve multiple investigations in a larger settlement, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said the new move toward settlement talks appeared to be driven by a strong desire within the bank to move past its legal troubles as quickly as possible, but the Justice Department likely has the upper hand in the talks, given how close it came to filing the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a regulatory filing in August, JPMorgan disclosed it was under parallel civil and criminal investigations by federal authorities in California and that the authorities on the civil side told the bank in May they had preliminarily concluded it violated federal securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To observers, another legal battle is the last thing the largest U.S. bank needs as it struggles to move past conflicts with regulators and prosecutors involving several business lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The way I see this, JPMorgan would like to avoid the continuing Chinese water torture of reputational damage they've been suffering," said Kathleen Wailes, senior vice president at LEVICK, a public relations and crisis-management firm in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would like to dispose of this in a settlement as opposed to a trial and get rid of this as quickly as they can to move on the more positive subjects," Wailes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, JPMorgan agreed to pay $1 billion to settle regulatory actions related to a $6.2 billion trading loss it incurred last year in its Chief Investment Office and to allegations of wrongful billing of credit-card customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week's settlements were part of a new push by the bank to try to remake its public image into one displaying more deference toward regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government is attacking very weak prey now," said Jonathan Macey, a corporate law professor at Yale Law School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I certainly don't think we can say JPMorgan is in a strong position because they've experienced such a relentless onslaught of legal and regulatory actions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, JPMorgan is financially strong and making record profits, despite the damage to its reputation, the expense of about $5 billion in annual legal costs, and government orders to fix its risk controls and legal compliance systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported net income of $21.3 billion last year and analysts expect profits this year to be even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's stock price on Tuesday was about 25 percent higher than before it disclosed in May 2012 that it was losing billions of dollars on its Chief Investment Offices' "London Whale" derivatives trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a statement issued by the company on Thursday: "We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Aruna Viswanatha in Washington and Emily Flitter and David Henry in New York; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;By Aruna Viswanatha, Emily Flitter and David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co,

under parallel civil and criminal investigations by federal
authorities in California and that the authorities on the civil
side told the bank in May they had preliminarily concluded it
violated federal securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To observers, another legal battle is the last thing the
largest U.S. bank needs as it struggles to move past conflicts
with regulators and prosecutors involving several business

Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would like to dispose of this in a settlement as
opposed to a trial and get rid of this as quickly as they can to
move on the more positive subjects," Wailes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, JPMorgan agreed to pay $1 billion to settle
regulatory actions related to a $6.2 billion trading loss it
incurred last year in its Chief Investment Office and to
allegations of wrongful billing of credit-card customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week's settlements were part of a new push by the bank
to try to remake its public image into one displaying more
deference toward regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government is attacking very weak prey now," said
Jonathan Macey, a corporate law professor at Yale Law School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I certainly don't think we can say JPMorgan is in a strong
position because they've experienced such a relentless onslaught
of legal and regulatory actions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, JPMorgan is financially strong and making record

and analysts expect profits this year to be even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's stock price on Tuesday was about 25 percent
higher than before it disclosed in May 2012 that it was losing
billions of dollars on its Chief Investment Offices' "London
Whale" derivatives trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a statement

      Radio Disney Denver, part of the #1 radio network for kids, tweens and 
      families, and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Colorado will team up 
      for the third consecutive year to promote the importance of childhood 
      health and wellness through the Get Active, Get Fit School Challenge, 
      which runs from Sept. 20, 2013 through Nov. 23, 2013 and is open to 
      students from kindergarten through sixth grade in schools across 
      Colorado. In 2012, more than 385,000 elementary school students across 
      seven states successfully participated in the program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Designed to motivate kids and families to achieve fitness together by

      naturally enjoy exercise, and a little competition between schools is a 
      very positive way to keep them active. We&#8217;re hoping this school year

&lt;p&gt;Sept 24 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and the U.S.
Department of Justice are in 'fluid' talks to settle multiple
probes of the company, the Wall Street Journal reported on
Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has offered to pay about $3 billion to help end the
legal issues, but the Justice Department is arguing that the
company should pay more, the report said, citing one of the
people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank based in the United States, has
been pressing to resolve several government investigations of
the company that have grown in number and intensity since the
company lost $6.2 billion on its "London Whale" derivatives
trades last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia (Reuters) - Gazprom (GAZP.MM) has halted talks on buying gas from the Exxon Mobil-led (XOM.N) Sakhalin-1 project after years of fruitless attempts to secure a deal, Deputy Chief Executive Alexander Medvedev told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim hopes for an agreement have been dashed by the prospect that Gazprom, having failed to finalize a gas export deal with China, might lose its monopoly on liquefied natural gas exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state-controlled gas giant had wanted to buy up production from Sakhalin-1 to supply Russia's Far East. But Exxon, with its partner Rosneft (ROSN.MM), now plans a $15 billion LNG project to supply the Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not in discussions; they will liquefy gas by themselves," Medvedev told the Reuters Russia Investment Summit on Tuesday. He did not elaborate on the reason behind the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom exports LNG from its own Sakhalin-2 project, which is already up and running and has annual capacity of 10 million tons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as Gazprom seeks to pivot away from a weak European export market, the company has opened a door to rivals by failing to clinch a long-awaited deal to supply gas by pipeline to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft, along with independent gas firm Novatek (NVTK.MM), has lobbied to end Gazprom's monopoly on gas exports, with an enabling proposal now before the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom also plans to expand existing Sakhalin-2 capacity and build up a new LNG plant in the Russian Pacific coast near Vladivostok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom this month signed a heads of agreement with China aiming to reaching a final supply deal by the end of this year, and Medvedev signaled greater flexibility on the pricing basis for future supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that Gazprom might use an Asian oil products basket as a benchmark for pricing gas that it plans to supply to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom has for decades pegged its long-term supply deals with European customers to oil products prices, although buyers have pushed for - and won - greater linkage to the 'spot' market price for gas on exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to the oil-price link in China sales would defend Gazprom's export pricing model from pressures arising from the relative abundance of natural gas in relation to oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A given formula can lead to completely divergent results," Medvedev said. "Therefore we will find an indexation method and, most importantly, a base price. The talks are going normally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told reporters earlier on Tuesday that Gazprom did not expect to use the "Japanese Crude Cocktail", which is seen as an expensive mix, as the benchmark for China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese state energy firm CNPC has, meanwhile, secured another 25 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year from Turkmenistan in addition to the 20 bcm shipped in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, China may buy as much as 65 bcm a year from Turkmenistan, once a major supplier for Gazprom which has become a competitor after the opening of an eastern export route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medvedev, speaking to Reuters, dismissed suggestions that Gazprom has come under pressure as a result of the new Turkmen deal, saying its own negotiations are not linked to Ashgabat's price formula with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Turkmens) are not pressing us, they have their own life and we have our own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom had initially planned to ship up to 68 billion cubic meters of gas per year via two routes to China. It later prioritized the more eastern route that would supply 38 bcm per year with a plan to start in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For other news from Reuters Russian and Eastern Europe Investment Summit, click here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Oleg Vukmanovic in London; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin and Katya Golubkova; editing by Jane Baird and Jane Merriman)&lt;/p&gt;

Investment Summit, click here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Denis Pinchuk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Gazprom
 has halted talks on buying gas from the Exxon
Mobil-led Sakhalin-1 project after years of fruitless
attempts to secure a deal, Deputy Chief Executive Alexander
Medvedev told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim hopes for an agreement have been dashed by the prospect
that Gazprom, having failed to finalise a gas export deal with
China, might lose its monopoly on liquefied natural gas exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state-controlled gas giant had wanted to buy up
production from Sakhalin-1 to supply Russia's Far East. But
Exxon, with its partner Rosneft, now plans a $15
billion LNG project to supply the Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not in discussions; they will liquefy gas by
themselves," Medvedev told the Reuters Russia Investment Summit
on Tuesday. He did not elaborate on the reason behind the
decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom exports LNG from its own Sakhalin-2 project, which
is already up and running and has annual capacity of 10 million
tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as Gazprom seeks to pivot away from a weak European
export market, the company has opened a door to rivals by
failing to clinch a long-awaited deal to supply gas by pipeline
to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft, along with independent gas firm Novatek,
has lobbied to end Gazprom's monopoly on gas exports, with an
enabling proposal now before the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom also plans to expand existing Sakhalin-2 capacity
and build up a new LNG plant in the Russian Pacific coast near
Vladivostok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom this month signed a heads of agreement with China
aiming to reaching a final supply deal by the end of this year,
and Medvedev signalled greater flexibility on the pricing basis
for future supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that Gazprom might use an Asian oil products basket
as a benchmark for pricing gas that it plans to supply to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom has for decades pegged its long-term supply deals
with European customers to oil products prices, although buyers
have pushed for - and won - greater linkage to the 'spot' market
price for gas on exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to the oil-price link in China sales would defend
Gazprom's export pricing model from pressures arising from the
relative abundance of natural gas in relation to oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A given formula can lead to completely divergent results,"
Medvedev said. "Therefore we will find an indexation method and,
most importantly, a base price. The talks are going normally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told reporters earlier on Tuesday that Gazprom did not
expect to use the "Japanese Crude Cocktail", which is seen as an
expensive mix, as the benchmark for China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese state energy firm CNPC has, meanwhile, secured
another 25 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year from
Turkmenistan in addition to the 20 bcm shipped in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, China may buy as much as 65 bcm a year
from Turkmenistan, once a major supplier for Gazprom which has
become a competitor after the opening of an eastern export
route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medvedev, speaking to Reuters, dismissed suggestions that
Gazprom has come under pressure as a result of the new Turkmen
deal, saying its own negotiations are not linked to Ashgabat's
price formula with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Turkmens) are not pressing us, they have their own
life and we have our own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom had initially planned to ship up to 68 billion cubic
metres of gas per year via two routes to China. It later
prioritised the more eastern route that would supply 38 bcm per
year with a plan to start in 2018.

			Announces Cross-Sector Collaboration with DEKA RD, IBM, 
      Inter-American Development Bank, McCann Health, NRG Energy, Qualcomm 
      Technologies and UPS to Deliver EKOCENTER to 20 Countries by End of 2015
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company, DEKA RD, IBM, Inter-American Development Bank 
      (IDB) Group, McCann Health, NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG), Qualcomm 
      Technologies, Inc. and UPS&#174;, today announced they will work together to 
      bring EKOCENTERTM &#8211; a kiosk designed to improve the 
      well-being of communities &#8211; to 20 countries by the end of 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s announcement brings to action its 2012 commitment with DEKA 
      RD to provide safe drinking water to communities through the SlingshotTM 
      water purification system, ensuring communities are more sustainable. 
      Today, we are announcing that we will place between 1,500 and 2,000 
      units in the form of EKOCENTERs, &#8220;downtowns in a box,&#8221; or SlingshotTM 
      water purification systems to deliver further services beyond clean 
      water, in Africa, Asia, Latin America and North America by the end of 
      2015. Each EKOCENTER will offer a locally tailored mix of products, 
      services and resources that may include safe drinking water, sustainable 
      energy, wireless communications, refrigerated vaccination storage, 
      health education, and other functionality to jump-start entrepreneurship 
      opportunities and community development. Through this commitment, we aim 
      to deliver 500 million liters of safe drinking water, while promoting 
      greater local development in communities that need it most.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Women and entrepreneurs from local communities will be recruited to 
      operate each EKOCENTER, creating new opportunities for employment in the 
      communities where we install and operate EKOCENTER. Entrepreneurs 
      selected to operate the EKOCENTERs will be given business skills 
      training similar to that provided by Coca-Cola&#8217;s 5by20 program, an 
      initiative designed to economically empower 5 million women 
      entrepreneurs across Coca-Cola&#8217;s value chain by 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;EKOCENTER represents an investment in the future prosperity and 
      progress of some of the most fragile and at-risk communities we serve,&#8221; 
      said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;Through 
      EKOCENTER we have the ability to change lives by offering access to safe 
      drinking water and other needed resources, all while empowering local 
      entrepreneurs. What started as an aspiration is now becoming a reality 
      as we welcome our partners across the golden triangle of business, 
      government and civil society to scale and improve this innovation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This collaboration is the first step in Coca-Cola&#8217;s long-term vision of 
      deploying thousands of EKOCENTERs globally in the next decade. 
      Currently, one EKOCENTER test site has been launched in Heidelberg, 
      South Africa, and there are plans to install one additional EKOCENTER 
      pilot by the end of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through this cross-sector collaboration, Coca-Cola intends to marry its 
      skills and know-how with that of other industry leaders to optimize and 
      scale the EKOCENTER concept. Partners are expected to bring financial 
      and in-kind support, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners will lead the 
        project, managing the site selection, installation and maintenance of 
        each EKOCENTER. They also will utilize their local operations to 
        support on-the-ground needs and serve as a distribution channel for 
        EKOCENTER placements. The Company led the EKOCENTER vision and design 
        as well as the creation and installation of the prototype unit in 
        South Africa.
      
			
				The Coca-Cola Company  DEKA RD will supply the 
        SlingshotTM water purification system as well as design and 
        infrastructure expertise to build and install EKOCENTER. DEKA RD 
        supported the design and creation of the first EKOCENTER test site in 
        South Africa and also has an additional partnership with Coca-Cola to 
        deliver safe drinking water using the Slingshot technology at schools, 
        health clinics and community centers in Africa and Latin America.
      
			
				IBM will contribute technology and business consulting services 
        to provide high-level business plan development and technology plan 
        development for EKOCENTER. IBM also will explore and advise on 
        potential technology applications for treating return water.
      
			
				IDB will provide funding and implementation support for 
        EKOCENTER placements in Latin America. It also will help establish 
        relationships with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to 
        support health and sanitation education for communities receiving 
        EKOCENTERs. IDB is a funding and implementation partner for 
        Coca-Cola&#8217;s existing safe drinking water partnership with DEKA RD in 
        Latin America.
      
			
				McCann Health, a part of McCann Worldgroup, will work with 
        Coca-Cola and other partners to create a micro-business model for 
        EKOCENTER. Additionally, it also will develop consumer-focused health 
        and sanitation programs and messaging for communities receiving an 
        EKOCENTER.
      
			
				NRG is the official energy partner for EKOCENTER, providing 
        solar panels and battery storage to power EKOCENTER, enabling each one 
        to be a self-sustaining, off-the-grid operation. NRG also is assisting 
        DEKA RD with development of the StirlingTM engine 
        technology which could provide another energy option for EKOCENTER in 
        the long-term. NRG provided solar panels and battery storage for the 
        first EKOCENTER test site earlier this year.
      
			
				Qualcomm
				Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary 
        of Qualcomm Incorporated, will provide guidance to Coca-Cola on the 
        inclusion of wireless communications technologies, such as mobile 
        devices and wireless Internet connectivity, for EKOCENTER.
      
			
				UPS will serve as a logistics partner, providing technical 
        expertise on global operations and deployment of EKOCENTER.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola also intends to work with TechnoServe as a strategic advisor 
      for EKOCENTER. TechnoServe will help establish a sustainable business 
      model and a metrics-based monitoring and evaluation plan, as well as 
      support identifying and training local entrepreneurs for EKOCENTER. 
      Coca-Cola has a long-term relationship with TechnoServe on key projects 
      in Haiti and countries in Africa under its 5by20 and sustainable 
      agriculture programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At a broad level, EKOCENTER is intended to be a financially sustainable, 
      globally replicable social enterprise model, run by primarily local 
      female entrepreneurs. EKOCENTERs will initially operate with a Slingshot 
      water purification system, power source and commercial space. The 
      partnership will then work to grow the technology, once optimally 
      developed, to be a fully equipped retail outlet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While EKOCENTER&#8217;s core mission is to improve the physical well-being of 
      people in rural communities, focused on providing safe drinking water to 
      approximately 45,000 people in its first two years, it also offers other 
      opportunities to communities. Through EKOCENTER, the partners aim to 
      empower communities through connectivity to information and the outside 
      world; provide a safe gathering place; create jobs, skills and services; 
      and offer incentives for local programs in a community, like recycling 
      or sanitation services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company will work with its local bottling partners to 
      ensure that the EKOCENTER and Slingshot technologies are working 
      properly, and that the drinking water provided complies with applicable 
      safe drinking water and health standards. EKOCENTER supports Coca-Cola&#8217;s 
      commitment to replenish the water used in its beverages and their 
      production, its 5by20 program to economically empower 5 million women 
      entrepreneurs across its value chain by 2020, and its continued 
      commitment to foster sustainable communities globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Slingshot water purification technology, developed by DEKA RD, 
      utilizes vapor compression distillation technology to turn nearly any 
      source of dirty water into safe drinking water. The Coca-Cola Company 
      announced a partnership with DEKA RD in September 2012 to install and 
      operate 1,500 Slingshot water purification systems in rural communities 
      in Africa, Asia and Latin America with pilots starting in South Africa, 
      Mexico and Paraguay in 2013.

      &#8220;One of the most difficult things to achieve in community-based projects

      J.P. Morgan to donate $50,000 for dual hurricane relief in Mexico

      The JPMorgan Chase Foundation announced that it will donate $50,000 to

      recover from destruction caused by Hurricanes Manuel and Ingrid, which 
      struck on the Pacific and Gulf coasts on September 15-16.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The grant will be divided evenly between World Vision, which is already 
      on the ground helping victims of the natural disaster, and the American 
      Red Cross, which is partnering with the Cruz Roja Mexicana to provide 
      technical assistance and fundraising support to respond to this

      the past 127 years and has always been a partner in the community. We 
      are especially pleased that this grant is enhanced by support from our 
      Mexico based staff, who are volunteering locally to provide relief.&#8221;

			Sonian Releases Cloud Archiving Solution for IBM Domino Servers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Archiving All Inbound/Outbound Email and Offloading Legacy Mail Data 
      to the Cloud
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sonian, 
      the pioneer in cloud-powered email archiving, today announced the 
      successful completion of its beta program for Central Archive, a 
      cloud-based email archiving solution for users of the IBM Domino mail 
      platform. After months of extensive testing, Sonian is now offering this 
      Domino mail archiving solution for general availability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud archiving is becoming an increasingly popular method of managing 
      the mountain of email communications, preserving that intellectual 
      property and, with Sonian&#8217;s fast and accurate search facility, making it 
      actionable in cases of audit, discovery, investigation or litigation. 
      Central Archive employs an easy-to-use on premise collector, which 
      resides on each Domino mail server, and forwards copies of all inbound 
      and outbound email (including all attachments) to the Amazon cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Sonian has maintained a long partnership with IBM and Central Archive 
      is a natural extension of that relationship. Now Domino users have a 
      secure, affordable, scalable archive which offloads data from Domino 
      servers, and makes it actionable," said Jack Dempsey,&#160;Vice President of 
      Product Management, Sonian. &#8220;Among the many pain points Sonian&#8217;s 
      solution addresses is enabling Domino server administrators to alleviate 
      on-premises mail storage burdens, including significant hardware and 
      software expenditures and the costs and complexity associated with 
      extensive discovery requests, particularly across large unstructured 
      datasets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, Sonian archives house more than 8 billion objects for more than 
      12,000 customers in 40 countries, and those cloud-based archives grow an 
      average of 300 gigabytes each day. Sonian is 100 percent web-based, 
      platform agnostic and can be deployed quickly to get companies up in 
      running in minutes to start realizing the cost savings and peace of mind 
      that come with secure, scalable data preservation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About SonianSonian&#8217;s cloud-powered information archiving 
      platform enables organizations to address early stage discovery needs, 
      achieve regulatory compliance, and reduce IT costs. Sonian&#8217;s archiving 
      services can be deployed in minutes, require no hardware or software,

      CTV-managed strategic investments prior to Fund V have supported a wide 
      range of companies and venture capital funds. Partner technologies are 
      used across Chevron&#8217;s Upstream and Downstream business units, producing 
      substantial earnings for the company. CTV screens more than 400 
      opportunities per year, selecting one to three companies in which to 
      invest. The company has a current portfolio of 37 companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA (Reuters) - U.S.-based Chevron Corp (CVX.N) will receive bids on September 30 from prospective buyers of three oil blocks in the Niger Delta, with several local Nigerian firms in the running, industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil industry sources estimate the mean value of the three blocks combined at $500 million to $600 million and anticipate winning bids will be around those levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in June it would be selling its 40 percent interest in five onshore blocks, joining Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Italy's Eni (ENI.MI) and France's Total (TOTF.PA) in selling stakes in Niger Delta assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. firm ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is also selling its Nigerian assets to Oando Energy (OANDO.LG) for $1.79 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron wants to sell OML 52, 53 and 55 to one buyer and suitors will have to pay 15 percent of bids on September 30, three sources close to the deals told Reuters. The firm will sell two other blocks, OML 82 and OML 85, in a separate bidding process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. firm did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three blocks have total oil reserves of around 134 million barrels and 5 trillion cubic feet of gas, two sources said. One company was willing to bid $1.7 billion for the assets but it was unlikely it was a credible buyer, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consortium bidders were more likely to be able to raise the financing necessary, sources said, and as with recent sales of Shell oil blocks, Nigerian firms, many in partnership with foreign companies, are likely to win most bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's South Atlantic Petroleum (SAPETRO), which already has joint ventures with Total and China's CNOOC, is expected to bid, as is First Hydrocarbon Nigeria, the local-arm of London-listed Afren (AFRE.L), two sources involved in the deals said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afren declined to comment and SAPETRO did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOCAL BIDDERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Nigeria has had a policy of encouraging more direct ownership of its oil and gas by Nigerians, either through the state oil company or local private firms. That has raised concerns among foreign oil majors they may lose smaller assets if they do not sell now, industry experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worries over oil theft, fraught relations with communities living around oil fields and uncertainty over a stalled bill to overhaul fiscal terms has also encouraged majors to sell down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Nigerian firms are backed by powerful political or business figures. The chairman of SAPETRO is General T.Y. Danjuma, a former minister of defense and chief of army staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEPLAT, which is partly owned by French oil explorer Maurel &amp; Prom (MAUP.PA) and Swiss-based commodity trader Mercuria, is expected to submit a bid, the sources said. SEPLAT did not respond to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indigenous Nigerian companies who already manage marginal fields in the delta, including Brittania-U, Vertex, Sogenal and Seven Energy have shown interest in the blocks, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns a 40 percent stake in 13 onshore blocks with Nigeria's state oil firm NNPC and also has deep offshore assets. Its 2012 net daily production in Nigeria averaged 238,000 barrels of crude oil and 165 million cubic feet of natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's NNPC, which owns the remaining 60 percent of the blocks Chevron is selling, has warned prospective buyers that although the U.S. firm currently operates production of the blocks, it has the right to hand over the handling of drilling to its subsidiary NPDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not having operatorship poses significant risks for would be investors in the fields, not least that NPDC is short on finance and expertise. It has usually had to call in a third-party to operate the blocks, pushing up costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa's biggest oil producer usually pumps 2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day of oil, most of which is exported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the sales of smaller onshore assets, oil majors like Shell, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron remain keen on expanding offshore Nigeria and want to keep hold of the biggest fields onshore, major pipelines and export terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sarah Young in London; editing by Tim Cocks and Keiron Henderson)&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Announces Data For XELJANZ&#174; 
      (tofacitinib citrate) In Rheumatoid Arthritis To Be Presented At The 
      American College Of Rheumatology 2013 Annual Meeting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Long-Term Safety and Efficacy Data of XELJANZ Up to Five Years 
      Will Be Presented
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that 20 abstracts for XELJANZ&#174; 
      (tofacitinib citrate), the first in a new class for the treatment of 
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, will be 
      presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) / Association of 
      Rheumatology Health Professionals (ARHP) 2013 Annual Meeting, which is 
      being held October 25-30 in San Diego, CA. XELJANZ is approved in the 
      United States for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely 
      active RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to 
      methotrexate, at a dose of 5 mg tablet twice daily.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These data add to the understanding of the efficacy and safety profile 
      of XELJANZ in the treatment of RA. XELJANZ was studied in a 
      comprehensive, global, multi-study program that included approximately 
      5,000 patients across Phase 2 and 3 trials in more than 40 countries, 
      resulting in 7,000 patient-years of exposure through 2011, the time of 
      regulatory submission. These data further inform rheumatologists who are 
      prescribing or considering prescribing XELJANZ for appropriate patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among the analyses being presented are open-label safety and efficacy 
      data up to five years in long-term extension (LTE) studies; integrated 
      and post-hoc analyses of safety data; and post-hoc safety and efficacy 
      analyses of clinical trial sub-populations, notably one that analyzed 
      the safety profile and efficacy of XELJANZ in U.S. patients versus 
      patients from the Rest of World (ROW). More details on these abstracts 
      are found below.

			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				XELJANZ can lower the ability of the immune system to fight 
        infections. Some people have serious infections while taking XELJANZ, 
        including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, 
        or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died 
        from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for 
        TB before starting XELJANZ, and monitor them closely for signs and 
        symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should 
        not start taking XELJANZ if they have any kind of infection unless 
        their healthcare provider tells them it is okay.
			
			
				XELJANZ may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the 
        way the immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancer can happen in 
        patients taking XELJANZ.
			
			
        Some people taking XELJANZ get tears in their stomach or intestines. 
        Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have 
        fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away, or a change in 
        bowel habits.
      
			
        XELJANZ can cause changes in certain lab test results including low 
        blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in 
        cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before 
        starting patients on XELJANZ and while they are taking XELJANZ, to 
        check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important 
        to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ treatment 
        because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results.
      
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become 
        pregnant or are pregnant.

        &lt;p&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          It is not known if XELJANZ will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the 
          outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ, a registry has been 
          established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and 
          pregnant women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 
          1-877-311-8972.
        &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to 
        breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare 
        provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ or breastfeed. They 
        should not do both.
      
			
        In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the 
        liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ. Healthcare 
        providers may do blood tests for hepatitis before and during treatment 
        with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common 
        cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, nasal congestion, sore 
        throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			About XELJANZ
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) 
      inhibitor. XELJANZ is used to treat adults with moderately to severely 
      active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in people with 
        Hepatitis B or C.
      
			
        XELJANZ is not for people with severe liver problems.
      
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in children.

			About Rheumatoid Arthritis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RA is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that typically affects 
      the hands and feet, although any joint lined by a synovial membrane may 
      be affected. RA affects approximately 1.6 million Americans1,2 and 
      23.7 million people worldwide.3 Although multiple treatments 
      are available, many patients do not adequately respond. Specifically, up 
      to one-third of patients do not adequately respond and about half stop 
      responding to any particular non-biologic disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drug (DMARD) within five years.4,5,6,7,8,9 There 
      remains a need for additional therapeutic options.

&lt;p&gt;* Reserves: 134 mln oil barrels, 5 trln cubic feet gas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Nigerian firms, partnered with foreign firms, to bid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Afren, Maurel &amp; Prom have interest in bids - sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Joe Brock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S.-based Chevron Corp 
will receive bids on Sept. 30 from prospective buyers of three
oil blocks in the Niger Delta, with several local Nigerian firms
in the running, industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil industry sources estimate the mean value of the three
blocks combined at $500 mln to $600 mln and anticipate winning
bids will be around those levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in June it would be selling its 40 percent
interest in five onshore blocks, joining Royal Dutch Shell
, Italy's Eni and France's Total in
selling stakes in Niger Delta assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. firm ConocoPhillips is also selling its
Nigerian assets to Oando Energy for $1.79 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron wants to sell OML 52, 53 and 55 to one buyer and
suitors will have to pay 15 percent of bids on Sept. 30, three
sources close to the deals told Reuters. The firm will sell two
other blocks, OML 82 and OML 85, in a separate bidding process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. firm did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three blocks have total oil reserves of around 134
million barrels and 5 trillion cubic feet of gas, two sources
said. One company was willing to bid $1.7 billion for the assets
but it was unlikely it was a credible buyer, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consortium bidders were more likely to be able to raise the
financing necessary, sources said, and as with recent sales of
Shell oil blocks, Nigerian firms, many in partnership with
foreign companies, are likely to win most bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's South Atlantic Petroleum (SAPETRO), which already
has joint ventures with Total and China's CNOOC, is expected to
bid, as is First Hydrocarbon Nigeria, the local-arm of
London-listed Afren, two sources involved in the deals
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afren declined to comment and SAPETRO did not respond to a
request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOCAL BIDDERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Nigeria has had a policy of encouraging more
direct ownership of its oil and gas by Nigerians, either through
the state oil company or local private firms. That has raised
concerns among foreign oil majors they may lose smaller assets
if they do not sell now, industry experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worries over oil theft, fraught relations with communities
living around oil fields and uncertainty over a stalled bill to
overhaul fiscal terms has also encouraged majors to sell down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Nigerian firms are backed by powerful political or
business figures. The chairman of SAPETRO is General T.Y.
Danjuma, a former minister of defence and chief of army staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEPLAT, which is partly owned by French oil explorer Maurel
&amp; Prom and Swiss-based commodity trader Mercuria, is
expected to submit a bid, the sources said. SEPLAT did not
respond to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indigenous Nigerian companies who already manage marginal
fields in the delta, including Brittania-U, Vertex, Sogenal and
Seven Energy have shown interest in the blocks, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns a 40 percent stake in 13 onshore blocks with
Nigeria's state oil firm NNPC and also has deep offshore assets.
Its 2012 net daily production in Nigeria averaged 238,000
barrels of crude oil and 165 million cubic feet of natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's NNPC, which owns the remaining 60 percent of the
blocks Chevron is selling, has warned prospective buyers that
although the U.S. firm currently operates production of the
blocks, it has the right to hand over the handling of drilling
to its subsidiary NPDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not having operatorship poses significant risks for would be
investors in the fields, not least that NPDC is short on finance
and expertise. It has usually had to call in a third-party to
operate the blocks, pushing up costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa's biggest oil producer usually pumps 2 million to 2.5
million barrels per day of oil, most of which is exported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the sales of smaller onshore assets, oil majors like
Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron remain keen on expanding
offshore Nigeria and want to keep hold of the biggest fields
onshore, major pipelines and export terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia is discussing internally whether to approach French rival Alcatel-Lucent about a tie-up, part of the Finnish company's review of how it can grow after the planned sale of its handset business to Microsoft Corp, several people close to the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No formal talks are underway with Alcatel-Lucent, the sources said. One of the people close to the matter said Nokia held "on again, off again" discussions about buying Alcatel's wireless business as recently as late 2012 and that the two companies could still come back to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation over a combination between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent goes back several years, as both have struggled to compete with market leader Ericsson and low-cost Asian network equipment rivals Huawei and ZTE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced on September 3 that it will buy Nokia's phone business and license its patents for 5.44 billion euros ($7.3 billion). Nokia has said it will evaluate strategy for its remaining operations before the deal closes. Those businesses include a mapping software unit called HERE and a portfolio of patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finnish phone maker once dominated the global market but has had its mobile business ravaged by nimbler rivals Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, under the leadership of interim CEO Risto Siilasmaa, has already begun internal discussions on future strategy, the sources said, adding that a decision could be months away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Nokia, its network equipment unit, Nokia Solutions and Networks, and Alcatel-Lucent declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia is in a "period of reflection trying to figure out what they want to do," one of the sources said. They said there were possibilities for Nokia such as having "the option to buy the entire Alcatel-Lucent, or just the wireless business ... Nothing is imminent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROCEEDS FROM MICROSOFT DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any formal dialogue around a combination would likely be held after Nokia receives proceeds from the Microsoft deal, which is expected to strengthen its financial position and boost its credit rating to investment grade from junk status, the people close to the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft deal would leave Nokia with its Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) unit as the main business generating around 90 percent of the company's sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most likely deal may be for Nokia to buy Alcatel's wireless division, which includes a big presence in the lucrative U.S. market where NSN has traditionally been weak, one of the sources said. That would leave Alcatel-Lucent to focus its fast-growing IP routing and optical business, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts put the value of Alcatel's wireless business at between 1.1 billion euros to 1.5 billion euros ($1.49 billion to $2.03 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination with Alcatel-Lucent would increase NSN's market share in the global wireless infrastructure market from 18 percent to more than 30 percent, leapfrogging Huawei and closing in on Ericsson, according to analyst data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While telecommunications operators around the world have been upgrading their infrastructure in response to consumer demand for faster mobile Internet connections, equipment makers have been under pressure to sell more for less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressure led to a round of mergers in 2006 and 2007, out of which were born Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia Siemens Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSN, which was a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens from 2007 until Nokia bought out the German company's stake in early July, announced in 2011 that it would focus on wireless network infrastructure to help turn the company around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has since shed more than a quarter of its workforce, and by the end of 2012 it was contributing to Nokia's cash flow instead of draining it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent, which has been unable to post regular profits and generate cash since 2006, also announced a new restructuring plan in June, under its new chief executive Michel Combes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia is likely to be highly cautious when considering any kind of offer for Alcatel-Lucent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With shares of the French company up about 130 percent this year, the Alcatel chief executive is currently not in any rush to strike a deal, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were other issues that could stand in the way of a deal, such as the risk of intervention by the French government to protect Alcatel or limit job cuts, one of the sources familiar with Nokia's thinking said. The French state owns 3.6 percent of Alcatel-Lucent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia also may not be the only company interested in buying some of Alcatel's assets. Other network equipment makers such as Juniper Networks and Ericsson have also recently eyed Alcatel-Lucent or some of its assets, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ericsson and Juniper declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nicola Leske in New York and Leila Abboud in Paris, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Grant McCool)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is in talks with government officials to settle federal and state mortgage probes for $11 billion, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum could include $7 billion in cash and $4 billion for consumers, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks are fluid and the $11 billion amount could change, the people familiar with the matter said.

regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the London whale trades were just one of many missteps
that has drawn regulatory scrutiny. The largest U.S. bank has
disclosed more than a dozen probes globally in recent filings,
including an investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice
in California that preliminarily concluded that JPMorgan
violated securities laws in selling subprime mortgage bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Department of Justice lawyers from other areas of the
country and state authorities have been investigating JPMorgan's
liability for mortgage securities sold by two other companies it
acquired during the financial crisis, Bear Stearns and
Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks to reach a global settlement on the mortgage
issues heated up this week after U.S. Department of Justice
officials in California told the bank that it was preparing to
file a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York prosecutor's office is participating in the
talks because it is part of a working group formed by President
Barack Obama in January 2012 to investigate misconduct in
mortgage securities that contributed to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the bank, the biggest in the United States by assets,
the sums being discussed are painful but manageable. The company
reported net income of $21.3 billion last year and analysts have
estimated that profits this year will be higher. At the end of
June, the bank's net worth, as measured by the accounting value
of its assets minus liabilities, was about $209 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAKING A TOLL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan generates so much excess capital from its
operations that its board, with approval of regulators, 
authorized spending $6 billion to buy back stock in the 12
months through next March. That buyback was conditioned on the
bank improving the way it calculates its capital needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the investigations have taken a toll. Before the
London Whale debacle, regulators had given the bank approval to
buy back stock at twice the current rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has spent about $5 billion a year on legal costs the
past two years, largely because of the London Whale debacle and
because of mishandling of mortgage loans and mortgage
securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two government regulators in January issued public
orders that the bank improve its risk and operational controls,
as well as its anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act
processes, CEO Dimon said the bank had postponed projects that
would have buildtits business so that it could put its house in
order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has added 4,000 staff to its control groups since
2012 - three quarters of them this year - and increased spending
on those efforts by about $1 billion. The bank's control group
includes risk, compliance, legal, finance, technology, oversight
and control and audit functions. Dimon pointed out the efforts
in a memo to employees last week in which he warned that the
company was about to face more bad publicity. [ID:nL2N0HD0PK}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's chief financial officer said earlier this month 
that many types of loans on its books are performing better, but
mounting legal costs will prevent those gains from boosting
profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were up 2.7 percent at the close of New York
Stock Exchange trading on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia is discussing internally whether to approach French rival Alcatel-Lucent about a tie-up, part of the Finnish company's review of how it can grow after the planned sale of its handset business to Microsoft Corp, several people close to the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No formal talks are underway with Alcatel-Lucent, the sources said. One of the people close to the matter said Nokia held "on again, off again" discussions about buying Alcatel's wireless business as recently as late 2012 and that the two companies could still come back to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation over a combination between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent goes back several years, as both have struggled to compete with market leader Ericsson and low-cost Asian network equipment rivals Huawei and ZTE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced on September 3 that it will buy Nokia's phone business and license its patents for 5.44 billion euros ($7.3 billion). Nokia has said it will evaluate strategy for its remaining operations before the deal closes. Those businesses include a mapping software unit called HERE and a portfolio of patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finnish phone maker once dominated the global market but has had its mobile business ravaged by nimbler rivals Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, under the leadership of interim CEO Risto Siilasmaa, has already begun internal discussions on future strategy, the sources said, adding that a decision could be months away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the sources asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Nokia, its network equipment unit, Nokia Solutions and Networks, and Alcatel-Lucent declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia is in a "period of reflection trying to figure out what they want to do," one of the sources said. They said there were possibilities for Nokia such as having "the option to buy the entire Alcatel-Lucent, or just the wireless business ... Nothing is imminent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROCEEDS FROM MICROSOFT DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any formal dialogue around a combination would likely be held after Nokia receives proceeds from the Microsoft deal, which is expected to strengthen its financial position and boost its credit rating to investment grade from junk status, the people close to the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft deal would leave Nokia with its Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) unit as the main business generating around 90 percent of the company's sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most likely deal may be for Nokia to buy Alcatel's wireless division, which includes a big presence in the lucrative U.S. market where NSN has traditionally been weak, one of the sources said. That would leave Alcatel-Lucent to focus its fast-growing IP routing and optical business, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts put the value of Alcatel's wireless business at between 1.1 billion euros to 1.5 billion euros ($1.49 billion to $2.03 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination with Alcatel-Lucent would increase NSN's market share in the global wireless infrastructure market from 18 percent to more than 30 percent, leapfrogging Huawei and closing in on Ericsson, according to analyst data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While telecommunications operators around the world have been upgrading their infrastructure in response to consumer demand for faster mobile Internet connections, equipment makers have been under pressure to sell more for less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressure led to a round of mergers in 2006 and 2007, out of which were born Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia Siemens Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSN, which was a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens from 2007 until Nokia bought out the German company's stake in early July, announced in 2011 that it would focus on wireless network infrastructure to help turn the company around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has since shed more than a quarter of its workforce, and by the end of 2012 it was contributing to Nokia's cash flow instead of draining it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent, which has been unable to post regular profits and generate cash since 2006, also announced a new restructuring plan in June, under its new chief executive Michel Combes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia is likely to be highly cautious when considering any kind of offer for Alcatel-Lucent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With shares of the French company up about 130 percent this year, the Alcatel chief executive is currently not in any rush to strike a deal, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were other issues that could stand in the way of a deal, such as the risk of intervention by the French government to protect Alcatel or limit job cuts, one of the sources familiar with Nokia's thinking said. The French state owns 3.6 percent of Alcatel-Lucent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia also may not be the only company interested in buying some of Alcatel's assets. Other network equipment makers such as Juniper Networks and Ericsson have also recently eyed Alcatel-Lucent or some of its assets, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ericsson and Juniper declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nicola Leske in New York and Leila Abboud in Paris, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Grant McCool)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Robert Cyran
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Bill Gates should follow Steve Ballmer out of Microsoft. Allowing Ballmer to buy Nokia&#8217;s smartphone business as he exits will saddle his replacement with a flawed strategy. The company&#8217;s founder and chairman bears some responsibility for this and other missteps. With under 5 percent of the shares &#8211; scarcely more than Ballmer owns &#8211; Gates matters more to his charitable foundation than to Microsoft these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sense, it&#8217;s sacrilegious to suggest Gates and the software behemoth he started part ways. He understands technology like few others and has demonstrated the acumen to create a huge business, now worth some $270 billion. With about $12.4 billion of stock, he is also still the biggest single shareholder and, given the long personal association, he surely cares about Microsoft&#8217;s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet his many talents don&#8217;t include effectiveness as chairman. Under his leadership, Microsoft&#8217;s board left Ballmer in place too long. Now that the CEO is to retire within a year, Gates doesn&#8217;t have a replacement ready, an important task for any chairman. The board let Ballmer waste money chasing consumer markets and hardware, with the company&#8217;s online services business losing $12 billion over the past three years alone. Directors also just sanctioned the purchase of Nokia&#8217;s smartphone operations for $7.2 billion, locking Ballmer&#8217;s successor into manufacturing devices &#8211; hardly a Microsoft strength to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True, during the last decade of Ballmer&#8217;s 13-year tenure the maturing company has returned more than $180 billion to investors, far more than any of its technology peers. Profit has also risen sharply. Despite this and Ballmer&#8217;s passion, evident at Microsoft&#8217;s annual investor meeting last week, shareholders just don&#8217;t seem to believe in the company&#8217;s strategy, developed with Ballmer and Gates in charge. Over 10 years, Microsoft shares are barely higher. By comparison, with the odd exception like Hewlett-Packard, the likes of Apple, Google, Oracle and IBM have recorded big gains. The Nasdaq index has roughly doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates&#8217; primary interest also arguably lies elsewhere these days. He stopped working full-time at Microsoft five years ago. The $38 billion endowment of his charitable foundation dwarfs his Microsoft holding. Improving education and preventing disease worldwide may also seem more compelling these days than deciding whether a sprawling company should build tablet computers. Ballmer&#8217;s belated departure offers Gates a window of opportunity. The world might be better off with his full attention on the foundation &#8211; and so would Microsoft&#8217;s investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds short interest, Sterne Agee note, updates share price)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept 25 (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc shares
tumbled to their lowest in nearly 13 years on Wednesday after
Goldman Sachs said it expects sales at the struggling department
store chain to improve more slowly than expected and raised

likely showing a slower-than-expected improvement," Goldman said
in a research note on Penney's credit, referring to the current
and final quarters, which include the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also said the overall difficult environment for
retailing is "increasing the risk of a poor holiday season that
the company can ill afford."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weak business fundamentals, the need to rebuild inventory of
goods popular with its long-time customers and the poor
performance of its home goods department will likely put

"encouraging." Penney did not immediately return a request for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters, 35 percent of Penney shares

Stewart Living Omnimedia against Macy's Inc over Penney's deal
to sell items designed by Stewart and bearing her name in its

      Deutsche Asset  Wealth Management

			GSAM Increases Focus on Defined Contribution Business
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Sachs Asset Management (&#8220;GSAM&#8221;) announced today it has entered 
      into an agreement with Deutsche Asset  Wealth Management (&#8220;DeAWM&#8221;) to 
      acquire DeAWM&#8217;s stable value* business, with total assets under 
      supervision of $21.6 billion as of June 30, 2013. The transaction 
      represents the latest step by GSAM to grow its defined contribution (DC) 
      franchise following last year&#8217;s acquisition of Dwight Asset Management 
      (&#8220;Dwight&#8221;), a premier stable value asset manager based in Burlington, VT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;GSAM&#8217;s acquisition of DeAWM&#8217;s stable value business affirms our strong 
      commitment to providing defined contribution plan participants with 
      capital preservation investment options,&#8221; said Eric S. Lane and Timothy 
      J. O&#8217;Neill, co-heads of the Investment Management Division at Goldman 
      Sachs. &#8220;The expert talent and potential client relationships that we 
      gain from this transaction will complement our existing stable value 
      business.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jerry W. Miller, Head of DeAWM Americas, said: "We are investing 
      significantly in our Americas business and are committed to providing 
      clients with an enhanced range of investment solutions across fixed 
      income, equity and alternative asset classes. As we focus on growing the 
      rest of our platform, we have opted not to participate in the 
      consolidation of the stable value sector. Consequently, we are pleased 
      with the sale of our stable value business to one of the leaders in the 
      space."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This transaction follows GSAM&#8217;s July 2013 announcement of its intent to 
      establish a new stable value collective trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of this transaction, John Axtell, DeAWM&#8217;s Head of Stable Value, 
      and other key members of the DeAWM stable value management team will 
      join GSAM. Prior to the closing, DeAWM will be working with clients to 
      ensure a seamless transition to GSAM or other stable value managers. 
      GSAM currently manages over $55 billion in defined contribution 
      mandates, including more than $34 billion in stable value assets under 
      supervision.**
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Subject to certain conditions, the transaction is expected to close 
      during the first quarter of 2014.

			4.7 Billion Mobile WebRTC Devices by 2018 Despite Lack of Open 
      Support from Apple and Microsoft, Says ABI Research
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Even though Apple and Microsoft haven&#8217;t commented on the new open source 
      technology which delivers high quality audio and video capabilities to 
      desktop and mobile browsers, major carriers such as ATT and Telef&#243;nica, 
      leading infrastructure providers like Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson and 
      new WebRTC application providers in likes of Teledini and NetDev are 
      driving the technology forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research analyst, Sabir Rafiq comments, &#8220;WebRTC brings many 
      opportunities; ABI Research believes major trends will start to form 
      within the enterprise market with WebRTC. Companies will be willing to 
      implement the new technology to aid productivity and reduce 
      communication barriers within the workplace.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ABI Research recognizes that there are significant barriers in the way 
      of WebRTC technology becoming widely adopted. Firstly, Apple is not 
      showing any interest in WebRTC, similar to its approach to Adobe Flash. 
      As it is a brand leader in the mobile space, this could impact short 
      term opportunity. Microsoft&#8217;s alternative to WebRTC, the CU-RTC, could 
      deter users away from WebRTC and should essentially be considered a 
      competitor. In the end, we believe Apple and Microsoft will not ignore 
      the market opportunity for WebRTC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

store chain to improve more slowly than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock slid as much as 16.5 percent to $9.94, the lowest
since January 2001, before easing to $10.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penney has struggled since it eliminated coupons and sales
events, favored by its price-conscious shoppers, last year,
leading to a 25 percent decline in sales in 2012. Improvement
has been slow in coming, with sales again dropping in the first
and second quarters of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect 3Q and 4Q to be difficult, with comp store sales
likely showing a slower-than-expected improvement," Goldman said
in a research note on Penney's credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also noted the overall difficult environment for
retailing is "increasing the risk of a poor holiday season that
the company can ill afford."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Penney got a $2.25 billion loan arranged
by Goldman to shore up its finances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source told Reuters last week that the retailer was
looking to raise more money, possibly through a combination of
debt and equity, according to a source familiar with the matter.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A unit of hedge fund Citadel LLC and a spinoff of Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday they will join forces in a bid to create a seamless passage for an order from inception to clearinghouse by bridging the disparate worlds of traders and asset managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Rosneft on Wednesday
dismissed Gazprom's opposition to its liquefied natural gas

&lt;p&gt;Victor Timoshilov, the head of the company's Oriental

ready to continue talks with Exxon about gas purchases from the
Exxon-operated Sakhalin-1 project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year,  Rosneft and ExxonMobil agreed on a $15
billion LNG project in Russia's Far East to supply Asia-Pacific
markets that would challenge Gazprom's monopoly on Russian gas
exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that the project is a superfluous... They don't
have to build the plant, the infrastructure is already in
place," Timoshilov told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, only one LNG-producing plant is operating in
Russia - the 10 million tonnes per year Sakhalin-2 project built
by Shell, in which Gazprom acquired a controlling stake
several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday rejected a bid by Ecuadorean villagers to remove a judge overseeing a trial next month in a decades-old dispute between the villagers and Chevron Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the trial, Chevron is seeking to prove that the Ecuadoreans and a lawyer who works on their behalf used fraud and bribery to obtain an $18 billion pollution award against Chevron in an Ecuadorean court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Ecuadoreans have said U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the upcoming trial, has disregarded a ruling in their favor by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and asked for him to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a brief order on Thursday, a three-judge panel of the appeals court denied the request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judges gave no reasoning in their order, but at a hearing hours earlier the judges suggested the request was premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadoreans will be able to appeal if they lose at trial, Circuit Judge Barrington Parker said at the hearing. "You can come back here and get that judgment set aside," Parker said. "If you're right, you'll win."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another circuit judge, Debra Ann Livingston, questioned what was "so extraordinary" to warrant action by the appeals court before the trial, scheduled for October 15, has even started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Gowen, a lawyer for the Ecuadoreans, said the 2nd Circuit's ruling had failed to stop an "impending travesty" of justice, and called on Kaplan to empanel a jury rather than decide the case alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Crinklaw, a spokesman for Chevron, said the company is pleased with the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case stems from environmental contamination in the Amazon jungle between 1964 and 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorean court awarded the plaintiffs - people affected by the contamination - $18 billion in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That year, Kaplan issued an injunction blocking enforcement of the judgment.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co CEO Jamie Dimon met with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday, seeking to make sure a possible $11 billion settlement will end the bank's pain from mortgage-securities probes, a source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is close to settling many of the probes into how it sold mortgage bonds before the financial crisis, but Dimon fears that as soon as this deal is worked out other investigations will emerge, the person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unusual for a CEO of a company to meet with the head of the U.S. Justice Department. But the bank is seeking to tamp down its legal problems as it fends off a spate of probes covering everything from possibly illegal nepotism in China to whether it hid losses from its disastrous "London whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the mortgage front, the Department of Justice in California, New Jersey and Philadelphia has been looking into mortgages that the bank packaged into bonds before the financial crisis. Meanwhile, government-owned home finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been pressuring JPMorgan to buy back mortgage bonds that they said the bank should not have sold them. Those claims and the investigation in California would be the two biggest pieces of any deal, another source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the meeting at the U.S. Justice Department, which lasted about an hour, Holder told reporters that he had met with representatives of JPMorgan but did not mention Dimon by name. He declined to give details of the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a news conference on an unrelated topic, the attorney general also said the Justice Department plans to make announcements about financial cases in the coming weeks and months. A source familiar with the matter said a JPMorgan mortgage deal could come within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has already paid billions of dollars this year to resolve probes into areas including power market manipulation and failing to supervise employees that lost $6 billion from the London whale trades. Many investors see the heat on the bank as evidence of Dimon's dysfunctional relationship with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of JPMorgan's board of directors said on Thursday at a conference in Chicago that the company is determined to make amends and improve its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got these things that we actually are guilty of and we've got to fix them," said Labon Jackson, the head of the audit committee on JPMorgan's board of directors. "It's embarrassing for the board."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank avoided the worst losses in the financial crisis but has been under intense scrutiny since May 2012, when it said it was losing money on derivatives bets that became known as the "London Whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNUSUAL BUT NOT UNPRECEDENTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's settlement talks heated up this week following a threat by the Justice Department to file a lawsuit over a mortgage probe being led by federal authorities in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal sources said high-level meetings between corporate executives and the U.S. attorney general are unusual but not unprecedented, especially as big investigations move toward resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conversations are difficult for a U.S. Attorney General, because he or she often does not want to be seen internally as caving to pressure from people or companies being prosecuted, said a former senior employee at the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting between Dimon and Holder, the highest-ranking U.S. law enforcement official, marks another step in the nation's attempts to sort out responsibility for the financial crisis that hit five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two men were backed in the meeting by top advisors. Dimon brought with him the bank's general counsel, Steve Cutler, and outside counsel Rodgin Cohen, a partner with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, according to a source familiar with the matter. Joining Holder was Deputy Attorney General James Cole and Associate Attorney General Tony West, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations this week have involved JPMorgan paying as much as $7 billion in cash and $4 billion in consumer relief to settle several investigations - a hefty sum, but representing little more than half of the bank's 2012 profit of $21 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A settlement in the $11 billion range would likely include claims from the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which has sought some $6 billion from the bank over risky mortgage securities sold to the government-sponsored entities, according to two people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Attorney General's office has been participating in those talks because it is part of a working group formed by President Barack Obama in January 2012 to investigate misconduct in mortgage securities that contributed to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks have been described as "fluid" and filled with uncertainties over exactly which claims against the bank would be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's litigation costs totaled $17.3 billion over the last three calendar years, according to the company's annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases that prosecutors are working on include probes of the mortgage businesses of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, two failing banks that JPMorgan bought during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman also sued the bank last October over mortgage-backed securities packaged and sold by Bear Stearns. It was not clear if JPMorgan would be able to include the New York state lawsuit in the settlement being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry, Emily Flitter and Karen Freifeld in New York, David Ingram and Aruna Viswanatha in Washington and Ross Kerber in Chicago; Editing by Matthew Goldstein, John Wallace and Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

mortgage deal could come within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has already paid billions of dollars this year to
resolve probes into areas including power market manipulation
and failing to supervise employees that lost $6 billion from the
London whale trades. Many investors see the heat on the bank as
evidence of Dimon's dysfunctional relationship with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of JPMorgan's board of directors said on Thursday
at a conference in Chicago that the company is determined to
make amends and improve its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got these things that we actually are guilty of and
we've got to fix them," said Labon Jackson, the head of the
audit committee on JPMorgan's board of directors. "It's
embarrassing for the board."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank avoided the worst losses in the financial crisis
but has been under intense scrutiny since May 2012, when it said
it was losing money on derivatives bets that became known as the
"London Whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNUSUAL BUT NOT UNPRECEDENTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's settlement talks heated up this week following a
threat by the Justice Department to file a lawsuit over a
mortgage probe being led by federal authorities in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal sources said high-level meetings between corporate
executives and the U.S. attorney general are unusual but not
unprecedented, especially as big investigations move toward
resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conversations are difficult for a U.S. Attorney
General, because he or she often does not want to be seen
internally as caving to pressure from people or companies being
prosecuted, said a former senior employee at the Justice
Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting between Dimon and Holder, the highest-ranking
U.S. law enforcement official, marks another step in the
nation's attempts to sort out responsibility for the financial
crisis that hit five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two men were backed in the meeting by top advisors.
Dimon brought with him the bank's general counsel, Steve Cutler,
and outside counsel Rodgin Cohen, a partner with Sullivan &amp;
Cromwell, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Joining Holder was Deputy Attorney General James Cole and
Associate Attorney General Tony West, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations this week have involved JPMorgan paying as much
as $7 billion in cash and $4 billion in consumer relief to
settle several investigations - a hefty sum, but representing
little more than half of the bank's 2012 profit of $21 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A settlement in the $11 billion range would likely include
claims from the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which
has sought some $6 billion from the bank over risky mortgage
securities sold to the government-sponsored entities, according
to two people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Attorney General's office has been 
participating in those talks because it is part of a working
group formed by President Barack Obama in January 2012 to
investigate misconduct in mortgage securities that contributed
to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks have been described as "fluid" and filled with
uncertainties over exactly which claims against the bank would
be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's litigation costs totaled $17.3 billion over the
last three calendar years, according to the company's annual
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases that prosecutors are working on include probes of
the mortgage businesses of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual,
two failing banks that JPMorgan bought during the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman also sued the
bank last October over mortgage-backed securities packaged and
sold by Bear Stearns. It was not clear if JPMorgan would be able
to include the New York state lawsuit in the settlement being
discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on JPMorgan Commercial 
      Mortgage Finance Corp. Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, 
      JPMCC 2013-INN.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$287,700,000 class A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$488,750,000* class X-CP 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$66,300,000 class D 'BBB-sf; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$74,000,000 class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      *Notional and interest only.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expected ratings are based upon information received by the issuer 
      as of Sept. 19, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates in this transaction represent the beneficial interest 
      in a trust that holds a $575 million mortgage loan secured by 51 hotel 
      properties with a total of 6,844 keys located in 16 states across the 
      U.S. The loan is sponsored by a joint venture between Cerberus Capital 
      Management, L.P. and Chatham Lodging Trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moderate Trust Leverage: Fitch's stressed DSCR and loan to value ratio 
      (LTV) for the trust component of the debt are 1.37x and 77.9%, 
      respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Single-Borrower Hotel Concentration: The transaction is primarily 
      secured by 51 extended stay, limited service, and full service hotel 
      properties. Hotel performance is considered to be more volatile due to 
      the lodging sector's operating nature.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portfolio Performance: After experiencing two years of year-over-year 
      revenue per available room (RevPAR) declines, the portfolio's 
      year-over-year RevPAR performance turned positive beginning in 2010. 
      Subsequently, portfolio RevPAR grew 5.1% in 2011 and 10% in 2012. 
      Overall, the portfolio's TTM (as of July 2013) RevPAR performance is 
      approximately 5.3% above its previous peak performance in 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Diversity: The portfolio exhibits significant geographic diversity 
      across 32 markets in 16 states. The largest state exposure is California 
      with 10 hotels representing 37.3% by allocated loan amount. No single 
      hotel contributes more than 6.8% of net cash flow (NCF). The portfolio 
      is comprised of eight different franchise flags, with the Marriott 
      Extended Stay brand (Residence Inn) being the majority, serving as the 
      flag for 68.8% (by loan balance) of the total portfolio.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Asset Quality and Age: The 51 properties comprising the portfolio have 
      an average age of 25 years (built from 1963 to 2006) and have generally 
      been renovated most recently between 2007 and 2012. The portfolio 
      demonstrates little performance differentiation based on property age. 
      The portfolio's assets are well maintained, with $141.8 million ($20,716 
      per key) of capital improvements spent from 2007 to 2012. In addition, 
      $96.6 million ($14,113 per key) in capital improvements are budgeted 
      through 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 77.2% decline in value and 
      an approximately 63% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing $1 of loss to the 'AAAsf' rated class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings of class A (rated 'AAAsf' 
      by Fitch) and found that a 17% decline in Fitch NCF would result in a 
      one category downgrade, while a 46% decline would result in a downgrade 
      to below investment grade. The Rating Sensitivity section in the presale 
      report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and 
      sensitivities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report. The presale report is available to all 
      investors on Fitch's web site 'www.fitchratings.com'.

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has been sued by a Singapore businessman for allegedly giving misleading advice that cost him 3.18 billion yen ($32.22 million) in losses on currency options, according to court documents seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oei Hong Leong, ranked 32nd on Singapore's rich list by Forbes with a net worth of $745 million, wants Goldman to compensate him for the losses as well as pay him interest and costs. Oei also wants the court to award him damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has rejected Oei's claim, with a spokeswoman in Hong Kong saying, "We believe the lawsuit is without merit and we intend to vigorously contest it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oei said in a statement of claim that he had on May 15 made two bets that the Brazilian currency will appreciate against the yen on the advice of a Hong Kong-based Goldman banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oei, who had been betting that the U.S. dollar will rise against the Japanese currency, claimed that the Goldman banker, Mats Dewitte, had told him the real was anchored to the dollar and that by switching from the greenback, he would also benefit from higher interest rates earned on the Brazilian unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many clients are turning to EMFX/Yen plays instead of USDJPY to earn greater carry/yield ... BRL vs USD volatility is low because the central bank is anchoring BRL to USD," Oei quoted Dewitte as saying in an email that the businessman reproduced in a claim dated September 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMFX refers to emerging markets foreign exchange, while BRL and USD are the codes for the Brazilian and U.S. currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke raised the prospect of ratcheting down the Fed's economic stimulus in late May, the Brazilian real has been one of the biggest losers among emerging market currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dewitte and the law firm representing Oei declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oei had in 2009 sued Citigroup's private banking arm for alleged negligence and misrepresentation after he made an estimated loss of S$1 billion ($798 million) on foreign exchange and U.S. Treasury bond transactions in 2008. That case was subsequently settled out of court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Kevin Lim; Editing by Ryan Woo)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Laura Philomin and Saeed Azhar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has been
sued by a Singapore businessman for allegedly giving misleading
advice that cost him 3.18 billion yen ($32.22 million) in losses
on currency options, according to court documents seen by
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oei Hong Leong, ranked 32nd on Singapore's rich list by
Forbes with a net worth of $745 million, wants Goldman to
compensate him for the losses as well as pay him interest and
costs. Oei also wants the court to award him damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has rejected Oei's claim, with a spokeswoman in Hong
Kong saying, "We believe the lawsuit is without merit and we
intend to vigorously contest it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oei said in a statement of claim that he had on May 15 made
two bets that the Brazilian currency will appreciate against the
yen on the advice of a Hong Kong-based Goldman banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oei, who had been betting that the U.S. dollar will rise
against the Japanese currency, claimed that the Goldman banker,
Mats Dewitte, had told him the real was anchored to the dollar
and that by switching from the greenback, he would also benefit
from higher interest rates earned on the Brazilian unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many clients are turning to EMFX/Yen plays instead of
USDJPY to earn greater carry/yield ... BRL vs USD volatility is
low because the central bank is anchoring BRL to USD," Oei
quoted Dewitte as saying in an email that the businessman
reproduced in a claim dated Sept. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMFX refers to emerging markets foreign exchange, while BRL
and USD are the codes for the Brazilian and U.S. currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke raised the
prospect of ratcheting down the Fed's economic stimulus in late
May, the Brazilian real has been one of the biggest losers among
emerging market currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dewitte and the law firm representing Oei declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oei had in 2009 sued Citigroup's private banking arm for
alleged negligence and misrepresentation after he made an
estimated loss of S$1 billion ($798 million) on foreign exchange
and U.S. Treasury bond transactions in 2008. That case was
subsequently settled out of court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 98.6900 Japanese yen)

      Next Generation of Dental Professionals
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Students Receive Scholarships for Their Commitment to Improving the 
      Oral Health of the Hispanic Community
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Procter  Gamble&#8217;s Oral Health Group (Crest) and the Hispanic Dental 
      Association Foundation (HDAF) are proud to announce the recipients of 
      their annual scholarship program on the first day of the Hispanic Dental 
      Association (HDA) Annual Meeting, which brings together the largest 
      gathering of U.S. Hispanic oral health professionals. These scholarships 
      were awarded to 16 entry-level U.S. Hispanic students who have been 
      accepted into an accredited dental, dental hygiene, dental assisting, or 
      dental technician programs. Each of these individuals was judged on 
      their demonstration of scholastic achievement, community service, 
      leadership skills and commitment to improving health in the Hispanic 
      community.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are proud to have partners, like Crest, who help us honor these 
      worthwhile individuals who will go on to positively influence the 
      Hispanic community,&#8221; said Sarita Arteaga, DMD, MAGD, President of the 
      HDAF. &#8220;As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, it is only fitting that 
      we put the spotlight on the next generation of dental professional 
      leaders who are already making an impact in their communities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To be considered for the scholarship, each of the winners had to fill 
      out an application that spoke to their community service, leadership, 
      extracurricular activities, honors, work experience and write an essay 
      on they career goals. Through the essay portion, the winners were asked 
      why they wanted to be a dental professional, how they will help to 
      improve their community and what the scholarship would do to help them 
      in attaining these goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I&#8217;m excited and appreciative that Crest and the HDAF have awarded me 
      the Procter  Gamble scholarship to advance my career in dentistry,&#8221; 
      said Christian V. Paez, PG scholarship recipient. &#8220;As an U.S. Hispanic, 
      I want to change the oral health perceptions in my community and this 
      scholarship will aid in reaching that goal.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to providing scholarships to the next generation of Hispanic 
      Dental professionals, Crest and the HDAF have set out to correct 
      misperceptions U.S. Hispanics face when it comes to their oral health. 
      This partnership assesses the state of oral health of the Hispanic 
      community &#8211; securing data that has been publicized and shared with key 
      stakeholders, consumer and media. This year, during Hispanic Heritage 
      Month and beyond, both Crest and the HDAF are focusing on the next 
      generation of Hispanic dental professionals, not only by awarding these 
      16 scholarship winners, but by partnering with Univision at their annual 
      Feria Es El Momento, on October 5, to teach Hispanic families about the 
      importance of oral care and how to become a dental professional.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Crest, we feel it is imperative to continue this partnership with 
      the HDAF in support of the U.S. Hispanic community,&#8221; said Wanda Vides, 
      Assistant Brand Manager for Crest. &#8220;Through our &#8216;Hispanics Open Up About 
      Oral Health Care&#8217; survey, we found that approximately six in 10 
      Hispanics feel that a higher representation of Spanish-speaking and 
      Hispanic dental professional would help them &#8216;a lot&#8217; in achieving and 
      maintaining better oral health1. This is why we want to help 
      foster the next generation of dental professionals through this 
      scholarship program.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday it will extend benefits to spouses of its U.S. workers in same-sex marriages, a sweeping reversal by one of the world's top companies following a landmark Supreme Court ruling in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many U.S. corporations, especially progressive ones like Apple Inc, have long offered domestic partner benefits to gay couples, the step at Exxon - the biggest publicly traded oil company - was heralded as especially significant for a company that has resisted repeated calls for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's announcement by ExxonMobil shows the tide is continuing to turn in corporate America," New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very positive step for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) community and a vindication of years of efforts by shareholders and activists across the country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York's retirement fund owns 13.5 million Exxon shares valued at about $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon had long avoided extending the gay marriage benefits in the United States, saying its policies were governed by federal laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Friday's announcement, the company had recognized gay marriages in some 30 countries around the world where it operates and where same-sex unions are legal, but it had not recognized same-sex marriages from U.S. states that allow them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics said the company, headquartered in conservative Texas, had been dragging its feet - especially because peers like Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell are known for their liberal policies for gay and transgender workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After years of stubbornly refusing, we commend Exxon for joining the majority of the Fortune 500 business leaders that already treat gay and lesbian married couples equally under employee benefit plans," Tico Almeida, founder and president of the LGBT organization Freedom to Work, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon was prompted to revise its stance for its U.S. workers after the Supreme Court struck down a key portion of the Defense of Marriage Act, which had defined marriage as between a man and a woman. That led to same-sex couple eligibility for federal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company itself described the move as reflecting a change in U.S. policy, not its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have made no change in the definition of eligibility for our U.S. benefit plans. Spousal eligibility in our U.S. benefit plans has been and continues to be governed by the federal definition of marriage and spouse," it said in a statement announcing it would recognize "all legal marriages".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) has in the past blasted Exxon for scrapping Mobil's anti-discrimination policy that protected gay workers after Mobil was acquired in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HRC praised Exxon's extension of benefits to spouses in same-sex unions as a step in the right direction but the civil rights organization said Exxon still does not provide specific anti-discrimination protections to gay, bisexual and transgender workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, DiNapoli's New York State Common Retirement fund submitted a proposal asking Exxon to amend its employment policy to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The proposal, which received the support of about 20 percent of shareholders, has been on Exxon's proxies for 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has previously said its current policies already prohibit any kind of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc also moved to extend benefits to people within same-sex marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage equality activists scored another victory on Friday. A New Jersey judge ordered state officials to allow same-sex couples to marry starting October 21, saying the current civil union system unfairly deprives them of federal benefits available to married couples. It became the fourteenth U.S. state to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Terry Wade, Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - An American pilot was killed and a U.S. co-pilot seriously injured on Friday when their plane crashed while on a mission to eradicate coca plants in southern Colombia, police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spraying of coca plants to combat the drugs trade has been intensified in Colombia since 2000 with support from the United States, which has provided billions of dollars to help Colombia fight guerrillas who are funded partly by revenue from cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Preliminary information we have is that it was a mechanical failure. An American piloting the plane was killed and the one accompanying him was injured," a police source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police source said the two were contractors working for companies hired by the Colombian government to fumigate coca crops. Most of those companies are from the United States, but it was not immediately clear who employed the pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the U.S. embassy were not immediately available for comment on Friday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plane crashed in Caqueta province near the township of Montanitas, where the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, have a presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group has been fighting the government for five decades in a conflict that began as a peasant movement seeking land reform. More than 200,000 have died in the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Caqueta area is one of Colombia's biggest coca-producing regions. The plant's leaves, when exposed to petrochemicals, yield a paste which is refined into cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Peter Murphy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vietnam Airlines has agreed to order General Electric (GE.N) engines to power its Boeing Co (BA.N) 787 Dreamliners, according to Vietnamese government officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of engines in the order could not be learned. The order is due to be formally announced next month in Brunei, Vu Huy Hoang, Minister of Industry and Trade for Vietnam, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 787 deal, "President Obama wants to witness the signing ceremony in Brunei," Hoang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Electric declined to comment. Boeing said that Vietnam Airlines has existing orders for eight 787s and orders for another 11 787s through leasing companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, speaking through a translator, said he wanted to formally announce the details of the engine deal on Friday, but the White House had asked for the delay until October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Dung said Vietnamese budget airline VietJet is in talks to buy Boeing 737 airplanes and that the contract should be signed soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The initial agreement, which is of Boeing 737 between VietJet and Boeing, is also another contract to be signed shortly," Dung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials spoke at a Vietnam investment forum in New York sponsored by the International Economic Alliance and the Asia Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister's comments highlighted questions around Vietnam's expansion into regional aviation markets, coming just days after the country's first privately owned airline placed a $9 billion Airbus order. Following the comments about a possible Boeing purchase by VietJet, the airline itself dampened the prospect of an imminent order with Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VietJet Managing Director Luu Duc Khanh said after signing the $9 billion Airbus order in Paris on Wednesday that the airline had so far opted to use a single aircraft type. A spokeswoman for the airline reaffirmed the comments on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most low-cost carriers prefer to stick to one type of aircraft to contain the cost of training and spare parts, but long delivery lead times in the wake of a boom in aircraft orders has forced some to split their orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Khanh, Vietnam has 0.7 passenger aircraft for every 1 million people in its population, compared with 7 in Malaysia and 15 in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vietnam Airlines, the traditional national flag carrier, has a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing jets and has ordered both the Boeing 787 and its future competitor, the Airbus A350.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also expressed interest in the Airbus A380 superjumbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daniel Bases, Tim Hepher and Alwyn Scott; Editing by Gerald E.

 787 Dreamliners, according to Vietnamese government
officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of engines in the order could not be learned. The
order is due to be formally announced next month in Brunei, Vu
Huy Hoang, Minister of Industry and Trade for Vietnam, told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 787 deal, "President Obama wants to witness the
signing ceremony in Brunei," Hoang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Electric declined to comment. Boeing said that
Vietnam Airlines has existing orders for eight 787s and orders
for another 11 787s through leasing companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, speaking
through a translator, said he wanted to formally announce the
details of the engine deal on Friday, but the White House had
asked for the delay until October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Dung said Vietnamese budget airline VietJet is
in talks to buy Boeing 737 airplanes and that the contract
should be signed soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The initial agreement, which is of Boeing 737 between
VietJet and Boeing, is also another contract to be signed
shortly," Dung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials spoke at a Vietnam investment forum in New
York sponsored by the International Economic Alliance and the
Asia Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister's comments highlighted questions around
Vietnam's expansion into regional aviation markets, coming just
days after the country's first privately owned airline placed a
$9 billion Airbus order. Following the comments
about a possible Boeing purchase by VietJet, the airline itself
dampened the prospect of an imminent order with Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VietJet Managing Director Luu Duc Khanh said after signing
the $9 billion Airbus order in Paris on Wednesday that the
airline had so far opted to use a single aircraft type. A
spokeswoman for the airline reaffirmed the comments on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most low-cost carriers prefer to stick to one type of
aircraft to contain the cost of training and spare parts, but
long delivery lead times in the wake of a boom in aircraft
orders has forced some to split their orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Khanh, Vietnam has 0.7 passenger aircraft for
every 1 million people in its population, compared with 7 in
Malaysia and 15 in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vietnam Airlines, the traditional national flag carrier, has
a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing jets and has ordered both the
Boeing 787 and its future competitor, the Airbus A350.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also expressed interest in the Airbus A380
superjumbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday it will extend benefits to spouses of its U.S. workers in same-sex marriages, a sweeping reversal by one of the world's top companies following a landmark Supreme Court ruling in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many U.S. corporations, especially progressive ones like Apple Inc, have long offered domestic partner benefits to gay couples, the step at Exxon - the biggest publicly traded oil company - was heralded as especially significant for a company that has resisted repeated calls for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's announcement by ExxonMobil shows the tide is continuing to turn in corporate America," New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very positive step for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) community and a vindication of years of efforts by shareholders and activists across the country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York's retirement fund owns 13.5 million Exxon shares valued at about $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon had long avoided extending the gay marriage benefits in the United States, saying its policies were governed by federal laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Friday's announcement, the company had recognized gay marriages in some 30 countries around the world where it operates and where same-sex unions are legal, but it had not recognized same-sex marriages from U.S. states that allow them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics said the company, headquartered in conservative Texas, had been dragging its feet - especially because peers like Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell are known for their liberal policies for gay and transgender workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After years of stubbornly refusing, we commend Exxon for joining the majority of the Fortune 500 business leaders that already treat gay and lesbian married couples equally under employee benefit plans," Tico Almeida, founder and president of the LGBT organization Freedom to Work, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon was prompted to revise its stance for its U.S. workers after the Supreme Court struck down a key portion of the Defense of Marriage Act, which had defined marriage as between a man and a woman. That led to same-sex couple eligibility for federal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company itself described the move as reflecting a change in U.S. policy, not its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have made no change in the definition of eligibility for our U.S. benefit plans. Spousal eligibility in our U.S. benefit plans has been and continues to be governed by the federal definition of marriage and spouse," it said in a statement announcing it would recognize "all legal marriages".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) has in the past blasted Exxon for scrapping Mobil's anti-discrimination policy that protected gay workers after Mobil was acquired in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HRC praised Exxon's extension of benefits to spouses in same-sex unions as a step in the right direction but the civil rights organization said Exxon still does not provide specific anti-discrimination protections to gay, bisexual and transgender workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, DiNapoli's New York State Common Retirement fund submitted a proposal asking Exxon to amend its employment policy to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The proposal, which received the support of about 20 percent of shareholders, has been on Exxon's proxies for 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has previously said its current policies already prohibit any kind of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc also moved to extend benefits to people within same-sex marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage equality activists scored another victory on Friday. A New Jersey judge ordered state officials to allow same-sex couples to marry starting October 21, saying the current civil union system unfairly deprives them of federal benefits available to married couples. It became the fourteenth U.S. state to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Terry Wade, Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept. 27, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz Grossman Hufford Dahlstrom  Gross LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft" or the "Company") (Nasdaq:MSFT) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, and docketed under 13-cv-12266, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of Microsoft between April 18, 2013 and July 18, 2013 both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). This class action seeks to recover damages against the Company and certain of its officers and directors as a result of alleged violations of the federal securities laws pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you are a shareholder who purchased Microsoft securities during the Class Period, you have until October 11, 2013 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, x237. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and number of shares purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Microsoft is the world's largest software company, primarily as a result of its near-monopoly Windows personal computer ("PC") operating system software and its Microsoft Office collection of productivity programs. In addition, the Company produces a wide range of software for desktop computers and servers and is active in Internet search with its Bing search engine; the video game market with its Xbox and Xbox 360 products; the digital services market with its Microsoft Network, or MSN; and in mobile phones via its Windows Phone operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business and operations. Specifically, Defendants: (a) employed devices, schemes, and artifices to defraud; (b) made untrue statements of material fact and/or omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading; and (c) engaged in acts, practices, and a course of business which operated as a fraud and deceit upon the purchasers of the Company's common stock during the Class Period.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On July 18, 2013, Microsoft issued a press release announcing that its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 had been adversely impacted by a $900 million charge related to a write-down in the value of its Surface RT inventory. In truth, however, the value of such inventory was materially impaired by March 31, 2013.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On this news, Microsoft shares fell $4.04 approximately 11.4% to close at $31.40 per share on July 18, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and San Diego, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 70 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Robert S. Willoughby

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Toni Clarke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept 27 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's antibacterial drug
Tygacil increases the risk of death whether used as authorized
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or for unapproved
conditions, the agency warned on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer must place a warning inside a black box on the drug's
label, indicating the risk is of the most serious nature. The
FDA said the drug, which is usually given intravenously, should
only be used when alternative treatments are not suitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is approved to treat complicated skin and abdominal
infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. It is not
approved to treat diabetic foot infection or hospital-acquired
pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2010, the FDA issued a reminder to physicians
that Tygacil carried a higher risk of death than other drugs
used to treat infection. The agency said at the time it had
analyzed pooled clinical trial data and determined that most
deaths were related to progression of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said the increased risk of death was mostly seen in
patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, though it was also
seen in patients with other types of infection. The agency
updated the "Warnings and Precautions" section of the label to
reflect risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since issuing that 2010 notice, the FDA said it has analyzed
data from 10 trials of patients who took Tygacil, known
generically as tigecycline, only for FDA-approved uses. This
analysis also showed a higher risk of death compared to other
antibacterial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Citizen, a drug safety watchdog, which petitioned the
FDA in 2011 to place a black box warning on Tygacil, said the
FDA's action comes far later than it should have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The failure of the FDA to require a black box warning years
ago is inexcusable," the group said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the FDA, patients who took Tygacil for
authorized uses had a 2.5 percent risk of death, compared with a
1.8 percent risk of death for those who took other antibacterial
drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Pfizer, Kimberly Bencker, said that "due
to the increase in antibiotic resistance worldwide, Tygacil
continues to be an appropriate treatment option for its approved
indications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the deaths resulted from worsening infections,
complications from infection or another underlying medical
condition, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tygacil was approved in the United States in 2005. It
generated sales in 2012 of $335 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares were up 34 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $28.86
in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer must place a warning inside a black box on the drug's label, indicating the risk is of the most serious nature. The FDA said the drug, which is usually given intravenously, should only be used when alternative treatments are not suitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is approved to treat complicated skin and abdominal infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. It is not approved to treat diabetic foot infection or hospital-acquired pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2010, the FDA issued a reminder to physicians that Tygacil carried a higher risk of death than other drugs used to treat infection. The agency said at the time it had analyzed pooled clinical trial data and determined that most deaths were related to progression of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said the increased risk of death was mostly seen in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia though it was also seen in patients with other types of infection. The agency updated the "Warnings and Precautions" section of the label to reflect risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since issuing that 2010 notice, the FDA said it has analyzed data from 10 trials of patients who took the drug only for FDA-approved uses. This analysis also showed a higher risk of death compared to other antibacterial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the deaths resulted from worsening infections, complications from infection or another underlying medical condition, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tygacil was approved in the United States in 2005. It generated sales in 2012 of $335 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker's shares were up 42 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $28.94 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Bernstein Research analyst
Brad Hintz cut earnings estimates for Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 and Morgan Stanley, saying in a research report on
Friday that the third quarter has been "a full-scale rout in
trading" for Wall Street banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hintz, a former Morgan Stanley treasurer, cut Goldman's
third-quarter estimate by 15 percent, to $2.62 per share from
$3.09 per share, and cut Morgan Stanley's by 20 percent, to 41
cents from 51 cents. He cut full-year estimates for the two
banks by 8.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the third quarter is typically seasonally soft, Q3
2013 appears to be turning into a full-scale rout in trading as
weak activity and limited risk taking constrained performance,"
said Hintz, who estimated that trading volumes have fallen 20 to
25 percent for Wall Street banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hintz is the latest in a series of bank analysts to cut
estimates over the past week, citing a drop-off in trading
revenue, as well as weak investment banking fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares fell 1.4 percent to $160.04 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Morgan Stanley dropped
0.4 percent to $27.05.

&lt;p&gt;Swiss staffing company Adecco rises to feature as one of Europe's

Goldman Sachs' move to upgrade its rating on the group to "buy" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adecco is up 1.1 percent at 63.75 Swiss francs ($69.97) in early session
trading, putting it on the leaderboard of the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
index, which is up by 0.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs writes in a research note that companies such as Adecco,
Michael Page, Robert Walters and Regus should all
benefit as major global economies slowly recover from the effects of the 2008
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland's leading economic indicator on Friday signals that the Swiss

Goldman writes in its note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu says the Goldman upgrade is driving
the rise in Adecco's share price, but adds he would rather wait for Adecco's

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) could reach a multibillion-dollar deal as early as Tuesday, putting an end to the bank's woes from mortgage securities related investigations, the New York Post reported on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dont know which producer at CNBC had the genius idea of asking Alex Pareene on to discuss Jamie Dimon with Dimons biggest cheerleaders, but the result was truly great television. Whats more, as Kevin Roose says, it illustrates the divide between the finance media bubble and the normals in an uncommonly stark and compelling manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole segment is well worth watching, but the tone is perfectly set at the very beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Bartiromo: Alex, to you first. Legal problems aside, JP Morgan remains one of the best, if not the best performing major bank in the world today. You believe the leader of that bank should step down?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Pareene: I think that any time youre looking at the greatest fine in the history of Wall Street regulation, its really worth asking should this guy stay in his job. In any other industry  I cant think of another industry. If you managed a restaurant, and it got the biggest health department fine in the history of restaurants, no one would say Yeah, but the restaurants making a lot of money. Theres only a little bit of poison in the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very strong point by Pareene  and its a point which was well taken by Barclays. When the UK bank was fined $450 million last year for its role in the Libor scandal, its CEO duly resigned. After all, a $450 million fine is prima facie evidence that the CEO really isnt in control of his bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But $450 million is a rounding error with respect to the kind of fines that Dimon is now talking about paying  $4 billion, $11 billion, $20 billion, who knows where this will stop. Tim Fernholz has a good roundup of all the various things that JP Morgan is in trouble for; Libor manipulation is at #5 on his list of seven oustanding investigations  on top of another four settled investigations. If Libor manipulation alone was enough to mean the end of Bob Diamond, its hard to see how Jamie Dimon should be able to survive this tsunami of litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless, it seems, you work for CNBC. In which case you just ignore Pareenes question, and get straight onto the important stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duff McDonald: Its preposterous. The stocks touching a ten-year high. Its a cash-generating machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Bartiromo: Should we talk about the financial strength of JP Morgan? The company continues to churn out tens of billions of dollars in earnings and hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. How do you criticize that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This view  that profits cleanse all sins, and that so long as youre making money, nothing else matters  is not normally expressed quite as explicitly as it was here. After all, there are licit and illicit ways of making money, and surely if your profits fall into the latter category, you should not be able to remain comfortably ensconced as a celebrated captain of industry. Besides, banks shouldnt be obscenely profitable: theyre intermediaries, and in an efficient economy their profits should be quite easily competed away. When bank profits are high, thats a sign that the bank in question is extracting rents from the economy, rather than helping it to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the interview is a glorious exercise in watching CNBC anchors simply implode in disbelief when faced with the idea that JP Morgan in general, and Jamie Dimon in particular, might be anything other than a glorious icon of capitalist success. In the world of CNBC, the stock chart tells you everything you need to know, while the New York Times is a highly untrustworthy organ of dissent and disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Bartiromo asks Pareene, with a straight face, who would be the best CEO of JP Morgan from a shareholder perspective. Since, clearly, the shareholder perspective is the only one that matters. Except, of course, it isnt. JP Morgans balance sheet shows assets of $2.4 trillion and liabilities of $2.2 trillion, leaving $200 billion in total stockholder equity. Sure, the shareholders matter  but even in terms of the balance sheet they only matter about 8.6%. And in terms of the systemic importance of JP Morgan to the nation as a whole, its shareholders matter even less. The country was seriously damaged by JP Morgans lies and misrepresentations about its mortgages  much more than it would be damaged if the share price went down instead of up. And the public has every reason to want the individuals running JP Morgan to be held accountable when it gets into serious regulatory trouble over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the banks arent lending money to homeowners  the government remains the only game in town, when it comes to mortgages, and that isnt healthy at all. JP Morgans shareholders might be happy with Jamie Dimon, but that doesnt mean the rest of us should be. Jesse Eisinger wants the banks executives to face personal charges; whether that happens or not, it still behooves them to take responsibility for the long series of egregious errors that JP Morgan has made. Shareholders might not want to see Dimon go. But if JP Morgan does end up paying an 11-digit fine, then resignation would surely be the honorable thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co and satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp agreed to a short-term extension of their current distribution deal, keeping Disney-owned channels on the air while the pair seek to bridge differences over carriage terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's possible $11 billion settlement of government mortgage probes has been complicated by a dispute with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp over responsibility for losses at the former Washington Mutual Inc, said people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute, between the largest U.S. bank and the FDIC, could leave the federal agency on the hook for billions the bank is expected to pay as part of the settlement and substantially reduce the amount of the penalty JPMorgan actually pays to the government, some analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking a "global" settlement of federal and state mortgage-related probes that could involve a payment of $7 billion in cash plus $4 billion for consumers, according to other people familiar with negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon met with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to discuss a possible global settlement, and a source said the broad outlines could be reached any day. JPMorgan is also in talks with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the New York Attorney General's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which acquired Washington Mutual from the FDIC for $1.9 billion at the height of the financial crisis, has disputed its responsibility to cover losses incurred by investors on the failed thrift's mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has said in corporate filings and court proceedings in recent years that its liability is limited when it comes to reimbursing investors who lost money on Washington Mutual mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDIC is disputing the matter in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fear the FDIC, under pressure from the Justice Department to join a global settlement, might agree to assume liability, a move that would effectively force another government agency to absorb billions of dollars in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for both JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC declined comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the FDIC were to indemnify JPM as part of the government deal, it would likely reduce the rumored $11 billion by about $3.5 billion," said Joshua Rosner, managing director of Graham Fisher, an independent research consultancy. "That would be an absurd outcome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An indemnification, Rosner said, would put JPMorgan's losses back on the FDIC, five years' after JPMorgan and the FDIC claimed that the transaction came at no cost to the FDIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosner estimates that an indemnification deal for JPMorgan would force the FDIC to assume $3.5 billion in claims against JPMorgan by the Federal Housing Finance Agency over Washington Mutual mortgage securities. Sources have said the FHFA claims against Washington Mutual are part of the global settlement negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John McDonald, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research, said in a research report the issue may be tough to resolve, because the agreement JPMorgan signed with the FDIC when it bought Washington Mutual does not specify which party - JPMorgan or the FDIC - is responsible for Washington Mutual's alleged breaches of representations and warranties in securitization agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA sued JPMorgan in September 2011, accusing the bank of misleading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in their purchase of billions of dollars' worth of risky mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulator said JPMorgan falsely represented that the mortgages underlying the securities met underwriting standards. The securities were sponsored or underwritten by the bank, or two other companies it acquired, Bear Stearns Cos and Washington Mutual Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute has played out in a 2009 lawsuit filed by Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. claiming $6 billion to $10 billion in damages from Washington Mutual's alleged breach of representations and warranties in mortgages pooled into securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDIC has claimed it should be dismissed from the lawsuit and Deutsche Bank's claims should be against JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Henry and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Bob Burgdorfer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The journey of anti-hero Walter White came to a dark end on Sunday when fans of "Breaking Bad" finally learned the fate of the chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin, as AMC's cult drug drama concluded after a five-season run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmy-winning "Breaking Bad" has captured audiences with its gritty plot about Walter, played by Bryan Cranston, a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher who turns to cooking methamphetamine with ex-student Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, in order to make money for his family. Walt's chemistry skills allow him to create the purest meth available, which becomes known as "blue sky." Its popularity in the market leads Walt to eventually becoming a drug kingpin known as Heisenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday's 75-minute finale, entitled "Felina," saw Walt return to his deserted family home, retrieve a vial of ricin he hid in the wall, and embark on his final mission to tie up the loose ends left by his crumbled drug empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt visits the gang of white supremacists he had once contracted to kill Jesse, but who instead stole his drug money earnings and kidnapped Jesse to cook the 'blue sky' meth. Walt sets up an automatic rifle in his car that discharges when he goes into the white supremacist compound, killing the gang and freeing Jesse from captivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt takes a bullet but stays alive long enough to call meth dealer Lydia, the last remaining link to his drug empire, to tell her he poisoned her with ricin. Walt watches Jesse drive away a free man, and draws his last breaths in the meth lab at the compound as the police finally catch up with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt's death was one of the probable endings that audiences predicted ahead of the finale, especially as his cancer had returned in the fifth season and his path into darkness saw him lose the support of the people closest to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one poignant scene where Walt sees his wife Skyler for the last time, he finally reveals his reasons for taking the dark path into the meth empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really, I was alive," Walt tells Skyler, after he gives her coordinates to the site where his police officer brother-in-law Hank was buried in the desert after being shot in the head by Walt's contracted neo-Nazi gang in an earlier episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Breaking Bad" become the hot topic on Twitter on Sunday, with the hashtag #GoodbyeBreakingBad trending throughout the day. As Walt's journey came in an end, the majority of fan reactions were positive, with many calling the ending "perfect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We needed to dot all the Is and cross all the Ts ... we needed a resolution," Vince Gilligan, creator of "Breaking Bad," said in AMC's post-finale show "Talking Bad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul added: "What I thought was great was that Walt died protecting Jesse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF GOOD AND BAD'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt's journey from a mild-mannered school teacher into a manipulative drug lord saw him descend the circles of hell as he loses his family and identity to become the cold, calculating Heisenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In looking into this character and what happens to him and the transformation, I really believe that everybody is capable of good or bad," Cranston, who won three best actor Emmys for his portrayal of Walt, said at last month's Television Critics Association panels in Beverly Hills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think, if given the right set of circumstances, dire situations, any one of us can become dangerous," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMC, owned by AMC Networks Inc., split the final season of "Breaking Bad" in two, the first half airing in 2012 and the second in 2013. The second half of the final season, which began in August, saw an average of 5.2 million viewers tuning in to see the conclusion of Walt's saga, more than double last year's audience for the show, according to AMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online streaming site Netflix is credited with helping boost viewership for "Breaking Bad," giving audiences a chance to binge-watch earlier seasons to quickly catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Paul hosted a viewing party of the final episode at the Hollywood Forever cemetery in Los Angeles. Paul joined cast members including RJ Mitte, who plays Walt Jr., driving onto the stage in the rusty RV that Walt and Jesse first cooked meth in, and emerged wearing yellow Hazmat suits, welcomed by hundreds of excited fans, attendee Terri Schwartz told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event raised more than $2 million for charity, and Paul surprised fans by posing for pictures ahead of the screening. Many of the show's celebrity fans, including actor Ewan McGregor and comedian Jimmy Kimmel, attended the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the final night of 'Breaking Bad.' It's devastating, I know. I can't thank you enough for coming out," Paul said, before enthusiastically kicking off the screening of the finale with Jesse's trademark phrase "Yeah, bitch!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Stacey Joyce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Edgemont Development Corporation Issues Interest Debentures For 
      Second Interest Payment
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Edgemont Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) announced 
      that the Corporation has paid, effective today, its second interest 
      payment on the 8% unsecured, subordinated, convertible, extendable 
      debentures (&#8220;Offering Debentures&#8221;) by issuing to holders of the Offering 
      Debentures, on a pro rata basis, that principal amount of interest 
      debentures (the &#8220;Interest Debentures&#8221;) equal to the amount of interest 
      owing under the Offering Debentures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Interest Debentures are 8% unsecured, subordinated, convertible, 
      extendable debentures of the Corporation and have substantially the same 
      terms as the Offering Debentures. The issuance of the Interest 
      Debentures is in accordance with the terms of the trust indenture 
      governing the Offering Debentures which were disclosed in the 
      Corporation's June 27, 2011 prospectus (the &#8220;Prospectus&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Offering Debentures were issued as part of the Corporation&#8217;s 
      Prospectus offering. The Offering Debentures are unsecured and bear 
      interest at a rate of 8% per annum. Interest on the debentures is 
      calculated each June 30, and is payable annually on or before September 
      30. For this second payment, interest is calculated from June 30, 2012 
      to June 29, 2013, for total interest of approximately $1,869,491.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The decision to settle the interest through the issuance of Interest 
      Debentures was primarily a result of deviations in the current cash flow 
      when compared to the cash flow assumptions in the Corporation&#8217;s original 
      business model. These deviations were due to subdivision and engineering 
      drawing approvals from the City of Edmonton taking longer than 
      anticipated, which delayed the receipt of proceeds from Phase 1 lot 
      sales in the development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In March of 2014, each investor will receive, by mail, a T5 from the 
      Corporation&#8217;s transfer agent or the shareholder&#8217;s brokerage firm. The T5 
      will indicate the amount of interest that the Offering Debenture holder 
      is required to report as a result of the issuance of the Interest 
      Debentures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Levi  Korsinsky, LLP Announces Class Action 
      Against Microsoft Corporation and Its Board of Directors and a Lead 
      Plaintiff Deadline of October 11, 2013 -- MSFT
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Levi  Korsinsky announces that a class action lawsuit has been 
      commenced in the United States District Court for the District of 
      Massachusetts on behalf of investors who purchased Microsoft Corporation 
      (&#8220;Microsoft&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NasdaqGS: MSFT) securities between April 
      18, 2013 and July 18, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For more information, click here: http://zlk.9nl.com/microsoft-msft/.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose the following 
      during the Class Period: (a) that the tablet known as Surface RT was 
      experiencing poor customer demand and lackluster sales; (b) that Surface 
      RT inventory experienced a material decline in value during the quarter 
      ended March 31, 2013; and (c) that the Company accumulated an excess of 
      overvalued Surface RT inventory that quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On July 18, 2013, Microsoft disclosed that its fiscal 2013 fourth 
      quarter ended June 30, 2013 had been adversely impacted by a $900 
      million inventory charge related to Surface RT inventory adjustments. 
      Upon this news, shares of Microsoft fell from a close of $35.44 per 
      share on July 18, 2013, to a close of $31.40 per share the following day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you suffered a loss in Microsoft you have until October 11, 2013 to 
      request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to 
      share in any recovery doesn&#8217;t require that you serve as a lead 
      plaintiff. To obtain additional information, contact Joseph E. Levi,

			Goodwin 
      Procter, a national Am Law 50 firm, today announced the release of PTAB 
      Post Grant Proceedings: A Tactical Guide for Practitioners, a 
      definitive guide for patent holders and practitioners engaging in new 
      trial proceedings under the America Invents Act (&#8220;AIA&#8221;). Visitors can 
      view the table 
      of contents for PTAB Post Grant Proceedings: A Tactical Guide for 
      Practitioners and request 
      a copy of the guide online.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2012 Act, which provides four new procedures to challenge the 
      validity of patents, has markedly shifted the landscape of patent 
      litigation, setting the Patent Trial  Appeal Board (&#8220;Board&#8221;) as an 
      uncharted front in a series of prominent patent disputes. With more than 
      540 petitions filed with the Board this year, companies including Apple, 
      Google, Oracle and Microsoft will face untested procedures implemented 
      under AIA&#8217;s provisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Implementation of the America Invents Act marks a profound shift in 
      America&#8217;s treatment of intellectual property, and the Patent Trial  
      Appeal Board will be the site of much of this change,&#8221; said Douglas 
      Kline, partner and chairman of Goodwin Procter&#8217;s Intellectual 
      Property Litigation Practice. &#8220;Cases heard before the Board over the 
      coming months will likely prove a bellwether, and understanding likely 
      outcomes has been a top concern of many of our clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The guide provides an overview of post-grant tactics likely to prevail 
      under AIA, explores likely trial and pre-trial results under evolving 
      courtroom procedures (among them Inter Partes Review, the 
      Transitional Program for Covered Business Method Patents, and Post-Grant 
      Review) and provides statistical breakdowns based on all petitions made 
      to PTAB under AIA this year. It also provides practical advice to those 
      looking to move claims through the court, and to patent holders looking 
      to defend their most vital intellectual property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study is published by Goodwin Procter&#8217;s Intellectual 
      Property Litigation Practice, ranked by IP Law and Business 
      as one of the nation&#8217;s most active. Goodwin&#8217;s 150 IP attorneys and 
      scientists have worked extensively with clients to secure preliminary 
      injunctions, declaratory and summary judgments, favorable results in Markman 
      proceedings, advantageous settlements and appellate relief. Goodwin 
      attorneys routinely work with clients to take cases from pre-suit 
      investigations through discovery proceedings and trials.

&lt;p&gt;* To take over from interim head on Nov. 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Brandicourt to drive growth from promising new drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Has been member of Pfizer executive leadership team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Germany's Bayer 
named Pfizer executive Olivier Brandicourt as the new
head of its healthcare division, where he will oversee the
market launch of a range of potential blockbusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will take over from Bayer Healthcare interim head
Wolfgang Plischke on Nov. 1, Germany's largest drugmaker said in
a statement on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandicourt, who was a member of Pfizer's executive
leadership team, will be responsible for taking new drugs to
market, including stroke prevention pill Xarelto, eye drug Eylea
and cancer treatment Stivarga and to translate successful drug
trials into revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 30 percent increase in Bayer's shares over the last 12
months shows high expectations that the new drugs will offset an
expected decline in sales of its multiple sclerosis drug and
some birth control pills, which are hit by rival products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 0707 GMT, the shares slipped 0.5 percent to 87.06 euros,
the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index edged 0.1 percent
lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Marijn Dekkers has said that while Bayer has been strong
in research and development, it needs to do better at marketing
its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group's five most promising new pharmaceuticals have a
combined peak sales potential of more than 5.5 billion euros
($7.45 billion), according to Bayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous head of Bayer Healthcare, Joerg Reinhardt, quit
in February to become chairman of Novartis
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Piya Sinha-Roy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The journey of anti-hero
Walter White came to a dark end on Sunday when fans of "Breaking
Bad" finally learned the fate of the chemistry teacher turned
drug kingpin, as AMC's cult drug drama concluded after a
five-season run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emmy-winning "Breaking Bad" has captured audiences with its
gritty plot about Walter, played by Bryan Cranston, a
cancer-stricken chemistry teacher who turns to cooking
methamphetamine with ex-student Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron
Paul, in order to make money for his family. Walt's chemistry
skills allow him to create the purest meth available, which
becomes known as "blue sky." Its popularity in the market leads
Walt to eventually becoming a drug kingpin known as Heisenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday's 75-minute finale, entitled "Felina," saw Walt
return to his deserted family home, retrieve a vial of ricin he
hid in the wall, and embark on his final mission to tie up the
loose ends left by his crumbled drug empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt visits the gang of white supremacists he had once
contracted to kill Jesse, but who instead stole his drug money
earnings and kidnapped Jesse to cook the 'blue sky' meth. Walt
sets up an automatic rifle in his car that discharges when he
goes into the white supremacist compound, killing the gang and
freeing Jesse from captivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt takes a bullet but stays alive long enough to call meth
dealer Lydia, the last remaining link to his drug empire, to
tell her he poisoned her with ricin. Walt watches Jesse drive
away a free man, and draws his last breaths in the meth lab at
the compound as the police finally catch up with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt's death was one of the probable endings that audiences
predicted ahead of the finale, especially as his cancer had
returned in the fifth season and his path into darkness saw him
lose the support of the people closest to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one poignant scene where Walt sees his wife Skyler for
the last time, he finally reveals his reasons for taking the
dark path into the meth empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was
really, I was alive," Walt tells Skyler, after he gives her
coordinates to the site where his police officer brother-in-law
Hank was buried in the desert after being shot in the head by
Walt's contracted neo-Nazi gang in an earlier episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Breaking Bad" become the hot topic on Twitter on Sunday,
with the hashtag #GoodbyeBreakingBad trending throughout the
day. As Walt's journey came in an end, the majority of fan
reactions were positive, with many calling the ending "perfect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We needed to dot all the Is and cross all the Ts ... we
needed a resolution," Vince Gilligan, creator of "Breaking Bad,"
said in AMC's post-finale show "Talking Bad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul added: "What I thought was great was that Walt died
protecting Jesse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF GOOD AND BAD'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt's journey from a mild-mannered school teacher into a
manipulative drug lord saw him descend the circles of hell as he
loses his family and identity to become the cold, calculating
Heisenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In looking into this character and what happens to him and
the transformation, I really believe that everybody is capable
of good or bad," Cranston, who won three best actor Emmys for
his portrayal of Walt, said at last month's Television Critics
Association panels in Beverly Hills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think, if given the right set of circumstances, dire
situations, any one of us can become dangerous," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMC, owned by AMC Networks Inc., split the final season of
"Breaking Bad" in two, the first half airing in 2012 and the
second in 2013. The second half of the final season, which began
in August, saw an average of 5.2 million viewers tuning in to
see the conclusion of Walt's saga, more than double last year's
audience for the show, according to AMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online streaming site Netflix is credited with helping boost
viewership for "Breaking Bad," giving audiences a chance to
binge-watch earlier seasons to quickly catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Paul hosted a viewing party of the final episode
at the Hollywood Forever cemetery in Los Angeles. Paul joined
cast members including RJ Mitte, who plays Walt Jr., driving
onto the stage in the rusty RV that Walt and Jesse first cooked
meth in, and emerged wearing yellow Hazmat suits, welcomed by
hundreds of excited fans, attendee Terri Schwartz told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event raised more than $2 million for charity, and Paul
surprised fans by posing for pictures ahead of the screening.
Many of the show's celebrity fans, including actor Ewan McGregor
and comedian Jimmy Kimmel, attended the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the final night of 'Breaking Bad.' It's devastating, I
know. I can't thank you enough for coming out," Paul said,
before enthusiastically kicking off the screening of the finale
with Jesse's trademark phrase "Yeah, bitch!"&lt;/p&gt;
