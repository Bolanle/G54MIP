&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a civil fraud lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) on Monday over mortgage-backed securities packaged and sold by Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first action to come out of a working group created by President Barack Obama earlier this year to go after wrongdoing that led to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which bought Bear Stearns for $10 a share in March 2008, said in a statement it would contest the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit accuses Bear Stearns of failing to ensure the quality of loans underlying residential mortgage-backed securities it packaged and sold in 2006 and 2007. Investors lost more than $22.5 billion on more than 100 of those securities, or one-quarter of their original value, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit said there were "serious long-standing concerns" about the quality of reviews done by Bear Stearns, and that defects uncovered among the loans sold to investors were largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The due diligence process was compromised "in order to increase their volume of securities", the complaint says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also alleged a "systematic abandonment of underwriting guidelines".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan noted in its statement that the allegations concern actions by Bear Stearns before the investment bank was acquired by JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The NYAG civil action relates to Bear Stearns, which we acquired over the course of a weekend at the behest of the U.S. Government. This complaint is entirely about historic conduct by that entity," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIMILAR CASES TO FOLLOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman, a co-chair of the working group, told Reuters on September 20 that his office would take action shortly and that he expected federal authorities to do so as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the matter said a federal-state announcement was planned for Tuesday and Schneiderman's filing the case on Monday appears to have irked his federal colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two federal officials familiar with the investigation said that while the lawsuit was brought under New York State law, much of the investigation was handled at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman's lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, was based on the Martin Act, New York State's powerful securities fraud statute, which does not require proof of intent to deceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar cases against other banks will follow, according to a person familiar with the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time Bear Stearns has emerged as a central figure in the financial crisis.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Another top executive at the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) unit that lost $5.8 billion on derivatives trades this year is leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irene Tse, who headed the North America operations of the Chief Investment Office, told the firm she is resigning to focus on "entrepreneurial ventures," according to a memo on Monday from Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tse worked opposite Achilles Macris, the head of the European side of the unit who oversaw trading executive Javier Martin-Artajo and trader Bruno Iksil, the man who became known in the credit derivatives market as the "London Whale" for the size of positions he took and that ultimately lost the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss, initially disclosed in May, exposed major problems with risk controls in the unit and tarnished the reputation of Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who had complained fiercely about excessive regulation of banks following the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macris, Martin-Artajo and Iksil were fired by the company in July. At the same time, Ina Drew, the head of the entire CIO, resigned. Their departures came as the company said it had found evidence suggesting that employees had tried to hide the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tse has been working on JPMorgan's overhaul of the investment office for the past several months, the memo said. The memo said the purpose of that effort is to refocus the unit "to its core mandate of conservative investing as we strengthened our risk management and controls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo called Tse "a great contributor to the group."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares have recovered from the initial shock of the trading debacle when the stock lost nearly $26 billion in market value in two weeks. The stock rose 1.2 percent to end at $40.97 on Monday. This is 23 cents above the price at the close on May 10, after which the loss was disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tse had been hired in January 2011 after working for three years as a portfolio manager at hedge fund operator Duquesne Capital Management. By then the unit had amassed for investment more than $300 billion as deposits piled into the bank during the financial crisis. She was quoted by the company at the time as saying the unit offered "an extraordinary platform for me and the entire CIO group to invest and manage risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining Duquesne, Tse was a partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) where she was co-head of the U.S. interest rates business. She had also been a member of the U.S. Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a panel of financial market experts appointed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo was reported earlier on Monday by Bloomberg News, which cited unnamed sources as saying that Tse plans to start a hedge fund to make investments based on trends in the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Kenneth Barry and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Candle maker Blyth Inc (BTH.N) said it would delay buying until April 2014 the remainder of ViSalus Inc that it does not already own, days after it withdrew the nutritional supplement seller's planned initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blyth signed a deal to buy ViSalus in 2008, but structured it such that it would pick up the direct seller of weight-management products in four investments through 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ViSalus, in which Blyth currently owns a 73 percent stake, withdrew its planned IPO on Wednesday, a little over a month after filing to go public.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission likely will not need another full year to revise its definition of municipal adviser, despite delaying its deadline until 2013, Commissioner Elisse Walter said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is "no intention on the part of the staff to take anywhere near that long," Walter said during a conference in New York about the $3.7 trillion U.S. municipal bond market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, federal securities regulators must provide guidance to municipalities and their financial advisers about who qualifies as a municipal adviser for the purposes of complying with the tougher regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC had proposed a temporary rule and was to have finalized a definition by September 30. But it said on September 21 that it was pushing its deadline back a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, municipal financial advisers, swap advisers, guaranteed investment contract brokers, placement agents and other consultants were largely unregulated. Critics said that helped set the stage for a wave of recent crises among cities, towns and other issuers involving complex financial instruments that panned out badly for local taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress is also weighing in on the best way to define who falls under the new rules. The House approved a clarification in September, but the U.S. Senate is unlikely to act until after the November elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, legislative action put the heat on regulators to complete their own determination, following hundreds of comments expressing concern that the proposed definition was too broad and would ensnare too many people who were only on the periphery of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House-passed law excludes securities dealers from the definition and maintains a provision specifying that municipal advisers have a fiduciary duty to their municipal clients, ensuring that they act in the best interests of the school districts, cities and counties they advise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which sponsored Monday's conference, had argued that the SEC's initial rule exceeded the scope of protections that Congress envisioned in its financial reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If enacted as first proposed, the SEC's definition would increase costs and legal burdens on Wall Street and regional financial firms, said SIFMA, which applauded the House-backed bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC's Walter also spoke on Monday about pre-trade pricing transparency, saying that investors in the muni market get "second class treatment" compared to the protections and information investors are afforded in other markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators need to begin a broad-based initiative to make the muni market "more transparent, efficient and fair for all investors," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said electronic trading and other newer technology could help open the door to greater transparency. And she urged the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, a self-regulatory organization, to consider ways to encourage disclosure of mark-ups and mark-downs in muni trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After November 1, underwriters in the municipal bond market will be banned from withholding important pricing information on new debt sales from market participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Hilary Russ; Editing by Tim Dobbyn and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 1 (Reuters) - Candle maker Blyth Inc said it

that it does not already own, days after it withdrew the
nutritional supplement seller's planned initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Irene Tse ran North America side of CIO office&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Latest executive to depart unit after $5.8 bln loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Her European counterpart oversaw 'London Whale'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Tse had job for 21 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Another top executive at the
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co unit that lost $5.8 billion on
derivatives trades this year is leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irene Tse, who headed the North America operations of the
Chief Investment Office, told the firm she is resigning to focus
on "entrepreneurial ventures," according to a memo on Monday
from Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames, a copy of which was
obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tse worked opposite Achilles Macris, the head of the
European side of the unit who oversaw trading executive Javier
Martin-Artajo and trader Bruno Iksil, the man who became known
in the credit derivatives market as the "London Whale" for the
size of positions he took and that ultimately lost the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss, initially disclosed in May, exposed major problems
with risk controls in the unit and tarnished the reputation of
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who had complained fiercely about
excessive regulation of banks following the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macris, Martin-Artajo and Iksil were fired by the company in
July. At the same time, Ina Drew, the head of the entire CIO,
resigned. Their departures came as the company said it had found
evidence suggesting that employees had tried to hide the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tse has been working on JPMorgan's overhaul of the
investment office for the past several months, the memo said.
The memo said the purpose of that effort is to refocus the unit
"to its core mandate of conservative investing as we
strengthened our risk management and controls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo called Tse "a great contributor to the group."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares have recovered from the initial shock of the
trading debacle when the stock lost nearly $26 billion in market
value in two weeks. The stock rose 1.2 percent to end at $40.97
on Monday. This is 23 cents above the price at the close on May
10, after which the loss was disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tse had been hired in January 2011 after working for three
years as a portfolio manager at hedge fund operator Duquesne
Capital Management. By then the unit had amassed for investment
more than $300 billion as deposits piled into the bank during
the financial crisis. She was quoted by the company at the time
as saying the unit offered "an extraordinary platform for me and
the entire CIO group to invest and manage risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining Duquesne, Tse was a partner at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc where she was co-head of the U.S. interest
rates business. She had also been a member of the U.S. Treasury
Borrowing Advisory Committee, a panel of financial market
experts appointed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo was reported earlier on Monday by Bloomberg News,
which cited unnamed sources as saying that Tse plans to start a
hedge fund to make investments based on trends in the global
economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A top Morgan Stanley (MS.N) broker, who managed about $2 billion in client assets, has left for J.P. Morgan Securities, marking one of the biggest departures this year from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Madrigano, a director of wealth management and a private wealth adviser at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management, the company's ultra-high-net-worth group catering to clients with at least $20 million in assets, generated annual revenue of between $8 million and $10 million, according to sources with knowledge of the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That level of production is eye-opening," because only a handful of broker teams with more than $1 billion in assets under management leave any big brokerage each year, said Danny Sarch, a New York-based financial services recruiter. "There aren't that many guys out there of that size at any firm across the country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory filings show Madrigano has been registered with J.P. Morgan Securities since September 28. A JPMorgan spokesman confirmed the new hire on Monday. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The departure of Madrigano, whose client assets of $2 billion were listed in a 2011 Barron's ranking of top financial advisers in New York, is the latest in a series of financial advisers to have left the unit, formerly known as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Morgan Stanley agreed to buy Smith Barney from Citigroup Inc (C.N) in phases, starting in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 178 veteran advisers who managed more than $24 billion in client assets have left the firm so far this year, based on moves tracked by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters tracks the movement of individual advisers or teams that manage around $100 million or more in client assets, which typically translates to around $1 million or more in annual revenue production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widespread technology issues after the July completion of the merger of the groups to one platform have led to more brokers considering a move, according to interviews with recently departed Morgan Stanley brokers, current employees at the firm and industry consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some former Morgan Stanley brokers also blamed a difference in cultures of the two firms for these departures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's definitely a culture clash between what Morgan Stanley is and what Smith Barney was," one Morgan Stanley broker who left the firm last week told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the loss of client assets managed by defecting advisers is only a small fraction of the roughly $1.7 trillion total under management at Morgan Stanley, industry experts say the departure of veteran advisers like Madrigano can hurt business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also additional costs with a big broker's departure, like the loss of associated revenue down the road - as top advisers generate significant money for the firm - and the cost of hiring another broker team to replace the assets lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It takes a lot of extra work to catch up when a big team leaves," said Alois Pirker, a research director at the Boston-based Aite Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madrigano, who worked at Morgan Stanley's New York office, started at New York-based investment bank D.H. Blair &amp; Co in 1989 and moved to Citigroup in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His move to JPMorgan Chase comes as the largest U.S. bank is increasingly emphasizing asset management in its business strategy. It is remodeling bank branches in higher-income areas to emphasize its "Chase Private Client" services with more private areas for meeting with wealthier customers about their investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry experts say more top advisers are looking at private banking as a new home for their books of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private bank side appeals to advisers with large client asset bases because it allows them to potentially generate greater revenue through the private bank model, said New Jersey-based lawyer Tom Lewis, who represents brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're not just buying them stock and mutual funds, but potentially a home loan or a mortgage or personal loan, or other types of financial instruments," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis said advisers using a more holistic private bank model can also charge flat management fees, instead of pure transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ashley Lau in New York; Additional reporting by David Henry; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Walden Siew, Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irene Tse, who headed the North America operations of the Chief Investment Office, told the firm she is resigning to focus on "entrepreneurial ventures," according to a memo on Monday from Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tse worked opposite Achilles Macris, the head of the European side of the unit who oversaw trading executive Javier Martin-Artajo and trader Bruno Iksil, the man who became known in the credit derivatives market as the "London Whale" for the size of positions he took and that ultimately lost the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss, initially disclosed in May, exposed major problems with risk controls in the unit and tarnished the reputation of Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who had complained fiercely about excessive regulation of banks following the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macris, Martin-Artajo and Iksil were fired by the company in July. At the same time, Ina Drew, the head of the entire CIO, resigned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tse has been working on JPMorgan's overhaul of the investment office for the past several months, the memo said. The memo said the purpose of that effort is to refocus the unit "to its core mandate of conservative investing as we strengthened our risk management and controls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tse had been hired in January 2011 after working for three years as a portfolio manager at hedge fund operator Duquesne Capital Management. By then the unit had amassed for investment more than $300 billion as deposits piled into the bank during the financial crisis. She was quoted by the company at the time as saying the unit offered "an extraordinary platform for me and the entire CIO group to invest and manage risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining Duquesne, Tse was a partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) where she was co-head of the U.S. interest rates business. She had also been a member of the U.S. Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a panel of financial market experts appointed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Kenneth Barry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Judge said losses to public outweigh merits of injunction
    * Ban was part of suit seeking about $20 bln for oil spill
    * Chevron ban upheld except for spill mitigation, monitoring
    * Transocean ban still applies to Frade field


    RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - A Brazilian court
overturned a ban on operations by offshore drilling contractor
Transocean Ltd, accepting government arguments that the
ban could cause billions of dollars in lost taxes for the
government and output for the state-led oil firm Petrobras
.
   Judge Felix Fischer, president of Brazil's second-highest
court -- the STJ, agreed with arguments from Brazil's petroleum
regulator, the ANP, according to a copy of the ruling obtained
by Reuters.
    A ban on Transocean, the world's largest offshore drilling
contractor, could deprive Brazil of 126 million barrels of oil,
an amount equivalent to about two months of Brazilian output,
the ANP said. It would also deprive the government of 6.71
billion reais ($3.31 billion) royalties over two years.
    If it had remained, the injunction would have shut down
Transocean's 10 drilling rigs operating in Brazilian waters,
eight of them under contract by Petrobras, as of Oct. 27. 
    Transocean owns two of the three drilling rigs in Brazil
that can drill in more than 2,200 feet of water. Such
"ultra-deep-water" is where most of Brazil's most promising new
reserves are located. Brazil is counting on tax revenues from
those reserves to boost the economy and reduce poverty. 
    "The reasons attached by the petitioner, rightly accompanied
by technical data, exhaustively show that the economic damage is
not restricted to the companies involved," Fischer wrote in his
decision.
    The court, though, only eased a related ban on Chevron
Corp's Brazil operations. The No. 2 U.S. oil company may
continue only those activities related to the mitigation and
monitoring of a 3,600 barrel November oil spill in the Frade
offshore field northeast of Rio de Janeiro that led to the ban.
    Transocean shares rose 4.3 percent in New York, their
biggest one-day jump in six days, after the ban was lifted.
    Petrobras preferred shares, the company's most-traded class
of stock rose 1.4 percent in Sao Paulo, their first gain in
three days. Chevron rose 1 percent in New York.
    A total ban on Chevron operations, the judge said, might
prevent the company from continuing a cleanup, potentially
harming the environment. Its activities will be monitored by
Brazil's petroleum regulator, the ANP.
    "I authorize Chevron to maintain only mitigation and
observations operations stemming from the accident in the Frade
Field under the supervision and coordination of the ANP."
    Chevron says the leak from the field was controlled in
November and that it shut operations at the field in March when
unexplained traces of oil showed up in the same area.
    Chevron had contracted Transocean's Sedco 706 rig to drill
in Frade, where the ban on Transocean remains in force. Chevron
and Transocean say they were not negligent in the spill and are
fighting the lawsuits and related criminal charges.
    The ANP said in a July report that Transocean had no
responsibility for the spill and that while Chevron made errors
in its drilling plan, failed to meet some safety requirements it
and could have avoided the spill but that it was not negligent.
 
    The ANP fined Chevron $17.3 million, a fine which has been
paid. 
    The court document seen by Reuters is likely to be published
early this week but was signed by Fischer on Friday.
    Brazil is in the early stages of developing its massive
subsalt geological oil play, which could hold upward of 100
billion barrels of oil.
    A shortage of drilling rigs able to operate in waters more
than 2,000 meters deep has restrained Petrobras' push to bring
on this new oil despite a $237 billion five-year expansion plan.
    "The original injunction was groundless and targeted
Transocean unfairly," a Transocean spokesman said. "The company
and its employees were completely exonerated by ANP's
investigation which concluded that the leak resulted from
geological factors and was totally unrelated to the actions of
the Transocean rig crew."
    Chevron and Petrobras officials did not immediately respond
to requests for comment.

          segmented shoppers by their attitudes and behaviors. Understanding 
          the characteristics and values of these unique segments will allow

          Shopper behavior varies drastically across various population 
          segments. Some segments have been deeply impacted by economic 
          volatility, and seek low prices above all else; other segments rely 
          heavily on new technologies, and are motivated by mobile 
          advertisements and social media promotions. With an understanding of 
          each segment&#8217;s values and economic perceptions, manufacturers and 
          retailers will be able to use segmentation data to identify key 
          shopper segments and successfully target shoppers at the household 
          level.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A top Morgan Stanley (MS.N) broker who last year managed about $2 billion in client assets left the company's brokerage division on Friday to join J.P. Morgan Securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adviser Jonathan Madrigano, who worked out of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management's Midtown Manhattan office, generated annual revenue of between $8 million and $10 million, according to sources with knowledge of the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That level of production is eye-opening," because only a handful of broker teams with more than $1 billion in assets under management leave any big brokerage each year, said New York-based financial services recruiter Danny Sarch, who has worked in the industry for nearly three decades. "There aren't that many guys out there of that size at any firm across the country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madrigano managed more than $2 billion in client assets, according to a 2011 Barron's ranking of top financial advisers in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a director of wealth management and a private wealth adviser at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management, the company's ultra-high-net-worth group catering to clients with at least $20 million in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madrigano was a legacy Citigroup Smith Barney broker. He started at New York-based investment bank D.H. Blair &amp; Co in 1989 and moved to Citigroup Inc (C.N) in 2000, according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He joined Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, now known as Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, after Citigroup's Smith Barney merged with Morgan Stanley's wealth business in 2009. During that time, many legacy Smith Barney brokers moved over to the new combined brokerage firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory filings show Madrigano has been registered with J.P. Morgan Securities, a division of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), since September 28. Neither that company nor J.P. Morgan immediately responded to a request for confirmation of the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madrigano, who joined J.P. Morgan's Park Avenue office, ranks among the biggest departures from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management so far this year. At least 178 veteran advisers who managed more than $24 billion in client assets have left the firm so far this year, based on moves tracked by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters tracks the movement of individual advisers or teams that manage around $100 million or more in client assets, which typically translates to around $1 million or more in annual revenue production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ashley Lau in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 1 - Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said today that it assigned its
'AA+' rating to General Electric Co.'s proposed senior unsecured debt
offering of upwards of $5 billion. We believe the company will use most of the
proceeds to meet its $5 billion February 2013 maturity. This maturity represents
about 50% of GE's industrial debt. In our view, the higher cash balance over the
next four months effectively offsets the incremental leverage and interest
expense. The final mixture of amounts and maturities from the proposed issue
could vary depending upon market demand. 

The 'AA+' corporate credit rating on GE reflects the company's "excellent" 
business risk profile and "modest" financial risk profile. Second-quarter 
industrial organic revenue growth was 10%, continuing a recent return to 
organic revenue growth, which we assume will continue in the upper single 
digits. Industrial segment profit was up 7%, but margins declined slightly to 
15% from 15.2%. We assume margins will improve in 2012 and 2013 because of 
product mix, pricing, and cost reductions. Industrial cash from operating 
activities (CFOA excluding dividends from GE Capital) declined sequentially to 
$1.7 billion from $2.1 billion because of increased working capital. We still 
assume industrial CFOA for all of 2012 will be at least $11 billion after 
pension contributions. 

GE ended the second quarter with industrial parent-level cash of $8.7 
billion--we assume ongoing cash balances at the industrial parent will be 
about $8 billion or more. Because of recent changes to pension legislation, GE 
has reduced its expectation for required pension funding by at least $2 
billion between 2012 and 2013. The company stated that its pension strategy 
(including plan changes) continues to focus on being fully funded in its 
primary plan. Our rating assumption continues to be that GE will address its 
large post-retirement obligation (which represents a majority of adjusted 
industrial debt), causing credit metrics to improve.

General Electric Capital Corp.'s (GECC) improved performance continued in the 
second quarter. Pretax earnings were $2.2 billion, up 13% from 2011. The real 
estate segment profit was $221 million, compared with a loss in 2011. GECC has 
resumed paying dividends to parent GE.

 01/10/2012     WNA6  WE      S RATES GENERAL ELECTRIC SENIOR
 11:22:05       03    SCRIPT  UNSECURED NOTES 'AA+'
 NEW YORK (Standard &amp; Poor's) Oct. 1, 2012--Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services
said today that it assigned its 'AA+' rating to General Electric Co.'s proposed
senior unsecured debt offering of upwards of $5 billion. We believe the company
will use most of the proceeds to meet its $5 billion February 2013 maturity.
This maturity represents about 50% of GE's industrial debt. In our view, the
higher cash balance over the next four months effectively offsets the
incremental leverage and interest expense. The final mixture of amounts and
maturities from the proposed issue could vary depending upon market demand. The
'AA+' corporate credit rating on GE reflects the company's "excellent" business
risk profile and "modest" financial risk profile. Second-quarter industrial
organic revenue growth was 10%, continuing a recent return to organic revenue
growth, which we assume will continue in the upper single digits. Industrial
segment profit was up 7%, but margins declined slightly to 15% from 15.2%. We
assume margins will improve in 2012 and 2013 because of product mix, pricing,
and cost reductions. Industrial cash from operating activities (CFOA excluding
dividends from GE Capital) declined sequentially to $1.7 billion from $2.1
billion because of increased working capital. We still assume industrial CFOA
for all of 2012 will be at least $11 billion after pension contributions. GE
ended the second quarter with industrial parent-level cash of $8.7 billion--we
assume ongoing cash balances at the industrial parent will be about $8 billion
or more. Because of recent changes to pension legislation, GE has reduced its
expectation for required pension funding by at least $2 billion between 2012 and
2013. The company stated that its pension strategy (including plan changes)
continues to focus on being fully funded in its primary plan. Our rating
assumption continues to be that GE will address its large post-retirement
obligation (which represents a majority of adjusted industrial debt), causing
credit metrics to improve. General Electric Capital Corp.'s (GECC) improved
performance continued in the second quarter. Pretax earnings were $2.2 billion,
up 13% from 2011. The real estate segment profit was $221 million, compared with
a loss in 2011. GECC has resumed paying dividends to parent GE. RELATED CRITERIA

management for Microsoft(R) Lync(R) UC environments.

    A Growing Trend
 The adoption of Microsoft Lync as a UC platform is
growing exponentially, with Microsoft reporting the platform experienced
a 250 percent growth rate overall this year. Many enterprises view Lync
as a cost effective strategy to incorporate unified communications into
their existing IPT environment utilizing their existing Windows(R)
network architecture, and their users' existing desktop resources. While
this strategy can yield significant ROI, it also creates additional
strain on the IP network, and the system resources of every Lync user's
desktop -- a strain that can seriously jeopardize the expected UC
benefits of collaboration, unified messaging and increased user
productivity.

    The new ReliaTel VoIP and UC Management solution for Microsoft Lync
proactively manages the entire Lync UC environment, inclusive of the
underlying IPT network, primary VoIP switch, third party SBCs and network
transport devices, end users' desktop resources, and users' softphone
call quality. Enterprises embracing Lync as their UC platform can now
leverage ReliaTel's real-time multi-platform management to achieve true
centralized management of quality, performance and capacity across their
entire VoIP and Lync UC environment - all through a central pane of glass.

    "ReliaTel for Lync addresses the needs of operations teams requiring
visibility into Lync-driven UC quality and service levels," noted Amit
Kapoor, director of strategic technology for Tone. "Leveraging ReliaTel's
core competency of multi-platform VoIP and UC management, the new 4.1
release delivers not only deep visibility over Lync UC services, but also
additional real-time performance dashboards and expanded QoS trending
reports for both Avaya and Cisco, providing deeper operational
intelligence across the entire communications ecosystem," he stated. 

    As noted by Kapoor, the latest ReliaTel release also includes deeper
Avaya RTCP QoS reports and Cisco QoS reports that deliver extensive
quality trending metrics to help users identify recurring quality
patterns and issues, and their root cause. In addition, ReliaTel 4.1
offers expanded Cisco Performance Dashboards that provide users with
dynamic graphical displays of Cisco real-time metrics, including call
activity, registered devices, channel activity, and port activity.
Through these combined Avaya, Cisco and Lync capabilities, ReliaTel 4.1
delivers an end-to-end solution that empowers voice and network teams to
more effectively ensure UC service levels.

    Benefits for MSPs
 For MSPs, the ReliaTel Lync management capabilities
open additional doors into client sites integrating Microsoft Lync into
their environment, enabling service providers to easily expand their
service portfolio to offer management services over a broader range of UC
technologies -- without increasing their operational overhead or service
delivery costs. Combined with ReliaTel's multi-vendor, multi-platform
management support, multi-tenant design, and deep VoIP QoS monitoring and
analytics, the solution provides a single, centralized platform that MSPs
can leverage to deliver full management services that consistently meet
and exceed SLAs without the need to increase support staff or purchase
multiple tools. 

    ReliaTel 4.1 is available immediately. Please visit www.tonesoft.com for

			prairieFyre Software Announces Newest Release of prairieFyre Contact 
      Center for Microsoft Lync
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			prairieFyre&#8217;s Contact Center for Microsoft Lync Version 5.10.1 adds 
      features to increase contact center productivity and efficiency
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      prairieFyre Software, a Microsoft Gold Communications and Independent 
      Software Vendor (ISV) Competency Partner developing unified 
      communications and contact center solutions, is proud to announce the 
      general availability of their Contact Center for
			Microsoft Lync 
      Version 5.10.1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      prairieFyre&#8217;s award-winning Contact Center for Microsoft Lync is 
      a modular software suite developed on the Voice-over-IP and UC 
      architecture of Microsoft Lync Server 2010. It is ideal for small to 
      medium sized contact centers looking to combine the advanced enterprise 
      voice features of the Lync platform with Automatic Call Distributor 
      (ACD) and management applications. At the core of the 5.10.1 release are 
      a number of intelligent telephony features that enhance the customer 
      experience with improved self-service, call handling, and quality 
      assurance options.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Version 5.10.1 offers integral auto-attendant and dial out of queue 
      capabilities providing callers with self-serve options to access 
      information and direct their calls to the appropriate department or 
      individual without going through a receptionist. Callers can also choose 
      to dial out of a queue and leave a message instead of waiting to be 
      answered by an agent. The new ANI and DNIS routing features enable 
      Contact Center for
			Microsoft Lync to automatically route 
      callers to specialized agents, extensions, and queues based on the 
      caller&#8217;s phone number or dialed number. With the new Screen-Pop feature, 
      this caller information can then be leveraged to automatically open the 
      appropriate CRM record as the call is routed to the agent&#8217;s Lync 2010 
      client. To ensure business continuity, Version 5.10.1 also introduces a 
      queue resiliency option that automatically routes calls to alternative 
      endpoints in the event of a network failure or outage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the new ACD integration with the OAISYS&#174; Talkument&#174; voice 
      documentation and Tracer quality monitoring software solutions, 
      businesses can leverage advanced call recording functionality to better 
      manage compliance requirements and promote superior customer service 
      delivery. These new features allow contact centers to provide prompt and 
      informed customer service, decrease call handling times, control 
      operational costs, and increase customer loyalty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;OAISYS is proud to have a long-standing partnership with prairieFyre 
      Software, who has a strong history of delivering advanced contact center 
      solutions,&#8221; said Brian Spencer, president of OAISYS. &#8220;Contact centers 
      can now take advantage of our powerful compliance and quality management 
      solutions while benefiting from prairieFyre Software&#8217;s advanced contact 
      center solution in a pure Microsoft voice network.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our new 5.10.1 release is evidence of the continued investment 
      prairieFyre is making in our Contact Center for Lync roadmap.&#8221; said 
      Chris Courneya, CEO, prairieFyre Software. &#8220;As businesses are 
      increasingly considering Microsoft Lync 2010 as an enterprise voice

      Communications capabilities for our clients&#8217; contact center 
      applications.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York state's lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co alleging fraud in mortgage-backed securities sold by Bear Stearns may be one of the broadest cases to come out of the financial crisis, but its impact is likely to be limited. The biggest beneficiaries may be investors who have taken out private lawsuits against the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil suit, brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, is the first from a federal-state financial fraud task force. It did not unearth any previously unknown details or attempt to assign criminal liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it largely follows in the footsteps of private suits from investors who have accused Bear Stearns and other firms of deceptively selling toxic mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the state could extract a monetary settlement out of JPMorgan that rivals other financial-crisis cases and government officials pledged more cases will follow, the biggest outcome of the New York state suit will be to add firepower to multibillion-dollar private litigation dogging Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the tools available to the attorney general...we have a better prospect of getting the whole story out," said Don Hawthorne, a New York lawyer who has brought cases against banks on behalf of bond insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York state's suit gives private plaintiffs more leverage to extract settlements from the banks they are targeting. It also could give investors more evidence as litigation unfolds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed late Monday, accused Bear Stearns of deceiving investors by leading them to believe the quality of loans in the mortgage-backed securities had been carefully evaluated, even though they had not been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It charges that Bear systematically ignored defects in the loans and kept investors in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit differs from prior government financial-crisis suits, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's case that accused Goldman Sachs of misleading investors on one subprime mortgage product in 2007. That case was settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 31-page complaint against JPMorgan more closely resembles a less-detailed version of dozens of private cases out there, including a lawsuit from bond insurer Ambac Assurance Corp against the Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks face billions of dollars in potential liability from investors who bought now-soured mortgage-backed securities and from insurers who were stuck with losses from the bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts did not think New York state's suit would immediately add to banks' risk. "We do not see this litigation as a game changer as it is similar to many of the civil suits that already are pending," Jaret Seiberg of Guggenheim Partners said in a Tuesday investors note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's stock price barely reacted to the news, dipping just 0.1 percent on Tuesday to close at $40.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the lawsuit, New York wants JPMorgan to return profits obtained through the alleged fraud and pay damages. {ID:nL1E8L202Y]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in a statement late Monday it would contest the allegations, and noted that the suit does not target JPMorgan's activity in the lead-up to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit "relates to Bear Stearns, which we acquired over the course of a weekend at the behest of the U.S. Government. This complaint is entirely about historic conduct by that entity," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE TO COME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman and federal authorities discussed the case during a press conference in Washington on Tuesday and said more actions were coming, although they declined to provide specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking forward to more cases," Schneiderman said at the U.S. Justice Department's headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil lawsuit against JPMorgan was brought under a powerful New York state law known as the Martin Act, which generally does not require proof of intent, a major stumbling block in most fraud cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statute allows the New York attorney general's office to pursue both criminal and civil cases, although the 2006 and 2007 conduct in the JPMorgan complaint appears to fall outside the statute of limitations of two years for misdemeanors and five for felonies. The civil statute of limitations is six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York attorney general's office has for years been investigating misdeeds related to the packaging and sale of home loans. In 2008, Schneiderman's predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, sent subpoenas to a handful of banks, including Bear Stearns, Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and others, according to news reports at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department also issued more than a dozen civil subpoenas to top banks on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes weeks before the presidential election, but the Justice Department said there was no political connection on the timing of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When cases are mature and ready to be brought, we bring them," said acting Associate Attorney General Tony West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama, who is trying to show he is helping the nation move past the devastating housing crisis and resulting recession, announced the task force in his January State of the Union speech. At the time, he said the group would "help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The working group includes the Justice Department, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Attorney General's office and other agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In forming the group, officials said it was designed to avoid duplicating efforts and collaborate on specific cases to bring actions more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OVERNIGHT RESCUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When JPMorgan purchased Bear Stearns, the investment bank's instability was threatening the larger financial system. The Federal Reserve and Treasury were desperate to find a buyer who could take on its toxic assets and help calm markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns was the No. 1 U.S. underwriter of residential mortgage-back securities in 2005, 2006 and 2007, Thomson Reuters league tables show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials in the working group defended the decision to go after JPMorgan in their first lawsuit, even though the federal government encouraged and was heavily involved in the investment bank's purchase of Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The liability traveled with the company, so it would be far worse for us to send the message that this kind of fraud is to be tolerated," Schneiderman said. "No one is above the law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear how strong a legal defense JPMorgan will have, said John Coffee, director of Columbia University Law School's Center on Corporate Governance, who noted that JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns through "an arranged marriage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Morally it's not JPMorgan's responsibility but there were losses and the public wants the historical record set right," Coffee said. "They took the bitter with the sweet when they accepted a major package of federal financing to complete the deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Aruna Viswanatha and David Ingram in Washington and Jed Horowitz, Karen Freifeld and Cezary Podkul in New York; Editing Karey Wutkowski and David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But so far the former Alaska governor and her husband Todd Palin have not come forward to claim their share of a settlement fund established for victims of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair was among the nearly 1,000 plaintiffs who have not claimed their payouts on a list released last week by managers of the settlement fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some on the list are dead.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska Oct 2 (Reuters) - Former vice
presidential candidate Sarah Palin is not shy about voicing her
opinions to national audiences, headlining big-ticket political
events and exposing her family and personal life on reality TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But so far the former Alaska governor and her husband Todd
Palin have not come forward to claim their share of a settlement
fund established for victims of the 1989 Exxon Valdez
oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair was among the nearly 1,000 plaintiffs who have not

I don't necessarily have all of his paperwork," Sarko said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarko said he was not permitted to give specific
information about the Palins' claims but he confirmed that most
people were generally owed hundreds of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the reality TV show "Sarah Palin's Alaska" documented,
the Palins fish commercially in southwestern Alaska's Bristol
Bay, far from the Prince William Sound and Gulf of Alaska sites
fouled with oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such fishermen are members of the "unoiled fisheries"
classes and are entitled to shares of spill funds, based on a
finding that fears of oil tainting had depressed Alaska salmon
prices in general, Sarko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a tremendous price drop, especially in southeast
Alaska," he said, adding that of the $1 billion settlement Exxon
paid to private plaintiffs in compensation, punitive fines and
interest, only about $1 million is left to be doled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Alaska-based lawyer who represents the Palins in other
matters, John Tiemessen, said he was not involved in the case
and did not know the status of the claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any remaining unclaimed payments will eventually revert to
the plaintiffs' last known home states and be put into
government unclaimed-asset funds, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York state's lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co alleging fraud in mortgage-backed securities sold by Bear Stearns may be one of the broadest cases to come out of the financial crisis, but its impact is likely to be limited. The biggest beneficiaries may be investors who have taken out private lawsuits against the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil suit, brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, is the first from a federal-state financial fraud task force.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - India's wealthy, from old money to nouveaux riches IT entrepreneurs, are quietly snapping up hotels and mines Down Under just as Australia embarks on an immigration campaign to attract long-term investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jindal family, ranked among the world's top 80 richest by Forbes, in May bought two minor stakes, worth a total of A$26 million (US$26.99 million), in Australian iron ore and coal mines through Jindal Steel &amp; Power (JNSP.NS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That followed a US$2 billion purchase by Indian self-made billionaire and college-dropout Gautam Adani (ADAN.NS) of a coal mine in the state of Queensland last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverneedle Hospitality, a company backed by Nadathur S. Raghavan, an Indian philanthropist and co-founder of software company Infosys Technologies INFY.NX, just bought a hotel in Brisbane for A$57 million. Last year, it bought a chain of about 60 hotels in Australia and New Zealand for an undisclosed sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the last six to nine months, there has been a lot of private investment into Australia because it is seen as a safe-haven," said Paul Dowling, principal analyst at banking research firm East &amp; Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Indian nationals have traditionally favored Britain and North America as offshore investment destinations, private wealth bankers have noticed a growing demand for Australian real estate, particularly hotels and serviced apartments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes as no surprise to Singapore-based Paul Guest, head of research and strategy at LaSalle Investment Management, as commercial property prices in Australia are very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a forecast of about 10 percent per year, he said total returns in Australia are the highest in Asia, topping Japan's 9 percent and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also underpinning demand is Australia's relatively strong economic performance compared with Western peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Australia is one among a select club of only eight nations that can still boast a pristine triple A rating with a stable outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed the lucky country for its abundance of natural resources, white sand beaches and kind climate, it is now entering its 21st year of uninterrupted annual growth, having dodged a recession after the 2008 global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATTRACTING RICH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Australia will overtake Spain as the world's 12th largest economy, despite being 52nd in terms of population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This explains the massive increase in Australia's foreign direct investment which leapt to A$67 billion ($69.56 billion) in 2012, nearly double the previous year, according to government statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, private investment from India, a country that produces millionaires every day, would appear to lag that from others such as China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts reckon China is leading the pack though the Australian government does not keep statistics on direct investment by nationality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Arjuna Mahendran, head of Asian investment strategy at HSBC's private bank in Singapore, the lag is due to a general perception in India that Australian incentives are not as generous as those of other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is one reason the Australian government will next month launch a "significant investor" visa program, with the aim of competing with New Zealand, Canada and Singapore in attracting a growing number of Asia's rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is home to more than 7,000 millionaires whose fortunes amount to nearly $1 trillion, data from global wealth intelligence firm Wealth X shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with $465 billion held by Indian nationals living outside their home country, the total is roughly equivalent to the size of Australia's entire economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts speculate that within five years, India could have pumped as much as $30 billion into Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Australian visas will target individuals who invest at least A$5 million in certain assets, such as infrastructure government bonds, in return for concessions on the usual migration requirements including qualifications and English skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such immigration schemes tend not only to bring much-coveted long-term investment, but also contribute to economic growth and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian nationals seem well-placed to benefit from the program. India has become Australia's biggest source of migrants, including a large number of IT entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of them are very interested in exploring the path to permanent residency," said Mark Wright, immigration leader partner at Deloitte Australia.

&lt;p&gt;* Indian millionaires sit on nearly $1 trillion assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* India is largest source of migrants to Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Australia's new visa scheme to attract the wealthy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Cecile Lefort&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Oct 3 (Reuters) - India's wealthy, from old money to
nouveaux riches IT entrepreneurs, are quietly snapping up hotels
and mines Down Under just as Australia embarks on an immigration
campaign to attract long-term investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jindal family, ranked among the world's top 80 richest
by Forbes, in May bought two minor stakes, worth a total of A$26
million (US$26.99 million), in Australian iron ore and coal
mines through Jindal Steel &amp; Power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That followed a US$2 billion purchase by Indian self-made
billionaire and college-dropout Gautam Adani of a coal
mine in the state of Queensland last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverneedle Hospitality, a company backed by Nadathur S.
Raghavan, an Indian philanthropist and co-founder of software
company Infosys Technologies, just bought a hotel in
Brisbane for A$57 million. Last year, it bought a chain of about
60 hotels in Australia and New Zealand for an undisclosed sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the last six to nine months, there has been a lot of
private investment into Australia because it is seen as a
safe-haven," said Paul Dowling, principal analyst at banking
research firm East &amp; Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Indian nationals have traditionally favoured Britain
and North America as offshore investment destinations, private
wealth bankers have noticed a growing demand for Australian real
estate, particularly hotels and serviced apartments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes as no surprise to Singapore-based Paul Guest,
head of research and strategy at LaSalle Investment Management,
as commercial property prices in Australia are very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a forecast of about 10 percent per year, he said total
returns in Australia are the highest in Asia, topping Japan's 9
percent and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also underpinning demand is Australia's relatively strong
economic performance compared with Western peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Australia is one among a select club of only eight
nations that can still boast a pristine triple A rating with a
stable outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed the lucky country for its abundance of natural
resources, white sand beaches and kind climate, it is now
entering its 21st year of uninterrupted annual growth, having
dodged a recession after the 2008 global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATTRACTING RICH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Australia will overtake Spain as the world's 12th
largest economy, despite being 52nd in terms of population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This explains the massive increase in Australia's foreign
direct investment which leapt to A$67 billion ($69.56 billion)
in 2012, nearly double the previous year, according to
government statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, private investment from India, a country that
produces millionaires every day, would appear to lag that from
others such as China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts reckon China is leading the pack though the
Australian government does not keep statistics on direct
investment by nationality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Arjuna Mahendran, head of Asian investment strategy at
HSBC's private bank in Singapore, the lag is due to a general
perception in India that Australian incentives are not as
generous as those of other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is one reason the Australian government will next month
launch a "significant investor" visa programme, with the aim of
competing with New Zealand, Canada and Singapore in attracting a
growing number of Asia's rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is home to more than 7,000 millionaires whose fortunes
amount to nearly $1 trillion, data from global wealth
intelligence firm Wealth X shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with $465 billion held by Indian nationals living
outside their home country, the total is roughly equivalent to
the size of Australia's entire economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts speculate that within five years, India could have
pumped as much as $30 billion into Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Australian visas will target individuals who invest
at least A$5 million in certain assets, such as infrastructure
government bonds, in return for concessions on the usual
migration requirements including qualifications and English
skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such immigration schemes tend not only to bring much-coveted
long-term investment, but also contribute to economic growth and

&lt;p&gt;  TOWNSEND, TN, Oct 02 (Marketwire) -- 
A Smoky Mountain golf course, located just beside Cade's Cove in
Townsend, Tenn., will sell at a real estate auction on October 18.
Sitting on 141 acres, the 18-hole, par-70 Laurel Valley Golf Course will
be offered by J. P. King Auction Company.

    "It's just a unique place," said Jay Crippen, part owner of the Laurel
Valley Golf Course. "Other than the beautiful area and the views, it
backs up to the National Park, so we see a lot of wildlife that makes a
challenging course even more enjoyable."

    The Laurel Valley Golf Course is a public course that also offers private
memberships and recently underwent an extensive update. Now equipped with
a fitness center and pool area, which includes a snack bar and sweeping
views of the Smoky Mountains, the property provides activities for the
entire family. The Laurel Valley Golf Course also features a 1.5-story
clubhouse that includes a pro shop, commercial kitchen, restaurant and a
bar downstairs, while a 60-seat conference room with Smoky Mountain
views, wood beamed ceilings and hardwood floors are located above. 

    "It's really unique to have so many amenities in an area like this,
unless you're going to a resort in the Carolinas or Florida," Crippen
said. "The Laurel Valley Golf Course sits on the peaceful side of the
Smoky Mountains and provides great views on a really nice and enjoyable
course."

    Along with the auction of the 6,070-yard golf course, the sellers are
including 70 golf carts and all the maintenance equipment in the sale of
the property. The course has not been listed for sale outside of the

Smoky Mountains attract over 9 million tourists annually from all over
the world to the front door of the golf course.

clubhouse, which is located at 702 Country Club Drive in Townsend,
Tennessee. Property previews will be available by appointment on October

&lt;p&gt;* Federal-state working group pledges more lawsuits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* NY state seeks return of mortgage-related profits, damages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* JP Morgan notes Bear Stearns activity came before merger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Aruna Viswanatha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Firms responsible for the 2008
financial crisis will face more government lawsuits, federal and
state officials said on Tuesday, a day after New York state sued
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co for fraud over mortgage-backed
securities packaged and sold by Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil lawsuit accused Bear Stearns, which was bought by
JPMorgan through a government-assisted sale in early 2008, of
deceiving investors by leading them to believe the quality of
loans in the mortgage-backed securities had been carefully
evaluated, even though they had not been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear systematically ignored defects in the loans and kept
investors in the dark, according to the suit by New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York's suit is the first action to come from a
federal-state working group created this year. The state wants
JPMorgan to return profits obtained through the alleged fraud
and pay damages.  {ID:nL1E8L202Y]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman and federal authorities announced the case
during a press conference in Washington. They said more actions
were coming, although they declined to provide specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking forward to more cases," Schneiderman said at
the U.S. Justice Department's headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials defended the decision to go after JPMorgan,
even though the federal government encouraged and was heavily
involved in the investment bank's purchase of Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The liability traveled with the company, so it would be far
worse for us to send the message that this kind of fraud is to
be tolerated," Schneiderman said. "No one is above the law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit is the latest headache for JPMorgan, which also
faces separate investigations and investor pressure from a $5.8
billion trading loss that sprung from a botched hedging strategy
carried out in its London office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in a statement late Monday that it would
contest the allegations, and noted that the suit does not target
JPMorgan's activity in the lead-up to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit "relates to Bear Stearns, which we acquired over
the course of a weekend at the behest of the U.S. Government.
This complaint is entirely about historic conduct by that
entity," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ELECTION APPROACHING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes weeks before the presidential
election, but the Justice Department said there was no political
connection on the timing of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When cases are mature and ready to be brought, we bring
them," said acting Associate Attorney General Tony West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama, who is trying to show he is helping
the nation move past the devastating housing crisis and
resulting recession, announced the task force in his January
State of the Union speech. At the time, he said the group would
"help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many
Americans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The working group includes the Justice Department, the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the New York Attorney General's office and
other agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In forming the group, officials said it was designed to
avoid duplicating efforts and collaborate on specific cases to
bring actions more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Tuesday press conference, officials said the JPMorgan
case was a result of that collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators from the inspector general's office of the
Federal Housing Finance Agency reviewed "countless documents and
interviewed many witnesses," and the Justice Department handled
around 40 interviews and reviewed more than 50 deposition
transcripts, John Walsh, the U.S. Attorney for the District of
Colorado, said at the press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yesterday's filing in fact is direct proof that this
approach...is smart and it achieves results," Walsh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OVERNIGHT RESCUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When JPMorgan purchased Bear Stearns, the investment bank's 
instability was threatening the larger financial system. The
Federal Reserve and Treasury were desperate to find a buyer who
could take on its toxic assets and help calm markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said the lawsuit could make firms cautious about
engaging in the rescue of a troubled financial company in the
future. Ernest Patrikis, a partner at the law firm White &amp; Case,
said buyers in future deals of this type need to make greater
efforts to evaluate the legal dangers and isolate any
questionable business units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I'm concerned about unknown risk at what I was buying, I
wouldn't be merging it into an existing entity," said Patrikis,
who also is a former general counsel of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York. "I would keep it separate and hopefully build
enough walls to make the separateness legally effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how strong a legal defense JPMorgan will have,
said John Coffee, director of Columbia University Law School's
Center on Corporate Governance, who noted that JPMorgan acquired
Bear Stearns through "an arranged marriage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Morally it's not JPMorgan's responsibility but there were
losses and the public wants the historical record set right,"
Coffee said. "They took the bitter with the sweet when they
accepted a major package of federal financing to complete the
deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil lawsuit against JPMorgan was brought under a
powerful New York state law known as the Martin Act, which
generally does not require proof of intent, a major stumbling
block in most fraud cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statute allows the New York attorney general's office to
pursue both criminal and civil cases, although the 2006 and 2007
conduct in the JPMorgan complaint appears to fall outside the
two-year statute of limitations for misdemeanors and five-year
for felonies. The civil statute of limitations is six years.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: 2012 Report on the $6 Billion US Vending Machine 
      Operators Featuring Coca-Cola, Compass Group, ARAMARK, and Sodexo
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/8j9glf/vending_machine) 
      has announced the addition of the "Vending 
      Machine Operators" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US vending machine operators industry includes about 5,000 
      establishments (single-location companies and units of multi-location 
      companies) with combined annual revenue of about $6 billion. Major 
      companies include divisions of Coca-Cola, Compass Group, ARAMARK, and 
      Sodexo. The industry is fragmented: the top 50 companies generate about 
      40 percent of industry sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer spending and business growth drive demand, since many vending 
      machines are located in workplaces. The profitability of individual 
      companies depends on effective merchandising, reliable service and 
      maintenance, and securing prime locations. Large companies can offer a 
      wide product selection, service large accounts, and enjoy scale 
      advantages in purchasing, finance, and distribution. Small companies can 
      compete effectively by serving a local market, providing superior 
      customer service, or offering unique products. The industry is 
      labor-intensive: average annual sales per employee are about $145,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vending machine operators compete with companies providing food and 
      beverages, including restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, 
      and coffee shops.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS  TECHNOLOGY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Major products sold include cold soda (30 percent of industry sales) and 
      candy and snacks, hot beverages, hot and cold meal products, ice cream, 
      and cigarettes. The majority of cold beverages sold are soft drinks in 
      cans, bottles, or cups. Candy includes chocolate, gum, and mints. Snacks 
      include salty snacks (potato chips and pretzels); baked goods (cookies 
      and cakes); crackers, nuts, and seeds; and nutritious bars. Companies 
      may also offer office coffee services (OCS) and provide brewing 
      machines, sweeteners, and cream.

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman deploys more capital to grow faster in Brazil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Shuts down local funds, focuses on off-shore vehicles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Strategy sees link between Brazil and capital markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Guillermo Parra-Bernal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, Oct 2 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman
Sachs Group will double the capital of its Brazilian unit
to about $400 million to leverage growth in fast-growing
activities such as structured finance and corporate lending, the
bank's top two executives in the country said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is bolstering its Brazilian unit's finances to
undertake more transactions that require it to set aside more
capital, such as debt underwriting, asset securitization and
lending to corporations, Alejandro Vollbrechthausen, the
president of the unit, told Reuters in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Paulo Leme, Goldman Sachs' chairman in Brazil,
the move fits within the bank's strategy, which sees a close
correlation between Brazil's economic growth and the development
of more robust capital market activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In order to materialize all these flows of transactions, we
need that additional capital," Vollbrechthausen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is seeking fast growth in Brazil, where demand for
debt and hedging instruments has swelled as interest rates have
fallen to all-time lows this year. Companies and investors are
stepping up demand for corporate bonds, asset-backed securities
and private equity fund-related vehicles posting higher returns
than equities and government debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leme, formerly Goldman Sachs' head of Latin America economic
research, said that "for Brazil to grow it needs to increase its
investment rate and that in turn means more capital is
required." He expects mergers and acquisitions advisory as well
as debt and equity capital markets underwriting in Brazil to
gain traction in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate move, the bank agreed to shut down a group of
local funds investing in domestic equities, bonds and currency
instruments, with about $159 million under management. The Wall
Street bank will continue offering off-shore funds services to
clients, Vollbrechthausen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the staff that helped oversee those funds will move
to work with the off-shore funds, he added. Others will be
relocated to other areas of the business, Vollbrechthausen said.
He did not give the exact number of people working for the
folded structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been expanding aggressively in Brazil
since 2009, when it became a full-service financial institution.
The bank has doubled its workforce in the country over the past
two years to approximately 300 people.&lt;/p&gt;

pledged on Tuesday to bring more cases against misconduct that

federal-state working group created earlier this year to bring
such cases, roughly four years after the peak of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil lawsuit accused Bear Stearns, bought by JPMorgan
for $10 a share in March 2008, of deceiving investors by leading
them to believe that the quality of loans in the mortgage-backed
securities had been carefully evaluated, even though they had
not been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear systematically ignored defects in the loans and kept
investors in the dark, the suit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allegations are similar to those investors have charged
in private lawsuits against a much wider array of Wall Street
firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has been a great collaboration, it continues to be a
great collaboration, there are more cases to come," Schneiderman
said during a press conference on Tuesday at the U.S. Justice
Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's purchase of Bear Stearns was done with the strong
encouragement and heavy involvement of the federal government,
but officials said that does not absolve JPMorgan of Bear
Stearns' alleged misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The liability traveled with the company, so it would be far
worse for us to send the message that this kind of fraud is to
be tolerated," Schneiderman said. "No one is above the law."&lt;/p&gt;

      one of the fastest-growing technology solutions providers in the 
      Southeast, will showcase IBM PureSystems in their IBM Business Partner 
      Innovation Center (BPIC) on Thursday, October 18. The InfoSystems BPIC 
      is the only facility of its kind in Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our first responsibility is to be the absolute best resource for our 
      customers,&#8221; said Clay 
      Hales, president and CEO of InfoSystems. &#8220;The BPIC gives our 
      employees a place to gain hands-on experience by learning &#8216;on the fly&#8217; 
      and it opens the door for our customers to test technology solutions for 
      their businesses before they implement onsite. It&#8217;s a win-win.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The event 
      will feature guest presenters from IBM, and InfoSystems technical 
      experts will be on hand to discuss the expected benefits of this 
      technology and how it can be applied in a business&#8217; unique technical 
      environment. Two demonstrations and panel discussions will be offered at 
      1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. at the InfoSystems office at 1317 
      Hickory Valley Road in Chattanooga. Guests can also enjoy 
      refreshments, tour the BPIC and meet the InfoSystems&#8217; team of experts.

      BPIC centers are owned and operated by IBM Premier Business Partners who 
      provide delivery of complex solutions to customers. Facilities such as 
      the one at InfoSystems can be the ideal venue for IBM Business Partners 
      to showcase their industry-leading solutions and new technologies. IBM 
      Business Partners with BPICs are regarded as being marketplace leaders 
      in new technologies and frequently earn industry recognition, as 
      evidenced by InfoSystems&#8217; 
      recent track record of awards.

      IBM PureSystems, announced 
      on April 11 this year, builds on knowledge gained from years of 
      innovation, thousands of deployments and $2 billion in research, which 
      led IBM to create a simplified approach that could &#8220;fundamentally change 
      the economics of IT,&#8221; according to Rod Adkins, senior vice president for 
      the IBM Systems and Technology Group. The shift in economics Adkins 
      refers to comes from automating tasks associated with the deployment and 
      ongoing management of computer networks and storage systems that are 
      typically performed manually by an engineer, saving significant amounts 
      of labor costs and freeing up personnel to focus on other business 
      initiatives.

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, Oct 02 (Marketwire) -- 
According to the American Academy of Orthodontics (AAO), five million
Americans are currently undergoing some form of orthodontic treatment, 20
percent of which are over the age of 18. While similar statistics from
the Journal of the American Dental Association show that 66 to 75 percent
of American adults have some form of malocclusion, or crooked teeth, and
could benefit from orthodontics, Dr. Jeffrey Schultz, a dentist in
Houston, says selecting the right procedure can be a daunting task. At
his practice, he says Invisalign(R) and Powerprox Six Month Braces are
both popular treatments for straightening teeth, and can both provide
successful results; however, he says the ultimate decision is based on
each patient's goals.

    Despite the fact that both treatments are designed to straighten teeth in
the most efficient way possible, Dr. Schultz says a majority of patients
at his Houston cosmetic dentistry practice end up requesting
Invisalign(R) for its ability to effectively close spaces and gaps in an
aesthetically subtle way. He says between 75 and 80 percent of his adult
patients prefer Invisalign(R) because the clear plastic aligners are
barely noticeable during treatment and they can be removed for meals and
daily hygiene. Since it is the more discreet method for straightening
teeth, Dr. Schultz says Invisalign(R) is more popular amongst his adult
and teenage patients, allowing them to enhance the alignment of their
smile without drawing unwanted attention to their mouths.

    "Most of my adult patients are choosing Invisalign(R) now, simply because
it's the more cosmetic option," says Dr. Schultz. "I have found that
people would rather have something that is more cosmetically pleasing but
takes longer."

    With the Powerprox Six Month Braces system, Dr. Schultz says the benefits
include a quicker, more efficient treatment time and an improved ability
to rotate teeth. Despite the fact that some patients are wary of the term
"braces" because it conjures up images of the bulky, metal appliances
worn in junior high school, he says the innovative Powerprox device has a
much sleeker design and can be placed to look more discreet than
traditional braces. Dr. Schultz says the number of patients who request
Powerprox Six Month Braces is smaller; however, patients are often
surprised by how quickly and efficiently the treatment works.

    Dr. Schultz says both procedures begin with a thorough patient exam and a
detailed questionnaire to help determine each person's individual goals.
While the end results are often very similar, he says every patient has a
unique set of teeth, and determining the proper plan for treating
malocclusion depends on a case-by-case basis. Dr. Schultz also adds that
both Invisalign(R) and Powerprox are intended for moderate to subtle
movement of teeth, and neither will do any major bite changes. He
encourages all patients considering a dental procedure, whether it be
cosmetic orthodontics or porcelain veneers, to consult with an
experienced and qualified dentist before making any decisions.

    "Overall, I think Powerprox can provide very effective results with a
little less treatment time, whereas Invisalign(R) offers patients a more
cosmetic solution that is still incredibly successful. The ultimate
decision should be made between each individual patient and their
experienced, knowledgeable cosmetic dentist."

      Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'A' to senior guaranteed trust 
      securities issued by Vesey Street Investment Trust I. These ratings are 
      based entirely on the ratings of parent guarantor, The Goldman Sachs 
      Group, Inc. Because The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. fully and 
      unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual payment of the senior 
      guaranteed trust securities, it is Fitch's view that the senior 
      guaranteed trust securities rank pari passu with senior, unsecured 
      obligations of the guarantor. The sole assets of Vesey Street Investment 
      Trust I are junior subordinated notes of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has downgraded the APEX securities issued by Goldman Sachs Capital 
      III to 'BB+' from 'BBB-' as a result of Goldman Sachs Capital III 
      purchasing perpetual non-cumulative preferred stock of The Goldman Sachs 
      Group, Inc. consistent with Fitch's criteria 'Rating Bank Regulatory 
      Capital Securities' dated Dec. 15, 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch assigns the following rating:

&lt;p&gt;It would be so easy to be cynical about the suit New York Attorney General&#160;Eric Schneiderman&#160;brought Monday night against JPMorgan Chase, seeking to hold the bank liable for the alleged mortgage securitization fraud committed by Bear Stearns before JPMorgan acquired Bear in March 2008. I could start with the political expediency of the&#160;31-page complaint, which, on the eve of the first presidential debate, provides the Obama administration with an answer to critics who have accused regulators of going easy on big banks. Indeed, the case is so politically charged that, according to Reuters, Schneidermans federal colleagues on the administrations mortgage fraud task force&#160;were peeved&#160;that the New York AG filed the suit Monday, ahead of a joint federal-state press conference Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, theres the content of the complaint. Ive been carping for a&#160;long time&#160;that regulators were&#160;years behind&#160;lawyers representing bond insurers and private investors in mortgage-backed securities. Beginning in 2008 and 2009, private lawyers marshaled evidence from their own discovery and, later, from Congresss&#160;Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Report&#160;and the&#160;Levin-Coburn Report&#160;to produce damning, detailed complaints against JPMorgan and the other banks involved in securitization. The New York AGs new complaint cited the FCIC report and the&#160;JPMorgan suit filed in August 2011&#160;by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, but the AG really owes his biggest debt of gratitude to the monolines Ambac, Syncora and Assured Guaranty and their counsel at&#160;Patterson Belknap Webb  Tyler. Patterson has been&#160;relentless in its pursuit of Bear Stearns&#160;and, by extension, JPMorgan. Just look at the&#160;amended complaint&#160;Ambac filed in New York State Supreme Court in February 2011 against JPMorgan and the Bear mortgage arm, EMC. Its 160 pages of brutal accusation, documenting the same theories put forth by the New York AG  but in much more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those colorful quotes in the AGs suit about Bears sack of shit and shit breather securitizations? Theyre in the Ambac complaint. So are the AGs allegations that PricewaterhouseCoopers, engaged in 2006 to offer an opinion of Bears put-back practices, told the bank to stop keeping the money it recovered from the originators of deficient mortgages for itself and to start passing on its put-back recoveries to MBS investors. The AG, in other words, did a lot of piggybacking on other peoples work. I didnt see anything in Schneidermans complaint that I havent seen elsewhere in suits against Bear and JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why do I believe the AGs suit is so significant? Because Schneiderman is the first regulator to acknowledge in a legal complaint that the mortgage securitization process was rotten to its core. He is the first government official to stand up and demand legal accountability on behalf of the market and all of its participants, not just for investors in individual MBS deals like Goldmans Abacus CDO or the Magnetar and Citigroup CDOs. This action is brought by Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman on behalf of the people of the State of New York, his complaint said. The Attorney General is charged by law with protecting the integrity of the securities marketplace in the state, as well as the economic health and well-being of investors who reside or transact business in the state. You can read that as boilerplate, or you can think about what it means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney general doesnt just represent a bond insurer or a major MBS investor like Dexia or the German regional banks or even Fannie Mae and Freddie Macs conservator. Theyve all got their own private lawyers pursuing federal securities claims on their behalf. He doesnt only represent BlackRock or Pimco or any of the other institutional investor clients of&#160;Gibbs  Bruns&#160;who have&#160;asserted billions of dollars of put-back claims&#160;against JPMorgan. And he doesnt merely represent the pension funds that have found&#160;MBS class action litigation&#160;to be such an exercise in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman represents all of us  the people of New York and all of the investors harmed by the allegedly deceptive practices of mortgage securitizers. (Im assuming that the JPMorgan suit is the first in a series of similar complaints against MBS issuers.) Everyone who lost even $1 of the $22.5 billion in losses suffered by Bear Stearns mortgage-backed notes in 2006 and 2007 has an interest in the AGs case. Everyone whose pension fund or healthcare fund or retirement fund took a hit when the MBS market collapsed should be rooting for this litigation to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you remember that Schneiderman seeks accountability on our behalf, his description of Bears alleged fraud sounds simple and elegant, not warmed over and rehashed: The defendants misconduct in connection with their due diligence and quality control processes constituted a systemic fraud on thousands of investors, the complaint said. As a result of this fraudulent misconduct, investors were deceived about the fundamentally defective character of the mortgages underlying the RMBS they purchased. Mortgagors defaulted on their loans in exceedingly large numbers, causing the value of these securities to plummet, which in turn caused investors in RMBS to incur monumental losses. On our behalf, Schneiderman is demanding that JPMorgan repay every penny that Bear unjustly derived from its alleged fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fervently hope that when Schneiderman talks about exacting justice, he means it. I hope that when he and the bank discuss a resolution of this case, he remembers the awesome responsibility he holds as our lawyer and his obligation to seek accountability on our behalf. I also hope that the AGs JPMorgan suit is the beginning of a new era of MBS litigation, in which regulators target systemic flaws in the securitization process that sent housing prices to such unsustainable heights that the entire economy was wrecked when the balloon fell to earth. The AGs suit asserts only state-law claims, under the plaintiff-friendly Martin Act, leaving plenty of room for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department to bring federal securities cases or enforcement actions against JPMorgan and the other banks that allegedly profited from deceptive securitizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only by acknowledging systemic wrongdoing and seeking systemic accountability can regulators restore confidence in the system. Cynicism aside, Schneidermans suit begins that process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to&#160;Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

      anticipated that the completion of the sale of the Alliston property 
      will occur on October 12, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This will be the first distribution to investors in the Partnership. 
      Assuming the completion of the sale of the Alliston property, payment 
      will be made on November 15, 2012, to Unitholders of record as of the 
      close of business on October 18, 2012. Pursuant to the terms of the 
      Limited Partnership Agreement of the Partnership, immediately after the 
      distribution, the Units will be consolidated so that each Unit prior to 
      the distribution will become 0.548 of a Unit after the distribution, 
      resulting in a total of 1,961,840 Units outstanding. Replacement 
      certificates will not be issued by the Partnership to reflect this 
      consolidation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each partner who is a Unitholder of record at the year-end of the 
      Partnership will receive, by mail in March of 2013, a T5013 from the 
      Partnership&#8217;s transfer agent or the Unitholder&#8217;s brokerage firm. The 
      T5013 indicates the amount and nature of the taxable income that the 
      Unitholder is responsible to report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in January 2010, the Partnership&#8217;s objective is to maximize 
      returns to limited partners through the acquisition, management, concept 
      planning, and eventual sale of two properties in Ontario; the Alliston 
      Property, which consists of two parcels totaling 154.93 acres 
      (approximately 45 percent of the net proceeds) near the Toronto area in 
      Alliston, and the Ottawa Property, which consists of 300 acres 
      (approximately 55 percent of the net proceeds) in the southwest quadrant 
      of the City of Ottawa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subsequent to the closing of the sale of the Alliston Property, the 
      Partnership will continue to own and manage the Ottawa Property, and 
      will work to maximize the returns to the limited partners in respect of 
      this asset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc., part of 
      the Walton Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group is a multinational group of real estate investment and 
      development companies headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

&lt;p&gt;  PENSACOLA, FL, Oct 04 (Marketwire) -- 
Conducting its second set of bank-ordered auctions in as many years on
behalf of Hancock Bank, J. P. King Auction Company sold 75 percent of the
company's OREO properties, totaling over $15 million in sales between the
two four-day events. 

    Beginning in Pensacola on Monday, September 24, the J. P. King event
brought 48 registered bidders from five states that included Florida,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas and Arizona. Each of the following events in
Tallahassee, Jacksonville and Orlando brought nearly 30 bidders each from
Florida, California, New York and Texas. 

    After considering the size of its inventory and the associated carrying
cost, Hancock Bank hired J. P. King again to help reduce its holdings
before the end of the year. The combination of single-family homes,
condominiums, commercial buildings, lots and land brought bidders from
both coasts to compete for the bank's properties, which brought a total
of $6.7 million at auction. 

    The auction drew inquiries from 22 states and Canada, with over 500
property information requests. The remaining properties are still
available for purchase through J. P. King. Visit the Available Properties
section of J. P. King's website or contact J. P. King directly at
800.558.5464. 

    About J. P. King: J. P. King Auction Company specializes in high-value
properties and portfolios such as luxury homes, developments,
condominiums and land and ranches. The company has marketed properties in
all 50 states and six countries with recent sales in Colorado, Wyoming,
Georgia, Florida and Washington. This sale is conducted through the
company's asset division, which serves corporate clients, financial

assets.

			Goodwin Procter Names Anthony McCusker Chair of Silicon Valley Office
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goodwin 
      Procter, a national Am Law 50 firm, announced today that Anthony 
      McCusker has been named chair of its Silicon Valley office. He 
      succeeds Kevin Dennis who will continue to focus his practice on serving 
      clients in the private equity sector. Dennis had served as chair of the 
      Silicon Valley office from its opening in 2007 to 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      McCusker joined Goodwin as a partner in 2010 from Gundersen Dettmer. As 
      a co-chair of Goodwin&#8217;s Technology Companies practice, he focuses on the 
      formation and financing of emerging growth companies. In the past year, 
      he has led major venture capital tech deals, including financings for 
      Airbnb, Dropbox, Etsy, Eventbrite, Tumblr, Twilio and Viddy, and IPOs, 
      including representation of JP Morgan in Trulia&#8217;s offering and Goldman 
      Sachs in Gigamon&#8217;s upcoming offering. McCusker has also been a key 
      contributor to Goodwin Procter&#8217;s Founder&#8217;s 
      Workbench, an award-winning online resource for start-ups, emerging 
      companies and the entrepreneurial community.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Anthony&#8217;s strong, strategic vision for our Silicon Valley office, 
      combined with his deep involvement in the worlds of venture capital and 
      technology-driven start-ups, make him a natural choice to lead our 
      growth in this region,&#8221; said Regina 
      M. Pisa, Chairman of Goodwin Procter. &#8220;We&#8217;re delighted that he will 
      be spearheading the further expansion of Goodwin&#8217;s Valley presence.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In his new role, McCusker will oversee the growth of Goodwin&#8217;s Silicon 
      Valley office, which opened in June 2007 and is now home to more 
      than 50 attorneys. The office has made several significant hires in 
      recent months, including growing its MA specialty with the addition of 
      Lawrence Chu, and bolstering its Labor  Employment Practice with the 
      hire of Kristen Garcia Dumont.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      McCusker will also continue to co-lead the firm&#8217;s Technology 
      Companies practice, which interconnects business, emerging science, 
      new technologies and the law. With more than 160 attorneys nationwide, 
      Goodwin&#8217;s Technology Companies Practice is one of the largest in the 
      United States and represents more than 800 technology-based companies, 
      including a third of Fortune 100 companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      McCusker received his B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley, 
      and his J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of the 
      Law.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4269 and 4270 Trusts
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4269 - 'AA+/F1', Stable Outlook; DRIVERs, Series 4269 
      - 'AA+', Stable Outlook; and--PUTTERs, Series 4270 - 'AA/F1', 
      Stable Outlook; DRIVERs, Series 4270 - 'AA', Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA+', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4269 
      PUTTERs and DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to 
      the Massachusetts School Building Authority Senior Dedicated Sales Tax 
      Refunding Bonds, 2012 Series A (rated 'AA+', Stable Outlook) that have 
      been deposited in the series 4269 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4270 
      PUTTERs and DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to 
      The Regents of the University of California Limited Project Revenue 
      Bonds, Series G (rated 'AA', Stable Outlook) that have been deposited in 
      the series 4270 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' ratings assigned to the series 4269 and 4270 PUTTERs 
      are based on the liquidity facilities provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
      N.A. (rated 'A+/F1', long-term rating on Rating Watch Negative). The 
      'F1' rating assigned to the series 4269 and 4270 PUTTERs will expire on 
      Oct. 3, 2013, the expiration date of each of the liquidity facilities, 
      unless such dates are extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 4 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said a late-stage study
of its Prevenar 13 vaccine met the main trial goal, and the data
will help to expand a European regulatory application for the
vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal of the study was to show that the immune
response to the vaccine in the 18 to 49 year old age group was
non-inferior when compared to the response in the 60 to 64 year
group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevenar, known as Prevnar in the United States and one of
Pfizer's top-selling products, prevents infection by
streptococcus pneumoniae - a bacterium that can cause pneumonia,
meningitis and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevenar 13 protects against 13 strains of the streptococcus
pneumoniae, while Prevenar protects against seven strains.&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Announces Top-Line Results Of Prevenar 13&#174; 
      Phase 3 Trial In Adults 18 To 49 Years Of Age
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Data Support EU Regulatory Filing and Planned Worldwide Regulatory 
      Filings For This Age Group
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced top-line data assessing 
      immunogenicity, tolerability and safety of Prevenar 13&#174;* 
      (Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent, absorbed]) in 
      adults 18 to 49 years of age. These data support a recent regulatory 
      submission to expand the indication of Prevenar 13 in the European Union 
      to include adults between 18 and 49 years old, and will be used to 
      support similar planned submissions in other countries around the world 
      in the future.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the 
      immune response to Prevenar 13 in the 18 to 49 year old age group is 
      noninferior to the immune response to Prevenar 13 in the 60 to 64 year 
      old age group as measured by serotype specific opsonophagocytic assay 
      (OPA) titers one month after vaccination. The primary objective was met 
      for all 13 serotypes in
			Prevenar 13.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The clinical program for Prevenar 13 demonstrates our commitment to 
      developing vaccines that can prevent serious disease through every stage 
      of life,&#8221; said William Gruber, M.D., senior vice president, Vaccine 
      Clinical Research and Development, Pfizer Inc. &#8220;Prevenar 13 is the first 
      and only pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults, and we continue to 
      study the vaccine in new populations with the aim of broadening its 
      availability.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease is associated with significant mortality and 
      morbidity for individuals of all ages. Prevenar 13 provides the broadest 
      coverage of any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and has proven 
      effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease in children less 
      than 2 years of age when used as part of a routine pediatric 
      immunization program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 is currently approved in more than 110 countries worldwide 
      for use in infants and young children and in more than 70 countries for 
      use in adults 50 years of age and older. Prevenar 13 also is available 
      through the World Health Organization (WHO) pre-qualification program 
      for active immunization of infants and young children, as well as adults 
      50 years and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Study
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Study 6115A1-004 is a pivotal, Phase 3, multi-center trial designed to 
      compare the immunogenicity, tolerability and safety of Prevenar 13 and 
      the currently licensed nonconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
      (PPSV) in 740 adults 60 to 64 years of age who were na&#239;ve to PPSV, using 
      a randomized, modified double-blind design. The study also assessed 
      immunogenicity, tolerability and safety of Prevenar 13 administered 
      open-label to 370 adults 50 to 59 years of age and compared to adults 60 
      to 64 years of age. Additionally, 900 healthy adults 18 to 49 years of 
      age (patients with stable chronic risk conditions were eligible for 
      inclusion) were assessed. These participants received open-label 
      Prevenar 13 to assess the immune response to Prevenar 13 in that younger 
      age group and to compare immune responses with participants 60 to 64 
      years of age. Serotype specific anti-pneumococcal functional antibodies 
      were measured for all 18 to 49 year old participants prior to 
      vaccination, at one month following vaccination and again at one year 
      following vaccination with Prevenar 13.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A detailed analysis of this immunogenicity and safety study data will be 
      submitted for future publication. Data concerning the 50 years of age 
      and older cohorts were previously presented at the 21st European 
      Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Prevenar 13 and Conjugate Technology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 uses Company-pioneered conjugate technology that links 
      pneumococcal polysaccharide sugar chains found on the surface of each 
      bacterial serotype with a carrier protein. Prevenar 13 uses the carrier 
      protein CRM197, which has more than 20 years of clinical and 
      commercial use in vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease (PD) is a group of illnesses caused by the 
      bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), also 
      known as pneumococcus. It can affect people of all ages, although older 
      adults, young children and individuals with certain chronic medical 
      conditions are at heightened risk. PD is associated with significant 
      morbidity and mortality. Non-invasive PD includes non-bacteremic 
      pneumococcal pneumonia (acute lower respiratory infection that affects 
      the lungs), which is the most common form of PD in adults, as well as 
      sinusitis (upper respiratory tract infection) and acute otitis media 
      (middle ear infection, most often found in children). Invasive 
      manifestations of the disease include bacteremic pneumonia (lung 
      infection with bacteria in the blood), bacteremia (bacteria in the 
      blood) and meningitis (infection of the tissues surrounding the brain 
      and spinal cord).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EU Indications for Prevenar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the European Union, Prevenar 13 is indicated for active immunization 
      for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae in adults aged 50 years and older caused by 13 Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae serotypes. The vaccine is also indicated for active 
      immunization for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute 
      otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants and 
      children from 6 weeks to 5 years of age.

			U.S. Indications for Prevnar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13 is a vaccine indicated for adults 50 years of age and older 
        for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive disease 
        caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 
        6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). This indication is based upon 
        immune responses to the vaccine
      
			
        In children 6 weeks through 5 years of age, Prevnar 13 is indicated 
        for the prevention of invasive disease caused by these same strains, 
        and for the prevention of ear infection caused by 7 of the 13 strains
      
			
        Prevnar 13 is not 100% effective and will only help protect against 
        the 13 strains included in the vaccine
      
			
        Effectiveness when given less than 5 years after a pneumococcal 
        polysaccharide vaccine is not known
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a history of severe 
        allergic reaction to any component of Prevnar 13 or any diphtheria 
        toxoid&#8211;containing vaccine
      
			
        Children and adults with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV infection, 
        leukemia) may have a reduced immune response
      
			
        In adults, the common side effects were pain, redness, or swelling at 
        the injection site, limitation of arm movement, fatigue, headache, 
        muscle pain, joint pain, decreased appetite, chills, or rash
      
			
        In adults, immune responses to Prevnar 13 were reduced when given with 
        injected seasonal flu vaccine
      
			
        A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been observed 
        in some infants born prematurely
      
			
        The most commonly reported serious adverse events in children were 
        bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs) (0.9%), gastroenteritis 
        (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine) (0.9%), and 
        pneumonia (0.9%)
      
			
        In infants and toddlers, the most common side effects were tenderness, 
        redness or swelling at the injection site, irritability, decreased 
        appetite, decreased or increased sleep, and fever
      
			
        Ask your health care provider about the risks and benefits of Prevnar 
        13. Only a health care provider can decide if Prevnar 13 is right for 
        you

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 4 (Reuters) - Recruitment firm Robert Walters
 ground out a 1 percent rise in gross profit in the third
quarter as a slowdown in the financial services sector in its
core Asia Pacific region held back more resilient performances
in Europe and Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white-collar hiring agency, which places people in
accountancy, banking, and administration jobs, reported a 5
percent year-on-year fall in Asia Pacific, where it derives half
of its gross profit, though investors may be buoyed that the
24.1 million pounds represents sequential quarter on quarter
growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the group were down 0.9 percent at 0707 GMT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly cyclical recruitment industry was hit hard by the
global economic slowdown, causing London-listed firms to turn to
new markets for opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lower forecasts from the Asian Development Bank for the
region and weak services data from China on Wednesday confirmed
that even that region is slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Asia Pacific has continued to be impacted by the ongoing
weakness in the financial services sector," Chief Executive and
founder Robert Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Trading conditions in the UK, Continental Europe, the
Americas and South Africa remained broadly unchanged in the
third quarter," he added. The group, which has 47 offices in 23
countries, expanded into Brazil and Australia last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the third quarter was up 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group said that they saw strong net fee income growth in
Germany and France, where President Francois Hollande just
unveiled tough belt-tightening measures in his 2013 budget,
including a 75 percent tax on the highest earners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain, representing just over a quarter of Robert Walters'
business, saw a growth of 8 percent, despite slipping back into
recession in the final quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headcount also increased after Resource Solutions, the
group's recruitment outsourcing business, won a new number of
clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAYTOWN, Texas (Reuters) - A fire broke out late Wednesday at Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) refining and chemical complex in Baytown, Texas, the largest operating U.S. refinery, Exxon Mobil said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire at the 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) refinery east of Houston was under control and remaining plant operations were not affected, Exxon said. There were no reported injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to sources familiar with refinery operations, the fire broke out at the diesel hydrotreating unit, which uses hydrogen to remove sulfur from motor fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon did not specify the exact location of the fire, which was reported at about 5:00 pm local time (2200 GMT), disclosing that it was confined to a refinery process unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Remaining plant operations were not impacted from the event," said Exxon spokeswoman Rachael Moore in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hole in a reactor caused the fire and triggered flaring at the complex, a filing with the U.S. National Response Center (NRC) showed. It did not identify the unit involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said emergency response teams had the fire under control at the five-square-mile (13 square km) complex, one of the world's biggest refining and petrochemical plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video from local television station KRTK earlier showed flames high up on a column at the complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said it will investigate the cause of the blaze and the president of the refinery workers union said they were ready to join the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody was hurt, that's the good thing," said Ricky Brooks, of the United Steelworkers union. "We're looking forward to working with the company to find the cause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two hours after the fire broke out, a large firefighting apparatus could be seen spraying water on the blaze, creating a cloud of steam and smoke in the middle of the maze of pipes and columns at the heart of the refinery, according to a Reuters eyewitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire appeared to damage the side of the unit in the images broadcast on television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hydrotreater is not a main production unit at a refinery. The loss of a diesel hydrotreater could lead to reduced diesel production, but would not impact wide-scale plant operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For refinery outages in the Reuters Oil Fundamentals Database see here or go to)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Soma Das and Naveen Arul in Bangalore; Editing by Gary Hill, Himani Sarkar and Miral Fahmy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Barry Zubrow was on watch when derivatives risk grew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Zubrow had been regulatory affairs head since January&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 5 (Reuters) - Barry Zubrow, who was head of risk
management at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co when the bank was
building a dangerously large position in credit derivatives, is
retiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zubrow, 59, will leave the company at the end of the year,
according to an internal memo from CEO Jamie Dimon, which the
bank released on Friday. Zubrow's job had changed in January to
head of corporate and regulatory affairs from chief risk
officer. In May, the company first disclosed losses on the
derivatives that as of July totaled $5.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zubrow said in his own memo to colleagues that he will
retire from banking and continue "my work in educational,
governmental and other not-for-profit organizations." He began 
talking to Dimon 18 months ago about retiring by the time he
turns 60 in February, according to a person familiar with his
plans who did not want to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memos made no reference to Zubrow's specific work on
risk at the company. Dimon said Zubrow, who was a member of the
company's elite operating committee for five years, "has been a
valued partner and a generous mentor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zubrow had become a leader in JPMorgan's push against
proposed new regulations on financial institutions after he
became head of regulatory affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Zubrow signed a 67-page letter to federal
regulators setting out JPMorgan's opposition to proposals to
implement the so-called Volcker Rule to prohibit banks from
making bets in the financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zubrow's credibility was undermined in May when JPMorgan
disclosed it had lost billions of dollars on credit derivatives
in London where hedge funds had nicknamed a bank trader the
"London Whale" because of the size of positions he took.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not help that Zubrow's brother-in-law, Irvin Goldman,
was named the top risk manager at the chief investment office in
February, the month after Zubrow changed jobs. Goldman, who
resigned from JPMorgan in July, had been working in the CIO

numerous and long-standing deficiencies in risk management in
the chief investment office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zubrow was hired to be chief risk officer for the entire
bank from November 2007. During his tenure JPMorgan was praised
for having emerged from the financial crisis as one of the
strongest of the big U.S. banks because of its conservative
business practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zubrow previously worked for 25 years at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc where he became chief administrative officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the London Whale losses appeared, people inside and
outside the bank expected Zubrow's profile to decline. In

&lt;p&gt;Overview
     -- We expect continued deterioration in operating trends to cause 
U.S.-based school memorabilia company Visant Holding Corp.'s credit metrics to 
weaken further over the near term.
     -- We are revising our 'B+' rating outlook to negative from stable.
     -- The negative outlook reflects our expectation that weak economic 
conditions and changing student purchasing habits will cause continued 
pressure on revenue and EBITDA over the near term, likely limiting future 
deleveraging.
 
Rating Action
On Oct. 5, 2012, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services revised its rating outlook 
on Armonk, N.Y.-based Visant Holding Corp. to negative from stable.

At the same time, we affirmed our 'B+' corporate credit rating on the company, 
along with all related issue-level ratings on the company's debt.

Rationale
The outlook revision to negative reflects our expectation that Visant's 
ongoing unfavorable revenue trends will continue to pressure EBITDA and 
discretionary cash flow, drive leverage higher, and could weaken its interest 
coverage. We continue to assess Visant's business risk profile as "fair," 
based on our criteria, given the good market position and solid operating 
EBITDA margin compared with its principal competitor. We view its financial 
risk profile as "highly leveraged" because of its high debt level and an 
aggressive financial policy, demonstrated by a large, special dividend in 2010.

Visant publishes school yearbooks and manufactures and sells school class 
rings, together known as "school affinity products." The school affinity 
product market is a mature business with relatively high barriers to entry. 
Visant has a strong competitive position in this niche business because of its 
existing relationships with customers and strong product offerings. These 
strengths, along with effective cost management, result in Visant having an 
EBITDA margin higher than its key competitor. Offsetting these strengths is 
the fact that a major portion of Visant's revenues and EBITDA are seasonal and 
highly dependent on the North American academic cycle. Because of the 
discretionary nature of purchases, Visant's operations are vulnerable to 
weakness in the economy and gold price spikes, which together have caused 
consumers to shift to lower-priced metals for jewelry and affinity products 
and have pressured revenues of late. 

Under our base-case scenario, we expect that for the remainder of 2012, 
revenue and EBITDA will decline at low- to mid-single-digit percentage rates, 
reflecting lower volumes resulting from continued weakness in consumer 
discretionary spending. This scenario incorporates the assumption that volumes 
will likely decline in the third quarter and that cost savings from plant 
consolidation of memory book facilities are likely to take longer than 
previously anticipated. In 2013, based on the current economic outlook, we 
have assumed current revenue flatness will likely persist. We expect the 
EBITDA margin to remain relatively flat or possibly decline modestly in 2013 
based on product development costs that are partially offset by the consumer 
shift to nontraditional low-cost rings. Longer term, we see moderate growth 
trends in class rings revenue and EBITDA subject to economic conditions 
improvement and gold price pressure easing. In yearbooks, we see a risk that 
digital substitution could pressure yearbook sales.

For the second quarter ended June 30, 2012, Visant reported a year-over-year 
6% decrease in revenues and 8% drop in operating income, slightly below our 
expectations. The performance reflected weak economic conditions, leading to 
lower graduation product sales and weak textbook sales. The EBITDA margin 
improved to 24.1%, compared with 23.1% in the prior-year period, and remains 
above its peers because of lower raw material costs. Over the past 12 months, 
Visant converted roughly 25.7% of EBITDA into discretionary cash flow, in line 
with our expectations; we expect discretionary cash flow to remain relatively 
flat until economic conditions improve.

Lease-adjusted debt to EBITDA was high, at 7x as of June 30, 2012, slightly 
higher than the same period last year and consistent with the 7x-and-higher 
leverage threshold that we associate with a highly leveraged financial risk 
profile. Higher leverage resulted from modestly lower EBITDA. Lease-adjusted 
EBITDA coverage of interest was 1.8x, in line with our expectations. We expect 
Visant's 2012 full-year debt leverage to remain in the low-7x area and 
interest coverage to remain in the high-1x area, based on our outlook for 
full-year EBITDA to be modestly lower. In 2013, we expect debt leverage to 
increase and interest coverage to weaken based on our base-case assumption of 
a modest EBITDA decline. 

Liquidity
We believe Visant has "adequate" sources of liquidity (based on our criteria) 
to more than cover its needs over the next 12 to 18 months, even in the event 
of moderate unforeseen EBITDA declines. Our assessment of Visant's liquidity 
profile incorporates the following expectations and assumptions:
     -- We expect sources of liquidity (including cash and facility 
availability) over the next 12 to 18 months to exceed uses by 1.2x or more. 
     -- We expect net sources would be positive, even with a 15% to 20% or 
larger drop in EBITDA over the next 12 months. Debt maturities over the next 
12 months are minimal.
     -- We believe Visant has the capacity to absorb high-impact, 
low-probability adversities.
     -- We believe the company has a satisfactory standing in the credit 
markets.
 
Liquidity sources include cash balances of $63.8 million as of June 30, 2012, 
our expectation of 2012 positive discretionary cash flow between $80 million 
and $100 million, and $163.1 million availability under Visant's $175 million 
revolving credit facility. Uses of liquidity include modest working capital 
requirements and capital expenditures, which we expect to be about $50 million 
over the next 12 months. We do not expect Visant to make additional dividend 
payments and meaningful acquisitions over the next 12 months.

Visant's earliest maturity is the 2015 maturity of the revolver ($175 
million), followed by the 2016 maturity of the term loan ($1.25 billion) and 
the 2017 maturity of the senior notes ($750 million). The company's credit 
facilities contain total leverage and interest coverage covenants. Visant had 
a 21% cushion against its total leverage covenant of 7.75x, on June 30, 2012, 
its tightest. We expect Visant to maintain adequate headroom against the 
covenants over the next 12 to 18 months, despite scheduled step-downs and a 
weak earnings outlook. 

Recovery analysis
For the complete recovery analysis, a report will be published as soon as 
possible after this report, on RatingsDirect. 

Outlook
Our rating outlook on Visant is negative, reflecting our view that credit 
metrics will continue to weaken over the near term. We could lower the rating 
if we become convinced that persistent EBITDA declines will lead to adjusted 
debt leverage above 7.25x on a sustained basis. We could also lower the rating 
if a structural demand shift becomes apparent that makes us less comfortable 
with the company's business prospects, and suggests further deterioration of 
credit measures.

We believe chances of an upgrade over the near term are remote, and would 
likely entail sustained lower leverage. An upgrade scenario would likely 
entail the company using excess cash largely for debt repayment. However, we 
believe management's aggressive financial policy could again lead to a 
leveraging transaction if business prospects improve. Therefore, without a 
firm commitment to establishing and maintaining leverage at or below 5.5x, we 
do not see a near-term upgrade scenario.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, Oct. 5, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Santo Mining Corporation (OTCBB:SANP), (the "Company"), is pleased to announce that Salvador Brouwer, a qualified geologist and independent part-time consultant for Santo Mining Corp., provided the following report on the "WALTER" claim after wrapping up a two week preliminary exploration survey. Mr. Brouwer was assisted in the field by Geologist Professor Luz Iris Contreras and seasoned sampler Francisco "Ramoncito" Vasquez. "The Walter Concession is located half way between the Cerro de Maimon Mine (VMS) and the world class mine of Barrick's Pueblo Viejo.&#160;Even though most of the surface area of the concession is covered by Quaternary fluvial sediments, there are plenty of outcrops in the five creeks that meander through the area.&#160;The rock under these sediments is the Maimon Schist, a bimodal metavolcanics formation.&#160;Foliation is well developed and a few areas of hydrothermal alterations were observed in The Lajas and Guar&#233; creeks. A total of 87 active sediment samples were taken at 100 meter intervals.&#160;Selected samples have been taken to the Acme Laboratories for assaying. On the banks of the Guar&#233; Creek exits the remains of a Colonial Spanish Smelter, where samples of slag with remaining copper carbonates are found.&#160;This slag is likely the smelting remains of the Copper minerals mined at the Loma La Mina deposit, two kilometers to the North of Walter. This concession has considerable potential of finding Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS) deposits similar to Perilya Gold's nearby Cerro de Maimon, Loma Pesada, Loma La Mina, etc."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Mobile phone maker Motorola achieved a rare victory against software giant Microsoft in a patent case before a German court on Friday, the latest in a wave of patent lawsuits by technology firms fighting over market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional court in Mannheim ruled that Motorola Mobility, part of Google, did not infringe a Microsoft patent which enables applications to work on different handsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows application developers to avoid writing separate codes for each handset saving time and development costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany has become a major battleground in the global patent war between makers of mobile phones, tablet computer devices and their operating software because court actions there have proved relatively cheap and quicker than in other jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has won three patent cases against Motorola in Germany. As a result of these rulings, smartphones with the disputed technology are no longer available on the German market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision does not impact multiple injunctions Microsoft has already been awarded and has enforced against Motorola products in Germany," said David Howard, associate general counsel at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google bought lossmaking Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion last year, in its largest acquisition ever, aiming to use the company's patents to fend off legal challenges against its Android mobile platform and expand beyond its software business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other technology companies have also invested billions of dollars in buying up patent portfolios that they can use against rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Harro ten Wolde.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - Pfizer Ltd, the India unit of U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc, will challenge the country's patent office for revoking a patent for its cancer drug Sutent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which will appeal before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board, said on Friday the Indian Patent Office's decision raised concerns over India's commitment to protect intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the decision undermines intellectual property rights in India and we will vigorously defend our basic Sutent patent," Jazz Tobaccowalla, managing director of Pfizer India, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision is the latest tussle between Big Pharma and India, following a move by the patent office in March to strip Germany's Bayer AG of its exclusive right to sell another cancer drug, Nexavar. Bayer has challenged that decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the Delhi High Court ruled in favor of local drugmaker Cipla Ltd in a patent infringement case filed by Switzerland's Roche Holding AG over Cipla's cancer drug Erlocip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's $12 billion drug market is seen by major Western drugmakers as a huge opportunity, but they are wary of the level of protection for intellectual property in a country where generic medicines account for more than 90 percent of sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kaustubh Kulkarni and Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Prateek Chatterjee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group's asset management unit on Monday named a former head of the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's investment management division as its deputy general counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew "Buddy" Donohue, who most recently was a partner in the New York office of Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP, will join Goldman Sachs Asset Management effective November 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donohue said he decided to make the change because he believes he can make more of an impact in-house. "I like being part of the discussions with management about issues and approaches the firm can take early on," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donohue will report to Ellen Porges, general counsel for Goldman Sachs Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was head of the division of investment management at the SEC from May 2006 to November 2010. In his role, he spearheaded an initiative to restrict how much mutual fund companies could charge in marketing and servicing fees, known as 12b-1 fees. The proposal was met with vehement opposition and ultimately never passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donohue also led the SEC's examination of how ETFs use derivatives, which is ongoing. Prior to the SEC, Donohue served as global general counsel for Merrill Lynch Investment Managers and before that as general counsel at OppenheimerFunds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management has $702 billion in assets, according to the firm's website. The firm's 75 mutual funds alone have $190 billion, according to Lipper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This story originally appeared on IFRe.com, a Thomson Reuters
publication)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Helen Bartholomew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Oct 8 (IFR) - Concerns of a collateral shortfall may
have been overplayed as the universe of AAA/AA bonds growing by
around USD1trn per year according to analysts at JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study from the US dealer may help to alleviate
fears of the collateral impact stemming from new rules that will
push over-the-counter derivatives through central clearing from
January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, warnings of the decline in top rated
assets have come thick and fast. The IMF predicts that USD9trn
of AAA/AA assets will disappear from the market by 2016 as
further sovereign issuers suffer downgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Barclays Multiverse Index, the universe of
AAA/AA bonds has grown by USD9trn since the end of 2008. JP
Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou believes that growth will
continue at a steady pace "due to elevated and persistent
government deficits among major developed countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPM analysis follows recent comments from Benoit Coeure,
executive board member of the European Central Bank, who argues
that there is no shortage of collateral and that the ECB is
addressing the problem of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such interventions include support of covered bond issuance,
lowering the ratings barrier for ABS issuance, implementation of
cross-border tri-party collateral management services, and the
central bank temporarily accepting foreign currency assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panigirtzoglou notes that while the share of AAA bonds has
fallen since the downgrades of France and the US, rating
requirements have also declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tri-party repo agreements with strict AAA requirements have
been relaxed to also include AA collateral," he said in a
report. "We find very few bond funds with specific AAA mandates.
Similarly, pension funds and insurance companies have no rating
restrictions in their mandates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments may help to alleviate fears of a forthcoming
collateral crunch as the USD648trn universe of over-the-counter
derivatives gets swept up by the central clearing mandate that
is set to become effective as of January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its calculations, JPM analysts believe the additional
demand for collateral will be limited as the majority of the OTC
derivatives markets already use collateral agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a margin survey from the International Swaps
and Derivatives Association conducted earlier this year, 84% of
all transactions are now executed with a collateral agreement,
compared to 80% in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collateral in the uncleared derivatives market jumped 24%
through 2011 to USD1.8trn, which JPM analysts translate to
USD700bn of "real collateral" posted assuming a 2.5 times
re-hypothecation rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent estimates of the additional requirement stemming from
new regulations for OTC derivatives vary wildly. A recent paper
from the Bank of England put the figure at USD200bn-USD800bn,
depending on netting benefits, rising to as much as USD1.7trn
under a stressed scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if we take these initial margin calculations into
account and assume total additional collateral needs of USD1trn,
this is not large compared to the collateral supply metrics,"
notes Panigirtzoglou, referencing the BoE report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IMF last year calculated a figure of USD100bn-USD200bn,
while estimates from Tabb Group caused alarm by predicting that
the requirement relating to OTC derivatives could be as much as

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Jessica Toonkel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group's 
asset management unit on Monday named a former head of the U.S.
Security and Exchange Commission's investment management
division as its deputy general counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew "Buddy" Donohue, who most recently was a partner in
the New York office of Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP, will join
Goldman Sachs Asset Management effective Nov. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donohue said he decided to make the change because he
believes he can make more of an impact in-house. "I like being
part of the discussions with management about issues and
approaches the firm can take early on," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donohue will report to Ellen Porges, general counsel for
Goldman Sachs Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was head of the division of investment management at the
SEC from May 2006 to November 2010. In his role, he spearheaded
an initiative to restrict how much  mutual fund companies could
charge in marketing and servicing fees, known as 12b-1 fees. The
proposal was met with vehement opposition and ultimately never
passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donohue also led the SEC's examination of how ETFs use
derivatives, which is ongoing. Prior to the SEC, Donohue served
as global general counsel for Merrill Lynch Investment Managers
and before that as general counsel at OppenheimerFunds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management has $702 billion in assets,
according to the firm's website. The firm's 75 mutual funds
alone have $190 billion, according to Lipper.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Boingo Wireless (NASDAQ: WIFI), the Wi-Fi industry&#8217;s leading provider of 
      software and services worldwide, announced today that Microsoft is 
      sponsoring free Wi-Fi access at high-traffic New York and San Francisco 
      locations from now through the end of the year. The Wi-Fi sponsorship is 
      part of the launch celebration for Windows 8, and will introduce the new 
      Windows Store for Windows 8 to the app builder community. Consumers can 
      also enjoy browsing great new apps in the Windows Store, view staff 
      recommendations and get personalized picks based on apps they may 
      already use.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the holiday promotion, Microsoft&#8217;s sponsored Wi-Fi is 
      immediately available for users of all Wi-Fi enabled devices in six 
      Manhattan subway stations, supported by Transit Wireless&#8217; 
      state-of-the-art network, and across Wi-Fi hotzones covering iconic San 
      Francisco locations including Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, UN Plaza, 
      the Financial District, Nob Hill and more. Microsoft will also sponsor 
      Wi-Fi via more than 200 Manhattan hotzones, starting November 1. The 
      Wi-Fi hotspots are part of Boingo&#8217;s Cloud Nine media platform, a global 
      advertising network that enables brand advertisers to reach target 
      audiences through high engagement Wi-Fi sponsorship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Microsoft, we know that amazing apps are being built in New York and 
      San Francisco, and we want to give talented developers the chance to 
      launch their businesses through the Windows Store,&#8221; said John Richards, 
      Senior Director at Microsoft Corp. &#8220;We hope our Boingo Wi-Fi sponsorship 
      will introduce the Windows 8 opportunity to app builders in NYC and San 
      Francisco, while providing folks with Wi-Fi connectivity on-the-go.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s sponsorship of Wi-Fi in New York and San Francisco is a 
      testament to the targeted reach and deep engagement Boingo&#8217;s Cloud Nine 
      advertising network delivers,&#8221; said Dawn Callahan, vice president of 
      consumer marketing for Boingo Wireless. &#8220;Our Wi-Fi sponsorships deliver 
      meaningful advertiser content to key consumer audiences, help partner 
      venues meet their revenue needs, and keep people connected from subway 
      station to city center.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;New York is always bustling during the holidays, and Microsoft&#8217;s 
      sponsorship of Boingo Wi-Fi on the Transit Wireless subway wireless 
      network will help straphangers stay connected,&#8221; said Jerry Page, MTA 
      director of strategic initiatives. &#8220;We&#8217;ve received positive feedback 
      from our subway riders on Boingo&#8217;s sponsored Wi-Fi, and look forward to 
      having them continue this free service through the holidays.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Norway: Total Exchanges Assets with ExxonMobil in the North Sea
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulatory News:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total (Paris:FP) (LSE:TTA) (NYSE:TOT) has today announced an exchange of 
      interests with ExxonMobil in a range of producing and undeveloped North 
      Sea assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In exchange for its interests in the PL089 license (5.6%) and the Sygna 
      (2.52%), Statfjord &#216;st (2.8%) and Snorre (6.18%) fields, Total will 
      receive from ExxonMobil its 4.7% interest in the Oseberg field and its 
      4.33 % interest in the Oseberg transportation system, together with its 
      interests in the PL029c license (100%) and the PL029b license (30%), 
      which contain part of the Dagny field. In addition, a minor cash 
      compensation will also be paid by Total to ExxonMobil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Oseberg is one of the largest oil and gas fields in the Norwegian North 
      Sea, and includes a number of satellite fields currently under 
      development. Dagny reserves are estimated by the Norwegian Petroleum 
      Directorate (NPD) to be 205 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and 
      the Final Investment Decision (FID) of the field development is expected 
      before the end of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the assets exchange with ExxonMobil, Total&#8217;s interest in the 
      Oseberg field will increase from 10% to 14.7% and in the Dagny field 
      from 6.54% to 39.54%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This exchange is expected to close before the end of 2012. It remains 
      subject to the approval of the Norwegian authorities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Commenting on the deal, Patrice de Vivies, Total&#8217;s Senior Vice President 
      Exploration&#160;&#160;Production for Northern Europe, said: &#8220;It 
      has been a longstanding objective of Total to rationalise its portfolio 
      in Norway and strengthen its interests in assets considered to have 
      upside potential. This exchange with ExxonMobil allows us to focus our 
      efforts on fewer and larger assets.&#8221;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since the late 1960s, the Total Group has played a major role in 
      development of a large number of Norwegian fields, notably Frigg and 
      Heimdal. Norway was the largest contributor to the Group&#8217;s equity 
      production in 2011 with 287,000 boe per day. Before the asset exchange 
      with ExxonMobil, Total held interests in 90 production licenses in 
      offshore Norway, 22 as operator.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the first semester 2011 the developments of the Ekofisk South and 
      Ekofisk ll fields were launched, in which Total has a 39.9% interest. 
      Each development has a production capacity of 70,000 boe per day and 
      production start-up is expected in 2014 and 2015 respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In November 2011, the Plan for Development and Operation (PDO) for the 
      operated Atla fast-track subsea field development was approved by the 
      Norwegian authorities. Atla is scheduled to come on stream in October 
      2012. In January 2012, Total submitted the PDO for the Martin Linge 
      field, a stand-alone field development planned to come on stream in 
      Q4&#160;2016. The PDO was approved by the Storting (Norwegian Parliament) in 
      June 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2011, Total made two promising discoveries as operator. The first is 
      on Norvarg in the Barents Sea, with reserves that could reach up to 300 
      million boe; the second is on Alve North in the Norwegian Sea close to 
      existing infrastructure. Appraisal of both discoveries is being planned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the 2011 (APA) Licensing Round, announced on 17 January 2012, Total 
      was granted interests in an additional eight licences in the Norwegian 
      North Sea, including five as operator.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS Oct 8 (Reuters) - France's Total and Exxon
Mobil Corp have agreed to exchange interests in a range
of assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, Total said in a
statement on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will see Total's interest in the Oseberg field -
one of the largest oil and gas fields in the Norwegian North Sea
and including a number of satellite fields under development -
rise to 14.7 percent from 10 percent, the French oil major said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its holding in the Dagny field - whose reserves are
estimated by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate to be 205
million barrels - will rise to 39.54 percent from 6.54 percent,
Total added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total will also pay a "minor cash compensation" to Exxon as
part of the deal, which is expected to close before the end of
the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has been a longstanding objective of Total to

Executive Steve Ballmer has signaled a new direction for the
world's largest software company, pointing to hardware and
online services as its future, taking a page from long-time

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) warned that third-quarter profits would be "substantially lower" than the previous quarter as a hurricane and maintenance curbed its oil and gas output and a fire hit its refining arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron's shares fell 1.2 percent in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company said on Tuesday that the key crude unit at its oldest refinery in Richmond, California, would remain offline through the fourth quarter after it was badly damaged in an August 6 fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact was apparent as its average U.S. refinery input fell 92,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 836,000 bpd in July and August, when compared with the second quarter average. This largely reflected the Richmond unit shutdown, it said, and was only partially offset by higher international refinery output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the upstream side, Chevron's average U.S. production of oil and gas from wells fell to 640,000 bpd in July and August, compared with an average of 659,000 bpd for all of the second quarter. This stemmed largely from shutting down in the Gulf of Mexico for Hurricane Isaac in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, Chevron produced the oil equivalent of 2.52 million bpd in the first two months of the quarter, down from an average 2.62 million in the second quarter. Planned maintenance in the UK and Kazakhstan caused most of the international decline, Chevron said in the quarterly interim update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company expects increased production in the fourth quarter 2012 compared to the third quarter 2012, reflecting the completion of planned turnarounds and restoration of shut in production in the Gulf of Mexico," Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company warned in July that it would fall short of its original full-year 2012 forecast of 2.68 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices for what Chevron extracted offered no relief, since the third-quarter average Brent oil price of $110 per barrel is down $2 on a year ago, and up only $1 on last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the interim update, analysts had expected a net profit of $3.06 per share for the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, down from $3.56 in the second quarter and $3.67 in the same quarter a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But William Rutherford, president of Portland, Oregon-based Rutherford Investment Management and a long-term Chevron shareholder, saw the stock as a proxy for the energy sector and had no doubt the management would turn things around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've had a good record.

&lt;p&gt;* Hurricane Isaac curbs U.S. oil and gas output from wells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares down 1.2 pct after hours&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp warned that
third-quarter profits would be "substantially lower" than the
previous quarter as a hurricane and maintenance curbed its oil
and gas output and a fire hit its refining arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's shares fell 1.2 percent in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company said on Tuesday that the
key crude unit at its oldest refinery in Richmond, California,
would remain offline through the fourth quarter after it was
badly damaged in an Aug. 6 fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact was apparent as its average U.S. refinery input
fell 92,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 836,000 bpd in July and
August, when compared with the second quarter average. This
largely reflected the Richmond unit shutdown, it said, and was
only partially offset by higher international refinery output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the upstream side, Chevron's average U.S. production of
oil and gas from wells fell to 640,000 bpd in July and August,
compared with an average of 659,000 bpd for all of the second
quarter. This stemmed largely from shutting down in the Gulf of
Mexico for Hurricane Isaac in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, Chevron produced the oil equivalent of 2.52
million bpd in the first two months of the quarter, down from an
average 2.62 million in the second quarter. Planned maintenance
in the UK and Kazakhstan caused most of the international
decline, Chevron said in the quarterly interim update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company expects increased production in the fourth
quarter 2012 compared to the third quarter 2012, reflecting the
completion of planned turnarounds and restoration of shut in
production in the Gulf of Mexico," Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company warned in July that it would fall short of its
original full-year 2012 forecast of 2.68 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices for what Chevron extracted offered no relief, since
the third-quarter average Brent oil price of $110 per
barrel is down $2 on a year ago, and up only $1 on last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the interim update, analysts had expected a net
profit of $3.06 per share for the third quarter, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, down from $3.56 in the second quarter

&lt;p&gt;* Announcement matches worst-case forecasts for outage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Motor fuel output cut by at least half since fire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Richmond outage cut Chevron's 3rd quarter 2012 output&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on
Tuesday the central crude oil refining unit at its 245,000
barrel-per-day (bpd) Richmond, California, refinery would remain
shut for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement of a shutdown lasting about five months
confirms worst-case scenario forecasts for the outage, which
sources familiar with operations at the refinery and industry
analysts had said would extend between three and six months from
the Aug. 6 fire which shut the CDU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Bay-area refinery's production of motor
fuel has been cut by at least half since the blaze, making
California gasoline wholesale and retail markets volatile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wholesale prices shot up 97 cents last week, when a Los
Angeles-area refinery was hit by a power outage. Retail prices
have hit a record $5 a gallon in some locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When Chevron went down in August, other refiners took up
the slack and were able to keep going," said David Hackett,
president of Stillwater Associates, an Irvine, California,
energy consultancy. "When the problems developed last week,
there wasn't anyone left to take up the slack."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said the shutdown has already affected production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During the first two months of the third quarter, U.S.
refinery crude-input volumes decreased by 92,000 barrels per day
compared to the second quarter, largely reflecting the shutdown
of the Richmond refinery crude unit," Chevron said in an interim
update to investors on the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Richmond crude unit is expected to remain offline
through the fourth quarter of 2012."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire, which erupted from a pipe on the crude unit, is
being investigated by federal and state agencies. As many as
15,000 people in the San Francisco Bay area claim to have been
affected by the smoke released by the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crude distillation unit does the initial refining of crude
oil coming into a refinery and produces feedstocks for all other

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Oct 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer got a lower bonus than last year's,
partly for flat sales of Windows and his failure to ensure that
the company provided a choice of browser to some European

&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who took over as CEO from co-founder Bill Gates in

essentially flat at $685,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the third year in a row that Ballmer has not earned
his maximum bonus, set at twice his salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's recent financial year was scarred by a massive
$6.2 billion write-down for a failed acquisition and lower
profit from its flagship Windows system as computer sales stood
still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the company's filing, Microsoft's compensation committee
said it took into account a 3 percent decline in Windows sales
over the year, as well as "the Windows division failure to
provide a browser choice screen on certain Windows PCs in Europe
as required by its 2009 commitment with the European
Commission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's failure to provide a browser choice in Europe
was an embarrassing setback for the software maker, which has
been embroiled in disputes with European regulators for more

faces further fines from a new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on
Tuesday that the central crude oil refining unit at its 245,000
barrel-per-day (bpd) Richmond, California, refinery would remain
shut through the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Bay-area refinery's crude distillation
unit was shut by an Aug. 6 fire and the plant's production of
motor fuel has been cut by at least half since the blaze, making
California gasoline markets more volatile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Aug. 6 fire, which erupted from a length of pipe on the
crude unit, is being investigated by federal and state agencies.
As many as 15,000 people in the San Francisco Bay area claim to
have been affected by the smoke plume released by the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, the second-largest

would be substantially lower than the previous quarter as a weak
performance from its oil and gas production arm got no help from
the refining side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said the key crude unit at its refinery in
Richmond, California, which was badly damaged in an Aug. 6 fire,
would remain offline through the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Issues Interim Update for Third Quarter 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported in its interim update 
      that earnings for the third quarter 2012 are expected to be 
      substantially lower than second quarter 2012. Upstream results are 
      projected to be lower between sequential quarters, reflecting foreign 
      exchange losses and lower liftings and realizations, partially offset by 
      an asset sale gain. Downstream earnings in the third quarter are 
      expected to be significantly lower than second quarter 2012, reflecting 
      the impact of negative timing effects, lower realized margins and the 
      negative effects of several smaller unrelated items.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Basis for Comparison in Interim Update
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This interim update contains certain industry and company operating data 
      for the third quarter 2012. The production volumes, realizations, 
      margins and certain other items in the report are based on a portion of 
      the quarter and are not necessarily indicative of Chevron's full 
      quarterly results to be reported on November 2, 2012. The reader should 
      not place undue reliance on this data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Readers are advised that portions of the commentary below compare 
      results for the first two months of the 
      third quarter 2012 to full second quarter 
      2012 results, as indicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			UPSTREAM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The table that follows includes information on production and price 
      indicators for crude oil and natural gas for specific markets. Actual 
      realizations may vary from indicative pricing due to quality and 
      location differentials and the effect of pricing lags. International 
      earnings reflect actual liftings, which may differ from production due 
      to the timing of cargoes and other factors.

      U.S. net oil-equivalent production decreased 19,000 barrels per day 
      during the first two months of the third quarter, largely reflecting 
      impacts from Hurricane Isaac. International net oil-equivalent 
      production during the first two months of the third quarter decreased 
      87,000 barrels per day. Planned maintenance in Kazakhstan and the United 
      Kingdom caused the majority of the decline. The company expects 
      increased production in the fourth quarter 2012 compared to the third 
      quarter 2012, reflecting the completion of planned turnarounds and 
      restoration of shut in production in the Gulf of Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      International upstream earnings in the third quarter are expected to 
      include a gain of approximately $600 million from the previously 
      announced sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone LNG project.

      U.S. crude oil realizations decreased $8.47, to $95.44 per barrel during 
      the first two months of the third quarter, consistent with the typical 
      monthly lag on pricing in the Gulf of Mexico. International liquids 
      realizations decreased $2.35, to $96.86 per barrel. U.S. natural gas 
      realizations increased $0.50 to $2.67 per thousand cubic feet, while 
      international natural gas realizations decreased $0.11 to $5.99 per 
      thousand cubic feet during the first two months of the third quarter.

						3 As of June 2012, Star Petroleum Refining Company 
            crude-input volumes are reported on a consolidated basis. Prior to 
            June 2012, crude-input volumes are reported on a net interest 
            basis.

      For the full third quarter, U.S. and international refining margins 
      increased compared to second quarter 2012, while U.S. marketing margins 
      decreased sharply over the same period, particularly for the U.S. West 
      Coast.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first two months of the third quarter, U.S. refinery 
      crude-input volumes decreased by 92,000 barrels per day compared to the 
      second quarter, largely reflecting the shutdown of the Richmond, 
      California refinery crude unit in early August following a fire. The 
      Richmond crude unit is expected to remain offline through the fourth 
      quarter of 2012. Additionally, U.S. refinery crude-input volumes reflect 
      disruptions from Hurricane Isaac at the Pascagoula, Mississippi 
      refinery. International refinery crude-input volumes increased 42,000 
      barrels per day compared to the second quarter, reflecting a change in 
      reporting for Star Petroleum Refining Company to gross input volumes, 
      effective June 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downstream earnings in the third quarter are also expected to reflect 
      unfavorable inventory impacts and negative mark-to-market effects on 
      open derivative contracts tied to underlying physical positions, as 
      opposed to notably positive contributions from these items in the second 
      quarter. International downstream earnings are also expected to decrease

      The company&#8217;s general guidance for the quarterly net after-tax charges

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp on Tuesday lost a U.S. Supreme Court bid to block an $18.2 billion judgment against it in Ecuador in a case over pollution in the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court did not give any explanation for its decision, which rejected Chevron's appeal of a lower court ruling. The lower court in January had thrown out an injunction blocking enforcement of the Ecuadorean judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision is the latest in a nearly two-decade conflict between the No. 2 U.S. oil company and residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region over claims that Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, contaminated the area from 1964 to 1992. The battle has spawned litigation in numerous courts both inside and outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies are watching the case closely because it may affect other cases accusing companies of polluting the areas where they operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron claims that the judgment, imposed by an Ecuadorean court in February 2011, was fraudulent and unenforceable under New York law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2011, a federal judge in New York issued a worldwide injunction blocking enforcement of the judgment. But on January 26, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned the ban, finding that Chevron had been premature to challenge the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd Circuit said the oil company, based in San Ramon, California, could challenge it "only defensively, in response to attempted enforcement," which the Lago Agrio residents had not attempted and might never attempt in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court also said that the U.S. judge did not have the authority to stop courts in other countries from enforcing the judgment. The Ecuadorean plaintiffs are currently trying to enforce the judgment in Canada and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Chevron said it was entitled to raise an anticipatory defense in U.S. courts to preempt any enforcement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said such defenses are necessary in light of the "disturbing trend" in which lawyers win big money judgments against U.S. companies in corrupt foreign courts, and then seek to enforce them in countries where the companies operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's shares were up 32 cents at $117.94 on Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While Chevron is disappointed that the Court denied our petition, we will continue to defend against the plaintiffs' lawyers' attempts to enforce the fraudulent Ecuadorean judgment, and to further expose their misconduct," Chevron said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is pursuing a racketeering suit against a New York attorney, Steven Donziger, a group of Ecuadoreans and environmental groups that helped win the judgment, accusing them of intimidation and extortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also challenged the judgment before an international arbitration panel under a trade agreement between the United States and Ecuador. The panel is scheduled to begin hearing the dispute in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judgment included $8.6 billion of environmental damages, which an Ecuador court more than doubled because Chevron failed to make a public apology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, damages in the case were increased to $19 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, did not participate in the Supreme Court's decision to deny the appeal. The court's order provided no reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GULFPORT, Miss., Oct. 9, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) announced that the company's Ingalls Shipbuilding division has delivered the composite deckhouse for the destroyer Zumwalt (DDG 1000) to the U.S. Navy. The 900-ton deckhouse provides an advanced structure to house the ship's bridge, radars, antennas and intake/exhaust systems and is designed to provide a significantly smaller radar cross-section than any other ship in today's fleet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A photo and video accompanying this release are available at http://www.globenewswire.com/newsarchive/hii/pages/news_releases.html?d=10007801&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"This is a significant delivery in the history of Ingalls Shipbuilding," said DDG 1000 Program Manager Steve Sloan. "Building composite ship structures takes a very unique skill-set and work ethic, and the men and women in Gulfport have done an outstanding job. This is one of the largest carbon composite structures ever built, and we are delivering a fine product with the utmost quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ingalls is building the composite deckhouse and hangar for the DDG 1000 class at the company's Composite Center of Excellence in Gulfport. Made almost exclusively using cored composite construction processes, the deckhouse and hangar take full advantage of the properties of carbon fiber materials and balsa wood cores. When cured, the composite structure is as strong as steel but requires little maintenance and is very lightweight. These unique attributes reduce maintenance cost over the life span of the ship due to its corrosion resistance in the marine environment and allow for improved hull stability, more payload and increased ship speeds. The Gulfport facility also builds composite masts for the Navy's San Antonio (LPD 17) class of amphibious ships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The deckhouse structure will be integrated to join the other eight of nine "ultra units" making up DDG 1000. This is a process that is similar to the integration process already used with the LPD masts. Steel base plates that are bolted to the composite structure will be welded to the steel hull of DDG 1000. Ingalls delivered the composite hangar and the aft peripheral vertical launch system units for DDG 1000 and has begun work on the composite components for DDG 1001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We are incredibly proud of this deckhouse and all the hard work that has gone into making it a reality for the Navy," said Jay Jenkins, site director for Gulfport. "We started this project in January of 2009 and fought our way through all the challenges with professionalism, dedication and commitment, but we do hard things right, and this is proof of that fact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The DDG 1000 Zumwalt-class destroyer is the U.S. Navy's next-generation guided-missile destroyer, leading the way for a new generation of advanced, multi-mission surface combat ships. The ships will feature a low radar profile, an integrated power system and a total ship computing environment infrastructure. Armed with an array of weapons, the Zumwalt-class destroyers will provide offensive, distributed and precision fires in support of forces ashore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ingalls' Composite Center of Excellence is a world-class composite manufacturing facility capable of building large-scale composite structures for the marine industry. Specializing in vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding for low-cost, large-scale component infusions, the Center of Excellence has more than 18,000 square feet of flat panel molds. It is also home to the world's largest numerically controlled five-axis saw capable of sawing, drilling and milling very large composite components to highly accurate tolerances. Located on 125 acres with access to water, rail and highway transportation links, it has more than 322,000 square feet of manufacturing space (5.6 football fields) with 253,000 square feet (4.5 football fields) that is environmentally controlled. It has the only U.S. Department of Labor Composite Apprentice Program and is a certified OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR Site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) designs, builds and maintains nuclear and non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard and provides after-market services for military ships around the globe. For more than a century, HII has built more ships in more ship classes than any other U.S. naval shipbuilder. Employing more than 37,000 in Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana and California, its primary business divisions are Newport News Shipbuilding and Ingalls Shipbuilding. For more information, visit:

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI (Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co's (PG.N) CEO stood behind the company's plan for increasing profit and sales at a drama-free annual meeting notable for the absence of William Ackman, the activist investor who has pushed hard for change in recent months at the world's largest maker of household products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Bob McDonald defended the strategy of developing major new products while the company at the same time seeks to cut $10 billion in costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's meeting, held in P's hometown of Cincinnati, came as something of a respite for McDonald months after Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management took a stake in P, putting pressure on the CEO and the board to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald, who has been at the helm since July 2009, is refocusing on core categories, countries and innovations with both the $10 billion restructuring and a strategy laid out in June that homes in on the company's 40 biggest businesses, 20 biggest new products and 10 key developing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ackman, who disclosed his stake in the maker of Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste too late to have any proposals on the agenda, was not in attendance, and only one shareholder referred to him, asking why it took the investment of an activist to boost P's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we remain focused on the plan I talked about, the 40/20/10 plan, with improved innovation from discontinuous innovation, with productivity improvement, then we are all convinced that shareholders will get an increase in value and the stock will reflect that," McDonald replied, without mentioning Ackman directly. "We are focused like a laser, we are holding our own feet to the fire to do this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Ackman was absent, several of his analysts - who are far less recognizable than the 6-foot, 3-inch hedge fund manager with the shock of gray hair - were in the crowd listening closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Ackman became involved in the stock, P's board has expressed confidence in the plans laid out by chairman, president and CEO McDonald. The board has publicly backed McDonald, giving the former Army captain time to overhaul the 175-year old company, which is struggling keep up with competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of P have risen since Ackman's stake was disclosed but have trailed the gains in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which they are a component, so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 11 board members, including McDonald, were elected for another year at the meeting. A shareholder proposal on adopting a simple majority vote to pass all such proposals passed, while two other shareholder proposals were defeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P shares were down 0.6 percent at $68.69 on Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 9.3 percent since Ackman's stake was disclosed in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRE-ACKMAN PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald was under pressure even before news of Ackman's stake surfaced, after lackluster earnings and the February announcement of the $10 billion restructuring plan that analysts deemed insufficiently transformative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our view, management cannot afford to fall short of its promises again, as the clock is ticking on its turnaround," Morningstar analyst Erin Lash said earlier this month. "It is possible that P could be forced to consider breaking up this household and personal-care behemoth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pershing Square is P's 10th-largest shareholder, with 21.92 million shares, or 0.79 percent of the company's outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a week ago in New York, Ackman exerted public pressure on P by answering a few questions about his plans for the company. Ackman met with P's board in September at the Manhattan office of Kenneth Chenault, the CEO of American Express Co (AXP.N) and a P board member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that meeting, Ackman did not mince words about what he considered McDonald's lackluster performance and the aspects that need repair if company performance is to improve. For now, Ackman has left his suggestions with the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ackman has been instrumental in shaking up management at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) and retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P stumbled in recent months as competitors failed to match some of the price increases it imposed on goods including laundry and dish detergents to mitigate higher commodity costs. The strengthening dollar has also trimmed the value of sales in overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The announced restructuring is a direct result of persistent questions about P's ability to grow profitably," said Lash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, several of the attendees at Tuesday's event said they stand behind the company and its leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are going in the right direction," said Bill Harding, an 86-year-old shareholder who lives in Kettering, Ohio, after growing up in Cincinnati. Harding and his wife, Pat, said that they reinvest their dividends in P and still think it is one of the best companies in the country, if not the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Boston; editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

holding our own feet to the fire to do this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Ackman was absent, several of his analysts - who are
far less recognizable than the 6-foot, 3-inch hedge fund manager
with the shock of gray hair - were in the crowd listening
closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Ackman became involved in the stock, P's board has
expressed confidence in the plans laid out by chairman,
president and CEO McDonald. The board has publicly backed
McDonald, giving the former Army captain time to overhaul the
175-year old company, which is struggling keep up with
competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of P have risen since Ackman's stake was disclosed
but have trailed the gains in the Dow Jones industrial average
, of which they are a component, so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 11 board members, including McDonald, were elected for
another year at the meeting. A shareholder proposal on adopting
a simple majority vote to pass all such proposals passed, while
two other shareholder proposals were defeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P shares were down 0.6 percent at $68.69 on Tuesday
afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 9.3
percent since Ackman's stake was disclosed in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRE-ACKMAN PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald was under pressure even before news of Ackman's
stake surfaced, after lackluster earnings and the February
announcement of the $10 billion restructuring plan that analysts
deemed insufficiently transformative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our view, management cannot afford to fall short of its
promises again, as the clock is ticking on its turnaround,"
Morningstar analyst Erin Lash said earlier this month. "It is
possible that P could be forced to consider breaking up this
household and personal-care behemoth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pershing Square is P's 10th-largest shareholder, with
21.92 million shares, or 0.79 percent of the company's
outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a week ago in New York, Ackman exerted public pressure
on P by answering a few questions about his plans for the
company. Ackman met with P's board in September at the
Manhattan office of Kenneth Chenault, the CEO of American
Express Co and a P board member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that meeting, Ackman did not mince words about what he
considered McDonald's lackluster performance and the aspects
that need repair if company performance is to improve. For now,
Ackman has left his suggestions with the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ackman has been instrumental in shaking up management at
Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd and retailer J.C. Penney Co
Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P stumbled in recent months as competitors failed to match
 some of the price increases it imposed on goods including
laundry and dish detergents to mitigate higher commodity costs.
The strengthening dollar has also trimmed the value of sales in
overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The announced restructuring is a direct result of
persistent questions about P's ability to grow profitably,"
said Lash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, several of the attendees at Tuesday's event said they
stand behind the company and its leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are going in the right direction," said Bill Harding,
an 86-year-old shareholder who lives in Kettering, Ohio, after
growing up in Cincinnati. Harding and his wife, Pat, said that
they reinvest their dividends in P and still think it is one
of the best companies in the country, if not the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      Application Performance Corporation (BAPCo&#174;), a non-profit consortium of 
      leading computing industry companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 1.5 versions extend support to Microsoft Windows* 8 further 
      enhancing the original 2012 releases which have been widely accepted by 
      IT Managers, PC OEMs, press and analysts worldwide.

      BAPCo benchmarks provide commercial and government IT decision makers, 
      retailers, media, channel buyers, consultants, component designers, 
      hardware designers, and manufacturers with objective, easy-to-use tools 
      to evaluate system performance and performance-qualified battery life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MobileMark  SYSmark are application-based benchmarks that reflect usage 
      patterns of business users in a wide range of activities that a user may 
      encounter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Unlike synthetic benchmarks, which artificially drive components to peak 
      capacity or attempt to deduce performance using a static simulation of 
      application behavior, BAPCo benchmarks use real applications, user 
      workloads and data sets in an effort to more closely reflect the 
      performance and/or battery life a user might expect when performing 
      similar workloads. For these reasons and more, BAPCo benchmarks are the 
      de facto standard for PC OEMs, hardware and software developers, IT 
      departments, system integrators, publishers and testing labs as well as 
      information technologists and computer industry analysts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new 1.5 editions build upon BAPCo&#8217;s 20-year history of building 
      benchmarks to evaluate platform technologies. Benchmarks designed by 
      BAPCo are the result of cooperative development between companies 
      representing the breadth of the computing industry. They harness a 
      consortium of knowledge to better reflect the computing trends of today 
      and tomorrow.

&lt;p&gt;* Court denies Chevron bid to block $18.2 billion judgment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Appeals court found Chevron's challenge premature&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court denied
a bid by Chevron Corp to block an $18.2 billion judgment
against the company in a pollution case in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lower court threw out an injunction blocking enforcement
of the judgment. Chevron appealed to the Supreme Court, which
rejected the appeal without explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 26, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
York said Chevron had been premature to challenge the judgment,
which residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region won in February
2011 over pollution of the Amazon jungle and resulting damage to
their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, damages in the case were increased to $19 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron claimed that the judgment was fraudulent and
unenforceable under New York law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the 2nd Circuit said the oil company, based in San
Ramon, California, could challenge it "only defensively, in
response to attempted enforcement," which the Lago Agrio
residents had not attempted and might never attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its appeal, Chevron said the 2nd Circuit ignored
"well-settled" precedents allowing it to raise an anticipatory
defense under the federal Declaratory Judgments Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said such defenses are necessary in light of the
"disturbing trend" in which lawyers win big money judgments
against U.S. companies in corrupt foreign courts, and then seek
to enforce them in countries where the companies operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judgment stemmed from environmental contamination from
1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judgment included $8.6 billion of environmental damages,
which an Ecuador court more than doubled because Chevron failed
to make a public apology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v. Naranjo et al, U.S. Supreme
Court, No. 11-1428.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, Oct. 9, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Santo Mining Corporation (OTCBB:SANP), (the "Company"), Santo Mining Corporation President Al French reports that last week during a trip to the Eastern sector of their Walter Claim, the exploration team found further evidence of a former Spanish Colonial smelter. After making some shallow holes in a pasture they recovered slag that still contained some copper and or copper carbonates.&#160;Samples will be sent for analysis together with other mineralized samples.&#160;Santo Mining's Geological Consultants recently reported "Even though most of the surface area of the claim is covered by Quaternary fluvial sediments, there are plenty of outcrops in the five creeks that meander through the area.&#160;The rock under these sediments consist of Maimon Schist, a bimodal metavolcanic formation.&#160;Foliation is well developed and a few areas of hydrothermal alterations were observed in The Lajas and Guar&#233; creeks".&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The exploration company is waiting for the analytical reports from their previous geochemical survey of the surface which will be followed by a systematic soil sampling on a 100-200 meter grid of the entire claim. The combined results of the geochemical, rock, stream and soil sampling surveys will be overlaid with any available geophysical survey charts to identify potential precious or base metal anomalies. The exploration team plan to investigate any precious or base metal soil anomalies by air-track drilling through the shallow quaternary sediment layer for favorable geology and altered units with sulphide mineralization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Walter claim shares the same "Hispaniola Gold Copper Arc" formation with World Class Barrick Gold "Pueblo Viejo" gold mine located 1 mile to the East with 25 Million ounces of Gold and 147 Million ounces of Silver followed by Perilya Gold "Cerro de Maimon" gold mine also 1 mile to the southwest with 1.76 g/mt gold and 31 g/mt Silver; and Falconado Xstrata massive nickel complex close by to the West. The area surrounding this gold and base metal claim has a history of artisanal and colonial mines. Again, Santo Mining's short term objective is to identify drill targets from surface geochemical, shallow drilling and any available geophysical surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      shareholders at its annual meeting today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the meeting, Mr. McDonald highlighted PG&#8217;s consistent growth and 
      superior long-term shareholder returns over the years. He cited the 
      strength of PG&#8217;s proven business model of discovering meaningful 
      consumer insights, translating those insights into products with 
      superior benefits and value and supporting those products with strong 
      marketing programs and broad distribution. He underlined the sharp focus 
      against the Company&#8217;s 40 largest businesses, 20 top innovations and 10 
      most important developing markets as well as its $10-billion 
      productivity program as key drivers to future growth.

      of Procter &#160;Gamble people all over the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      On innovation, Mr. McDonald commented, &#8220;We are renewing our commitment 
      to discontinuous innovation &#8212; that is, to innovation that obsoletes 
      current products and creates new categories and new brands.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      He continued: &#8220;In the meantime, many superior product innovations are in 
      the market now, including Tide PODS, Downy UnStopables, ZzzQuil, Pampers 
      Baby Dry, Charmin DuraClean, Bounty Trap  Lock, Crest Pro-Health for

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. McDonald concluded, &#8220;Our objectives are unchanging: To win with

			Sand 9 Selects IBM as IC Foundry for Precision MEMS Timing Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sand 
      9, Inc., a pioneer in precision MEMS timing products for wireless 
      and wired applications, today announced that it has selected IBM 
      to produce and help customize the integrated circuit (IC) portion of 
      Sand 9&#8217;s micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) timing products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Targeting a multi-billion dollar market opportunity for timing devices 
      historically satisfied by quartz crystals, Sand 9&#8217;s MEMS timing products 
      provide an alternative with significant performance and quality 
      improvements over legacy quartz crystal solutions. Sand 9&#8217;s timing 
      products can be integrated into chipsets for applications in which space 
      is at a premium, such as mobile and consumer electronics&#8212;another 
      competitive advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the addition of IBM Specialty Foundry to the Sand 9 supply chain, 
      we gain many tangible benefits,&#8221; said Vince Graziani, CEO, Sand 9. 
      &#8220;IBM&#8217;s extensive design experience, high-performance process technology, 
      and high-volume capacity are critical to delivering thoroughly vetted 
      products for precision-timing applications. Our relationship with IBM is 
      one more reason why we are able to meet the performance and volume 
      requirements of even the most demanding customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The low-noise performance of IBM's technology helped Sand 9 meet the 
      demanding specifications of the timing market,&#8221; said Regina Darmoni, 
      director, IBM Specialty Foundry. "IBM's comprehensive manufacturing 
      services provide clients with leadership RF and analog technology that 
      can enable them to differentiate their products&#160;and speed time to 
      market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Technical Differentiators
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sand 9&#8217;s timing products are the first MEMS devices that use 
      piezoelectric actuation to achieve the stringent phase noise and 
      short-term stability requirements for wireless and wired applications. 
      Their spurious-free resonator design, in conjunction with a low 
      phase-noise oscillator, enables a low-jitter product, which can reduce 
      packet loss and enhance network efficiency in communications 
      applications. The capability for integration&#8212;combined with high immunity 
      to noise, shock and lead-free reflow temperatures&#8212;address quartz crystal 
      weaknesses that system designers have been forced to work around for 
      decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon on Wednesday lashed out at the government for a lawsuit alleging misdeeds at Bear Stearns, more than four years after JPMorgan was asked to rescue the teetering financial giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the company is still paying the price for doing the Federal Reserve "a favor" by buying Bear Stearns in early 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to say we've lost $5 billion to $10 billion on various things related to Bear Stearns now. And yes, I put it in the unfair category," Dimon said, speaking at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's candid comments come one week after the New York State Attorney General filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan, alleging that Bear Stearns deceived investors buying mortgage-backed securities in 2006 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a wide-ranging hour-long discussion that went from the "fiscal cliff" to the impact of regulations, Dimon bristled when a member of the audience asked him if he now regretted participating with the government to rescue Bear Stearns in light of the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't participate with the Federal Reserve, OK?" he said. "Let's get this one exactly right. We were asked to do it. We did it at great risk to ourselves ... Would I have done Bear Stearns again knowing what I know today? It's real close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government engineered the rescue during the Bush administration when regulators were desperate to find a buyer who could take on Bear Stearns' toxic assets and help calm markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon went on to recount how he warned a senior regulator at the time of the deal to "please take into consideration when you want to come after us down the road for something that Bear Stearns did, that JPMorgan was asked to do this by the federal government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that JPMorgan, which will report its third-quarter earnings on Friday, will come out fine in the end. But if he is ever put in a similar position again, he said he "wouldn't do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a big boy. I'll survive," he said. "But I think the government should think twice before they punish business every single time things go wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FISCAL CLIFF WAR ROOM"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Bear Stearns, Dimon also criticized the government for so far failing to seriously negotiate an agreement to avoid a fiscal cliff of $600 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts due to hit at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said JPMorgan is "forming a fiscal cliff war room" and will be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JP Morgan will survive a fiscal cliff - it is just terrible policy to allow it to get close," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He backed several proposals supported by Democrats to raise revenues, including a higher individual tax rate for the wealthy and a hike in the capital gains tax to 20 percent while keeping corporate taxes low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't mind paying 39.6 percent in taxes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon is one of a handful of CEOs who have been lobbying lawmakers to give businesses greater certainty around budget and taxes issues before the year's end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans want to extend low rates that expire on December 31 for all income groups, while President Barack Obama and Democrats want to extend the lower rates only for households earning up to $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the expiring tax rates first enacted by President George W. Bush. The current top rates are 33 percent and 35 percent. They would rise to 36 and 39.6 percent under the Democrats' proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a decision on the individual tax rates must be made before the end of the year, the corporate tax issue is almost certainly going to wait until next year at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama and his Republican presidential rival Mitt Romney agree that the current 35 percent corporate tax rate should be reduced to be more competitive globally, but they disagree on the extent and how to fund such a rate cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite backing some of Obama's tax plans, Dimon told the audience he is "barely" still a Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'INTENSELY STUPID'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Wednesday's event, Dimon was also faced with questions about the "London whale" credit derivative trades that have so far racked up at least $5.8 billion in losses for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dimon has previously acknowledged his bank's failure to intervene sooner, he went even further on Wednesday in assigning himself personal responsibility for not detecting the problematic hedging strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I should have caught it ... I didn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the trading loss was "really intensely stupid" and "it's kind of embarrassing personally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon also touched on financial reforms more generally, saying he was frustrated with contradictory and overlapping regulations being pushed out by policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said JPMorgan could see more than $1 billion in annual overhead costs from new international and domestic financial regulations, including the Basel III capital standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sarah N.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) said he should have caught the "London whale" derivatives trades that resulted in a multibillion-dollar loss for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We made a stupid error," Jamie Dimon told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington on Wednesday. "I should have caught it ... I didn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, JPMorgan has estimated its total trading loss at $5.8 billion. The losses stemmed from a London-based trader known as the "London whale" who took large positions in credit derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Sarah N.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 10 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 's Chief
Financial Officer might step down and take another post within
the company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper's sources said that although it isn't clear where
Douglas Braunstein might end up, there was a possibility he
could move to J.P. Morgan's recently combined corporate and
investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was not available for comment outside of U.S.
working hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, JPMorgan said Barry Zubrow, who was head of risk
management at JPMorgan when the bank was building an overly 
large position in credit derivatives, is retiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) said he should have caught the "London whale" derivatives trades that resulted in a multibillion-dollar loss for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We made a stupid error," Jamie Dimon told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington on Wednesday. "I should have caught it ... I didn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, JPMorgan has estimated its total trading loss at $5.8 billion. The losses stemmed from a London-based trader known as the "London whale" who took large positions in credit derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Sarah N.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Jamie Dimon, waded into the U.S. fiscal debate on Wednesday when he said he was willing to pay a higher individual tax rate while calling for lower corporate taxes so U.S. business can compete in a global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A U.S. state court has ordered JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to pay more than $18 million to a trust in a suit stemming from the bank's recommendation of a security that was unsuitable for the trust and benefited the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank engaged in misconduct and breached its duties of care to the trust in recommending so-called "variable prepaid forward contracts," wrote Judge Linda Morrissey of the District Court for Tulsa County, Oklahoma, in an opinion late Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contracts were not only unsuitable for the trust, but bestowed a financial benefit to JP Morgan at the trust's expense, the court ruled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan and the trust entered into numerous variable prepaid forward contracts between 2000 and 2005. The investments began after Ann Fletcher, the trust's current beneficiary, became a co-trustee with JP Morgan at the bank's suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher has a history of cognitive and physical impairments, the court wrote. The trust was created in 1955 by William Skelly, founder of Skelly Oil Company, and his wife. It was meant to benefit Fletcher, who is Skelly's granddaughter, and her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A court in 2007 ordered the transfer of the trust's assets to another bank. The investment contracts between the trust and JP Morgan had been settled by then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 32-page court decision illustrates the extent to which certain investment fees and conflicts of interest can damage a portfolio. JPMorgan breached its fiduciary duty to the trust - which required the bank to act in the trust's best interests - by profiting from certain investments it recommended, the court ruled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Morrissey, in an unusual move, also ordered JPMorgan to pay punitive damages, to be determined at a later date, along with the trust's legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan disagrees with the court's decision, a spokesman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm "will take all appropriate measures to respond, including appealing the decision," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors who buy variable prepaid forward contracts typically agree to give a certain number of stock shares to the brokerage at a future date, but receive a significant percentage of the value of those shares at the time of the agreement. While the arrangements can have tax benefits and help insulate investors from certain losses, they can also involve hefty fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of the trust, however, required that its trustee not sell stocks placed in the trust when it was originally set up, with exceptions for "unusual circumstances," according to the opinion. The original stocks included shares in what would eventually become ExxonMobil Corp, according to the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan did not tell Fletcher, now 75 years old, that the contracts could lead to the sale of that stock, according to the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also breached its fiduciary duty to the trust by investing proceeds from the contracts in its own investment products, the court wrote. It then charged investment fees for those transactions in addition to corporate trustee fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That "amounted to double dipping that was inherently unreasonable," Judge Morrissey wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punitive damages against JPMorgan are appropriate in the case because the bank "has been guilty of reckless disregard for the rights of others," the judge added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Alden Bentley and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Court finds JP Morgan engaged in self-dealing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Earned fees with complex contracts recommendation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Suzanne Barlyn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. state court has ordered JPMorgan

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S 500 fell for a fourth day on Wednesday, weighed down by disappointing news from Chevron and Alcoa as earnings season got under way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron (CVX.N) shares dropped 4.2 percent to $112.45 after it said third-quarter profits would be "substantially lower" than the previous quarter, while Alcoa (AA.N) fell 4.6 percent to $8.71 after it posted a quarterly loss. The company cut its outlook for global aluminum demand, citing a slowdown in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both stocks are Dow components, and the blue-chip average posted its biggest daily percentage drop since early July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market is worried about what is going to happen with earnings," said Randy Warren, chief investment officer of investment advisory firm Warren Financial Service in Exton, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All expectations are for a softening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market continues to focus on weak global demand as S 500 companies' third-quarter earnings are expected to fall 2.9 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would be the first decline in three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks briefly trimmed losses after the Federal Reserve's Beige Book showed the overall economy had expanded modestly, with most districts seeing strengthened home sales in the last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 128.56 points, or 0.95 percent, to end at 13,344.97. The S 500 .SPX dropped 8.92 points, or 0.62 percent, to 1,432.56. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 13.24 points, or 0.43 percent, to end at 3,051.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The declines in the Dow and the S 500 were partially offset by gains in Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which hit an all-time high, and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), which posted its largest daily advance this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart shares climbed 1.7 percent to $75.42 after hitting an all-time high of $76.81 as it cited strong sales at its U.S. grocery stores and a big start to holiday layaway sales in its annual meeting with analysts and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FedEx rose 5.2 percent to $89.99, its largest daily percentage jump this year, as the package delivery company laid out plans to sharply cut costs at two divisions, seeking to improve profits there by $1.7 billion over the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yum Brands (YUM.N) shares climbed 8 percent to $70.99 as the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and other fast-food restaurant chains raised its full-year profit forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse chain Costco Wholesale (COST.O) also hit a record high at $104.43 after it reported a jump in quarterly profit. Shares closed at $101.56, up 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engine maker Cummins Inc (CMI.N) lowered its 2012 forecast for a second time this year and its shares dropped 3.4 percent to $87.79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so far this year of about 6.53 billion shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the NYSE, roughly eight issues fell for every five that rose. On the Nasdaq, six shares declined for every five that advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Goldman Sachs' IDRs at 'A/F1'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s (Goldman) 
      IDRs at 'A/F1'. Fitch also affirms Goldman's Support Rating at '1', 
      Support Floor at 'A' and Viability Rating (VR) at 'a'. A complete list 
      of ratings follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today's rating action was taken in conjunction with Fitch's Global 
      Trading and Universal Bank (GTUB) periodic review. Fitch's outlook for 
      the industry is stable on balance. The positive rating drivers include 
      improved liquidity, funding, capitalization and more streamlined 
      businesses, all partly driven by regulation. Offsetting these positive 
      drivers are substantial earnings pressure, regulatory uncertainty and 
      heightened legal and operational risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING ACTION RATIONALE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's ratings continue to be supported by its leading investment 
      banking franchise, strong risk management, solid liquidity position, and 
      better-than-average capital position. Ratings have limited upward 
      potential, given Goldman's business focus on the capital markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman has higher reliance on capital market operations than many 
      global trading and universal banks (GTUBs). Fitch recognizes that 
      capital market revenues are inherently volatile and susceptible to 
      declines in difficult market periods. Concerns over this inherent 
      volatility are tempered by management's successful track record in 
      managing through difficult periods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman has demonstrated favorable risk management during the financial 
      crisis and its aftermath. Fitch believes that Goldman has a 
      comparatively strong risk management organization and systems to manage 
      and monitor risk. Positively, Goldman has far less exposure to the U.S. 
      real estate market than most U.S. banks, given its focus on capital 
      markets activities and asset management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquidity remains at conservative levels. Cash and unencumbered highly 
      liquid securities totaled $175 billion (18% of total assets) at mid-year 
      2012. Conservative liquidity management reduces Fitch's concerns 
      regarding reliance on wholesale funding. To reduce wholesale funding 
      risk, reliance on unsecured short-term funding remains at modest levels 
      and the weighted average maturity of secured funding has been increased 
      (particularly repos associated with less liquid collateral).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's capital position continues to improve and remains 
      comparatively strong. At mid-year 2012, Fitch Core Capital to 
      risk-weighted assets of 14.7% was significantly above average. In 
      addition, Goldman maintains comfortable capital in a stress scenario.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulatory and legal issues appear manageable but costly. Goldman and 
      peers face new capital markets regulations such as the Volcker Rule and 
      implementation of Basel III capital and liquidity standards. Goldman is 
      projected to meet new requirements well within allowable time frames.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - VR, IDRs  SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's VR continues to be underpinned by a strong risk management 
      track record and leading investment banking franchise. The VR factors in 
      Fitch core capital in line with current levels and the management of 
      capital comfortably above Basel III capital minimums. Downward pressure 
      on the VR would result from a material loss, reduction in capital ratios 
      or significant deterioration in liquidity levels. Likewise, any 
      unforeseen outsized fines, settlements or other charges could also have 
      adverse rating implications. IDRs and Senior Debt ratings are equalized 
      with Goldman's VR, but are further underpinned by the prospect of U.S. 
      government support in the event of need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING 
      FLOOR
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's current 'A' Long-term IDR is equalized with its VR, but 
      benefits from support as well. Fitch's '1' Support Rating for Goldman 
      and 'A' Support Rating Floor factor in government support in the event 
      of need. Fitch's rating action continues to embody a view of support in 
      the IDRs of Goldman and other U.S. Global Systemically Important 
      Financial Institutions (G-SIFIs) over the near-to-intermediate term. 
      This viewpoint was broadly discussed in Fitch's special report titled 
      'U.S. Banks - Sovereign Support: When Does it End' dated Dec. 15, 2011. 
      Fitch could reassess its support ratings for U.S. G-SIFIs if global 
      market conditions normalize and resolution regimes become more 
      harmonized across international jurisdictions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Goldman and by 
      various issuing vehicles are all notched down from Goldman's VR in 
      accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective 
      nonperformance and relative loss severity risk profiles. Their ratings 
      are primarily sensitive to any change in Goldman's VR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HOLDING COMPANY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's IDR is equalized with those of its operating companies and 
      banks, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is 
      mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank 
      subsidiaries, as well as the use of the holding company to fund 
      subsidiary operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IDRs of major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized with Goldman's 
      IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to Goldman's 
      business strategy and financial profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman is a top global bank with four business segments: investment 
      banking, institutional client services, investment management, and 
      investing and lending.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following ratings with a Stable Outlook
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;

day on Wednesday, weighed down by disappointing news from
Chevron and Alcoa as earnings season got under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares dropped 4.2 percent to $112.45 after
it said third-quarter profits would be "substantially lower"
than the previous quarter, while Alcoa fell 4.6 percent
to $8.71 after it posted a quarterly loss. The company cut its
outlook for global aluminum demand, citing a slowdown in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both stocks are Dow components, and the blue-chip average
posted its biggest daily percentage drop since early July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market is worried about what is going to happen with
earnings," said Randy Warren, chief investment officer of
investment advisory firm Warren Financial Service in Exton,
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All expectations are for a softening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market continues to focus on weak global demand as S
500 companies' third-quarter earnings are expected to fall 2.9
percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. It
would be the first decline in three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks briefly trimmed losses after the Federal Reserve's
Beige Book showed the overall economy had expanded modestly,
with most districts seeing strengthened home sales in the last
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average fell 128.56 points,
or 0.95 percent, to end at 13,344.97. The S 500 dropped
8.92 points, or 0.62 percent, to 1,432.56. The Nasdaq Composite
 lost 13.24 points, or 0.43 percent, to end at 3,051.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The declines in the Dow and the S 500 were partially
offset by gains in Wal-Mart Stores Inc, which hit an
all-time high, and FedEx Corp, which posted its largest
daily advance this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart shares climbed 1.7 percent to $75.42 after hitting
an all-time high of $76.81 as it cited strong sales at its U.S.
grocery stores and a big start to holiday layaway sales in its
annual meeting with analysts and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FedEx rose 5.2 percent to $89.99, its largest daily
percentage jump this year, as the package delivery company laid
out plans to sharply cut costs at two divisions, seeking to
improve profits there by $1.7 billion over the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yum Brands shares climbed 8 percent to $70.99 as the
parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and other fast-food restaurant
chains raised its full-year profit forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse chain Costco Wholesale also hit a record
high at $104.43 after it reported a jump in quarterly profit.
Shares closed at $101.56, up 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engine maker Cummins Inc lowered its 2012 forecast
for a second time this year and its shares dropped 3.4 percent
to $87.79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock
Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so
far this year of about 6.53 billion shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the NYSE, roughly eight issues fell for every five that
rose. On the Nasdaq, six shares declined for every five that
advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 10 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s
 (Goldman) IDRs at 'A/F1'. Fitch also affirms Goldman's Support Rating at 
'1', Support Floor at 'A' and Viability Rating (VR) at 'a'. A complete list of 
ratings follows at the end of this release.

Today's rating action was taken in conjunction with Fitch's Global Trading and 
Universal Bank (GTUB) periodic review. Fitch's outlook for the industry is 
stable on balance. The positive rating drivers include improved liquidity, 
funding, capitalization and more streamlined businesses, all partly driven by 
regulation. Offsetting these positive drivers are substantial earnings pressure,
regulatory uncertainty and heightened legal and operational risk.

RATING ACTION RATIONALE

Goldman's ratings continue to be supported by its leading investment banking 
franchise, strong risk management, solid liquidity position, and 
better-than-average capital position. Ratings have limited upward potential, 
given Goldman's business focus on the capital markets. 

Goldman has higher reliance on capital market operations than many global 
trading and universal banks (GTUBs). Fitch recognizes that capital market 
revenues are inherently volatile and susceptible to declines in difficult market
periods. Concerns over this inherent volatility are tempered by management's 
successful track record in managing through difficult periods.

Goldman has demonstrated favorable risk management during the financial crisis 
and its aftermath. Fitch believes that Goldman has a comparatively strong risk 
management organization and systems to manage and monitor risk. Positively, 
Goldman has far less exposure to the U.S. real estate market than most U.S. 
banks, given its focus on capital markets activities and asset management.

Liquidity remains at conservative levels. Cash and unencumbered highly liquid 
securities totaled $175 billion (18% of total assets) at mid-year 2012. 
Conservative liquidity management reduces Fitch's concerns regarding reliance on
wholesale funding. To reduce wholesale funding risk, reliance on unsecured 
short-term funding remains at modest levels and the weighted average maturity of
secured funding has been increased (particularly repos associated with less 
liquid collateral).

Goldman's capital position continues to improve and remains comparatively 
strong. At mid-year 2012, Fitch Core Capital to risk-weighted assets of 14.7% 
was significantly above average. In addition, Goldman maintains comfortable 
capital in a stress scenario. 

Regulatory and legal issues appear manageable but costly. Goldman and peers face
new capital markets regulations such as the Volcker Rule and implementation of 
Basel III capital and liquidity standards. Goldman is projected to meet new 
requirements well within allowable time frames. 

RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - VR, IDRs &amp; SENIOR DEBT

Goldman's VR continues to be underpinned by a strong risk management track 
record and leading investment banking franchise. The VR factors in Fitch core 
capital in line with current levels and the management of capital comfortably 
above Basel III capital minimums. Downward pressure on the VR would result from 
a material loss, reduction in capital ratios or significant deterioration in 
liquidity levels. Likewise, any unforeseen outsized fines, settlements or other 
charges could also have adverse rating implications. IDRs and Senior Debt 
ratings are equalized with Goldman's VR, but are further underpinned by the 
prospect of U.S. government support in the event of need.

RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR

Goldman's current 'A' Long-term IDR is equalized with its VR, but benefits from 
support as well. Fitch's '1' Support Rating for Goldman and 'A' Support Rating 
Floor factor in government support in the event of need. Fitch's rating action 
continues to embody a view of support in the IDRs of Goldman and other U.S. 
Global Systemically Important Financial Institutions (G-SIFIs) over the 
near-to-intermediate term. This viewpoint was broadly discussed in Fitch's 
special report titled 'U.S. Banks - Sovereign Support:  When Does it End' dated 
Dec. 15, 2011. Fitch could reassess its support ratings for U.S. G-SIFIs if 
global market conditions normalize and resolution regimes become more harmonized
across international jurisdictions.

SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES

Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Goldman and by various 
issuing vehicles are all notched down from Goldman's VR in accordance with 
Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective nonperformance and relative 
loss severity risk profiles. Their ratings are primarily sensitive to any change
in Goldman's VR. 

HOLDING COMPANY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES

Goldman's IDR is equalized with those of its operating companies and banks, 
reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. 
to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries, as well as the use of 
the holding company to fund subsidiary operations.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES

IDRs of major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized with Goldman's IDR 
reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to Goldman's business 
strategy and financial profile. 

Goldman is a top global bank with four business segments: investment banking, 
institutional client services, investment management, and investing and lending.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s Ratings at 'A+/F1'; Revises Outlook 
      to Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s (JPM) Long-term Issuer 
      Default rating (IDR) at 'A+' and Short-term IDR at 'F1'. Fitch also 
      affirmed JPM's Viability Rating (VR) at 'a+', its Support Rating at '1' 
      and its Support Rating Floor at 'A'. The Rating Outlook has been revised 
      to Stable from Rating Watch Negative. A full list of ratings follows at 
      the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today's rating action on JPM was taken in conjunction with Fitch's 
      global trading and universal bank periodic review. Fitch's outlook for 
      the industry is stable on balance. The positive rating drivers include 
      improved liquidity, funding, capitalization and more streamlined 
      businesses, all partly driven by regulation. Offsetting these positive 
      drivers are substantial earnings pressure, regulatory uncertainty and 
      heightened legal and operational risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING ACTION RATIONALE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings affirmations reflect JPM's dominant domestic franchise and 
      growing international franchise. The firm continues to maintain a 
      leading position in its businesses, particularly in U.S. domestic 
      commercial banking and investment banking. It has not suffered 
      meaningful damage to its franchise from the losses in its Chief 
      Investment Office (CIO). The firm has not demonstrated any material 
      weakening in funding flexibility or access to the capital markets as a 
      result of the CIO incident. Fitch believes that most of the risk 
      management weaknesses were centralized in the CIO and have been 
      addressed or are being remediated. Importantly, some broader risk 
      governance issues such as greater centralization of processes are also 
      being addressed by the firm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Stable Outlook recognizes that the firm still has some work to do in 
      addressing its risk governance weaknesses arising from the losses in the 
      CIO. However, the firm appears to have identified and addressed most of 
      the problems in the CIO and has similarly looked across the entire firm 
      to enhance its risk management and governance framework. Fitch believes 
      the firm is committed to a best-in-class risk framework and will 
      continue to address any unresolved issues. The firm's significant 
      earnings power, diverse earnings sources, strong front-end risk culture, 
      leading franchise, and liquidity management are core strengths.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capital is also sufficient for its rating level, though JPM tends to be 
      a more aggressive capital manager than some of its global peers. Share 
      repurchases have been suspended for 2012 but Fitch expects these to 
      resume in 2013, which is negative for credit ratings in a business that 
      is not contracting. Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio is estimated to be 
      7.9% at 2Q'12 and the firm should comfortably reach Basel III capital 
      requirements within the prescribed time frame.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mortgage business, particularly JPM's real estate portfolios 
      continue to have relatively weak asset quality. However, the firm's 
      charge-off rates, non-performing assets and late stage delinquencies 
      continue to improve. JPM's diverse business franchise and underwriting 
      have helped to offset this weakness, but the improving trend has also 
      benefited from the impact of quantitative easing on the U.S. economy and 
      could, therefore, be vulnerable to any change in this. The credit card 
      business has performed very well and Fitch expects that there will 
      likely be some deterioration in card asset quality as the business 
      reverts to more historical performance. Commercial banking, Treasury  
      Security Services and the Asset Management businesses remain stable 
      performers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Like other global trading and universal banks, Fitch believes the 
      investment bank creates greater volatility in JPM's earnings and serves 
      as a rating constraint. While the agency recognizes the firm's leading 
      position in IB, the business is vulnerable to cyclicality and more 
      sensitive to market conditions than many of its other business lines. In 
      addition, IB has been an important component of the firm's earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given the company's size and scale in many businesses, along with many 
      other large financial firms, continues to be subject to various 
      investigations and litigation. The most costly so far are mortgage 
      related, including foreclosures and repurchases. LIBOR investigations 
      are pending as well as several litigations stemming from the crisis and 
      as a result of the CIO losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes the firm manages liquidity well, though wholesale funding 
      is a meaningful component which mainly supports its global broker/dealer 
      operations. However, the company has a solid core deposit base, mainly 
      in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - VR, IDRs  SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Going forward JPM is going to be challenged to continue to deliver 
      consistent strong revenues, particularly in light of the current 
      regulatory environment and the low interest rate environment. Higher 
      capital charges and difficult market conditions present a challenge for 
      all global trading and universal banks, which may be encouraged to seek 
      more aggressive ways to generate profits that take advantage of 
      regulatory loopholes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, Fitch expects that JPM's strong global franchise, liquidity 
      risk management, and current earnings power from its diverse businesses 
      mitigate some of these concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's ratings could be sensitive to weakening in the global
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (particularly the U.S.) macro-environment that goes beyond what Fitch's 
      stress tests incorporate. Slow on-going growth or recession would affect 
      asset quality and investment banking activity. Material asset quality 
      weakening across asset classes could put negative pressure on the 
      ratings unless the capital buffer is strengthened. Further, significant 
      risk management or operational failures that result in material losses 
      to the firm could also result in a negative rating action. Fitch 
      believes that the rating is currently constrained and therefore upward 
      rating momentum is unlikely for the foreseeable future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING 
      FLOOR
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's current 'A+' Long-term IDR is equalized with its 'a+' VR, which 
      remains above its support rating floor. JPM's '1' Support Rating 'A' 
      Support Rating Floor factor in government support in the event of need 
      for JPM and other U.S. G-SIFIs. While Fitch believes the broad policy 
      goal is to no longer provide full support to systemically important 
      banks, this is progressing at an uneven pace globally. Fitch could 
      reassess its support ratings for U.S. G-SIFIs if global market 
      conditions normalize and resolution regimes become more harmonized 
      across international jurisdictions. At JPM's current VR, the firm's 
      Long-term IDR would not be affected by a change in support rating floor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and by various 
      issuing vehicles are all notched down from JPM's or its bank 
      subsidiaries' VRs in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each 
      instrument's respective nonperformance and relative loss severity risk 
      profiles. Their ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs 
      of JPM or its bank subsidiaries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HOLDING COMPANY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and 
      banks, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is 
      mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank 
      subsidiaries. It has modest double leverage of 107% at 2Q12.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IDRs and VRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries benefit from the 
      cross-guarantee mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs 
      and VRs are equalized across the group. JPMorgan Securities LLC (JPMS) 
      is a wholly owned subsidiary that is the firm's U.S. broker dealer and 
      is considered core to JPM's business. As a result its IDR is equalized 
      with that of its parent JPM. Bear Stearns Companies, LLC and JPMorgan 
      Clearing Corp. benefit from a parent guarantee and therefore their IDRs 
      are equalized with JPM's. Collateralized Commercial Paper Co., LLC's ST 
      IDR benefits from JPMS's guarantee of the amounts payable by the repo 
      seller, JPMCC, and as result its ST IDR is equalized with that of JPMS. 
      Collateralized Commercial Paper II Co., LLC's ST IDR is based on the 
      repo seller, JPMS's ST IDR.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      JPM is a leading global trading and universal bank with $2.3 trillion in 
      total assets and $5.0 billion of net income as of June 30, 2012.

Long-term Issuer Default rating (IDR) at 'A+' and Short-term IDR at 'F1'. 
Fitch also affirmed JPM's Viability Rating (VR) at 'a+', its Support Rating at 
'1' and its Support Rating Floor at 'A'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to 
Stable from Rating Watch Negative. A full list of ratings follows at the end of 
this release.

Today's rating action on JPM was taken in conjunction with Fitch's global 
trading and universal bank periodic review. Fitch's outlook for the industry is 
stable on balance. The positive rating drivers include improved liquidity, 
funding, capitalization and more streamlined businesses, all partly driven by 
regulation. Offsetting these positive drivers are substantial earnings pressure,
regulatory uncertainty and heightened legal and operational risk.

RATING ACTION RATIONALE

The ratings affirmations reflect JPM's dominant domestic franchise and growing 
international franchise. The firm continues to maintain a leading position in 
its businesses, particularly in U.S. domestic commercial banking and investment 
banking. It has not suffered meaningful damage to its franchise from the losses 
in its Chief Investment Office (CIO). The firm has not demonstrated any material
weakening in funding flexibility or access to the capital markets as a result of
the CIO incident. Fitch believes that most of the risk management weaknesses 
were centralized in the CIO and have been addressed or are being remediated. 
Importantly, some broader risk governance issues such as greater centralization 
of processes are also being addressed by the firm. 

The Stable Outlook recognizes that the firm still has some work to do in 
addressing its risk governance weaknesses arising from the losses in the CIO. 
However, the firm appears to have identified and addressed most of the problems 
in the CIO and has similarly looked across the entire firm to enhance its risk 
management and governance framework. Fitch believes the firm is committed to a 
best-in-class risk framework and will continue to address any unresolved issues.
The firm's significant earnings power, diverse earnings sources, strong 
front-end risk culture, leading franchise, and liquidity management are core 
strengths. 

Capital is also sufficient for its rating level, though JPM tends to be a more 
aggressive capital manager than some of its global peers. Share repurchases have
been suspended for 2012 but Fitch expects these to resume in 2013, which is 
negative for credit ratings in a business that is not contracting. Basel III 
Tier 1 Common Ratio is estimated to be 7.9% at 2Q'12 and the firm should 
comfortably reach Basel III capital requirements within the prescribed time 
frame.

The mortgage business, particularly JPM's real estate portfolios continue to 
have relatively weak asset quality. However, the firm's charge-off rates, 
non-performing assets and late stage delinquencies continue to improve. JPM's 
diverse business franchise and underwriting have helped to offset this weakness,
but the improving trend has also benefited from the impact of quantitative 
easing on the U.S. economy and could, therefore, be vulnerable to any change in 
this. The credit card business has performed very well and Fitch expects that 
there will likely be some deterioration in card asset quality as the business 
reverts to more historical performance. Commercial banking, Treasury &amp; Security 
Services and the Asset Management businesses remain stable performers. 

Like other global trading and universal banks, Fitch believes the investment 
bank creates greater volatility in JPM's earnings and serves as a rating 
constraint. While the agency recognizes the firm's leading position in IB, the 
business is vulnerable to cyclicality and more sensitive to market conditions 
than many of its other business lines. In addition, IB has been an important 
component of the firm's earnings. 

Given the company's size and scale in many businesses, along with many other 
large financial firms, continues to be subject to various investigations and 
litigation. The most costly so far are mortgage related, including foreclosures 
and repurchases. LIBOR investigations are pending as well as several litigations
stemming from the crisis and as a result of the CIO losses.

Fitch believes the firm manages liquidity well, though wholesale funding is a 
meaningful component which mainly supports its global broker/dealer operations. 
However, the company has a solid core deposit base, mainly in the U.S. 

 

RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - VR, IDRs &amp; SENIOR DEBT

Going forward JPM is going to be challenged to continue to deliver consistent 
strong revenues, particularly in light of the current regulatory environment and
the low interest rate environment. Higher capital charges and difficult market 
conditions present a challenge for all global trading and universal banks, which
may be encouraged to seek more aggressive ways to generate profits that take 
advantage of regulatory loopholes. 

However, Fitch expects that JPM's strong global franchise, liquidity risk 
management, and current earnings power from its diverse businesses mitigate some
of these concerns.

JPM's ratings could be sensitive to weakening in the global 

(particularly the U.S.) macro-environment that goes beyond what Fitch's stress 
tests incorporate. Slow on-going growth or recession would affect asset quality 
and investment banking activity. Material asset quality weakening across asset 
classes could put negative pressure on the ratings unless the capital buffer is 
strengthened. Further, significant risk management or operational failures that 
result in material losses to the firm could also result in a negative rating 
action. Fitch believes that the rating is currently constrained and therefore 
upward rating momentum is unlikely for the foreseeable future. 

RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR

JPM's current 'A+' Long-term IDR is equalized with its 'a+' VR, which remains 
above its support rating floor. JPM's '1' Support Rating 'A' Support Rating 
Floor factor in government support in the event of need for JPM and other U.S. 
G-SIFIs. While Fitch believes the broad policy goal is to no longer provide full
support to systemically important banks, this is progressing at an uneven pace 
globally. Fitch could reassess its support ratings for U.S. G-SIFIs if global 
market conditions normalize and resolution regimes become more harmonized across
international jurisdictions. At JPM's current VR, the firm's Long-term IDR would
not be affected by a change in support rating floor.

SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES

Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and by various issuing 
vehicles are all notched down from JPM's or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in 
accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective 
nonperformance and relative loss severity risk profiles. Their ratings are 
primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs of JPM or its bank subsidiaries. 

HOLDING COMPANY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES

JPM's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks, 
reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. 
to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. It has modest double 
leverage of 107% at 2Q12.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES

The IDRs and VRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee 
mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs and VRs are equalized 
across the group. JPMorgan Securities LLC (JPMS) is a wholly owned subsidiary 
that is the firm's U.S. broker dealer and is considered core to JPM's business. 
As a result its IDR is equalized with that of its parent JPM. Bear Stearns 
Companies, LLC and JPMorgan Clearing Corp. benefit from a parent guarantee and 
therefore their IDRs are equalized with JPM's. Collateralized Commercial Paper 
Co., LLC's ST IDR benefits from JPMS's guarantee of the amounts payable by the 
repo seller, JPMCC, and as result its ST IDR is equalized with that of JPMS. 
Collateralized Commercial Paper II Co., LLC's ST IDR is based on the repo 
seller, JPMS's ST IDR. 

JPM is a leading global trading and universal bank with $2.3 trillion in total 
assets and $5.0 billion of net income as of June 30, 2012.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Bethany McLean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 10 (Reuters) - Last week, New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman, who is the co-chairman of the
Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group - which
President Obama formed earlier this year to investigate who was
responsible for the misconduct that led to the financial crisis
- filed a complaint against JPMorgan Chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint, which seeks an unspecified amount in damages
(but says that investors lost $22.5 billion), alleges widespread
wrongdoing at Bear Stearns in the run-up to the financial
crisis. JPMorgan Chase, of course, acquired Bear in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this is just the beginning of a Schneiderman
onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do expect this to be a matter of very significant
liability, and there are others to come that will also reflect
the same quantum of damages," Schneiderman said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television. "We're looking at tens of billions of
dollars, not just by one institution, but by quite a few."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevailing opinion seems to be, Yay! Someone is finally
making, or at least trying to make, the banks pay for their
sins. But while there is one big positive to the complaint,
overall I don't think there's any reason to cheer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman's case clearly lays out the alleged bad
behavior at the old Bear Stearns. Although Bear promised
investors it was doing due diligence on the mortgages it
purchased, it wasn't. Defendants "systematically failed to fully
evaluate the loans, largely ignored the defects that their
limited review did uncover, and kept investors in the dark about
both the inadequacy of their review procedures and the defects
in the underlying loans," alleges the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, Bear would make deals with the sellers of
mortgages in which it would force them to make a payment for
failed mortgages, but instead of taking the bad loan out of the
trust, Bear would just keep the money - even though both Bear's
lawyers and its accountants (this is truly stunning), according
to Schneiderman's case, warned them that wasn't OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint shows just how complicit the Bear bankers were
in the proliferation of bad loans that almost took down the
economy, and that alone makes it valuable. "He's finally telling
the story so that people can understand the depth and magnitude
of what went on," says Eliot Spitzer, who had Schneiderman's job
after the dot-com bust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, there's not much to applaud. The biggest
flaw is that Schneiderman decided not to name any individuals, a
practice that is sadly all too common in financial fraud cases.
The New York Times argued that it's a strength that the case
doesn't focus on individuals and specifics, and instead alleges
a broad pattern of fraud. But naming names is powerful.
Anonymity is weak, and that is amplified when the generalized
wrongdoing allegedly occurred at a now-defunct bank. In
addition, the lack of names is weird. How could the actions
alleged in the complaint have been accomplished if real people
didn't do them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman's office also brought charges under a specific
New York State law called the Martin Act. The Martin Act doesn't
require prosecutors to show that the defendants intended to
commit fraud. This seems ridiculous. If Bear employees committed
the acts detailed in the complaint, especially pocketing money
that should have gone into investors' pockets, against the
warnings of lawyers and accountants, how can they have intended
anything other than fraud?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which, of course, raises a few other questions. Chief among
them: Why haven't Justice Department investigators brought
criminal charges, and why hasn't the Securities and Exchange
Commission even brought civil charges? Technically speaking,
both are also members of the Residential Mortgage-Backed
Securities Working Group, but both also have been conducting
their own investigations since the crisis hit. The answer cannot
be that Schneiderman discovered something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has complained that his suit relies on "recycled
claims already made by private plaintiffs" and, well, it does.
The notion that investment banks were knowingly putting bad
loans into securitizations has been public knowledge since the
fall of 2010. That was when executives from a company called
Clayton Holdings, which was retained by many of the big banks to
do due diligence on the mortgages they were buying, told the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that Wall Street knew that
almost one-third of the mortgages they were securitizing didn't
meet their own standards. Spitzer wrote a column for Slate
calling the documents the "Rosetta stone" because he thought
they provided such a clear road map for investigators. That's
not all. Schneiderman's predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, actually
entered into a cooperation agreement with Clayton back in 2008!
Did it really take over four years to put together a complaint
that doesn't even name real people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the part about Bear pocketing money that should have
gone to investors, that's been well known since at least early
2011, when Teri Buhl did an in-depth piece for the Atlantic on a
lawsuit that bond insurer Ambac filed against JPMorgan in 2008,
which was unsealed in early 2011. Buhl wrote that Bear traders
were "pocketing cash that should have gone to securities
holders." And the Ambac lawsuit named names!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, everyone has had plenty of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there are a couple of possibilities. One is that Justice
and/or the SEC will follow up with their own charges now that
Schneiderman has laid the groundwork. Maybe. But that doesn't
make a lot of sense given the widespread availability of the
information in his lawsuit and the length of time that has
passed since the financial crisis. It's an old saw in legal
circles that the more time goes by, the harder it is to file
criminal charges. By now, it will feel strange if the Justice
Department yanks four people who worked at the old Bear and in
effect says: "You and only you are going to take the fall for
the entire financial crisis!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that those who say that federal
agencies simply don't have the appetite to pursue the banks are
right. Whether that's because they lack the resources and the
political will, or because bringing criminal charges against
individuals would inexorably lead up the chain to the
institution, which would destroy it, and no one wants to see
that happen, it doesn't much matter. If Schneiderman's lawsuit
is the best we can manage under those constraints, then that's a
tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third possibility is that there's more nuance to what
happened than Schneiderman's suit allows. (JPMorgan, for its
part, has said it will contest the charges.) Some would still
say that's all right, because if there are 50 shades of bad
behavior, this is clearly one of them; so even if it's not the
darkest, let's make the bankers pay up. The problem is that it's
not the bankers who will pay. It's not the individuals who did
these awful things, or former Bear Stearns executives who may
have sanctioned it knowingly or unknowingly, or even current
JPMorgan executives who will pay the big fine that will likely
be the end result of all this. It's JPMorgan's current
shareholders, which include mutual funds like indexers Vanguard
and Wellington. In other words, we, the American investor class,
are the ones who are going to pay. And if Schneiderman does
indeed apply this same method to other banks, well, then we'll
pay even more. I fail to understand why this is justice, or why
this will do anything to dissuade bad behavior in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm also bothered by what happened after Schneiderman filed
his suit. First, JPMorgan Chase raised a stink, because in the
minds of many JPMorgan executives, they performed a public
service by purchasing Bear and have already paid enough for its
misdeeds. Maybe it's not fair to blame Schneiderman's office for
responding with a press release trumpeting the myriad ways in
which JPMorgan Chase benefited from government assistance. But
whether you love or hate the big banks, the alleged wrongdoing
that happened at Bear has nothing to do with whether or not
JPMorgan Chase benefited from government help. The punishment
the bank should face for any misdeeds should be purely a matter
of law, not public opinion about the bank bailout. Otherwise, we
risk bastardizing the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I worry that this is all a classic "watch the
birdie" exercise: Hey, folks, look over here at this facsimile
of justice! Making the big banks pay somehow sure feels good,
and if you don't look too closely, it may even distract you from
the big questions. Namely, what should a financial institution
that serves the needs of businesses and consumers-instead of one
that uses us as fodder for its own profits and executive bonuses
- look like? And how do we get from here to there? Instead,
we're going to pay up, and in exchange, get business as usual.
That's not a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A U.S. state court has ordered JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to pay more than $18 million to a trust in a suit stemming from the bank's recommendation of a type of complex security that was unsuitable for the trust and benefited the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank engaged in misconduct and breached its duties of care to the trust in recommending so-called "variable prepaid forward contracts," wrote Judge Linda Morrissey of the District Court for Tulsa County, Oklahoma, in an opinion late Tuesday. The contracts were not only unsuitable for the trust, but bestowed a financial benefit to JP Morgan at the trust's expense, the court ruled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan and the trust entered into numerous variable prepaid forward contracts between 2000 and 2005. A court, in 2007, ordered the transfer of the trust's assets to another bank. The investment contracts between the trust and JP Morgan, by that time, had been settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 32-page court decision illustrates the extent to which certain investment fees and conflicts of interest can damage a portfolio. JPMorgan breached its fiduciary duty to the trust - which required the bank to act in the trust's best interests - by profiting from certain investments it recommended, the court ruled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Morrissey, in an unusual move, also ordered JPMorgan to pay punitive damages, to be determined at a later date, along with the trust's legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan disagrees with the court's decision, a spokesman said in a statement. The firm "will take all appropriate measures to respond, including appealing the decision," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors who buy variable prepaid forward contracts typically agree to give a certain number of stock shares to the brokerage at a future date but receive a significant percentage of the value of those shares at the time of the agreement. While the arrangements can have tax benefits and help insulate investors from certain losses, they can also involve hefty fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the court wrote, breached its fiduciary duty to the trust by investing proceeds from the contracts in its own investment products. It then charged investment fees for those transactions in addition to corporate trustee fees, Judge Morrissey wrote. That "amounted to double dipping that was inherently unreasonable," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punitive damages against JPMorgan are appropriate in the case because the bank "has been guilty of reckless disregard for the rights of others," the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Alden Bentley)&lt;/p&gt;

a day after the earnings season opened with Alcoa posting a
quarterly net loss and Chevron saying profits would fall sharply
in its most recent period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After hitting lows in the early afternon, stocks briefly
trimmed losses after the Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book
report that the economy was expanding modestly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Alcoa slid 4.2 percent to $8.74 and weighed
on the Dow industrials following the U.S. aluminum producer's
report late Tuesday of a quarterly net loss, which it linked to
a slump in the price of aluminum and weak demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp shares fell 4.4 percent to $112.19 and
were the biggest drag on the S 500 after the second-largest
U.S. oil company said third-quarter profits would be
"substantially lower" than in the previous quarter. Chevron said
a hurricane and planned maintenance had curtailed its oil and
gas output, while a fire hurt its refining business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the poor earnings for the third quarter are baked
into the market. If that were the only issue I think there would
be limited downside," said William Delwiche, investment
strategist at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co in Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But what matters now is the outlook for the fourth quarter
and 2013. So far it seems to be one of more caution, and if that
trend continues that could be a headwind for stocks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was down 113.56
points, or 0.84 percent, at 13,359.97. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index was down 7.52 points, or 0.52 percent, at 1,433.96.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 10.24 points, or
0.33 percent, at 3,054.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S energy sector index fell 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 index was heading for its fourth day of declines
on worries about deteriorating profits due to weak global
demand. S 500 companies' third-quarter earnings are expected
to fall 2.9 percent from a year ago, which would be the first
decline in three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's Beige Book said consumer spending, prices and
employment conditions have changed little since the last report 
in late August but that the overall economy had expanded
modestly, with most districts seeing strengthened home sales in
the last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Beige Book can help us trade higher once we get through
this nervous period," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive
officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. "There's
a lot of negative sentiment in the market after what was three,
even four straight weeks of gains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger economic backdrop is also casting a shadow. The
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank recently cut
their global outlooks as the Eurpoean debt crisis drags on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yum Brands Inc climbed 8 percent to $71.01
and ranked as the S 500's best performer. Yum, the parent
company of KFC, Taco Bell and other fast-food restaurant chains,
raised its full-year profit forecast after sales in China held
up despite slowing growth in that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, a Dow component, hit
an all-time high of $76.81 after Chief Executive Officer Mike
Duke said the retailer was gaining widespread market share. 
Wal-Mart's stock later was up 2.6 percent at $76.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse chain Costco Wholesale Corp reported a 27
percent jump in quarterly profit on higher sales and membership
fees. Costco shares rose 3.4 percent to $103.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discount chain Dollar Tree also posted a 2.5
percent gain to $46.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engine maker Cummins Inc lowered its 2012 forecast
for a second time this year and said it would cut up to 1,500
jobs. Cummins shares dropped 3.1 percent to $88.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FedEx Corp said it plans to cut costs at its
underperforming express air freight and services divisions, with
a goal of improving profits at those operations by $1.7 billion
over the next four years. FedEx shares gained 4.7 percent to
$89.57.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Says did Fed a favor buying Bear Stearns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* New regulations will cost more than $1 billion annually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 10 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said his company has lost up to $10
billion as a result of the government asking him to buy
teetering Wall Street firm Bear Stearns during the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to say we've lost $5 billion to $10 billion on
various things related to Bear Stearns now. And yes, I put it in
the unfair category," Dimon said, speaking at a Council on
Foreign Relations event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the losses come from litigation and writedowns,
among other expenses. JPMorgan reports third-quarter earnings on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, JPMorgan was hit with a fresh civil lawsuit from
the New York's attorney general, seeking to hold the bank
accountable for allegations that Bear Stearns deceived investors
buying mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a question on Wednesday about the lawsuit,
Dimon said he needed to set the record straight and emphatically
said JPMorgan did the Federal Reserve "a favor" by buying Bear
Stearns in early 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told a senior regulator at the time of the deal, "Please
take into consideration when you want to come after us down the
road for something that Bear Stearns did, that JPMorgan was
asked to do this by the federal government," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said it is a "real close" call about whether he would
do the deal again. And, the government's appetite to go after
JPMorgan for Bear Stearns' activity could have a chilling
effect, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a big boy. I'll survive...But I think the government
should think twice before they punish business every single time
things go wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the wide-ranging discussion, Dimon also touched on
financial reforms and the firm's recent multibillion-dollar
trading loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan could see more than $1 billion in annual overhead
costs from new international and domestic financial regulations,
including the Basel III capital standards, he said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon criticized regulators for pushing out contradictory
and overlapping regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also assigned himself personal responsibility for not
realizing that a risky hedging strategy in the firm's London
office could warp into a trading loss that has reached at least
$5.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I should have caught it...I didn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the trading loss was "really intensely stupid" and
"it's kind of embarassing personally."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks extended their
decline on Wednesday, with the Dow industrials briefly down 1
percent, weighed by a sharp retreat in shares of Chevron and
Alcoa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 10 (Reuters) - The chief executive of
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Jamie Dimon, waded into the U.S.
fiscal debate on Wednesday when he said he was willing to pay a
higher individual tax rate while calling for lower corporate
taxes so U.S. business can compete in a global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't mind paying 39.6 percent in taxes,"  Dimon said 
in an interview in Washington at the Council on Foreign
Relations, backing the Democrats' position. He added he might
back an increase in the capital gains tax rate to 20 percent,
another proposal by President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans want to extend low rates that expire on Dec. 31
for all income groups, while Obama and Democrats want to extend
the lower rates only for households earning up to $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon is one of several CEOs lobbying lawmakers to create
more certainty around tax and budget issues, as the United
States faces a "fiscal cliff" of $600 billion in tax hikes and
spending cuts should Congress fail to act by the end of the
year.&lt;/p&gt;

a day after earnings season opened with Dow component Alcoa
posting a quarterly net loss while Chevron's profit warning
dragged on the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Alcoa slid 4.7 percent to $8.70 and weighed
on the Dow following the U.S. aluminum producer's report late
Tuesday of a quarterly net loss. Alcoa attributed the loss to a
slump in the price of aluminum and weak demand. On Wednesday, a
Nomura analyst cut the target price on Alcoa's stock to $9 from
$12, citing "continued weakness in aluminum prices" as a key
reason for the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp shares fell 4.2 percent to $112.39 and
ranked as the biggest drag on the S 500 after the
second-largest U.S. oil company warned that third-quarter
profits would be "substantially lower" than in the previous
quarter. Chevron said a hurricane and planned maintenance had
curtailed its oil and gas output, while a fire hurt its refining
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An S energy sector index fell 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 index is on track for its fourth day of
declines on worries that the global economic slowdown will hurt
profits more than expected. S 500 companies' third-quarter
earnings are expected to fall 2.9 percent from a year ago, which
would be the first decline in three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The temptation to sell is out there," said John Brady,
managing director of R.J. O'Brien &amp; Associates in Chicago.
"Equities have had a tremendous year, and the outlook is very
unclear. So why not reduce risk? It's hard to imagine an
additional 20 percent rally from here in the next three or four
months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger economic backdrop is also casting a shadow. The
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank recently cut
their global outlooks.  And the
European debt crisis drags on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the latest decline, the S 500 broke below the
technical support level of 1,440.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think we will tuck under 1,400 but I'm not calling for a
wholesale sell-off," said Rick Bensignor, senior trading
strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. "We're still
not far off the highs, and have not yet seen significant
distribution panic selling of stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 103.65
points, or 0.77 percent, to 13,369.88. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500

Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 13.43 points, or 0.44
percent, to 3,051.59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the market was down, there were some bright spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock of Yum Brands Inc climbed 8 percent to
$71.01 and ranked as the S 500's best performer. Yum, the
parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and other fast-food restaurant
chains, raised its full-year profit forecast after sales in
China held up despite slowing growth in that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, a Dow component, hit
an all-time high of $76.81 on Wednesday morning after CEO Mike
Duke said the world's largest retailer was gaining widespread
market share. The CEO also said Wal-Mart sees its international
business as a growth engine despite its decision to slow down
store openings in some key countries. At midday, Wal-Mart's
stock was up 3.4 percent at $76.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse chain Costco Wholesale Corp reported a 27
percent jump in quarterly profit on higher sales and membership
fees. Costco shares shot up 3.4 percent to $103.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True Religion Apparel Inc surged 22 percent to
$25.64 after the denim maker said it was evaluating strategic
alternatives, which could include a possible sale of the
company, after receiving indications of interest from third
parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the U.S. economic front, data showed wholesale
inventories rose 0.5 percent, as expected, in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors also await the Federal Reserve's Beige Book at 2
p.m (1800 GMT) for the U.S. central bank's assessment of the

      At just 11 years-old, Dustin Meraz knew he wanted his life to make a 
      difference for seriously ill children. A terminal cancer patient, 
      Dustin&#8217;s last wish was to inspire grown-ups to have the courage to care

			Procter  Gamble, its Orgullosa Program and the League Against Cancer 
      Partner in the Fight Against Breast Cancer and Empower the Community to 
      Share the Gift of Early Detection
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			For every new &#8220;Like&#8221; on its Facebook page, Orgullosa will donate $1 
      to the League Against Cancer, up to $10,000
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Procter 
       Gamble (PG) and its Orgullosa 
      program have joined forces with Liga Contra el C&#225;ncer to empower the 
      community to share the gift of breast cancer early detection through 
      simple, everyday actions. The program is designed
			to
			rally 
      women to take action by preparing their own early detection plan, 
      sharing inspirational stories about how early detection saves lives and 
      by supporting the cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the most 
      commonly diagnosed type of cancer among Hispanic women, and it is 
      detected at an advanced stage more often than in non-Hispanic women. 
      This difference has been largely attributed to lower frequency of and 
      longer intervals between mammograms, and lack of timely follow-up of 
      suspicious mammograms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The efforts by Orgullosa and the League Against Cancer will support 
      PG&#8217;s GIVE 
      Hope and its breast cancer early detection awareness message. GIVE 
      Hope is part of PG&#8217;s GIVE program, a social sustainability platform 
      designed to inspire and enable people to use their everyday purchases to 
      touch lives and improve life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;My sister-in-law is a breast cancer survivor, so I know firsthand the 
      importance of early detection. For this reason, I am proud to be part of 
      Orgullosa and to help carry this meaningful and important cause that is 
      dear to my heart,&#8221; said Valentina Sanchez, Orgullosa Brand Manager.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a part of this effort, Orgullosa will be donating $10,000 to the 
      League Against Cancer and is providing the opportunity for more women to 
      support the cause. During the month of October, for every new &#8220;Like&#8221; on 
      its Facebook page, Orgullosa will donate $1 to the League Against 
      Cancer, up to an additional $10,000. Also, on another special Facebook 
      application, consumers will be able to share inspirational stories about 
      breast cancer awareness and the importance of early detection to help 
      spread the word.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another way consumers can support the cause is through the redemption of 
      the coupons from the October 14 PG 
      brandSAVER&#174; found in Sunday newspapers across the nation. For every 
      brandSAVER coupon redeemed, a one-cent donation will be provided to the 
      National Breast Cancer Foundation, Inc. and consequently its partners, 
      like the League Against Cancer, to fulfill their mission to save lives 
      through early detection and provide mammograms for those in need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The support that Orgullosa and the community provide the League Against 
      Cancer is imperative so we can continue to provide the education about 
      early breast cancer detection and diagnostic breast care services for 
      those in need,&#8221; said Adriana Cora, Executive Vice President/volunteer of 
      League Against Cancer.

      De acuerdo a la Sociedad Americana contra el C&#225;ncer (American Cancer

      y es detectado en etapas m&#225;s avanzadas que en las mujeres anglosajonas. 
      Esto se debe en gran parte a que las latinas se hacen menos mamograf&#237;as 
      o esperan m&#225;s entre un examen y otro, y tambi&#233;n por la falta de 
      seguimiento a las mamograf&#237;as que se presentan irregulares.

full-year outlook after sales in China held up despite slowing
Chinese growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall tone at the start of the earnings season was
downbeat, however. The S 500 index was on pace for its fourth
day of declines over concern the global economic slowdown was
hurting profits and causing companies to lower their outlooks.
The index was testing the technical support level of 1,440.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronger demand from airplane and automobile producers
helped Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, to
report third-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations.
Still, Alcoa fell 3.1 percent to $8.85 as the biggest percentage
decliner on the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp dipped 3 percent to $113.80 as the
biggest drag on the S 500 after the second-largest U.S. oil
company warned third-quarter profits would be "substantially
lower" than in the previous quarter. Chevron said a hurricane
and maintenance curbed its oil and gas output and a fire hit its
refining operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lackluster growth in China, the world's second-largest
economy, is expected to rein in corporate earnings in the third
quarter and dent profit forecasts as the Asian nation feels the
pinch of the debt crisis in the euro zone, a key trading
partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've seen very cautionary earnings results and even
forward guidance. Alcoa has good earnings, but their forward
guidance is lackluster. It points to a slow China and slow
global growth," said Richard Weeks, managing director at
HighTower Advisors in Vienna, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 42.05
points, or 0.31 percent, to 13,431.48. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index shed 1.83 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,439.65. The
Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.18 points, or 0.04
percent, to 3,066.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have
recently cut world growth forecasts, citing concerns about
China's slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engine maker Cummins Inc lowered its 2012 forecast
for a second time this year, citing delays in customer spending
due to a weakening global economy, and said it would cut up to
1500 jobs. Cummins shares dropped 2.6 percent to $88.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cautious outlooks are the latest in a string of
forecasts from large multinational companies, including FedEx
Corp, Caterpillar Inc and Hewlett-Packatrd Co
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts forecast third-quarter earnings of Wall Street's
S 500 companies would fall 2.3 percent from the
year-ago quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, which would
be the first drop in U.S. quarterly earnings in three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data through Tuesday, 94 companies in the
benchmark S index have issued negative outlooks, compared with
23 positive pre-announcements, for a ratio of 4.1, the weakest
showing since the third quarter of 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FedEx said it plans to slash costs at its
underperforming express air freight and services divisions, with
profit improvements of $1.7 billion planned at those operations
over the next four years. Shares gained 5.5 percent to $90.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. data showed wholesale inventories rose 0.5 percent, as
expected, in August. Investors will also look to the Federal
Reserve's Beige Book at 2 p.m (1800 GMT) for the U.S. central
bank's assessment of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings from warehouse chain Costco Wholesale Corp 
were a bright spot as the company reported a 27 percent jump in 
quarterly profit on higher sales and membership fees. Costco
shares were up 4 percent to $103.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True Religion Apparel Inc surged 22.2 percent to
$25.67 after the denim maker said it was evaluating strategic
alternatives, which could include a possible sale of the
company, after receiving indications of interest from third
parties.&lt;/p&gt;

			PG Introduces Digital Platform That Brings To Life The Passion 
      NFL Fans Have For Their Team
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To mark the fourth year of Procter  Gamble&#8217;s (NYSE: PG) official 
      sponsorship of the National Football League (NFL), the company is 
      launching an online platform called Fan-cestry where fans can build and 
      share their personal fan history and see how they are connected to their 
      favorite NFL team. The &#8220;Official Locker Room Products of the NFL&#8221; 
      include five PG brands: Duracell, Gillette, Head  Shoulders, Old 
      Spice, and Tide which will sponsor the Fan-cestry program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG will launch this campaign by driving consumers to www.fan-cestry.com, 
      encouraging fans to enter information about their relationship with 
      their favorite NFL team, memorable events from their teams, their NFL 
      game rituals, and habits throughout the season. The result will be a 
      sharable infographic about how each member&#8217;s lives are parallel to their 
      NFL team&#8217;s history, which the company calls Fan-cestry. Members will 
      have the ability to share their Fan-cestry across social platforms, 
      driving fellow fans to display their own team loyalty on the Fan-cestry 
      site. Throughout the season consumers will be able to add new and unique 
      content to their Fan-cestry in real time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Anyone who creates their Fan-cestry will have a chance to be entered to 
      win tickets to Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;America&#8217;s favorite PG brands are engaging fans of America&#8217;s favorite 
      sport in a way that is relevant and meaningful to them,&#8221; said Anne 
      Westbrook, Communications Leader, U.S. Sports Marketing at PG. 
      &#8220;Fan-cestry is a platform to unite all types of NFL fans, from those who 
      have never attended a game to those who live and breathe their team 
      colors. These fans share a common bond of loyalty and fandom for the 
      sport, and that is what Fan-cestry is all about.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) must pay more than $18 million to a trust in a suit stemming from its improper recommendation of a type of complex security that was unsuitable for the trust and benefited the bank, a U.S. state court judge has ruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank engaged in misconduct and breached its duties of care to the trust in recommending so-called "variable prepaid forward contracts," wrote Judge Linda Morrissey of the District Court for Tulsa County, Oklahoma, in an opinion late Tuesday. That caused financial harm to the trust beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan and the trust entered into numerous variable prepaid forward contracts between 2000 and 2005. A court, in 2007, ordered the transfer of the trust's assets to another bank. The investment contracts between the trust and JP Morgan, by that time, had been settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court, in an unusual move, also ordered JPMorgan to pay punitive damages, to be determined at a later date, along with the trust's legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors who buy variable prepaid forward contracts typically agree to give a certain number of stock shares to the brokerage at a future date but receive a significant percentage of the value of those shares at the time of the agreement. While the arrangements can have tax benefits and help insulate investors from certain losses, they can also involve hefty fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 32-page court decision illustrates the extent to which certain investment fees and conflicts of interest can damage a portfolio. JPMorgan, for example, breached its fiduciary duty to the trust - which required the bank to act in the trust's best interests - by investing proceeds from the contracts in its own investment products. It then charged investment fees for those transactions in addition to corporate trustee fees, Judge Morrissey wrote. That "amounted to double dipping that was inherently unreasonable," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punitive damages against JPMorgan are appropriate in the case because the bank "has been guilty of reckless disregard for the rights of others," the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to immediately comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Alden Bentley)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Fixmo, 
      the mobile risk management (MRM) company, today announced it has 
      acquired the mobile product offering for secure access to Microsoft 
      SharePoint from Virginia-based IT consulting firm Twin-Soft 
      Corporation. As a result of the product acquisition, Fixmo will 
      offer its customers secure and compliant access to Microsoft SharePoint 
      from within the Fixmo 
      SafeZone secure workspace. The fully integrated native application 
      will offer defense-grade security and policy controls, highly optimized 
      performance, and a best-in-class user experience for accessing Microsoft 
      SharePoint documents, dashboards, forms, lists and workflow on the 
      latest iOS and Android devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Twin-Soft has been delivering systems integration (SI) services for 
      enterprise portals, content management systems and business intelligence 
      solutions to Defense and Civilian Government clients for over a decade. 
      With deep expertise and hands-on experience spanning the full lifecycle 
      of Microsoft SharePoint deployments, they have developed a portfolio of 
      services and products that help public and private sector organizations 
      maximize returns on their Microsoft SharePoint investments without 
      compromising security or compliance. The mobile product offering 
      acquired by Fixmo enables native access to Microsoft SharePoint on 
      smartphones and tablets while maintaining custom policy controls and 
      access rights for users on mobile devices. It also provides the ability 
      to enforce location-based policy controls and multi-factor 
      authentication requirements &#8211; all without the need to open up full 
      access to SharePoint Web Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of the acquisition, Fixmo is now offering the industry's 
      first fully-integrated secure container solution for smartphones and 
      tablets with federated access to corporate email, calendaring, browsing, 
      content management, document management, document sharing, enterprise 
      workflow and custom applications through a single defense-grade secure 
      container environment. Fixmo SafeZone keeps all business-related 
      applications and data &#8211; including content from Microsoft SharePoint &#8211; 
      password protected and completely separated from the personal side of 
      the device. All corporate data is encrypted while at-rest and in-transit 
      with FIPS 140-2 AES 256-bit encryption and can be easily locked or wiped 
      without impacting the personal data on the device. With the addition of 
      a native solution for Microsoft SharePoint, Fixmo SafeZone customers can 
      now enjoy safe and compliant access to corporate documents, workflow and 
      applications on the devices of their choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Many organizations are now relying on Microsoft SharePoint for 
      enterprise document management and workflow. But until now, it has been 
      extremely difficult to enable access to these systems on mobile devices 
      in a way that meets the security and compliance requirements of 
      government agencies and organizations in regulated industries,&#8221; said 
      Rick Segal, CEO at Fixmo. &#8220;With integrated support for Microsoft 
      SharePoint, Fixmo SafeZone now delivers a whole new level of 
      productivity for employees, ensuring they can access the information 
      they need to get their jobs done anywhere, anytime without compromising 
      corporate security or compliance.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Fixmo has emerged as a leader and innovator in the mobile security and 
      compliance space, and we are thrilled that they have chosen Twin-Soft&#8217;s 
      technology for delivering mobile access to Microsoft SharePoint to their 
      growing client base,&#8221; said Jim Harrison, Principal and Co-Founder at 
      Twin-Soft. &#8220;We will continue to expand our own IT consulting practices 
      and look forward to offering best-in-class integration services around 
      Fixmo&#8217;s powerful new offering for secure mobile access to Microsoft 
      SharePoint.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fixmo will be showcasing Fixmo SafeZone and its new secure mobile 
      solution for Microsoft SharePoint at the upcoming Gartner Symposium 
      ITxpo in Orlando, FL from October 21 &#8211; 25 at booth #839.

			New Platform Features Efficiencies and Tools for Clients
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) Treasury Services today launched the next 
      generation of J.P. Morgan ACCESS&#174;, an online, electronic banking portal 
      for corporate clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P.&#160;Morgan ACCESS provides treasury and investment professionals 
      worldwide with a secure, single point of access to effectively manage 
      their treasury operations online. The next generation includes 
      integrated payment and reporting capabilities and unique attributes for 
      user administration, allowing clients a more efficient use of time while 
      simultaneously improving their control environment. It also features an 
      entirely new online user community, providing a single location for user 
      learning and interaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In speaking with our clients over the past several years, they 
      consistently indicated that they were looking for greater efficiency and 
      a way to save time,&#8221; said Lloyd O&#8217;Connor, Managing Director, J.P. Morgan 
      Treasury Services. &#8220;The next generation of J.P. Morgan ACCESS was born 
      from those conversations. We re-envisioned what the client experience 
      looked like end-to-end and created a platform that responds to what our 
      corporate clients want. Every decision was made with their needs in 
      mind, and we believe the outcome is a product that will fulfill their 
      needs for efficiency, control and accessibility,&#8221; he concluded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Time Efficiency Through Managing User Entitlements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next generation&#8217;s advanced administrative capabilities build upon 
      what is a mission-critical, but historically time-consuming process. 
      User set-up and entitlement management is now reduced from hours, 
      sometime days, to minutes by simplifying the process and providing a 
      unique grouping capability allowing multiple changes to be made 
      simultaneously. Administrators are able to view all user entitlements 
      from a single screen &#8211; by user, account, or product, providing a better 
      and more streamlined experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ACCESS Community Provides One Single Location for Product  
      Service-Related Content
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next generation of J.P. Morgan ACCESS allows clients to utilize new 
      community features that help educate users about the new platform via 
      user guides, FAQ&#8217;s, how-to videos and podcasts. Additionally, corporate 
      clients may now interact with their peers to acquire knowledge and 
      leverage their experiences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All 25,000 current J.P. Morgan ACCESS clients representing approximately 
      155,000 users worldwide will be upgraded to the next generation 
      platform. New clients will be offered this integrated and time-saving 
      solution to meet their current and future cash management needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;J.P. Morgan ACCESS next generation delivers a modern architecture 
      capable of quickly adapting a client&#8217;s evolving needs and future 
      industry trends,&#8221; said Christine Barry, Research Director, Aite Group. 
      &#8220;Customers will benefit from true portal integration, a more efficient 
      user experience, and one-click performance which offers a new level of 
      flexibility, integration, and ease of use necessary to meet today&#8217;s more 
      demanding market and customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next generation of J.P. Morgan ACCESS will be featured during the 
      annual Association 
      for Financial Professionals conference (booth #1121), held at the 
      Miami Beach Convention Center from October 14-17, 2012.

&lt;p&gt;* Prop trader Roumani shifted into asset mgmt arm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* JP Morgan cuts its capital in credit fund by 25 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Roumani to cap fund's size at $1 bln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tommy Wilkes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Fahad Roumani, the JP Morgan
"prop" trader still making bets with the bank's capital, has
made clients in his hedge fund 14 percent this year, boosting
efforts to win new investors and replace money the bank has
started to pull from the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of new U.S. rules banning banks from gambling with
shareholder capital - known as proprietary trading - Roumani
shifted his team into JP Morgan's asset management arm, unlike
colleagues who opted to leave the bank and launch on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roumani's JPS Credit Opportunities Fund, which JP Morgan
 launched last year with $350 million of its own capital,
has profited from bets on dislocations in fixed income markets
including on instruments linked to the health of European banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Periods of market volatility have been better for us than
benign periods," Roumani told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh injections of capital by central banks has stoked a
strong rally in credit markets in recent months, but Roumani
said this will create further dislocations once the run fades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more volatility you get it's just inconceivable that
everything will move together...This creates opportunities to
put shorts on companies you know are going to be reporting
pretty bad results in a couple of weeks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is one of several banks trying to hold on to some
of their proprietary traders, supplant their own capital with
outside investor cash and retain ownership of the fund - as well
as the chance to earn lucrative performance fees in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank cut its stake in the Credit Opportunities Fund by a
quarter this month, leaving Roumani managing just shy of $500
million. It is the first of four planned withdrawals so that by
mid-2014 JP Morgan has pulled all its capital, Roumani said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow prop traders Mike Stewart and Deepak Gulati decided
against joining him in the new unit. Stewart now heads up Whard
Stewart Asset Management, while Gulati is raising capital for a
Swiss-based fund set to launch in 2013, hedge fund sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roumani, who will cap the size of his fund at $1 billion,
said he decided against launching on his own given how tough and
time-consuming the environment now is for raising new assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPM has always been totally supportive of us... We have an
economic agreement with JPM which is pretty attractive (versus)
the seed agreements we would have got outside of the bank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of traders have left banks for hedge funds since the
2008 financial crisis, driven by regulatory curbs on trading and
on the money they can make at banks, including requirements they
defer big chunks of their pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roumani said this was not proving a problem in holding on to
staff and that his team of 20 - including nine on the investment
side - had all stayed with him since the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally the whole hedge fund industry is going to move
towards more deferred remuneration," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CertiVox announces first ever solution for one-click, end to 
      end security within Microsoft Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			PrivateSky for Outlook secures world&#8217;s favourite email client
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CertiVox, a leading Web 2.0 security company, has today announced the 
      launch of the world&#8217;s first automatic, end-to-end encryption capability 
      designed specifically to enable Government, businesses and individuals 
      to benefit from one-click security within Microsoft Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PrivateSky&#8482; for Outlook enables users to automatically encrypt messages 
      and large files from within their Outlook client. No troublesome 
      usernames and passwords are required &#8211; only a four-digit PIN. There are 
      no changes to the user&#8217;s workflow &#8211; PrivateSky for Outlook installs a 
      simple, single button into the sender&#8217;s Outlook email console, to enable 
      them to secure, send and receive messages with one click.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PrivateSky for Outlook&#8217;s ability to secure much larger files than 
      Outlook normally supports - up to 5GB &#8211; enables it to address the 
      growing risk of employees resorting to insecure file transfer methods 
      because of the filesize limitations of Exchange. In contrast to other 
      encryption solutions, the recipient does not need to be 
      previously enrolled. Clicking on the received message is all that is 
      required to both decrypt and view the message, but the data remains 
      completely encrypted and safe until the recipient verifies their 
      identity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Private Sky for Outlook provides total, certificateless message and file 
      security from creation to delivery. It dispenses with the costly, 
      labour-intensive key management and administration issues that often 
      plague businesses using conventional encryption technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;This is the perfect example of how CertiVox&#8217;s technology doesn&#8217;t 
      just deliver benefit in its own right, but can also transform the value 
      of even the most well-established solutions in the market, giving users 
      a level of security that they have never previously been able to 
      experience,&#8220; Brian Spector, CEO of CertiVox, said. &#8220;The user 
      doesn&#8217;t care about the years of cryptographic expertise and military 
      grade encryption techniques behind the service - they just want a single 
      button in their Outlook, that takes care of all the encryption the 
      moment they click it. From the point of view of the end user, reseller, 
      partner and distributor, it is absolute simplicity.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rob Gaskin, Business Development Director of pioneering cloud service 
      provider CloudOne Services, who will make PrivateSky for Outlook 
      available through the channel, said &#8220;We are excited about leading the 
      channel for PrivateSky for Outlook and creating the opportunity for 
      service providers to participate. PrivateSky for Outlook delivers hugely 
      powerful security for end-users, yet it doesn&#8217;t require a change in 
      their behaviour in any way. It&#8217;s business as usual, but better. We 
      anticipate that our service provider customers will be extremely keen to 
      provide such a straightforward service for their end-users to adopt.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson has been granted a visa to enter Australia for a series of motivational talks next month, organisers said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are thrilled and are very grateful to the Australian government for granting Mike Tyson a visa and allowing him to visit Australia for the very first time" Max Markson, CEO of tour promoter Markson Sparks said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson's speaking engagements in Australia were supposed to include a similar visit to New Zealand, though his visa was revoked by the country's Associate Immigration Minister Kate Wilkinson after it had been approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson, who served three years of a six-year U.S. jail sentence for rape, needed dispensation under New Zealand immigration laws because of his conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a youth-related charity trust which originally backed his visit to appear at the Auckland event, billed as "Day of the Champions", said it no longer wanted to have anything to do with Tyson's visit due to his conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson's promoters applied for a new visa for New Zealand after a second community group said it would support his application in exchange for him talking to at-risk youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope we will also receive good news about Tyson's visit to New Zealand and are now patiently waiting on their response," Markson added on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson, 46, was undisputed world heavyweight boxing champion in the 1980s but he was convicted in 1992 of raping teenage beauty queen Desiree Washington and served three years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added to his notoriety when he bit rival Evander Holyfield on both ears in a 1997 bout, for which he was disqualified and temporarily suspended from boxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson declared bankruptcy in 2003 and retired from professional boxing three years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Tyson spoke to a financiers' conference in Hong Kong about his life before and after boxing, his family and his acting career, which includes a recent one-man show on Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by John O'Brien)&lt;/p&gt;

      laboratory fully meets Chevron Oronite standards for a testing facility, 
      the Intertek Shanghai laboratory has been awarded the &#8220;Oronite

      Oronite customer service to customers in China and support ongoing 
      in-country field testing programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jirong Xiao, Vice President for Technology, Chevron Oronite, said, &#8220;The 
      addition of the Shanghai testing facility is part of a longer term 
      strategy for China that supplements Chevron Oronite&#8217;s other technical

      and other fluids to detect signs of engine wear and other arising 
      problems.

      &#8220;With a lab open in China, Chevron Oronite offers analytical services

&lt;p&gt;WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson has been refused a visa to visit New Zealand as part of a series of motivational speeches for the second time, the country's government said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 46-year-old Tyson, who served three years of a six-year U.S. jail sentence for rape, needed dispensation under New Zealand immigration laws because of his conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had initially been granted a visa by Associate Immigration Minister Kate Wilkinson to visit New Zealand, but that was revoked when a youth charity which originally backed his appearance at the Auckland event no longer wanted to have anything to do with the visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoters applied for a new visa after a second community group said it would support the application in exchange for him talking to at-risk youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The original decision in respect of Mr. Tyson was a finely balanced call based on the letter of support from a board member of the Life Education Trust," Wilkinson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the Trust withdrew its support I received another application from Mr. Tyson's representatives with the support of the Manukau Urban Maori Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This new application was not enough to get the application over the line and as such, I have declined to grant Mr. Tyson a new visa under the Immigration Act 2009."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson, who was the undisputed world heavyweight champion in the 1980s, was granted a visa by the Australian government earlier this week to take part in the series of talks, billed as "Day of the Champions" in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was convicted for rape in 1992 and served three years in prison. Tyson declared bankruptcy in 2003 and retired from professional boxing three years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Tyson spoke to a financiers' conference in Hong Kong about his life before and after boxing, his family and his acting career, which includes a recent one-man show on Broadway.

&lt;p&gt;By Kim Dixon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Chief Executive
Lloyd Blankfein on Thursday became the latest big-name business
leader to pledge to pay a steeper tax rate - 5 percent more, he

on the economy if a bipartisan compromise were reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd be a buyer of the market," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simpson and Bowles were co-chairs of a bipartisan commission
established by President Barack Obama that in December, 2010
came up with a comprehensive proposal to reduce the budget
deficit, which has been topping $1 trillion for several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission's report has some support among Democrats and

initially proposed, Obama did not act on it and most House
Republicans opposed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Simpson and Bowles have been traveling the country with
the corporate group to push for a similar proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also trying to sway a group of Senators known as
the "Gang of Eight," - four Democrats and Republicans each, who
are working on a bipartisan deal and have embraced the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the push for a broad deficit-cutting deal to avoid
the fiscal cliff, Congress has put off any decisions until after
the Nov. 6 presidential and congressional elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will leave lawmakers only a few weeks to act before the
automatic cuts and tax increases are triggered under a budget
law passed by Congress in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budget and tax issues are expected to be among the big
issues addressed during Thursday night's vice presidential
debate. [See: ID:nL1E8LA85K]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIVERSE BUSINESS GROUPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business community, while eager for lower taxes,

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the new monetary stimulus actions was muted by lingering concerns about the effect of fiscal troubles in Greece and Spain on the region's banking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prime money market funds added $11 billion in euro zone bank paper, following a $16 billion increase in August, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a year-to-date basis, these funds' combined euro zone holdings rose by $40 billion to $193 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;September's increase in euro zone holdings came largely from a $12 billion rise in holdings of French bank debt, which was the biggest monthly increase since February, JPMorgan analysts said in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the rise in French bank paper was in unsecured, longer-dated commercial paper and certificates of deposits, suggesting less worries about French banks' creditworthiness, according to the latest data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Treasuries-only money market funds, prime money funds may invest in riskier short-term bank debt in an attempt to obtain higher yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money funds' non-European bank holdings fell by $32 billion in September to $578 billion, stemming largely from a $20 billion decline in U.S. bank debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The larger-than-average drop in September could be related to regulatory pressure on U.S. banks to reduce their reliance on short-term funding," the JPMorgan analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prime money funds had $1.411 trillion in assets under management, $11 billion lower than August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Gary Crosse and James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 11 (Reuters) - U.S. prime money market funds
raised their holdings of euro zone bank debt in September as the
Federal Reserve and European Central Bank embarked on another
round of unconventional policy  measures to help their
economies, according to a report by JPMorgan Securities on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the new monetary stimulus actions was muted by
lingering concerns about the effect of fiscal troubles in Greece
and Spain on the region's banking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prime money market funds added $11 billion in euro zone
bank paper, following a $16 billion increase in August, the
report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a year-to-date basis, these funds' combined euro zone
holdings rose by $40 billion to $193 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;September's increase in euro zone holdings came largely from
a $12 billion rise in holdings of French bank debt, which was
the biggest monthly increase since February, JPMorgan analysts
said in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the rise in French bank paper was in unsecured,
longer-dated commercial paper and certificates of deposits,
suggesting less worries about French banks' creditworthiness,
according to the latest data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Treasuries-only money market funds, prime money funds
may invest in riskier short-term bank debt in an attempt to
obtain higher yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money funds' non-European bank holdings fell by $32 billion
in September to $578 billion, stemming largely from a $20
billion decline in U.S. bank debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The larger-than-average drop in September could be related
to regulatory pressure on U.S. banks to reduce their reliance on
short-term funding," the JPMorgan analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prime money funds had $1.411 trillion in assets under
management, $11 billion lower than August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday set a trial date for the only Goldman Sachs Group Inc employee charged in the government's civil fraud case over the bank's Abacus subprime mortgage deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre's case is scheduled to go to trial on July 15, 2013, District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan ruled. The Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking financial and other penalties as part of its case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre, a Goldman vice president on leave from the bank, is currently enrolled in a PhD program in economics at the University of Chicago, his lawyer said in court. He has denied the charges against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman confirmed that Tourre was on unpaid leave from the bank but declined to comment further on Thursday's hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman and Tourre in April 2010, saying they misled investors in a complex mortgage transaction. Goldman settled its part of the litigation for $550 million in July 2010 without admitting wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyer, Pamela Chepiga, told the judge the defense would file court papers by March 2013 seeking to dismiss the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC has accused Goldman and Tourre of failing to tell investors that the Paulson &amp; Co hedge fund, run by billionaire John Paulson, had helped to choose and bet against the subprime residential mortgage-backed securities underlying Abacus 2007-AC1, a collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 10-cv-03229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Basil Katz; Editing by Martha Graybow and Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs chief
executive, Lloyd Blankfein, became the latest big-name business
leader to pledge to pay steeper tax - 5 percent, he said - in
exchange for a long-term bipartisan deal in Congress to keep the
country from falling off the "fiscal cliff."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein is part of a group of corporate executives who
have raised nearly $30 million to support a deal to avoid the
so-called cliff - about $600 billion in tax hikes and spending
cuts set to take effect at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if he would pay 5 percent more in taxes if it became
necessary for Congress to reach a deal, he said "I don't know
anybody who wouldn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who characterized his political views as "center
left," was interviewed Thursday along with Erskine Bowles and
Alan Simpson on CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simpson and Bowles are co-chairs of a bipartisan commission
established by President Barack Obama that in December, 2010
came up with a comprehensive proposal to tame deficits. While
the commission's report is now held up by Democrats and
Republicans as a model, it was never translated into law. Obama
did not act on it, which some criticized as a missed
opportunity, but others say was wise since House Republicans had
 voted against it on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the push for a broad deficit-cutting deal to avoid
the fiscal cliff, Congress has put off any decisions until after
the Nov. 6 presidential and congressional elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will leave lawmakers only a few weeks to act before the
automatic cuts and tax increases are triggered under a budget
law passed by Congress in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      nCircle Releases Configuration Compliance Manager&#8482; 5.13, Now Audits 
      MySQL and Microsoft Internet Information Services 7
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Version Also Includes New DISA STIG Policies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      nCircle, the leader in information 
      risk and security performance management solutions, today announced 
      the immediate availability of nCircle Configuration 
      Compliance Manager&#8482; version 5.13. This release adds the 
      ability to audit MySQL and Microsoft Windows Server Internet Information 
      Services (IIS) 7 configurations, updates PCI support to Windows 7, and 
      adds new DISA STIG policies for IIS7 and Solaris 10.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Auditing the configurations of IT systems, and monitoring changes in 
      those configurations, is a critical step in reducing security risk and 
      achieving compliance. nCircle Configuration 
      Compliance Manager automates configuration auditing, and changes 
      monitoring and configuration compliance processes, providing a clear 
      picture of system configurations and the impact of configuration changes 
      on compliance. Configuration Compliance Manager utilizes a completely 
      agentless architecture, requiring no software installation on monitored 
      endpoints. Agentless monitoring dramatically reduces deployment costs 
      and makes it possible to profile every device on the network, delivering 
      the most comprehensive coverage and the lowest cost of ownership. 
      Configuration Compliance Manager includes a rich library of policies 
      based on standards and benchmarks from NIST, 
      Center 
      for Internet Security, DISA and Microsoft, as well as policies for 
      specific regulations, such as PCI,&#160;Sarbanes-Oxley,&#160;HIPAA,&#160;USGCB&#160;and&#160;NERC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With Configuration Compliance Manager 5.13, nCircle extends coverage 
      for two of the most important technologies in the enterprise: databases 
      and web servers,&#8221; said Tim Erlin, director of product management and IT 
      risk and security strategist for nCircle. &#8220;The addition of MySQL 
      auditing and the corresponding CIS policy allow customers to audit a 
      critical enterprise application. Microsoft IIS 7 coverage, including the 
      DISA STIG policies, extends Configuration Compliance Manager's web 
      server auditing capabilities to help protect the underlying 
      infrastructure behind many of the most critical enterprise applications.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MySQL Support
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With over 65,000 downloads per day, MySQL is the one of the most popular 
      open-source databases. MySQL provides a reliable, affordable, easy to 
      use solution for a wide range of database applications. Configuration 
      Compliance Manager 5.13 adds MySQL support and four CIS-certified MySQL 
      policies, enabling customers to audit for a wide range of best practice 
      standards in order to improve security, ensure integrity and meet 
      regulatory compliance requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft IIS Support
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Web servers are targeted and attacked by cyber criminals more frequently 
      than any other system on an organization&#8217;s network. Microsoft IIS runs 
      on over 84 million domains around the world and is used extensively in 
      the enterprise. Configuration Compliance Manager 5.13 allows 
      organizations to scan IIS7 configurations for a wide range of best 
      practice standards to effectively manage security risks and increase 
      compliance on these critical assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Configuration Auditing Policies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Configuration Compliance Manager version 5.13 adds seven new policies 
      and updates two PCI policies, bringing the total number of available 
      policies to 166.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			WorldDesk Announces Support for AutoCad, Microsoft Office, Microsoft 
      Visio and Skype on Enterprise Platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			WorldDesk, 
      a leading provider of desktop virtualization software, has today 
      announced support for a suite of productivity and business critical 
      applications for their WorldDesk 
      for Enterprise platform. More than 30 apps have been verified, 
      including AutoCAD, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Visio, Visual Studio, 
      Tally, OpenOffice and Skype.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In this latest release of WorldDesk for Enterprise, the Menlo Park and 
      Belfast-based start-up has focused on heavyweight and real-time apps, 
      traditionally a weak point in the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) 
      story.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WorldDesk for Enterprise uses a unique &#8220;container&#8221; to manage and deliver 
      the desktop centrally but run it entirely on the local machine. This 
      approach takes full advantage of the power in the local machine, but 
      avoids the significant back-end expenditure required in other VDI 
      solutions and capitalises well on existing infrastructure. WorldDesk 
      supports both Windows XP and Windows 7 having launched in 
      both&#160;32-bit&#160;and&#160;64-bit&#160;earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Speaking following today&#8217;s announcement, Rao Cherukuri, WorldDesk CEO 
      said: &#8220;Today we&#8217;re excited to announce the full support of these key 
      productivity applications for our Enterprise customers, and particularly 
      thrilled to include AutoCAD, one of the most requested applications on 
      our WorldDesk for Enterprise platform.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Our container approach is completely unique; customers can hardly 
      believe we can deliver their desktops while running a heavyweight app 
      like AutoCAD with ease.
			Critically, WorldDesk for Enterprise can 
      help avoid expensive upgrades and complex GPU acceleration on the server 
      side.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mr Cherukuri concluded: &#8220;Customers are deploying our WorldDesk 
      for Enterprise platform on existing hardware, making CAPEX go further 
      and reducing OPEX with better and easier IT management.&#8221;

			Pfizer Announces Top-Line Results From A Phase 3 Long-Term Safety 
      Study Of ALO-02:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			An Investigational Agent Comprised Of Oxycodone Hydrochloride And 
      Naltrexone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, In Subjects With 
      Moderate-To-Severe Chronic Non-cancer Pain
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced top-line results today from a Phase 3 
      open-label long-term safety study of investigational agent ALO-02 
      (oxycodone hydrochloride and naltrexone hydrochloride extended-release 
      capsules) in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic, non-cancer pain. 
      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of ALO-02 
      administered for up to 12 months. The study showed that the adverse 
      event profile was as expected based on similar long-term safety studies 
      with other extended-release opioid formulations; the most common adverse 
      events were nausea, constipation, vomiting and headache. The study 
      supports the safety profile of this investigational analgesic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ALO-02 uses technology designed to encourage use as intended. The 
      technology may discourage common methods of tampering associated with 
      prescription opioid misuse and abuse and consists of extended-release 
      oxycodone pellets that surround a sequestered core of naltrexone. When 
      used as directed, the naltrexone core remains sequestered and patients 
      receive oxycodone in an extended release manner. When the pellets are 
      crushed, the naltrexone is released and is designed to counteract the 
      effects of oxycodone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These top-line data provide evidence of the long-term safety of ALO-02 
      in patients with moderate-to-severe non-cancer pain regardless of prior 
      prescription opioid treatment,&#8221; said Steven J. Romano, M.D., senior vice 
      president, head, Medicines Development Group, Global Primary Care 
      Business Unit, Pfizer Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Study ALO-02-10-3001 included adult patients with moderate-to-severe 
      chronic non-cancer pain lasting at least 3 months and requiring a 
      continuous around-the-clock opioid analgesic for an extended period of 
      time. Before enrolling in the study, subjects could be receiving a 
      prescription opioid for the management of chronic pain or could be 
      opioid-na&#239;ve. The primary objective of this single-arm, multicenter, 
      safety study was to evaluate the long-term safety of ALO-02 administered 
      once or twice daily for up to 12 months. The study enrolled 395 
      patients, the majority of whom &#8211; 77 percent &#8211; were opioid-experienced. 
      The majority of patients had chronic lower back pain (61 percent) and 18 
      percent had pain from osteoarthritis. Patients enrolled in the study had 
      pain for an average of nine years. A total of 193 (48.9%) patients 
      received ALO-02 for approximately 6 months and 105 (26.6%) patients for 
      approximately one year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (10%) while on ALO-02 
      were nausea, constipation, vomiting and headache. The most common 
      serious adverse events were acute myocardial infarction, non-cardiac 
      chest pain, pneumonia, convulsion, and kidney stones, each of which 
      occurred in 2 patients. A total of 237 (60%) patients discontinued from 
      the study over the one-year study period, with 19 percent of patients 
      reporting adverse events as the primary reason for discontinuation. The 
      adverse events that most commonly (2%) lead to discontinuation were 
      nausea and constipation. The discontinuation rate was within the 
      expected range based on similar long-term safety studies with other 
      extended-release opioid formulations.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co's (JPM.N) chief financial officer, Doug Braunstein, may step down and take another position with the bank, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move would be the latest management change at the bank, which has been roiled by $6 billion of losses from bad bets on derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person familiar with the matter said Wednesday that any shift would be Braunstein's decision, and would be unrelated to the trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, JPMorgan announced new co-heads for commercial and investment banking and placed a co-chief operating officer in the reporting line between Braunstein and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon had testified a month earlier to a U.S. Senate committee that Braunstein was one of the people who had wrongly assured him in April that the derivatives losses were not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts believed the executive changes in July were designed to add checks and balances to the bank's senior ranks after the trading losses, which have brought intense regulatory scrutiny to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon told Reuters at the time that the shifts had been in the works before the bad trades, and were designed to help the bank cope with the increased complexity that financial companies face globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein did not return a call to his cell phone seeking comment on his possible job change, and the bank declined to comment. The timing for any job change for Braunstein is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $6 billion of trading losses came from a JPMorgan group called the Chief Investment Office (CIO), which managed risk for the bank and invested deposits. The CIO group in London took large bets on derivatives, with one trader taking big enough positions to be called "the London Whale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank first disclosed possible losses in May, and in July said that some traders may have lied about the value of their positions to the bank, adding fuel to government probes into the trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators and agencies including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are all looking at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Dimon told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, "We made a stupid error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "I should have caught it ... I didn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the trading losses, JPMorgan Chase earned $5 billion in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In narrative accounts of the bad trades by multiple media outlets, including a more-than-7,000 word piece published in this weekend's New York Times Magazine, Braunstein is not mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said last week in an internal memo that Barry Zubrow was retiring. Zubrow was head of risk management at the bank when it was building a dangerously large position in credit derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, months before the bank announced the bad derivatives trades, Zubrow switched to heading corporate and regulatory affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of Braunstein's possible job switch was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sarah N.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Oct 11 (Marketwire) -- 
DotNetNuke Corp., the company behind the most widely adopted Web Content
Management Platform for Microsoft .NET, today announced that it has
signed a strategic alliance with Microsoft to offer its Social Content
Management System (CMS) through Microsoft's Windows Azure cloud. The
terms of the agreement include an investment from Microsoft to support
engineering, sales and marketing over the next four years. Additionally,
Microsoft is providing technology assistance, as the two companies work
together to build a world-class cloud offering. 

    "Over the last year, our customers in the upper mid-market and enterprise
have been requesting a world-class cloud infrastructure to host their
mission-critical content and functionally rich, web properties," said
Navin Nagiah, CEO of DotNetNuke. "We are working with Microsoft to bring
our customers a powerful Windows Azure-based CMS that is both reliable
and elastic."

    The Windows Azure-based service will provide the power and flexibility of
DotNetNuke's Social CMS without requiring users to install and manage the
software and hardware required to run the platform. Everything an
organization needs to build content rich, social websites is provided as
a cloud-based service including:


--  One-Click Installation and Setup - Customers select a service plan and
    a new DotNetNuke installation and a website are automatically created.
--  Full Feature Set - Access to all of DotNetNuke's powerful CMS
    features, including site management, social collaboration, granular
    security, advanced content workflows, document management, page and
    module caching, analytics, and mobile site management.
--  App Store - Customers can build and customize websites by purchasing
    applications and design templates through the DotNetNuke Store.
--  Custom Development - Organizations that wish to develop custom
    functionality have full access to the DotNetNuke platform and API.
    Some service offerings include full file system access for developers.
--  Upgrades - The service streamlines and simplifies the process of
    upgrading a site to a newer version of the DotNetNuke platform.
--  Import/Export - Existing sites can be moved onto the cloud platform or
    exported to another hosting provider.
--  Backup and Restore - Sites are automatically backed and earlier
    versions can be restored.
--  Test Sites - Plans include the ability to test websites before they
    are made publically available.

    

DotNetNuke began offering Windows Azure-based trials of its
professional edition software worldwide, localized into five languages,
earlier this year. The company today opened up registration for a beta
version of its cloud offering that will be available in Q4 2012.
DotNetNuke is scheduled to make the service generally available in early
2013, with service plans for mid-sized businesses and enterprises.

    "Social experiences are ideal for cloud computing; they are consumed
across many devices and browsers and they also need to scale based on
fluctuations in usage," said Kim Akers, General Manager of Microsoft.
"With Windows Azure developers can build social experiences that take
advantage of a reliable cloud backend and a scalable way to manage and
continually refine their sites. DotNetNuke's Windows Azure-based offering
is designed to make it easy for organizations to build and deploy
websites."

    The alliance extends DotNetNuke and Microsoft's close collaboration
across multiple initiatives including:


--  DotNetNuke Community Edition availability through Microsoft CodePlex,
    the open source project hosting service
--  DotNetNuke's inclusion in Web Platform Installer
--  DotNetNuke's inclusion in Web Matrix installer for developers
--  DotNetNuke's participation in Microsoft Technology Adoption Program
    (TAP) for Windows Azure
--  Development of a RAZOR module for the DotNetNuke Platform
--  Microsoft's Diamond Sponsorship of DNN World 2012

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Stan Lee Media, a company that says it controls the rights to Marvel characters including Spider Man and Iron Man, has filed suit in U.S. District Court in Colorado against the Walt Disney Co seeking "billions of dollars of profits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stan Lee, no longer associated with the company, created many of Marvel's stable of comic book characters. The company claims Lee assigned it his rights to those characters in 1998 but then agreed a month later to assign the same rights to Marvel Enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney acquired Marvel Enterprises, which had been renamed Marvel Entertainment, in 2009 for $4.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Walt Disney Company has represented to the public that it, in fact, owns the copyright to these characters as well as hundreds of other characters created by Stan Lee," the suit alleges. "Those representations made to the public by the Walt Disney Company are false."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit focuses on successful movies based on Marvel characters that Disney has released since its Marvel acquisition. Those films include "The Avengers," which has grossed more than $1.5 billion in worldwide sales and is second only to "Avatar" and "Titanic," according to movie site Box Office Mojo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This lawsuit is without merit," Walt Disney said in a statement. "It arises out of the same core facts and legal claims that have been rejected by three federal district court judges."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stan Lee Media, which said it was created in 1999 to "sue to recover damages to its assets," has been involved in what it called a "somewhat tortured history" of litigation dating from 2001 over corporate governance issues and the characters rights in cases filed in Colorado, New York and California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include suits between the company, its shareholders and Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest suit claims that Stan Lee Media owns the rights "to the billions of dollars that Disney has generated, or allowed others to generate".

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter named Joe Saunders as his starting pitcher for the do-or-die fourth game of their series against the New York Yankees and said there would be no hangover from Wednesday's 12-inning loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Orioles, who have been virtually unstoppable in close games and extra-inning contests, took a 2-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth before New York's Raul Ibanez hit a pinch-hit homer to tie it and another long ball to win it 3-2 in the 12th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're so impressed with all our guys tonight," Showalter said about his young team, who have taken Baltimore into the postseason for the first time in 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They played a great game in a tough situation, and they'll come out and compete tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defeat snapped a streak of 16 successive extra-innings victories for Baltimore and ended their perfect 74-0 mark this season when leading after seven innings in a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if he was stunned by the failure of closer Jim Johnson to preserve Baltimore's lead in the ninth, Showalter said: "Stunned? No. Stunned left me a while ago. I got a grip on how hard this is to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jimmy is a big-hearted, talented guy. Believe me, we'd be at home watching without people like Jim Johnson. He's a special guy. We're real proud of him and you'll see him again tomorrow night, I hope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the game, Showalter had said he was undecided whether he was going to start left-hander Saunders or right-hander Chris Tillman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saunders was the winning pitcher in Baltimore's victory over the Texas Rangers in the one-game, wildcard playoff to advance to the Division Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Joe is obviously coming off a real good start in a pressure situation, a game that we had to win, and he'll find himself back in that spot again,' the Orioles manager said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Joe is a guy that gives you a chance to win, and he'll compete. We feel good with him out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Peter Rutherford)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE Oct 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp 
expects to make a decision on how to develop the Scarborough gas
field, considered one of the toughest projects in Western
Australia, around the second half of 2013, its Australian
chairman said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scarborough field, half-owned by BHP Billiton
 , lies some 280 kilometres offshore, making it an
expensive prospect to develop, which could be difficult to
justify at a time when abundant gas supplies in the United
States could start flowing into Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenge of Scarborough is finding a solution that's
viable given the challenged nature of the resource," Exxon Mobil
Australia chairman John Dashwood told reporters after speaking
at a business function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners are evaluating a range of options including
supplying gas to other companies' LNG plants or building a
floating LNG platform, Dashwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some engineering evaluations to go through here,
and I don't anticipate a decision much before the second half of
next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dashwood said any new LNG project would have to be weighed
up against potential exports out of the U.S., where Exxon Mobil
is the biggest gas producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is developing a $15.7 billion LNG project in
Papua New Guinea and is also a 25 percent partner in Australia's
biggest LNG project, the $37 billion Gorgon project, operated by
Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dashwood said those projects would not be affected by
potential U.S. exports as all of its production from them has
already been locked into contracts. He declined to comment on
pricing provisions in those deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the oil refining side, Dashwood said Exxon Mobil remains
committed to running its 80,000 barrels per day Altona refinery
near Melbourne, despite decisions by rivals Royal Dutch Shell
 and Caltex to shut some refineries and turn
them into fuel import terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand others have made some choices about not
continuing to run their refineries here, but we have no plans to
do anything other than run the Altona refinery at this point,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Downgrades 16 Classes of JPMCC 2008-C2; Removed 15 from Rating 
      Watch Negative
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded 16 classes and removed from Rating Watch 
      Negative 15 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Mortgage Securities Trust, 
      series 2008-C2. The downgrades reflect an increase in expected losses on 
      the specially serviced loans, escalating interest shortfalls, and 
      continued underperformance of many of the larger loans not in special 
      servicing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many of the loans have been in special servicing for a number of years 
      as anticipated resolutions have not occurred. These unresolved specially 
      serviced loans have resulted in additional trust expenses and a 
      significant increase in interest shortfalls from approximately $21.5 
      million in August 2011 to approximately $35.6 million as of the 
      September 2012 distribution date. The shortfalls currently impact 
      classes A-M though T.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades to classes A-3, A-4, A-4FL, A-SB, and A1-A reflect the 
      expected reduction in credit enhancement as well as a concern that 
      interest shortfalls could affect these classes prior to class repayment. 
      While these classes are senior in the waterfall, limited amortization 
      occurs monthly and only roughly $35 million in principal payoffs are 
      expected to occur prior to 2014. According to Fitch's global criteria 
      for rating caps, Fitch will not assign or maintain 'AAAsf' or 'AAsf' 
      ratings for notes that it believes have a high level of vulnerability to 
      interest shortfalls or deferrals, even if permitted under the terms of 
      the documents (for more information please see the full report titled 
      'Criteria for Rating Caps in Global Structured Finance Transactions', 
      dated Aug. 2, 2012, at www.fitchratings.com).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the concern with interest shortfalls, based on current 
      loss expectations on loans in special servicing, the erosion of credit 
      enhancement will be significant upon the disposition of these assets. 
      Additionally, while a number of the performing larger loans have 
      institutional quality borrowers, these loans continue to show declines 
      in net operating income (NOI) or fail to show performance improvement 
      from stressed levels. Fitch's rating actions are in line with stressed 
      model assumptions. A detailed listing of rating actions follows at the 
      end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 22.4% of the remaining pool. Fitch has 
      designated 28 loans (46.4% of the pool balance) as Fitch Loans of 
      Concern, which includes six specially serviced loans (23.9%). Fitch 
      estimates that classes B through T may be fully depleted from losses 
      associated with the specially serviced assets. As of the August 2012 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been 
      reduced by approximately 10.3% to $1.045 billion from $1.17 billion at 
      issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest specially serviced asset, The Shops at Dos Lagos (12%), is 
      comprised of a 345,847 square foot (sf) lifestyle/entertainment retail 
      center built in 2006/2007. The loan transferred to special servicing in 
      October 2008 for monetary default after the borrower indicated the 
      property was significantly impacted by the downturn in the economy. The 
      special servicer has foreclosed on the property and continues to work to 
      stabilize the tenant base, increase foot traffic, and improve visibility 
      to the center in an effort to stabilize value. As of September 2012, 
      occupancy was reported at 68%. The special servicer plans to market the 
      property beginning in late 2012, with a target closing date for the 
      first quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the Westin Portfolio 
      (9.8%), which is comprised of the 487-room Westin La Poloma in Tucson, 
      AZ, with a 27-hole Jack Nicklaus golf course and spa, and the 412-room 
      oceanfront Westin Hilton Head, in Hilton Head, SC. The loan transferred 
      to special servicing in October 2008 due to monetary default. The 
      properties were significantly impacted by the recession and its impact 
      on business and leisure travel. In 2010, special servicing 
      responsibilities were transferred from Midland Loan Services to LNR 
      Partners, Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The borrower filed for bankruptcy in November 2010, and the process 
      continues to face delays. As of August 2012, the special servicer was 
      still working through the bankruptcy process. Property values, as well 
      as each respective market where the hotels are located, remain stressed, 
      and it is uncertain as to whether the properties will experience any 
      additional improvement in value.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 12 () - Fitch Ratings has downgraded 16 classes and removed from Rating
Watch Negative 15 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Mortgage Securities Trust, series
2008-C2. The downgrades reflect an increase in expected losses on the specially
serviced loans, escalating interest shortfalls, and continued underperformance
of many of the larger loans not in special servicing.

Many of the loans have been in special servicing for a number of years as

shortfalls currently impact classes A-M though T.

The downgrades to classes A-3, A-4, A-4FL, A-SB, and A1-A reflect the expected
reduction in credit enhancement as well as a concern that interest shortfalls
could affect these classes prior to class repayment. While these classes are
senior in the waterfall, limited amortization occurs monthly and only roughly
$35 million in principal payoffs are expected to occur prior to 2014. According
to Fitch's global criteria for rating caps, Fitch will not assign or maintain

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Two of the nation's biggest banks, Wells Fargo &amp; Co and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co, made record profits over the last three months from a sharp rise in mortgage lending, though performance stumbles elsewhere left investors worried about how long those profits can last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both banks reported double-digit increases in third-quarter earnings on Friday, as record-low interest rates and an uptick in the housing market drove a boom in mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts said those record earnings might not be sustainable, as each bank posted declining margins that suggest they may have a harder time earning as much in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan shares closed the day down 1.1 percent at $41.62, while Wells Fargo declined 2.6 percent to $34.25. Both underperformed the broader market, which was essentially flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is the "net interest margin," or the spread between what the banks earn from loans and what they pay out on deposits. That margin contracted in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have a battle between net interest margin and mortgage banking," said Marty Mosby, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, referring to the tension between profit-drivers now and potential future results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORTGAGES ON THE MOVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mortgage market dragged on banks during the worst of the financial crisis but has become a bright spot of late. After the Federal Reserve said in September it would buy huge quantities of mortgage bonds every month for the foreseeable future, rates fell sharply and loan applications soared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, by far the largest mortgage lender in the country - three times the size of its closest peer - made $139 billion in mortgages in the three months ending in September, up $50 billion from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a limit to that growth, though, warned J.P. Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't expect to count on high margins and mortgage origination forever," Dimon said on Friday. The refinancing trend, he added, will continue "next quarter, maybe for a couple of quarters after that, but it won't last much longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMALLER WHALES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the good news about the housing market, J.P. Morgan also reported that losses are shrinking rapidly from the bad trades engineered by the so-called London Whale, which cost the bank almost $6 billion in the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The losses cast a harsh light on Dimon, the chief executive viewed by some as a potential leading candidate for U.S. Treasury secretary in a second Obama administration. He has apologized repeatedly, and at length, for failing to catch the problem before it grew so big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation's largest bank by assets posted net income of $5.71 billion, or $1.40 a share, up 34 percent from a profit of $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.24 a share, according to surveys by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Barclays Capital said it was the 17th time in the last 18 quarters that the bank beat Wall Street's forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net interest margin contracted to 2.43 percent in the quarter, 4 basis points less than the prior quarter and 23 basis points lower than a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, the nation's fourth-largest bank by deposits, earned $4.9 billion in the quarter, 22 percent more than a year earlier. Per-share earnings of 88 cents just beat the average Wall Street forecast of 87 cents, although revenue missed estimates by some $270 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells, Warren Buffett's favorite bank, stumbled on the net interest margin. It fell 25 basis points to 3.66 percent in the third quarter. That was a sharper drop than expected, though bank executives insisted they were unconcerned and that investors should focus on overall profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods analyst Frederick Cannon, in a research report for clients, said the strength in mortgages was good but the weakness in the interest margin was more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, N.C.; additional reporting by Dan Wilchins and Jed Horowitz in New York; writing by Ben Berkowitz; editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 12 (Reuters) - International Business Machines 
said it was booking a pension-related fee in its third quarter
of $160 million due to a ruling by the high court in London in a
legal dispute over retirement terms at its UK business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said in a statement on Friday that the charges would not
affect the company's operating reported results for the third
quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court decided that terms set in 1983 should be modified
to allow some current IBM UK employees who are members of a
specific plan to retire from the age of 60 instead of 63 without
reduction of their defined benefit pension, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said IBM UK was considering an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is scheduled to report on its third quarter financial
results on Oct 16.&lt;/p&gt;

      JP Morgan Chase 3Q'12 Results Highlight Franchise Strength
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JP Morgan Chase (JPM) reported record net income of $5.7 billion on the 
      back of strong business performance across the company's major business 
      lines. Revenues and earnings showed marked improvement on a year-on-year 
      basis as well as sequentially reflecting improved business trends. 
      Nonetheless, JPM recognized a number of significant items pertaining to 
      increases in litigation reserves, reduction in mortgage provisions, 
      gains from the extinguishment of debt, and charges related to new 
      regulatory guidance on real estate portfolios. Adjusting for these 
      items, Fitch Ratings estimates JPM had pretax income of $7.7 billion vs. 
      reported pretax income of $7.9 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Adjusting for DVA, the investment bank performed well with growth in 
      investment banking fees and fixed income businesses reporting solid 
      increases, particularly on Y-o-Y basis as last year's quarter was 
      particularly weak. JPM reported higher Investment Bank VaR during the 
      quarter, although this partly reflects previously announced plans to 
      move the synthetic credit portfolio from the CIO into the investment 
      bank and related model changes. JPM incurred incremental losses on its 
      CIO synthetic credit portfolio during quarter, but within Fitch's 
      expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Card Services and Auto net income was down modestly sequentially to $954 
      million. Credit card outstanding continued to decline to $124.3 billion 
      although purchase volumes were up vs. prior year. Auto originations were 
      up 7% Y-o-Y, although outstandings were flat sequentially. Credit 
      quality continues to modestly improve in this segment, although Fitch 
      believes these improvements will begin to plateau. Results in Commercial 
      Banking were strong on a Y-o-Y basis but more modest sequentially. 
      Commercial loans continued to grow while credit quality remained solid.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's Treasury and Security Services marked a modest decline in net 
      income during the quarter attributed to seasonal activity in securities 
      lending and depositary receipts, although assets under custody grew 12% 
      to $18.2 trillion. The Asset Management segment was buoyed by improved 
      market levels, as assets under supervision grew $225 billion to $2.0 
      trillion and assets under management were up $127 billion to $1.4 
      trillion. Fitch continues to regard these businesses as stable 
      contributors to revenues and earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Retail Financial Services segment posted net income of $1.4 billion 
      reflecting strong mortgage origination volumes. Within this, Consumer  
      Business Banking was weaker on both a sequential and Y-o-Y basis as 
      revenues were negatively affected by reduced interchange fees and higher 
      expenses related to investments in sales force and branches. Similar to 
      many other banks, the deposit margin in this segment noticeably declined 
      to 2.56% from 2.82% the prior year given the low rate environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Deposits continued to grow and were $394 billion. The mortgage business 
      was strong with record mortgage production net income of $563 million 
      reflecting strong loan origination volumes and wider margins offset by 
      higher servicing costs. Mortgage application volume was up significantly 
      as well, suggesting that volume trends will continue into next quarter. 
      Servicing expenses were up 23% and will likely remain elevated 
      reflecting industry changes to servicing standards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM continues to make progress on meeting Basel III capital 
      requirements. It reported a Tier 1 Common ratio of 8.4% for the quarter 
      based on the proposed implementation outlined in U.S. regulators notice 
      of proposed rulemakings (NPRs). Fitch expects that JPM will continue to 
      build capital in anticipation of the additional capital requirements as 
      a designated globally systemically important financial institution. 
      While JPM ceased its share buy back program following losses in the CIO, 
      Fitch expects that JPM may resume such activity if it re-submits its 
      capital plans and receives approval from the Federal Reserve.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 12 (Reuters) - The New York-traded shares of
Coca Cola Hellenic rose sharply on Friday, a day after
the bottling company said it was leaving Greece, making the
shares a standout in an otherwise flat market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement by the drinks bottler that it was switching
its primary listing from Athens to London and moving its
corporate base to stable Switzerland is a bitter blow to the
debt-crippled nation but a likely boost for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its rating on the stock to overweight from
neutral while SocGen raises its price target for the company's
shares to 13.50 euros. The shares closed up 6.4 percent at
$21.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNY Mellon index of leading American depositary receipts
 fell 0.1 percent, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
  fell 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks wrapped up their worst week in four months, led
lower on Friday by financial shares as results from Wells Fargo
and JPMorgan ignited concerns about shrinking profit margins for
big lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STMicroelectronics said it was not planning to split
itself up, contrary to a report that Europe's top semiconductor
maker was considering a breakup. The stock rose 6.4 percent to
$6 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNY Mellon index of leading European ADRs edged
down 0.04 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of
top shares closed down 0.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian software services provider Infosys Ltd again
disappointed investors hoping for a more robust growth outlook,
undermining its standing as the country's information technology
bellwether and sending its shares down almost 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNY Mellon index of leading Asian ADRs fell 0.4
percent and the BNY Mellon index of leading Latin American ADRs
 dipped 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Oct 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on
Friday it plans to add Google Inc as a defendant in
Germany in one of its patent actions against Google's phone
maker, Motorola Mobility, marking the first time the two tech
giants have come into direct legal conflict over Google's
Android mobile software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft contends that Google's Android infringes its
software patents but so far has pursued handset makers rather
than Google itself for payment of royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many hardware companies have settled with Microsoft over
their use of Android, but Motorola -- which Google bought this
year -- is fighting a range of patent issues with Microsoft in
courts in the United States and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest move, Microsoft said in a court in Munich that
it plans to add Google as a defendant in a case in which it
claims a mapping feature on Motorola phones infringes one of its
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It became necessary to add Google to this particular case
because Motorola maintains that it lacks sufficient information
about actions occurring on Google's servers," said a Microsoft
spokesperson in an e-mailed statement on Friday. Google did not
immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent in question defines a method for a mobile device
to obtain a map from one database, call up resource information
such as the location of a hotel from a second database, and
overlay the two sets of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola and Microsoft are engaged in separate patent
disputes in courts in Mannheim, Germany and Seattle over
Motorola's use of scheduling software and Microsoft's use of
some video and wireless technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct 12 - Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services today said that its ratings on
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM; A/Negative/A-1) are not affected by the
company's third-quarter results, which were above our expectations, given
current operating conditions.

Standard &amp; Poor's adjusted pretax earnings were roughly $7.3 billion, up from 
roughly $3.9 billion in the prior-year period. Results include a litigation 
expense of $700 million but exclude an $889 million gain resulting from the 
elimination of some of its trust preferred securities (TRUPS). 

Positively, risk from JPM's synthetic credit portfolio, which resulted in 
significant trading losses in the first two quarters, has been significantly 
reduced. The portfolio generated only a modest loss in the third quarter. In 
addition, firmwide average Value at Risk (VaR) declined to $115 million in the 
third quarter, down from $201 million the previous quarter.   

JPM's Standard &amp; Poor's adjusted revenue rose by 12.0% in the third quarter 
(year over year) to $25.2 billion, mostly as a result of stronger Investment 
Banking revenue, largely because of strong debt underwriting results and 
favorable year-over-year comparisons. Given new support mechanisms in the 
eurozone and the absence of another flare-up in the crisis, we expect 
fourth-quarter results to remain strong versus fourth-quarter 2011. 
Separately, Retail Financial Services benefitted from continued strong 
mortgage volume, reflecting historically low mortgage rates and high margins. 
We expect this trend to continue at least through the fourth quarter. 

The net interest margin (NIM) declined 4 basis points (bps) sequentially, to 
2.43%, largely as a result of run-off of higher-yielding assets and limited 
reinvestment opportunities. Given the flattening of the yield curve, we expect 
the NIM to continue to decline over the next few quarters. The impact on net 
interest income should be offset somewhat by growth in JPM's loan book in the 
coming quarters, particularly in jumbo loans. 

Credit quality improved but was obfuscated in the third quarter by new 
guidance that resulted in higher nonperforming assets. As a result, 
nonperforming assets totaled $12.5 billion, including $1.7 billion related to 
the new regulatory guidance, versus nonperforming assets of $11.4 billion the 
previous quarter. We expect net charge-offs to continue to decline in 2013, 
albeit at a more moderate pace than 2012. Although JPM released roughly $900 
million, reserves are adequate compared with nonperforming loans.    

We believe direct exposure to GIIPS countries (Greece, Ireland, Italy, 
Portugal, and Spain) remains manageable, but a worsening of the European 
crisis could still have a negative ratings impact.

JPM's Basel I Tier 1 common ratio totaled 10.4% in the third quarter, up 50 
bps sequentially. We believe that JPM's share repurchase program, which is 
currently suspended, will commence in the first quarter of 2013, assuming 
regulatory approval, and would subsequently slow the rate at which JPM builds 
capital.  

Our rating outlook on JPM remains negative as we continue to assess possible 
further fallout from JPM's risk management missteps. We continue to look into 
JPM's risk management practices to ensure that missteps were isolated to JPM's 
CIO unit, and we await the outcome of an internal assessment of the company's 
risk management practices by its Board of Directors. We also continue to 
assess if and how future capital plans affect the company's ability to build 
capital. Furthermore, we need to assess ongoing legal issues and ensure that 
JPM is adequately reserved.

&lt;p&gt;* Net income $5.71 billion vs $4.26 billion year earlier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Mortgage lending revenue climbs 36 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* CEO Dimon: "We believe the housing market has turned the
corner"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares slip 1.8 percent in afternoon trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co posted a
record quarterly profit on Friday as falling interest rates and
a recovering housing market brought big increases in mortgage
lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mortgage market, long a drag on bank results, is
starting to lift lenders' earnings again, and JPMorgan Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon said he was hopeful about the outlook for
U.S. residential real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the housing market has turned the corner," Dimon
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan suffered only modest losses in the latest quarter 
from the "London whale" trades that brought it $5.8 billion of
losses in the first half of the year, signaling that it is
moving on after the scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The improving housing market brought the bank a 36 percent
increase in mortgage lending revenue in the third quarter and
made up for the drag of weak demand from borrowers. In fact, a
$993 million increase in total mortgage fees neatly offset an
$831 million decrease in net interest income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect mortgage lending volume to continue to rise
after the Federal Reserve said in September that it would buy up
to $40 billion of mortgage bonds every month until the labor
market improved materially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That announcement from the Fed has lowered mortgage rates.
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications for
home loans jumped 16.6 percent in the week ended Sept. 28 from
the week before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co also benefited from the mortgage
bonanza, posting a 22 percent increase in third-quarter profit
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investors and analysts were concerned that JPMorgan's
profitability of loans, known as its "net interest margin,"
contracted. The bank's stock fell as much as 1.8 percent during
the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The margin compression worries investors about what that
means for future earnings," said analyst Marty Mosby of
Guggenheim Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said the difference between its cost of funds and
yield on assets fell to 2.43 percent from 2.47 percent in the
second quarter and 2.66 percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORTGAGE MARGINS DOUBLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's profit margins on mortgages that it sells to
investors, in contrast, is currently double the normal level,
Dimon noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts asked the CEO whether the mortgage refinancing wave
will last until the economy strengthens enough to lift lending
profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't expect to count on high margins and mortgage
origination forever," Dimon said. The refinancing trend, he
added, will continue "next quarter, maybe for a couple of
quarters after that, but it won't last much longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said he is not sure whether the latest Federal Reserve
move will drive the economy. "If the economy gets better we are
fine," Dimon said, explaining that the benefits would more than
offset a decline in refinancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's buying program did boost JPMorgan's profits in
fixed-income trading, which rose 33 percent, excluding
adjustments for changes in the value of the bank's debt. That
increase could bode well for other big investment banks due to
report results over the next week, including Goldman Sachs Group
Inc and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's third-quarter net income was $5.71 billion, or
$1.40 a share, up from $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had expected, on average, $1.24 a share, according
to surveys by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately
clear whether the analyst forecast was comparable to the
reported results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profits at JPMorgan's investment bank, excluding accounting
adjustments for changes in the value of JPMorgan debt, rose to
$1.7 billion from $1.2 billion a year earlier, when the European
debt crisis cast a darker shadow over the capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon told analysts that risk in the remaining piece of the
"London whale" derivatives portfolio was reduced by about
one-third during the quarter after its management was taken over
by the company's investment bank from its Chief Investment
Office. Another related credit derivatives portfolio which had
remained in the CIO was closed out during the quarter with a
$449 million loss, bringing the total loss associated with the
whale trades to about $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank set aside an additional $684 million, before taxes,
in the third quarter to cover legal settlements and judgments. A
year earlier, it boosted its legal reserves by $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was sued last week by the New York state attorney
general over allegations that Bear Stearns, salvaged by the bank
in a 2008 takeover assisted by the government, had deceived
investors buying mortgage-backed securities in 2006 and 2007.
Though the allegations were similar to ones already made by
private investors in civil suits, the lawsuit raised concerns
among analysts that there are more litigation costs to come for
JPMorgan and other banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon on Wednesday said the lawsuit was "unfair" because
JPMorgan had done the Fed "a favor" by taking over a broken Bear
Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were down 1.8 percent at $41.36 on Friday
afternoon. Through Thursday the shares were up 27 percent this
year, almost twice the rise in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock
index but about three percentage points less than the KBW Bank
stock index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) investment bank set aside less revenue to pay employees last quarter, another sign that Wall Street bonuses are on the decline this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank put aside $2.07 billion for pay in the third quarter, or 32 percent of net revenue excluding a special accounting charge. That's down from 41 percent a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically JPMorgan aims to pay its bankers anywhere from 35 to 40 percent of revenue, but Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Friday that he is now targeting the low end of that range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a rule of thumb, I would think about 35 percent being a good number," Dimon said on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on to note that the investment bank's low expenses helped it posted a 40 percent pretax profit margin: "That's pretty good. If we can sustain that, I would be a very happy guy in a competitive environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratio of compensation to revenue is a closely watched metric on Wall Street, particularly in recent quarters as trading and deal-making revenue has come under pressure, and investors have demanded better returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said earlier this week that he expects cash bonuses paid to securities industry workers who live in New York City to decline this year, for the second year in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Lipstein, a managing director with the recruiting firm Gilbert Tweed International, said that after months of job cuts across Wall Street, management has a greater ability to cut workers' pay because they cannot find other jobs as easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the battle between labor and management on Wall Street, management may finally be getting the upper hand," said Lipstein. "If tons of people leave, they'll lose it. But given the environment, it's tough to imagine that they're going to walk out the door unless they feel egregiously underpaid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, the bank set aside just $269,703 for the average investment banking employee, versus $289,611 for the first nine months of 2011, a 7 percent drop. That compares with a 16 percent net revenue decline, excluding accounting charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus decisions won't be finalized til year-end and JPMorgan, which typically pays less than competitors, is not necessarily an indication of how pay across Wall Street is changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typical rule of thumb for Wall Street firms is a 50 percent compensation ratio and JPMorgan's chief competitors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), regularly pay out greater portions of revenue in compensation than JPMorgan does.

			Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 Announces Closing of Alliston Property Sale
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) and its general 
      partner, Walton Ontario Land 1 Corporation (the &#8220;General Partner&#8221;), 
      announce that the sale of the Alliston property owned by the Partnership 
      at the price of $155,199.12 per acre, being an aggregate price of 
      $24,045,000, closed on October 12, 2012. The property sale, to a 
      non-arm&#8217;s length entity is considered a &#8220;related party&#8221; under applicable 
      securities legislation, was previously approved by limited partners at 
      an extraordinary meeting held on May 1, 2012. As previously announced on 
      October 4, 2012, the board of directors of the General Partner has 
      approved a cash distribution on the limited partnership units of the 
      Partnership (the &#8220;Units&#8221;) in the amount of $6.00 per Unit. 
      Further particulars of the material change constituted by the sale 
      transaction and the distribution will be disclosed in a material change 
      report which will be filed on SEDAR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the first distribution to investors in the Partnership. Payment 
      will be made on November 15, 2012, to Unitholders of record as of the 
      close of business on October 18, 2012. Pursuant to the terms of the 
      Limited Partnership Agreement of the Partnership, immediately after the 
      distribution the Units will be consolidated so that each Unit prior to 
      the distribution will become 0.548 of a Unit after the distribution, 
      resulting in a total of 1,961,840 Units outstanding. Replacement 
      certificates will not be issued by the Partnership to reflect this 
      consolidation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each partner who is a Unitholder of record at the year-end of the 
      Partnership will receive, by mail in March of 2013, a T5013 from the 
      Partnership&#8217;s transfer agent or the Unitholder&#8217;s brokerage firm. The 
      T5013 indicates the amount and nature of the taxable income that the 
      Unitholder is responsible to report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in January 2010, the Partnership&#8217;s objective is to maximize 
      returns to limited partners through the acquisition, management, concept 
      planning, and eventual sale of two properties in Ontario; the Alliston 
      Property, now sold and which consisted of two parcels totaling 154.93 
      acres (approximately 45 percent of the net proceeds) near the Toronto 
      area in Alliston, and the Ottawa Property, which consists of 300 acres 
      (approximately 55 percent of the net proceeds) in the southwest quadrant 
      of the City of Ottawa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership will continue to own and manage the Ottawa Property, and 
      will work to maximize the returns to the limited partners in respect of 
      this asset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc., part of 
      the Walton Group.

      new home by Taylor Morrison Houston&#8217;s Amy Haywood-Rino on the steps of 
      the Innoventions Dream Home, which was developed by the Disneyland&#174; 
      Resort in collaboration with Taylor Morrison, Microsoft and HP. The 
      Dream Home Giveaway, now in its fifth year, was inspired by the 
      Innoventions Dream Home exhibit located in Disneyland&#174; Park in Anaheim.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Roberson and his wife, Gloria, found out in August that they had won the 
      2012 Dream Home Giveaway - two weeks before Mark&#8217;s unemployment benefits 
      were set to expire.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After receiving the key, the family was treated to a personal tour of 
      the Innoventions Dream Home exhibit before being welcomed to Disneyland&#174; 
      Park to experience the fun of the Park&#8217;s attractions for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s too much to be able to comprehend,&#8221; Roberson said. &#8220;This has been 
      an incredible couple of months for us. We can&#8217;t wait to see what&#8217;s next.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Next up for the Robersons will be the unveiling of their new $200,000 
      dream home in Houston in November. The couple chose the Texas community 
      to begin a new chapter in their lives together. Their new home has been 
      outfitted to their wishes and even includes Taylor Morrison&#8217;s new 
      Interactive Home&#8482; system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s terrific to see the joy this event has brought to the Roberson 
      family,&#8221; Haywood-Rino said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t wait to see their faces as they 
      walk through the front door of their dream home for the first time.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Stephanie Simon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 12 (Reuters) - It's been a turbulent period for charter
schools in the United States, with financial analysts raising
concerns about their stability and regulators in several states
shutting down schools for poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volatility has made it tough for startup schools to get
financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an unlikely source of new capital has emerged to fill
the gap: foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wealthy individuals from as far away as China, Nigeria,
Russia and Australia are spending tens of millions of dollars to
build classrooms, libraries, basketball courts and science labs
for American charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Buffalo, New York, foreign funds paid for the Health
Sciences Charter School to renovate a 19th-century orphanage
into modern classrooms and computer labs. In Florence, Arizona,
overseas investment is expected to finance a sixth campus for
the booming chain of American Leadership Academy charter
schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in Florida, state business development officials say
foreign investment in charter schools is poised to triple next
year, to $90 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason? Under a federal program known as EB-5, wealthy
foreigners can in effect buy U.S. immigration visas for
themselves and their families by investing at least $500,000 in
certain development projects. In the past two decades, much of
the investment has gone into commercial real-estate projects,
like luxury hotels, ski resorts and even gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, however, enterprising brokers have seen a golden
opportunity to match cash-starved charter schools with
cash-flush foreigners in investment deals that benefit both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The demand is massive - massive - on the school side," said
Greg Wing, an investment advisor. "On the investor side, it's
massive, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Wing set up a venture called the Education
Fund of America specifically to connect international investors
with charter schools. He is currently arranging EB-5 funding for
11 schools across North Carolina, Utah and Arizona and says he
has four more deals in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's just the start, Wing says: "It's going to be
explosive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CREDIT CRUNCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charter school movement is somewhat controversial.
Critics - led by teachers' unions - contend they divert
much-needed funds from traditional public schools. Still, they
have proved quite popular and now educate more than 2 million
children in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter schools are publicly funded but privately run,
sometimes by for-profit companies. They receive taxpayer dollars
to educate each child who enrolls. Yet in most states, they get
little or no public money to build classrooms, libraries and
other facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-established and successful chains of charter schools,
such as KIPP, Green Dot or Achievement First, receive hefty
support from philanthropic foundations and private donors. The
chains can also tap into financing provided by an array of
for-profit and non-profit investment funds created for that
purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the charter school movement also includes hundreds of
small, one-of-a-kind schools, often started by parents seeking a
different educational environment for their children. Those
mom-and-pop startups have always had a hard time securing
funding to build their schools. Many have had to make do with
makeshift classrooms in strip malls or church basements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lately, experts say, the credit crunch has worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a hard go," said Eric Hall, an attorney in Colorado
Springs who advises charter school boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Fitch Ratings warned it was likely to downgrade
bonds backed by charter schools because the sector is volatile
and the schools are highly leveraged. Such risks mean
charter-school debt is typically considered speculative, rather
than investment grade, said Eric Kim, a director at Fitch
Ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the IRS has signaled it plans closer scrutiny of 
charter schools' tax-exempt status if they rely on for-profit
management companies to provide their classroom space and run
their academic programs, Hall said. He sent his clients a long
memo this summer warning that the stepped-up IRS oversight could
put some at "significant risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that weren't enough to make investors wary, several
well-known charter schools have run into significant legal and
fiscal hurdles in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missouri regulators shut down six campuses run by Imagine
Schools, one of the nation's largest for-profit charter chains,
because of poor academic performance. A judge in California
ruled that Aspire Public Schools, a large non-profit chain,
hadn't secured the proper approval for six of its schools and
would have to get permission from local boards of education to
continue running them. Local officials yanked the charter of a
high-achieving middle school in Georgia over concerns about
mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, about 15 percent of the 6,700 charter schools that
have been launched in the United States in the past two decades
have since closed, primarily because of financial troubles,
according to the Center for Education Reform, which supports
charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fall alone, more than 150 established charter schools
didn't open their doors to students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such volatility "will spook people, no doubt about it," said
David Brain, chief executive officer of Entertainment Properties
Trust, which has historically owned movie theaters but branched
out to invest in charter schools, including the six that were
shuttered in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain said the closures did not affect his company's bottom
line and he remains convinced charter schools are a profitable
sector. But even he's not ready to start backing untested
startup schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter school administrators say they know that wariness
all too well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until you get that charter renewal that says you're doing
good things" - typically after five years in operation - "banks
won't even talk to you," said Hank Stopinski, principal of the
Health Sciences Charter School in Buffalo. Without foreign
investment, he said, "we would not have been able to do this
project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECESSION-PROOF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EB-5 program has drawn sharp criticism in the past. Some
immigrant investors have lost both their money and their shot at
U.S. citizenship when their American partners proved inept or
corrupt. In the United States, critics have questioned the value
of trading visas for scattershot investment. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet interest is surging. In the first nine months of this
year, the government approved 3,000 petitions from foreigners
seeking to participate in the program - nearly twice as many as
were approved all last year, according to the Department of
Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter schools have become particularly trendy because they
are pitched as recession-proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investor forum in China last spring, for instance, touted
U.S. charter schools as a nearly fool-proof investment because
they can count on a steady stream of government funding to stay
afloat, according to a transcript posted on a Chinese website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona educator Holly Johnson, who runs three charter
schools and plans to open a fourth next year, said she couldn't
believe how easy it was to secure $4.5 million in funding from
abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't have to do anything at all," she said, other than
open her schools to potential investors. They didn't ask many
questions, she said. Their concern was more basic: "They wanted
to come over and make sure it was real."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INNER SATISFACTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eager to join the rush, Ali Faisal devoted a day this week
to touring charter schools in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal, 37, is a Pakistani citizen who now lives in Calgary,
Canada. He runs a technology consulting business that works with
oil and gas companies and says he is eager to expand to the
United States. He figures the best way to do that is to get a
green card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the best way to do that, he said, is the EB-5 program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants can get a temporary visa by investing $500,000
to $1 million in a federally approved business. If the business
creates or preserves at least 10 jobs in two years, the investor
and his immediate family are eligible for permanent residency in
the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a much easier path," Faisal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He decided to put his money in a charter school, he said,
because that way he felt he'd be serving society as well as
helping himself. The schools he saw impressed him with their
rigorous science curriculum and he said he hoped his investment
would help nurture a new generation of American entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investing in some type of hotel," Faisal said, "will not
give me that inner satisfaction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's interior minister called on Friday for the suspension of visa-free travel for Serbs and Macedonians to the European Union following a surge in asylum applications from citizens of the two Balkan countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serbs and Macedonians accounted for nearly a third of all applications for political asylum in Germany last month, official data showed, though both former Yugoslav republics are candidates to join the European Union and are thus required to uphold its values and freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illegal immigration and asylum are likely to prove sensitive issues for German politicians in the countdown to federal elections next autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The increasing abuse of the asylum system is not acceptable ... The huge inflow of Serbian and Macedonian citizens must be stopped immediately," Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top-selling Bild daily quoted Friedrich as saying: "Visa-free travel must not lead to abuse of the asylum rules. This will strain the readiness of Germans to help the truly needy and persecuted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of Serb asylum applicants in Germany rose threefold in September from the previous month while Macedonian requests jumped 70 percent, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitors from Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro won the right to visa-free travel in the European Union's border-free Schengen zone in 2009. Citizens of Bosnia and Albania followed suit in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last year the European Union agreed new rules to make it easier to restore visa requirements, to counter fears of a sudden influx of migrants from the western Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bloc's Council of Ministers and the European Parliament have still to approve those rules, which envisage a temporary suspension of visa-free arrangements for countries whose citizens are deemed to be abusing the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may take up to six more months to get a final agreement," an EU official in Brussels told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, a lawmaker from Germany's main opposition Social Democrats, Michael Hartmann, urged the authorities to reject bogus asylum applications more swiftly and to focus resources on genuine cases from countries such as Syria and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany receives about 144,000 requests for political asylum per year, down from a peak of 500,000 in 1996, Hartmann said. Germany took in large numbers of refugees from the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Gareth Jones; Editing by Pravin Char)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, made headlines this week for an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations in which he said that buying Bear Stearns in March, 2008 was a &#8220;favor&#8221; to the Federal Reserve, and that JPMorgan had lost money on the deal. But there was another part of his interview where he talked about lending to states that caught my attention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIMON: OK, so  (laughs)  this company, JP Morgan and Chase  (inaudible)  went through 06, 07, 08, 09, 2010, 2011, 2012, never lost money in a quarter, didnt need TARP and was there for a lot of people when others werent. California, New Jersey, Illinois, hospitals, schools, businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that Mr. Dimon is inferring that California, New Jersey and Illinois, which have had severe cash flow problems, had had to rely on JPMorgan to tide them over until they completed their next bond offerings. I remember all these financings; there was very little data available about the borrowing costs and terms. Although these loans are for public entities, the current MSRB rules exempt bank loans from disclosure. This is mind-bending when you consider that JPMorgan&#8217;s purchase of Bear Stearns required voluminous public disclosure to protect shareholders. There are no such rules to protect taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that JPMorgan did exceptionally well when it helped finance a bridge loan for California in October, 2010. Bloomberg reported the details (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;California used a $6.7 billion bridge loan from JPMorgan Chase  Co. and five other banks in October, when a record 100-day budget impasse prevented Lockyer from issuing RANs. The notes are commonly used for cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California paid 1.4 percent on the October loan, which was repaid when the bulk of taxes were collected later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;California borrowed for a very short period, less than one year, and paid 1.4 percent interest to JPMorgan and the other lenders. At the same time, California&#8217;s short term bonds were trading at 0.68 percent for one year paper, according to Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data. The loan cost California about $4 million more than the bond market rates to borrow for one month. It&#8217;s hard to see how JPMorgan and the other lenders were doing California any favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, in fact, another option for short-term borrowing that could save California, Illinois, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and other states in interest costs. The Federal Reserve open market operations offer short-term borrowing. This borrowing access for states is already codified in the law, Federal Reserve Section 14 (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To buy and sell, at home or abroad, bonds and notes of the United States and bills, notes, revenue bonds, and warrants with a maturity from date of purchase of not exceeding six months, issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes or in anticipation of the receipt of assured revenues by any State, county, district, political subdivision, or municipality in the continental United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must be easier for a state treasurer to call JPMorgan and secure execution of a multi-billion dollar loan in a of couple days. But that convenience costs taxpayers a lot of money. It also provides less transparency for taxpayers than if it was done through the Federal Reserve. The cash flow needs of states will keep short-term borrowing around for some time. As interest rates increase, states shouldn&#8217;t rely on Jamie Dimon&#8217;s bank to cover their short falls. The Federal Reserve is, after all, the lender of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

advanced on Friday, indicating the S 500 may crimp its worst
weekly decline since early June, following a robust earnings
report from JP Morgan and ahead of data on consumer confidence
and inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co rose 1.4 percent to $42.68 in
premarket trading after reporting a 34 percent jump in
third-quarter profits as the largest U.S. bank made more home
mortgage loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Wells Fargo &amp; Co lost 1.8 percent to $34.55 in
premarket trading after reporting its third-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earnings of both banks will be scrutinized for insight
on the health of the financial sector and the economy as a
whole. Both had been forecast to benefit significantly from a
home loan refinancing boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The banks are a huge part of what is going on - they have
been trading below tangible book value, which means people don't
believe what is on their books, so any time we get information
on them, that could be a driver for the market," said Kim
Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group
in Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So people are going to be analyzing the results from JP
Morgan and trying to figure out if things in the economy are
getting better or staying the same."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark S index has shed 1.9 percent so far this
week, putting it on track for its worse weekly performance since
a 3-percent drop in the week through June 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weak global demand has heightened investor worry over the
corporate earnings season. As a group, S 500 companies'
third-quarter earnings are expected to fall 3 percent from a
year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data, marking the first
decline in three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic data is due, in the form of the September producer
price index at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) and the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers preliminary
consumer sentiment index for October at 9:55 a.m. (1355 ET).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producer prices are expected to show a 0.7 percent rise
compared with a 1.7 percent rise in August. Economists in a
Reuters survey expect a consumer sentiment reading of 78.0
compared with 78.3 in the final September report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will eye the PPI data for any signs of inflation

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct 12 - Coca-Cola Hellenic's decision to relocate from Greece 
to Switzerland, and the recent relocation by fellow Greek corporate FAGE, are 
limited precedents for other eurozone corporates for now, despite incentives to 
reduce share price discounts or protect against the risk of a full-blown 
sovereign crisis, Fitch Ratings says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redomiciling, as opposed to simply seeking listings on foreign exchanges, could 
mitigate the impact of a euro exit for issuers with substantial offshore 
operations and cash flow. This is the case for Coca-Cola Hellenic, which has 
operations in 28 countries and is seeking a premium listing in London as well as 
relocating to Switzerland, to reflect its international status and improve its 
access to capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the severity of the crisis in Greece, Coca-Cola Hellenic - which has 
in any event been a stand-out case of diversification away from its home market 
- follows a similar move by FAGE, a much smaller international dairy company. 
FAGE announced a restructuring to move ultimate ownership of subsidiaries to a 
Luxembourg parent company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the highly-stressed situation in Greece, larger blue-chip corporates, 
especially those with a significant domestic presence, would face strong 
political resistance as well as the possibility of tax crystallisations and the 
complexity of debt novation. The prospect of creeping forms of taxation in an 
austerity-inflicted country is not yet a sufficient incentive. Smaller companies 
are likely to see limited benefits to their share prices or lending conditions, 
unless, like FAGE, they can demonstrate that the majority of revenues come from 
outside their home jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect peripheral eurozone corporates, in the first instance, to focus on 
reducing capital expenditure and dividend payments, which can preserve 
standalone credit profiles by offsetting the impact of a weak economy on 
revenues. Divestments, minority stake sales, and diversifying cash holdings away 
from the domestic banking system, are also popular measures to ensure liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relocation of listings and accessing capital through subsidiaries in other 
jurisdictions were scenarios that came to the fore in Fitch's 'war game' 
exercise in August, which identified the likely responses to a hypothetical 
euro-exit crisis and the effectiveness of those responses in disentangling 
corporates from the sovereign risk of their home jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch has also reiterated its fundamentals-driven approach to rating links 
between eurozone corporate ratings and their respective sovereigns, which leads 
to significant levels of independence between ratings actions on each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both reports are available from www.fitchratings.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - It's been a turbulent period for charter schools in the United States, with financial analysts raising concerns about their stability and regulators in several states shutting down schools for poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volatility has made it tough for startup schools to get financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an unlikely source of new capital has emerged to fill the gap: foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wealthy individuals from as far away as China, Nigeria, Russia and Australia are spending tens of millions of dollars to build classrooms, libraries, basketball courts and science labs for American charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Buffalo, New York, foreign funds paid for the Health Sciences Charter School to renovate a 19th-century orphanage into modern classrooms and computer labs. In Florence, Arizona, overseas investment is expected to finance a sixth campus for the booming chain of American Leadership Academy charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in Florida, state business development officials say foreign investment in charter schools is poised to triple next year, to $90 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason? Under a federal program known as EB-5, wealthy foreigners can in effect buy U.S. immigration visas for themselves and their families by investing at least $500,000 in certain development projects. In the past two decades, much of the investment has gone into commercial real-estate projects, like luxury hotels, ski resorts and even gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, however, enterprising brokers have seen a golden opportunity to match cash-starved charter schools with cash-flush foreigners in investment deals that benefit both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The demand is massive - massive - on the school side," said Greg Wing, an investment advisor. "On the investor side, it's massive, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Wing set up a venture called the Education Fund of America specifically to connect international investors with charter schools. He is currently arranging EB-5 funding for 11 schools across North Carolina, Utah and Arizona and says he has four more deals in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's just the start, Wing says: "It's going to be explosive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CREDIT CRUNCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charter school movement is somewhat controversial. Critics - led by teachers' unions - contend they divert much-needed funds from traditional public schools. Still, they have proved quite popular and now educate more than 2 million children in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter schools are publicly funded but privately run, sometimes by for-profit companies. They receive taxpayer dollars to educate each child who enrolls. Yet in most states, they get little or no public money to build classrooms, libraries and other facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-established and successful chains of charter schools, such as KIPP, Green Dot or Achievement First, receive hefty support from philanthropic foundations and private donors. The chains can also tap into financing provided by an array of for-profit and non-profit investment funds created for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the charter school movement also includes hundreds of small, one-of-a-kind schools, often started by parents seeking a different educational environment for their children. Those mom-and-pop startups have always had a hard time securing funding to build their schools. Many have had to make do with makeshift classrooms in strip malls or church basements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lately, experts say, the credit crunch has worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a hard go," said Eric Hall, an attorney in Colorado Springs who advises charter school boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Fitch Ratings warned it was likely to downgrade bonds backed by charter schools because the sector is volatile and the schools are highly leveraged. Such risks mean charter-school debt is typically considered speculative, rather than investment grade, said Eric Kim, a director at Fitch Ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the IRS has signaled it plans closer scrutiny of charter schools' tax-exempt status if they rely on for-profit management companies to provide their classroom space and run their academic programs, Hall said. He sent his clients a long memo this summer warning that the stepped-up IRS oversight could put some at "significant risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that weren't enough to make investors wary, several well-known charter schools have run into significant legal and fiscal hurdles in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missouri regulators shut down six campuses run by Imagine Schools, one of the nation's largest for-profit charter chains, because of poor academic performance. A judge in California ruled that Aspire Public Schools, a large non-profit chain, hadn't secured the proper approval for six of its schools and would have to get permission from local boards of education to continue running them. Local officials yanked the charter of a high-achieving middle school in Georgia over concerns about mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, about 15 percent of the 6,700 charter schools that have been launched in the United States in the past two decades have since closed, primarily because of financial troubles, according to the Center for Education Reform, which supports charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fall alone, more than 150 established charter schools didn't open their doors to students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such volatility "will spook people, no doubt about it," said David Brain, chief executive officer of Entertainment Properties Trust, which has historically owned movie theaters but branched out to invest in charter schools, including the six that were shuttered in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain said the closures did not affect his company's bottom line and he remains convinced charter schools are a profitable sector. But even he's not ready to start backing untested startup schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter school administrators say they know that wariness all too well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until you get that charter renewal that says you're doing good things" - typically after five years in operation - "banks won't even talk to you," said Hank Stopinski, principal of the Health Sciences Charter School in Buffalo. Without foreign investment, he said, "we would not have been able to do this project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECESSION-PROOF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EB-5 program has drawn sharp criticism in the past. Some immigrant investors have lost both their money and their shot at U.S. citizenship when their American partners proved inept or corrupt. In the United States, critics have questioned the value of trading visas for scattershot investment. (link.reuters.com/cem33t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet interest is surging. In the first nine months of this year, the government approved 3,000 petitions from foreigners seeking to participate in the program - nearly twice as many as were approved all last year, according to the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter schools have become particularly trendy because they are pitched as recession-proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investor forum in China last spring, for instance, touted U.S. charter schools as a nearly fool-proof investment because they can count on a steady stream of government funding to stay afloat, according to a transcript posted on a Chinese website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona educator Holly Johnson, who runs three charter schools and plans to open a fourth next year, said she couldn't believe how easy it was to secure $4.5 million in funding from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't have to do anything at all," she said, other than open her schools to potential investors. They didn't ask many questions, she said. Their concern was more basic: "They wanted to come over and make sure it was real."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INNER SATISFACTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eager to join the rush, Ali Faisal devoted a day this week to touring charter schools in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal, 37, is a Pakistani citizen who now lives in Calgary, Canada. He runs a technology consulting business that works with oil and gas companies and says he is eager to expand to the United States.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Stephanie Simon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 12 (Reuters) - It's been a turbulent period for charter
schools in the United States, with financial analysts raising
concerns about their stability and regulators in several states
shutting down schools for poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volatility has made it tough for startup schools to get
financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an unlikely source of new capital has emerged to fill
the gap: foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wealthy individuals from as far away as China, Nigeria,
Russia and Australia are spending tens of millions of dollars to
build classrooms, libraries, basketball courts and science labs
for American charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Buffalo, New York, foreign funds paid for the Health
Sciences Charter School to renovate a 19th-century orphanage
into modern classrooms and computer labs. In Florence, Arizona,
overseas investment is expected to finance a sixth campus for
the booming chain of American Leadership Academy charter
schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in Florida, state business development officials say
foreign investment in charter schools is poised to triple next
year, to $90 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason? Under a federal program known as EB-5, wealthy
foreigners can in effect buy U.S. immigration visas for
themselves and their families by investing at least $500,000 in
certain development projects. In the past two decades, much of
the investment has gone into commercial real-estate projects,
like luxury hotels, ski resorts and even gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, however, enterprising brokers have seen a golden
opportunity to match cash-starved charter schools with
cash-flush foreigners in investment deals that benefit both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The demand is massive - massive - on the school side," said
Greg Wing, an investment advisor. "On the investor side, it's
massive, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Wing set up a venture called the Education
Fund of America specifically to connect international investors
with charter schools. He is currently arranging EB-5 funding for
11 schools across North Carolina, Utah and Arizona and says he
has four more deals in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's just the start, Wing says: "It's going to be
explosive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CREDIT CRUNCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charter school movement is somewhat controversial.
Critics - led by teachers' unions - contend they divert
much-needed funds from traditional public schools. Still, they
have proved quite popular and now educate more than 2 million
children in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter schools are publicly funded but privately run,
sometimes by for-profit companies. They receive taxpayer dollars
to educate each child who enrolls. Yet in most states, they get
little or no public money to build classrooms, libraries and
other facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-established and successful chains of charter schools,
such as KIPP, Green Dot or Achievement First, receive hefty
support from philanthropic foundations and private donors. The
chains can also tap into financing provided by an array of
for-profit and non-profit investment funds created for that
purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the charter school movement also includes hundreds of
small, one-of-a-kind schools, often started by parents seeking a
different educational environment for their children. Those
mom-and-pop startups have always had a hard time securing
funding to build their schools. Many have had to make do with
makeshift classrooms in strip malls or church basements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lately, experts say, the credit crunch has worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a hard go," said Eric Hall, an attorney in Colorado
Springs who advises charter school boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Fitch Ratings warned it was likely to downgrade
bonds backed by charter schools because the sector is volatile
and the schools are highly leveraged. Such risks mean
charter-school debt is typically considered speculative, rather
than investment grade, said Eric Kim, a director at Fitch
Ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the IRS has signaled it plans closer scrutiny of 
charter schools' tax-exempt status if they rely on for-profit
management companies to provide their classroom space and run
their academic programs, Hall said. He sent his clients a long
memo this summer warning that the stepped-up IRS oversight could
put some at "significant risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that weren't enough to make investors wary, several
well-known charter schools have run into significant legal and
fiscal hurdles in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missouri regulators shut down six campuses run by Imagine
Schools, one of the nation's largest for-profit charter chains,
because of poor academic performance. A judge in California
ruled that Aspire Public Schools, a large non-profit chain,
hadn't secured the proper approval for six of its schools and
would have to get permission from local boards of education to
continue running them. Local officials yanked the charter of a
high-achieving middle school in Georgia over concerns about
mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, about 15 percent of the 6,700 charter schools that
have been launched in the United States in the past two decades
have since closed, primarily because of financial troubles,
according to the Center for Education Reform, which supports
charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fall alone, more than 150 established charter schools
didn't open their doors to students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such volatility "will spook people, no doubt about it," said
David Brain, chief executive officer of Entertainment Properties
Trust, which has historically owned movie theaters but branched
out to invest in charter schools, including the six that were
shuttered in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain said the closures did not affect his company's bottom
line and he remains convinced charter schools are a profitable
sector. But even he's not ready to start backing untested
startup schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter school administrators say they know that wariness
all too well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until you get that charter renewal that says you're doing
good things" - typically after five years in operation - "banks
won't even talk to you," said Hank Stopinski, principal of the
Health Sciences Charter School in Buffalo. Without foreign
investment, he said, "we would not have been able to do this

immigrant investors have lost both their money and their shot at

corrupt. In the United States, critics have questioned the value
of trading visas for scattershot investment. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet interest is surging. In the first nine months of this
year, the government approved 3,000 petitions from foreigners
seeking to participate in the program - nearly twice as many as
were approved all last year, according to the Department of
Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter schools have become particularly trendy because they
are pitched as recession-proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investor forum in China last spring, for instance, touted
U.S. charter schools as a nearly fool-proof investment because
they can count on a steady stream of government funding to stay
afloat, according to a transcript posted on a Chinese website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona educator Holly Johnson, who runs three charter

      JPMorgan&#160;Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported record net income for 
      third-quarter 2012 of $5.7 billion, compared with net income of $4.3 
      billion in the third quarter of 2011. Earnings per share were a record 
      $1.40, compared with $1.02 in the third quarter of 2011. The Firm&#8217;s 
      return on tangible common equity1 for the third quarter of 
      2012 was 16%, compared with 13% in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on 
      financial results: &#8220;The Firm reported strong performance across all our 
      businesses in the third quarter of 2012. Revenue for the quarter was 
      $25.9 billion, up 6% compared with the prior year, or 16% before the 
      impact of DVA. These results reflected continued momentum in all our 
      businesses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon continued: &#8220;The Investment Bank reported favorable Fixed Income 
      Markets results and maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment 
      Banking fees. Consumer  Business Banking average deposits were up 9% 
      and Business Banking loan balances grew for the eighth consecutive 
      quarter to a record $19 billion, up 8% compared with the prior year. 
      Mortgage Banking originations were $47 billion, up 29% compared with the 
      prior year. Credit Card sales volume1 was up 11% compared 
      with the prior year. Commercial Banking reported record revenue and grew 
      loan balances for the ninth consecutive quarter to a record $124 
      billion, up 15% compared with the prior year. Treasury  Securities 
      Services assets under custody rose to a record $18.2 trillion, up 12% 
      compared with the prior year. Asset Management reported positive net 
      long-term product flows for the fourteenth consecutive quarter and 
      record loan balances of $75 billion.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon commented: &#8220;Importantly, we believe the housing market has turned 
      the corner. In our Mortgage Banking business, we were encouraged that 
      credit trends continued to modestly improve, and, as a result, the Firm 
      reduced the related loan loss reserves by $900 million. Despite this 
      improvement, the absolute level of charge-offs remains elevated. We also 
      expect to see high default-related expense for a while longer. We are 
      acting responsibly to help homeowners and prevent foreclosures, offering 
      nearly 1.4 million mortgage modifications and completing 578,000 since 
      2009. Credit trends in our credit card portfolio continued to improve, 
      and the wholesale credit environment remained stable.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The underlying strength in the Firm&#8217;s results is reflected in our 
      support for customers, corporate clients and communities around the 
      world. The Firm has provided credit and raised capital of over $1.3 
      trillion for our commercial and consumer clients during the first nine 
      months of 2012. This included more than $15 billion of credit provided 
      for U.S. small businesses, an increase of 21% compared with the same 
      period last year. This also included $52 billion of capital raised and 
      credit1 provided for more than 1,300 nonprofit and government 
      entities so far this year, including states, municipalities, hospitals 
      and universities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon added: &#8220;There were several significant items that affected our 
      results this quarter - some positively, some negatively. As we always 
      do, we discuss these significant items in detail within our disclosures."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the balance sheet, Dimon said: &#8220;We strengthened our 
      fortress balance sheet, ending the third quarter with a strong Basel I 
      Tier 1 common ratio1 of 10.4%, up from 9.9% in the second 
      quarter. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio1 
      was approximately 8.4%3 at the end of the third quarter, up 
      from 7.9% in the second quarter.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon concluded: &#8220;I am proud of the momentum we are seeing throughout 
      our businesses. The exceptional power of our franchise is evident in the 
      solid foundation of our fortress balance sheet and the tremendous 
      capacity of JPMorgan Chase to support our customers and communities 
      around the world while making significant investments for the future.&#8221;

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $1.6&#160;billion, down 4% from the prior year. These results 
      reflected higher noninterest expense and lower net revenue, largely 
      offset by a benefit from the provision for credit losses compared with a 
      provision for credit losses in the prior year. Net revenue was 
      $6.3&#160;billion, compared with $6.4&#160;billion in the prior year. Net revenue 
      included a $211 million loss from DVA on certain structured and 
      derivative liabilities resulting from the tightening of the Firm&#8217;s 
      credit spreads compared with a gain of $1.9 billion in the prior year. 
      Excluding the impact of DVA, net income was $1.7 billion1, up 
      $1.2 billion from the prior year, and net revenue was $6.5 billion1, 
      up $2.0 billion from the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investment banking fees were $1.4 billion (up 38%), which consisted of 
      debt underwriting fees of $805&#160;million (up 62%), equity underwriting 
      fees of $235&#160;million (up 32%), and advisory fees of $389&#160;million (up 
      7%). Combined Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue was $4.8 billion, 
      flat compared with the prior year. The portion of the synthetic credit 
      portfolio transferred from the Chief Investment Office in Corporate to 
      the IB on July 2, 2012 experienced a modest loss, which was included in 
      Fixed Income Markets revenue. Credit Portfolio reported net revenue of 
      $90 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Excluding the impact of DVA, Fixed Income and Equity Markets combined 
      revenue was $4.8&#160;billion1, up 24% from the prior year, 
      driven by solid client revenue and broad-based strength across the Fixed 
      Income businesses. Excluding the impact of DVA, Credit Portfolio net 
      revenue was $289 million1, driven by net interest income on 
      retained loans and fees on lending-related commitments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $48 million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses in the prior year of $54&#160;million. The 
      ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained 
      was 2.06%, compared with 2.30% in the prior year. Excluding the impact 
      of the consolidation of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits 
      effective on January 1, 2010, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses 
      to end-of-period loans retained was 3.29%1, compared with 
      3.60%1 in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $3.9 billion, up 3% from the prior year, driven 
      by higher compensation expense, partially offset by lower 
      noncompensation expense. The compensation ratio for the current quarter 
      was 32%1, excluding the impact of DVA.

      Net revenue was $8.0 billion, an increase of $478 million, or 6%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $3.9 billion, down 
      $190 million, or 5%, driven by lower deposit margins and lower loan 
      balances due to portfolio runoff, largely offset by higher deposit 
      balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.1&#160;billion, an increase of 
      $668&#160;million, or 19%, driven by higher mortgage fees and related income, 
      partially offset by lower debit card revenue.

      The provision for credit losses was $631&#160;million, compared with 
      $1.0&#160;billion in the prior year and a benefit of $555 million in the 
      prior quarter.&#160;The current-quarter provision reflected a $900 million 
      reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Current-quarter total net 
      charge-offs were $1.5 billion, including $825 million of incremental 
      charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory guidance requiring 
      loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the 
      borrower to be charged off to their collateral value and to be 
      considered nonaccrual, regardless of their delinquency status. Excluding 
      these incremental charge-offs, net charge-offs during the quarter would 
      have been $706 million compared with $1.0 billion in the prior year and 
      $795 million in the prior quarter. The prior-quarter provision reflected 
      a $1.4&#160;billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses.

      quarter. Home equity net charge-offs were $1.1&#160;billion (6.22% net

      compared with $581&#160;million (2.82% net charge-off rate1) 
      in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs would have been $91 
      million (4.13% adjusted net charge-off rate1), compared with 
      $141&#160;million (5.43% net charge-off rate1). Prime 
      mortgage, including option ARMs, net charge-offs would have been $97

      and $5.3 billion in the prior quarter. The current quarter included $1.7 
      billion of loans that were reported as nonaccrual as a result of the 
      regulatory guidance noted above. The current quarter nonaccrual loans 
      also reflected the effect of regulatory guidance implemented in the 
      first quarter of 2012 as a result of which the Firm began reporting 
      performing junior liens that are subordinate to nonaccrual senior liens 
      as nonaccrual loans. Such junior liens were $1.3 billion in the current

						Discussion of Results:Net income was $954 
            million, an increase of $105 million, or 12%, compared with the 
            prior year. The increase was driven by lower noninterest expense 
            and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower 
            net revenue.
          &lt;/p&gt;
				
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $4.7 billion, a decrease of $52 million, or 1%, from the 
      prior year. Net interest income was $3.4&#160;billion, down $78 million, or 
      2%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by narrower loan 
      spreads, lower average loan balances, and lower late fee income. These 
      decreases were largely offset by lower revenue reversals associated with 
      lower net charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $1.3 billion, an increase 
      of $26&#160;million, or 2%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by 
      higher net interchange and merchant servicing revenue, largely offset by 
      higher amortization of direct loan origination costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, compared with 
      $1.3&#160;billion in the prior year and $734&#160;million in the prior quarter. 
      The current-quarter provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a 
      small reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The prior-year 
      provision included a $370 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses. The Credit Card net charge-off rate1 was 3.57%, down 
      from 4.70% in the prior year and 4.32% in the prior quarter; and the 30+ 
      day delinquency rate1 was 2.15%, down from 2.89% in the prior 
      year and up from 2.13% in the prior quarter. The Auto net charge-off 
      rate was 0.74%, up from 0.36% in the prior year and from 0.17% in the 
      prior quarter. Regulatory guidance requiring loans discharged under 
      Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be charged 
      off to their collateral value, regardless of their delinquency status, 
      resulted in an incremental $55 million of net charge-offs. Excluding 
      these incremental charge-offs, Auto net charge-offs would have been $35 
      million for the current quarter, and the net charge-off rate would have 
      been 0.29%.

            $690&#160;million, an increase of $119&#160;million, or 21%, from the prior 
            year. The improvement was driven by an increase in net revenue and 
            lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher 
            expense.

      Net revenue was a record $1.7&#160;billion, an increase of $144 million, or 
      9%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1&#160;billion, up by 
      $82&#160;million, or 8%, driven by growth in loan and liability balances, 
      partially offset by spread compression on loan products. Noninterest 
      revenue was $586&#160;million, up $62 million, or 12%, compared with the 
      prior year, primarily driven by higher investment banking revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $838 million, an increase of $47 
      million, or 6%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term

      from Corporate Client Banking was $370&#160;million, an increase of $64 
      million, or 21%, from the prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking 
      was $106 million, an increase of $2 million, or 2%, from the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $16 million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $67&#160;million in the prior year. 
      There were net recoveries of $18 million in the current quarter (0.06% 
      net recovery rate), compared with net charge-offs of $17&#160;million (0.06% 
      net charge-off rate) in the prior year and net recoveries of $9&#160;million 
      (0.03% net recovery rate) in the prior quarter. The allowance for loan 
      losses to period-end loans retained was 2.15%, down from 2.50% in the 
      prior year and 2.20% in the prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans were 
      $876&#160;million, down by $567&#160;million, or 39%, from the prior year, due to 
      commercial real estate repayments and loan sales, and down by $41 
      million, or 4%, from the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $601&#160;million, an increase of $28&#160;million, or 5%, 
      from the prior year, reflecting higher headcount-related2 
      expense.

      an increase of $95 million, or 10%. The increase was driven by higher

      Private Equity reported a net loss of $89 million, compared with a net 
      loss of $347 million in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $135 
      million, compared with a loss of $546 million in the prior year, due to 
      lower net valuation losses on both private and public investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Treasury and CIO reported net income of $369 million, compared with a 
      net loss of $94 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $713 million, 
      compared with net revenue of $102 million in the prior year. The current 
      quarter revenue reflected $888 million of pretax extinguishment gains 
      related to the redemption of trust preferred capital debt securities. 
      The extinguishment gains were related to adjustments applied to the cost 
      basis of the trust preferred capital debt securities during the period 
      they were in a qualified hedge accounting relationship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter, the CIO effectively closed out the index 
      credit derivative positions that were retained following the transfer of 
      the synthetic credit portfolio to the IB on July 2, 2012. Principal 
      transactions in CIO included $449 million of losses on this portfolio 
      reflecting credit spread tightening during the quarter. Net revenue also 
      included securities gains of $459 million from sales of 
      available-for-sale investment securities during the current quarter. Net 
      interest income was negative, reflecting the impact of lower portfolio 
      yields and higher deposit balances across the Firm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other Corporate reported a net loss of $59 million, compared with a net 
      loss of $204 million in the prior year. The current quarter included 
      pretax expense of $684 million for additional litigation reserves, 
      largely offset by other items, including tax adjustments. The prior year 
      included pretax expense of $1.0 billion for additional litigation 
      reserves.

      (*) Presented on a managed basis. See notes on page 14 for further

      $25,146&#160;million, $22,180 million, and $23,763 million for the third 
      quarter of 2012, second quarter of 2012, and third quarter of 2011, 
      respectively.

						Discussion of Results:Net income was $5.7 
            billion, up $1.4 billion, or 34%, from the prior year. The 
            increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, lower 
            provision for credit losses and lower noninterest expense.
          &lt;/p&gt;
				
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $25.9 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 6%, compared with the 
      prior year. Noninterest revenue was $14.7 billion, up $2.3 billion, or 
      18%, from the prior year, due to higher mortgage fees and related 
      income, higher principal transactions and higher investment banking 
      fees. The current quarter revenue reflected $888 million of pretax 
      extinguishment gains related to the redemption of trust preferred 
      capital debt securities. The extinguishment gains were related to 
      adjustments applied to the cost basis of the trust preferred capital 
      debt securities during the period they were in a qualified hedge 
      accounting relationship. Net interest income was $11.2 billion, down 
      $774&#160;million, or 6%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact 
      of low interest rates, as well as lower average trading balances, faster 
      mortgage-backed securities repayments, limited reinvestment 
      opportunities and the runoff of higher-yielding loans, partially offset 
      by lower deposit costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $1.8 billion, down $622 million, or 
      26%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses 
      was $1.9 billion, down $432 million from the prior year. The decrease in 
      the consumer provision reflected a $900 million reduction of the 
      allowance for loan losses related to the mortgage portfolio due to 
      improved delinquency trends and lower estimated losses. Consumer net 
      charge-offs1 were $2.8 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in 
      the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 3.10% and 2.84%, 
      respectively. The increase in consumer net charge-offs was primarily due 
      to incremental charge-offs of $825 million for certain residential loans 
      reported in accordance with regulatory guidance requiring loans 
      discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower 
      to be charged off to their collateral value and to be considered 
      nonaccrual, regardless of their delinquency status. The wholesale 
      provision for credit losses was a benefit of $63 million compared with 
      an expense of $127 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recoveries 
      were $34 million, compared with net recoveries of $151 million in the 
      prior year, resulting in net recovery rates of 0.05% and 0.24%, 
      respectively. The Firm&#8217;s allowance for loan losses to end-of-period 
      loans retained1 was 2.61%, compared with 3.74% in the prior 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Firm&#8217;s nonperforming assets totaled $12.5&#160;billion at September 30, 
      2012, up from the prior-quarter level of $11.4 billion and flat compared 
      with the prior-year level of $12.5 billion. Before the impact of the 
      reporting changes noted below, nonperforming assets would have been $9.5 
      billion for the third quarter, down from $9.9 billion in the prior 
      quarter and $12.5 billion in the prior year. The current quarter 
      included $1.7 billion of loans which were reported as nonaccrual in 
      accordance with the regulatory guidance noted above. The current quarter 
      nonaccrual loans also reflected the effect of regulatory guidance 
      implemented in the first quarter of 2012 as a result of which the Firm 
      began reporting performing junior liens that are subordinate to senior 
      liens that are 90 days or more past due, as nonaccrual loans. Such 
      junior liens were $1.3 billion in the current quarter and $1.5 billion 
      in the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Noninterest expense was $15.4 billion, down $163 million, or 1%,

            In addition to analyzing the Firm&#8217;s results on a reported basis, 
            management reviews the Firm&#8217;s results and the results of the lines 
            of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP financial 
            measure. The Firm&#8217;s definition of managed basis starts with the 
            reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications 
            to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the 
            business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. 
            Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments 
            that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a 
            basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This 
            non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the 
            comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
            sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt 
            items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments 
            have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or 
            by the lines of business.

            The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans 
            excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and 
            loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans; and 
            the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, 
            Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of 
            PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI 
            portfolio totaled $5.7 billion, $5.7 billion and $4.9&#160;billion at

            Tangible common equity (&#8220;TCE&#8221;) represents common stockholders&#8217; 
            equity (i.e., total stockholders&#8217; equity less preferred stock) 
            less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than 
            MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible 
            common equity measures the Firm&#8217;s earnings as a percentage of TCE.

            equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers.

            The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided 
            by Basel I risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined 
            as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form 
            of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, 
            noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred 
            capital debt securities. Tier 1 common capital, a non-GAAP 
            financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and 
            analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the 
            Firm&#8217;s capital with the capital of other financial services 
            companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital along with other 
            capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On 
            December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued its final version of 
            the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; In 
            June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published final rules 
            on Basel 2.5 that will go into effect on January 1, 2013 and 
            result in additional capital requirements for trading positions 
            and securitizations. Also, in June 2012, the U.S. federal banking 
            agencies published for comment a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
            (the &#8220;NPR&#8221;) for implementing Basel III, in the United States. The 
            Firm&#8217;s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is a 
            non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firm&#8217;s current 
            understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such 
            rules to its businesses as currently conducted based on 
            information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. 
            federal banking agencies, and therefore excludes the impact of any 
            changes the Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a 
            result of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firm&#8217;s estimates 
            of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the 
            Firm&#8217;s businesses change, and as a result of further rule-making 
            on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. 
            Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the 
            Firm&#8217;s capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios 
            under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, 
            investors and analysts to compare the Firm&#8217;s capital under the 
            Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by 
            other financial services companies.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Oct 12 (Reuters) - Stephen Branton-Speak, the
head of metals trading at Goldman Sachs, is set to retire
after 15 years and after playing a key role in steering the 1.4
billion pound ($2.25 billion) sale of the London Metal Exchange,
sources told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Branton-Speak will step down from Goldman Sachs
at the end of the year, said the sources who have direct
knowledge of the staffing situation at the investment bank.
Branton-Speak could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His exit comes at a time when investment banks are facing
tough times with brokerage margins squeezed by electronic trade,
and fewer large scale funds interested in metals as the growth
boom in top metals consumer China fades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the 135-year old LME to Hong Kong Exchanges and
Clearing Ltd 0388.HK (HKEx) was sealed in July and is set to
complete later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Branton-Speak, Goldman is losing London-based
Managing Director Rohan Khurana who was at the bank for more
than 13 years, said the sources, who could not be identified
because they were not authorised to talk to the media. Khurana
will relocate with Macquarie to Asia, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two base metals traders, Ben Green and Liam Brown, quit
Goldman in January to join Mercuria, one of the world's top five
energy traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After joining Goldman Sachs in 1997 as a metals trader,
Branton-Speak became a managing director in 2006 and a partner
in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He presided over the creation of a physical metals trading
desk at Goldman Sachs in the aftermath of the 2008 financial
crisis, and as banks made a bid to offset the loss of income
from the forced closure of proprietary trading desks due to
stricter regulatory reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branton-Speak has been a board member of LME since 2009. He
was also on the management committee of the London Bullion
Market Association (LBMA). Prior to joining Goldman,
Branton-Speak worked as a precious metals trader with Engelhard.&lt;/p&gt;

AFSCME had wanted Goldman to split the CEO and chairman responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Goldman made some changes to its board structure, naming Jim Schiro as lead independent director and adding some new duties to that role, including an annual CEO evaluation and setting the board's meeting agendas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Blankfein, Goldman's board includes a few other directors with company ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn serves as president of the board, and Stephen Friedman, who ran Goldman as a senior partner before it became a public company, is also director.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A number of stocks were upgraded and downgraded by equities research analysts today, as reported by Analyst Ratings Network (http://bit.ly/equitybriefdaily) and Equity Brief:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs downgraded shares of Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) from a neutral rating to a sell rating. Their analysts now have a $32.00 price target on the stock. They wrote, "We see downside to both consensus revenue and EPS expectations looking forward. We are 3%/12%/14% below consensus on EPS for 2012-2014. (1) We now more firmly believe that Games and Puzzles, HAS's second-largest division at 25% of sales, is firmly in secular decline. We were previously too dismissive of this dynamic. (2) We believe Boys Toys, HAS's largest division at 40% of sales, is currently over-earning and may decline this year and next. The three largest brands in that division (Transformers, Beyblades and Nerf) are all currently declining in the US. (3) In the absence of revenue growth, we believe margin expectations may also be at risk due to de-leverage on fixed costs."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Macquarie downgraded shares of Hercules Offshore, Inc. (HERO) from an outperform rating to a neutral rating.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Lazard Capital downgraded shares of Harris (HRS) from a neutral rating to a sell rating.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Stifel Nicolaus raised its price target on shares of IBM (IBM) from $221.00 to $243.00. They have a buy rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;BGB Securities upgraded shares of IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) from a hold rating to a buy rating. BGB Securities now has a $150.00 price target on the stock, up previously from $145.00.&lt;/p&gt;

      General Electric and Deutsche Bank Collaborate to Deliver Innovative 
      Risk and Working Capital Solutions for Large Scale Projects
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Deutsche Bank and GE Aero Energy, a General Electric Company business 
      that manufactures gas turbines and other power equipment, have announced 
      their collaboration to introduce new risk management and working capital 
      solutions for complex projects in Africa, China and other emerging 
      countries. These transactions will be supported by a unique combination 
      of traditional trade finance and the more progressive financial supply 
      chain product offerings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GE Aero Energy and Deutsche Bank work together to cover GE Aero Energy&#8217;s 
      payment and documentary risk, enabling accelerated payments and hence 
      improved working capital. The transaction involves the structuring of 
      standby and documentary letters of credit, confirmations and transfers 
      of such instruments. With Deutsche Bank&#8217;s guidance, GE Aero Energy 
      prepares the shipping documents required for payment under the letters 
      of credit. Where unavoidable discrepancies in the documentary 
      presentation occur, Deutsche Bank then provides GE Aero Energy with an 
      accounts receivable purchase linked to the underlying letter of credit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stephen Veigel, Commercial Finance  Risk Leader, at GE Aero Energy, 
      said, &#8220;We are delighted to collaborate with the trade finance experts at 
      Deutsche Bank to help us bring power and light to countries throughout 
      the world. Through our relationship, we have been able to reduce payment 
      risk as well as to accelerate the long-term cash flows associated with 
      the substantial investment that is required for each GE Aero Energy 
      project.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jon Richman, Head of Trade Finance and Financial Supply Chain Americas, 
      Global Transaction Banking, Deutsche Bank, added, &#8220;Deutsche Bank is 
      pleased to partner with GE Aero Energy on this innovative approach of 
      combining traditional trade finance products with the latest financial 
      supply chain solutions to support GE Aero Energy in their effort to 
      provide energy services throughout the world. The Bank offers a complete 
      range of next generation trade finance and financial supply chain 
      solutions to allow our clients to optimize liquidity and risk 
      management.&#8221;

      successful integration with our network through ISO 20022 messaging.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are many instances where eBAM will be crucial for our clients, 
      such as when a senior manager leaves a company, or if a company goes 
      through a merger or acquisition. The traditional, paper process for 
      updating signature authorities and account structures related to these 
      activities may involve printing, signing, stuffing and mailing thousands 
      of papers to many different banks. eBAM addresses the delays and 
      inefficiencies inherent in that process, facilitating compliance with 
      various regulations. eBAM standards facilitate a closed loop process 
      that can help assure consistency of records between an organization and 
      its various banking partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The promise of true eBAM using the ISO standards has been out there for 
      a long time. With the testing and piloting going on in the market in the 
      last several years, we are happy to see J.P. Morgan offering an eBAM 
      solution in a production capacity,&#8221; said Jeanne Capachin, Research Vice 
      President, IDC Financial Insights. &#8220;The fact that it&#8217;s functional with 
      clients' existing eBAM applications will prove to be a great way for 
      customers to leverage the investments they have made in eBAM.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan executives will be on-hand to discuss eBAM during the annual Association 
      for Financial Professionals conference (booth #1121), held at the 
      Miami Beach Convention Center from October 14-17, 2012.

			Research and Markets: 2012 Report on the $325 Billion US Information 
      Technology Services Market Featuring CSC, Unisys, IBM and HP
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/rxv3px/information) 
      has announced the addition of the "Information 
      Technology Services" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US information technology (IT) services industry includes about 
      100,000 companies with combined annual revenue of about $325 billion. 
      Major companies include Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), Unisys, and 
      the technology consulting arms of IBM and Hewlett-Packard. The computer 
      facilities management segment of the industry is highly concentrated: 
      the 50 largest companies generate about 80 percent of revenue. The rest 
      of the industry is fragmented: the 50 largest companies account for 
      about 40 percent of revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide IT services spending is about $3.7 trillion annually, 
      according to Gartner. Leading exporters of computer and technology 
      services include India, the US, Israel, and China, according to the 
      World Trade Organization. Major companies based outside the US include 
      Fujitsu (Japan), T-Systems International (a subsidiary of Germany's 
      Deutsche Telekom), and Cap Gemini (France).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Competitive Landscape:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand for IT services is driven by rapid technological advances, but 
      spending for these expensive products depends on the health of the US 
      economy. The profitability of companies depends on offering technical 
      expertise, innovative services, and effective marketing. Large companies 
      have advantages in broad service offerings and global reach, which give 
      them the ability to provide outsourcing services to big corporate 
      customers. Small companies can compete effectively by specializing in 
      market niches or by partnering with larger companies that want to 
      broaden their mix of services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Products, Operations  Technology:
		&lt;/p&gt;

engage with decision makers more effectively. 

    InsideView augments the essential contact data that is included in the

			openBench Labs Testing Shows Condusiv&#8217;s Diskeeper 12 Windows 
      Acceleration Solution Dramatically Improves Storage and System 
      Performance vs Microsoft Windows Built-in Utility
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			openBench Labs evaluation shows up to 98% fewer physical I/O requests 
      on servers, data throughput up to 5X faster on workstations, server 
      throughput increased 130%, idle CPU time increased 100% with Diskeeper 
      12 vs. Microsoft Windows built-in utility for Windows 7 and Server 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Condusiv&#8482; Technologies, formerly Diskeeper Corporation, the 
      leader in high-performance software optimizing technology, people and 
      businesses, today announced the results of rigorous benchmark testing of 
      its Diskeeper&#174; 12 acceleration solution vs. Microsoft Windows 
      7 and Windows Server 2012. The testing was conducted by Westborough, 
      Massachusetts based openBench Labs, a trusted independent IT industry 
      source&#160;providing hands-on evaluation and certification of Information 
      Technology products and services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Big data, online transactions, cloud computing, and other strategic 
      business IT initiatives are creating new challenges for IT executives 
      tasked with optimizing performance and ROI. Among the dynamics yet to be 
      fully explored and measured until now is the rise in I/O requests caused 
      by file fragmentation on servers and workstations and its implications 
      for storage, operations and application performance over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      openBench Labs&#8217; results found the benefits of using Diskeeper to prevent 
      fragmentation and eliminate huge volumes of I/O requests to storage both 
      dramatic and far-reaching.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are finally getting a deep look into the hard facts on the impact of 
      the rise of I/O requests caused by file fragmentation,&#8221; said Jerry 
      Baldwin, CEO of Condusiv Technologies. &#8220;Until now, substantial CAPEX 
      hardware investment was the IT solution to improve performance and 
      capacity. Now we are able to solve this problem for a fraction of the 
      investment and most of the time, protect the customer&#8217;s existing 
      investment in CAPEX equipment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The openBench Labs&#8217; report 
      benchmarks the ability of Diskeeper and Condusiv&#8217;s IntelliWrite 
      technology to maximize I/O performance for server and desktop systems by 
      restructuring the way data gets written to disk to minimize and prevent 
      file fragmentation. All of the tests described here can be 
      easily replicated by IT professionals as they evaluate new strategies on 
      the basis of five key questions:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        How susceptible are Windows 7 and Windows Server 2012 to file 
        fragmentation?
      
			
        How does file fragmentation affect system performance and end-user 
        perception?
      
			
        How does file fragmentation affect operating conditions on physical 
        storage systems?
      
			
        Does the built-in Windows utility sufficiently remediate the effects 
        of file fragmentation over time?
      
			
        How much does preventing fragmentation help?
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report explores the issues of I/O and fragmentation from the ground 
      up, details test methodologies, and quantifies the benefit and impact of 
      employing Diskeeper 12.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;After running an intensive defragmentation process consumed over 80% of 
      a core processor, the built-in Windows 7 defragmentation utility 
      reported that all file fragmentation had been eliminated; however, when 
      we examined our system volume with Microsoft&#8217;s Sysinternals DiskView 
      utility, we discovered a storage space that was far from being 
      completely defragmented,&#8221; said Dr. Jack Fegreus, founder and Managing 
      Director of openBench Labs. &#8220;In testing the effects of file 
      fragmentation on the latest Windows server and desktop operating 
      systems, Diskeeper 12 offered significant advantages for end users by 
      maintaining optimal application performance with respect to both storage 
      and CPU resources and equally significant advantages for IT operations 
      by reducing physical I/O operations performed by storage resources, 
      which reduces power consumption.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Diskeeper 12 openBench Labs Finding Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Up to 98% fewer physical I/O requests were generated with Diskeeper 
        versus the Windows built-in defragmentation utility, which lowers 
        electric power consumption while improving I/O performance.
      
			
        Diskeeper prevented 99% of file writes from fragmenting.
      
			
        Data throughput rates increased dramatically &#8211;1.3X improvement on 
        servers and 5X on workstations, verses Window built-in defragmentation 
        utility.
      
			
        During a one-week period, no file or free space fragmentation occurred 
        on heavily utilized workstations.
      
			
        I/O performance improved across all environments using DK12.
      
			
        Storage volumes performed at fully optimized levels throughout the 
        testing.
      
			
        Idle CPU time improved by 100%
      
			
        Application throughput was maximized.
      
			
        Boot-up times improved by more than 50% versus using the Windows 
        built-in defragmentation utility.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 16 (Reuters) - Visa Inc is set to name a new chief

contender for the top job, while Elizabeth Buse, who oversees
much of Visa's operations outside of the United States, is the
internal candidate, the newspaper reported, citing people

&lt;p&gt;QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadorean plaintiffs on Tuesday said an order issued by a court in the Andean country lets them seize some $200 million worth of assets belonging to Chevron in a new legal blow to the No. 2 U.S. oil company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs from villages in the oil-rich Amazon won an $18.2 billion case against the oil giant over claims that Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, contaminated the area from 1964 to 1992. Damages were increased to $19 billion in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the assets ordered turned over are $96.3 million that Ecuador's government owes Chevron, money held in Ecuadorean bank accounts by Chevron, and licensing fees generated by the use of the company's trademarks in the country, the plaintiffs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a huge first step for the rainforest villagers on the road to collecting the entire $19 billion judgment," Pablo Fajardo, the lead lawyer for the communities, said on Tuesday, a day after the order was issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle between Chevron and the Ecuadorean plaintiffs has lasted for nearly two decades and is being fought in courts both inside and outside the Andean country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an attempt by Chevron to preemptively block enforcement efforts in the United States. Earlier this year the plaintiffs filed lawsuits in Brazil and Canada in a bid to enforce the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accuse Texaco of causing illnesses among locals by dumping drilling waste in unlined pits.

&lt;p&gt;* Chevron says it will challenge court decision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Plaintiffs hail "first step" toward collecting $19 bln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUITO Oct 16 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean plaintiffs on Tuesday
said an order issued by a court in the Andean country lets them
seize some $200 million worth of assets belonging to Chevron
 in a new legal blow to the No. 2 U.S. oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs from villages in the oil-rich Amazon won an
$18.2 billion case against the oil giant over claims that
Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, contaminated the area from
1964 to 1992. Damages were increased to $19 billion in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the assets ordered turned over are $96.3 million that
Ecuador's government owes Chevron, money held in Ecuadorean bank
accounts by Chevron, and licensing fees generated by the use of
the company's trademarks in the country, the plaintiffs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a huge first step for the rainforest villagers on
the road to collecting the entire $19 billion judgment," Pablo
Fajardo, the lead lawyer for the communities, said on Tuesday, a
day after the order was issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle between Chevron and the Ecuadorean plaintiffs has
lasted for nearly two decades and is being fought in courts both
inside and outside the Andean country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an attempt by
Chevron to preemptively block enforcement efforts in the United
States. Earlier this year the plaintiffs filed lawsuits in
Brazil and Canada in a bid to enforce the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accuse Texaco of causing illnesses among
locals by dumping drilling waste in unlined pits. Chevron denies
the accusations and says Texaco properly cleaned up all the pits
for which it was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company claims that the judgment, imposed by an
Ecuadorean court in 2011, was fraudulent and unenforceable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Craig, a spokesman for Chevron, said the company
intends to challenge the latest ruling, which was issued by a
court in the Amazon town of Lago Agrio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's order is not surprising, since the plaintiffs have
shown they are able to get any order they wish granted by the
Lago Agrio court. In the past the plaintiffs' lawyers have been

environmental groups that helped win the judgment, accusing them

arbitration panel under a trade agreement between the United
States and Ecuador. The panel is scheduled to begin hearing the
dispute in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies are watching the case closely because it may

where they operate.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, giving the S 500 its best two-day advance in a month as strong earnings from Johnson &amp; Johnson and other bellwether companies raised hopes for the rest of the U.S. reporting season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversified U.S. healthcare company Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) also increased its full-year profit outlook. Its stock rose 1.4 percent to $69.55, helping the Dow Jones industrial average register its best day since September 13, when the Federal Reserve unveiled its third round of stimulus, or quantitative easing, known as "QE3."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS.N) earnings also beat expectations, its revenue more than doubled and it raised its quarterly dividend. But it earned less money from customers' trading, and the stock lost 1 percent to $123.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's results followed upbeat earnings from Citigroup Inc (C.N) in the previous session. Shares of Citigroup jumped 1.6 percent to $37.25 on Tuesday after the surprising resignation of Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit. An S financial-sector index .GSPF rose 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports were among a flood of results from 80 S 500 companies as the third-quarter earnings season picks up the pace.

IBM closed at $211, up 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Intel Corp (INTC.O) also declined after the bell.

The world's biggest soft drinks maker reported quarterly revenue that was short of Wall Street's expectations, hurt by declines in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other earnings reports, U.S. insurer UnitedHealth reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, but it gave a cautious outlook. Its shares fell 1.1 percent to $56.88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic data showed the overall U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 0.6 percent in September as the cost of gasoline surged, posing a threat to consumers' spending power.

easing, known as "QE3."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs earnings also beat expectations, its
revenue more than doubled, and it raised its quarterly dividend.
But it earned less money from customers' trading, and the stock
lost 1 percent to $123.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's results followed upbeat earnings from Citigroup
Inc in the previous session. Shares of Citigroup jumped
1.6 percent to $37.25 on Tuesday after the surprising
resignation of Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit.
 An S financial-sector index rose 0.7
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports were among a flood of results from 80 S 500
companies as the third-quarter earnings season picks up the
pace. A spate of corporate warnings heading into the period
raised worries that slower growth in Europe and China may be
affecting corporate America more than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Financials have proven to be fairly good, and that has
given the market a second push this week, compared to declines
last week," said Mohannad Aama, managing director of Beam
Capital Management LLC in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There may be a push upwards, depending on results, but
we'll be waiting until economic indicators improve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall S 500 companies' quarterly earnings still are
expected to decline 2.3 percent from a year ago, but the
forecast does mark a slight improvement from estimates last
week, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 127.55
points, or 0.95 percent, to 13,551.78 at the close. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 Index advanced 14.79 points, or 1.03
percent, to finish at 1,454.92. The Nasdaq Composite Index
 rose 36.99 points, or 1.21 percent, to close at
3,101.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 has gained 1.8 percent in the last two days,
rebounding from last week's slide of 2.2 percent. That was the
benchmark index's worst week in four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bell, shares of International Business Machines
Corp fell 3 percent to $204.50 following the release of
its results. IBM closed at $211, up 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the regular session, Coca-Cola Co shares
slipped 0.6 percent to $37.90 after it reported a rise in
earnings. But the world's biggest soft drinks maker reported
quarterly revenue that was short of Wall Street's expectations,
hurt by declines in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of U.S. insurer UnitedHealth shed 1.1 percent to
$56.88 after its results. The company reported a
higher-than-expected quarterly profit, but it gave a cautious
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic data showed the overall U.S. Consumer Price Index
rose 0.6 percent in September as the cost of gasoline surged,
posing a threat to consumers' spending power. On the other hand,
 inflation pressures looked unlikely to derail the Federal
Reserve's ultra-easy policy path. Excluding volatile food and
energy prices, core CPI was up 0.1 percent - less than the
forecast for a gain of 0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch: Goldman's Performance in Line with Rating Assumptions
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third-quarter 2012 (3Q'12) operating results for The Goldman Sachs 
      Group, Inc. (Goldman) were generally in line with Fitch Ratings' 
      assumptions: improved operating profits in tandem with better market 
      conditions, maintenance of conservative liquidity, and solid capital 
      measures. These latest results have no rating implications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenues for the latest quarter reflected recovering market conditions 
      from a difficult 2Q'12 including: general spread tightening in fixed 
      income markets, higher equity markets, and low absolute interest rates. 
      These conditions spurred a high volume of bond issuance, growth in 
      equity-related revenues, and a rebound in fixed income market revenues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a linked-quarter basis, notable revenue growth occurred in the 
      institutional client services as well as the investing and lending 
      segments. Within institutional client services, fixed income, currency 
      and commodities (FICC) and equities both posted higher linked-quarter 
      revenues. Within FICC, areas of growth included the rates and mortgages. 
      The currency and commodities areas, however, were negatively affected by 
      low customer volumes and subdued volatility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investment and lending revenues were positively affected by 
      mark-to-market adjustments in both equity and credit-related positions. 
      The contribution from this area tends to be volatile from quarter to 
      quarter depending on moves in equity markets and credit spreads. The 
      investment banking and the investment management segments recorded 
      moderate declines, yet remained steady contributors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman continues to manage liquidity at conservative levels while 
      maintaining solid capital ratios. Management is taking a cautious 
      approach to overall risk levels as indicated by a reduction of average 
      VaR. This decline likely also reflects lower market volatility versus 
      2Q'12.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global core excess liquidity, including unencumbered, highly liquid 
      securities and cash, stood at $170 billion (18% of total assets) at 
      quarter-end, in line with the 2Q'12 level. Goldman's Tier I common ratio 
      of 13.1% was also in line with the prior quarter. Under Basel III, 
      Goldman's Tier I common ratio stood at an estimated 8.5%, up from just 
      under 8% at prior quarter end.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Intel Corp forecast fourth-quarter revenue and margins below Wall Street's expectations, as the personal computer industry weathers a shaky global economy and a persistent shift by consumers toward tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines reported revenues below analysts' targets with technology spending held back by a waning global economy, helping send its shares lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commentary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STACY RASGON, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm always amazed that they can preannounce and still beat it. Although some of it looks like it was from a tax beat -- some revenue upside, some gross margins. The Q4 guide is weak, revenue and particularly gross margins we haven't seen gross margins like that in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Q4 revenue forecast was not surprising, people have been wondering how weak that was going to be. It was fairly obvious that there aren't tons of build from Windows 8, and that was the reason for the preannouncement. I guess they're guiding up slightly on a sequential basis, typically in Q4 you do a lot more. Looks like they're taking a fair amount of underutilization and just looking at the CFO comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of capital expenditure, "they took it down for the year and that's normal. What they do in this environment is they will pull equipment off-line, and repurpose what they have for the next process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOUG FREEDMAN, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The gross margins and the earnings for next quarter are below expectations, largely on lower gross margins from under-utilization of the factory, and some pull-in of some startup costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some people will be disappointed by the fact that the datacenter business didn't perform better. There was some thought that the data centers would continue to do well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIAN MARSHALL, ANALYST, ISI GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's disappointing with a pretty big miss on the top line. Pretty much every business unit or segment was down year over year across the board, in particular systems and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They missed our gross margin assumptions. We were at 48.4 percent, they reported 48.1 percent. EPS is essentially flat year over year and they typically grow earnings double digits year over year. So all in all, pretty disappointing results from IBM."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Jennifer Saba in Los Angeles, Malathi Nayak and Poornima Gupta in San Francisco, Jim Finkle in Boston)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 16 (Reuters) - IBM reported third-quarter
revenue of $24.7 billion and net earnings of $3.9 billion as
demand for its software services and tight cost management
offset the effect of a stronger dollar on the technology and
consulting company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp, which has shifted its
focus to higher-margin software and services from tech products,
said on Tuesday that earnings per share, excluding items, were
$3.62, just beating average analysts' estimate of $3.61.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue eased 5 percent due to a negative currency impact of
almost $1 billion. Wall Street had expected a decline in revenue
by about 3 percent to $25.36 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

      IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced third-quarter 2012 diluted earnings of 
      $3.33 per share, a year-to-year increase of 4 percent, or $3.44 per 
      share, up 8 percent excluding the impact of UK pension-related charges. 
      Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $3.62 per share, compared 
      with operating diluted earnings of $3.28 per share in the third quarter 
      of 2011, an increase of 10 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third-quarter net income was $3.8 billion, flat year-to-year; or $3.9 
      billion, up 3 percent excluding the impact of UK pension-related 
      charges. Operating (non-GAAP) net income was $4.2 billion compared with 
      $4.0 billion in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 5 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues for the third quarter of 2012 of $24.7 billion were down 
      5 percent (down 2 percent, adjusting for currency) from the third 
      quarter of 2011. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by nearly 
      $1 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the third quarter, we continued to drive margin, profit and earnings 
      growth through our focus on higher-value businesses, strategic growth

      president and chief executive officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Looking ahead, we see good opportunity with a strong product lineup

      The company&#8217;s total gross profit margin was 47.4 percent in the 2012 
      third quarter compared with 46.5 percent in the 2011 third-quarter 
      period. Total operating (non-GAAP) gross profit margin was 48.1 percent 
      in the 2012 third quarter compared with 46.8 percent in the 2011 
      third-quarter period, with increases in Global Technology Services and 
      Global Business Services.

      Total expense and other income decreased 7 percent to $6.7 billion, or a 
      decrease of 9 percent to $6.5 billion, excluding $162 million for UK 
      pension-related charges, compared with the prior-year period. S,GA 
      expense of $5.9 billion increased 4 percent year over year, or expense 
      of $5.7 billion, up 1 percent excluding the impact of UK pension-related 
      charges. S,GA expense includes $408 million for workforce rebalancing, 
      which negatively impacted net income by approximately $310 million. 
      R,DE expense of $1.5 billion decreased 1 percent compared with the 
      year-ago period. Intellectual property and custom development income 
      increased to $303 million compared with $298 million a year ago. Other 
      (income) and expense was income of $606 million compared with prior-year 
      expense of $128 million. This increase in income was primarily due to a 
      $447 million gain from the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions, which 
      contributed approximately $280 million to net income. Interest expense 
      increased to $124 million compared with $107 million in the prior year.

      Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other income decreased 10 percent 
      to $6.4 billion compared with the prior-year period. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) S,GA expense of $5.6 billion increased 1 percent compared 
      with prior-year expense. Operating (non-GAAP) R,DE expense of $1.5

      Debt, including Global Financing, totaled $33.7 billion, compared with 
      $31.3 billion at year-end 2011. From a management segment view, Global 
      Financing debt totaled $23.3 billion versus $23.3 billion at year-end 
      2011, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 7.1 to 1. Non-global 
      financing debt totaled $10.3 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion since 
      year-end 2011, resulting in a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 36.0 
      percent from 32.0 percent.

      IBM ended the third-quarter 2012 with $12.3 billion of cash on hand and 
      generated free cash flow of $3.1 billion, excluding Global Financing 
      receivables, down approximately $0.3 billion year over year. The company 
      returned $4.0 billion to shareholders through $1.0 billion in dividends 
      and $3.0 billion of share repurchases. The balance sheet remains strong,

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc took less risk and earned less money from customers' trading last quarter, even as the Wall Street bank reaped big gains from the rising values of its stock and bond investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank's executives struck a cautious tone on a conference call with analysts, saying that events such as the U.S. presidential election and the European debt crisis will continue to weigh on earnings in the coming quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is still so much political uncertainty out there that is driving markets, both for our clients and for us," said outgoing Chief Financial Officer David Viniar. "And in that environment, it is very hard to have conviction and very hard to take risk, both for our clients and for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's average daily value at risk - which represents how much money the investment bank could potentially lose in a day - dropped to $81 million, the lowest level in roughly six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its return-on-equity, a key measure of how much profit a company can wring from its balance sheet, also remained low at 8.6 percent. That's below the 15 percent level that shareholders generally expect investment banks to earn in better times and far below the 30 percent or more Goldman posted just before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ROE's kind of skimpy, but that goes along with high capital and some softness in the business," said Regency Wealth Management portfolio manager Andrew Aran, who owns Goldman shares for clients. "It's going to be impossible to go back to 15 percent in this environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, Goldman earned $1.5 billion, or $2.85 per share, in the third quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $428 million, or 84 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last quarter included a charge to reflect the rising value of Goldman's own debt, which reduced earnings by $370 million. The third quarter of 2011 included the cost of buying back preferred stock from Warren Buffett, as well as losses on Goldman's stock and bond holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected the bank to earn $2.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's biggest business, trading, reported a 3 percent increase in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sizeable portion of that trading gain was at the expense of Knight Capital Group, which nearly went bankrupt in August after losing $440 million because of trading glitch. Goldman bought a lot of the stocks that Knight had inadvertently acquired, at a steep discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from commissions and fees dropped 29 percent. What little client-driven trading took place was mostly lower fee products like stock and bond indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking revenue jumped 49 percent from a very weak period a year ago, but the backlog of deals dropped slightly from the previous period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An uncertain economic outlook "has weighed on the psychology of corporate leaders and investors," making them more hesitant to pull the trigger on deals, Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one bright spot of Goldman's earnings was its investing and lending division, which consists of stocks and bonds that Goldman holds as investments.

"People are just kind of waiting for Goldman Sachs and other investment banks to start being positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares rose 0.3 percent to $124.89 in afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it would lift its dividend for the second time in a year, which is unusual because Goldman has historically preferred to use capital to invest in businesses, or buy back shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman will now pay shareholders 50 cents per share in dividends each quarter, up from 46 cents. Viniar did not rule out further dividend hikes in the future. He said much more of the bank's capital planning will revolve around share repurchases going forward. Goldman spent $1.25 billion buying back stock during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar also said that the bank has already finished most of a cost-saving program that aims to reduce annual expenses by $1.9 billion, by cutting staff and other non-compensation expenses. In fact, Goldman added 300 employees last quarter and paid out 44 percent of revenue in compensation, consistent with its payout ratio in the previous two quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has set aside $10.97 billion for compensation so far this year, a 10 percent increase from a year ago. That equates to $336,442 per employee, up 15 percent from $292,836 per worker during the first nine months of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by John Wallace, Lisa Von Ahn, Matthew Goldstein and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

    By Lauren Tara LaCapra
    Oct 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc took less
risk and earned less money from customers' trading last quarter,
even as the Wall Street bank reaped big gains from the rising
values of its stock and bond investments.
    The bank's executives struck a cautious tone on a conference
call with analysts, saying that events such as the U.S.
presidential election and the European debt crisis will continue
to weigh on earnings in the coming quarters.
    "There is still so much political uncertainty out there that
is driving markets, both for our clients and for us," said
outgoing Chief Financial Officer David Viniar. "And in that
environment, it is very hard to have conviction and very hard to
take risk, both for our clients and for us."
    Goldman's average daily value at risk - which represents how
much money the investment bank could potentially lose in a day -
dropped to $81 million, the lowest level in roughly six years.
    Its return-on-equity, a key measure of how much profit a
company can wring from its balance sheet, also remained low at
8.6 percent. That's below the 15 percent level that shareholders
generally expect investment banks to earn in better times and
far below the 30 percent or more Goldman posted just before the
financial crisis.
    "ROE's kind of skimpy, but that goes along with high capital
and some softness in the business," said Regency Wealth
Management portfolio manager Andrew Aran, who owns Goldman
shares for clients. "It's going to be impossible to go back to
15 percent in this environment."
    
    All told, Goldman earned $1.5 billion, or $2.85 per share,
in the third quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $428
million, or 84 cents per share.
    Last quarter included a charge to reflect the rising value
of Goldman's own debt, which reduced earnings by $370 million.
The third quarter of 2011 included the cost of buying back
preferred stock from Warren Buffett, as well as losses on
Goldman's stock and bond holdings.
    Analysts on average had expected the bank to earn $2.12 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
    Goldman's biggest business, trading, reported a 3 percent
increase in revenue.
    A sizeable portion of that trading gain was at the expense
of Knight Capital Group, which nearly went bankrupt in
August after losing $440 million because of trading glitch.
Goldman bought a lot of the stocks that Knight had inadvertently
acquired, at a steep discount.
    Revenue from commissions and fees dropped 29 percent. What
little client-driven trading took place was mostly lower fee
products like stock and bond indexes.
    Investment banking revenue jumped 49 percent from a very
weak period a year ago, but the backlog of deals dropped
slightly from the previous period. 
    An uncertain economic outlook "has weighed on the psychology
of corporate leaders and investors," making them more hesitant
to pull the trigger on deals, Viniar said.
    The one bright spot of Goldman's earnings was its investing
and lending division, which consists of stocks and bonds that
Goldman holds as investments. The value of those assets rose
during the quarter after the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled a new
program to boost liquidity.
    That business generated $1.8 billion in revenue; a year
earlier, it reduced overall revenue by $2.5 billion.
    The sustainability of those earnings are in question, due to
a regulation that limits large U.S. banks' ability to invest
their own money and new capital requirements that punish banks
for holding illiquid assets, like private equity and corporate
debt.
    Goldman is aiming to reduce its risk-weighted assets by $88
billion through 2015, some of which will come from the investing
and lending division.
    "The big takeaway from this quarter is that Goldman needs a
stronger economic environment to have adequate returns on
capital, rather than just the asset price rally," said Michael
Wong, an equity analyst at Morningstar who covers the bank.
"People are just kind of waiting for Goldman Sachs and other
investment banks to start being positive."
    Goldman shares rose 0.3 percent to $124.89 in afternoon
trading.
    The company also said it would lift its dividend for the
second time in a year, which is unusual because Goldman has
historically preferred to use capital to invest in businesses,
or buy back shares.
    Goldman will now pay shareholders 50 cents per share in
dividends each quarter, up from 46 cents. Viniar did not rule
out further dividend hikes in the future. He said much more of
the bank's capital planning will revolve around share
repurchases going forward. Goldman spent $1.25 billion buying
back stock during the quarter.
    Viniar also said that the bank has already finished most of
a cost-saving program that aims to reduce annual expenses by
$1.9 billion, by cutting staff and other non-compensation
expenses. In fact, Goldman added 300 employees last quarter and
paid out 44 percent of revenue in compensation, consistent with
its payout ratio in the previous two quarters.
    Goldman has set aside $10.97 billion for compensation so far
this year, a 10 percent increase from a year ago. That equates
to $336,442 per employee, up 15 percent from $292,836 per worker
during the first nine months of 2011.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported quarterly revenue that came in short of Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, hurt by declines in Europe and Asia where it sold more lower-priced drinks amid economic uncertainty the company expects to continue into 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest soft-drink maker, with brands such as Sprite, Fanta and Minute Maid, also said revenue and profit were hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, earnings were in line with analysts' expectations and Coca-Cola shares fell only 27 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $37.86 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola gets most of its sales from outside the United States, so shifts in currency can have a big effect. In the third quarter that ended on September 28, the strong dollar shaved 5 percentage points of growth from net revenue and 7 points from operating income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from currency, results in Asia, particularly China, disappointed some analysts, though Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said it was not surprising, given the softening of consumer sentiment and the slowing of an economy that had been a growth engine for multinational companies in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is slowing down a little bit for the long-term benefit of China. As China will settle, there's a little bit of adjustment," Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent told Reuters. "Take a plane -- when it leaves cruising altitude and is going to land, the ride gets rougher. But it will settle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent said he expects settling into a lower growth rate will happen within the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales volume rose 3 percent in the Pacific region; JP Morgan analyst John Faucher expected 4.5 percent growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, European consumers have been hurt by the debt crisis. In the latest quarter, consumers were buying bottled soft drinks to take home, which is less profitable for the company than drinks sold in restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go to Madrid and look at the cafes. There aren't a lot of people sitting around drinking Cokes or coffee or whatever," Gary Fayard, chief financial officer, said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, European sales are growing most Eastern and Central Europe where prices are lower, Kent said. This helps volume of sales but hurts revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income for Coca-Cola was $2.31 billion, or 50 cents per share, up from $2.22 billion, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, earnings were 51 cents per share, in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 1 percent to $12.34 billion. Analysts were expecting $12.41 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide sales volume rose 4 percent in the quarter, driven by gains in all regions. Volume rose 1 percent in Europe, 2 percent in North America, 5 percent in Latin America and 11 percent in the Eurasia and Africa region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales volume in the Philippines was flat, due to typhoons. In Japan, soda volume fell 5 percent from the year-earlier period when new products boosted sales. Volume rose 2 percent in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, North American revenue and profit rose, helped by a recent acquisition and the impact of certain commodities hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke is also seeing tougher competition from PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), which is working hard to improve its North American beverage business. It has increased marketing spending with a focus on core brands like Pepsi-Cola and analysts have been saying that the renewed effort is working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Monday's close, Coke shares were up 9 percent year-to-date, while the Dow Jones U.S. Beverage Index .DJUSBV gained 10 percent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index .SPX rose 14.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Brad Dorfman in Chicago; Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PITTSBURGH, Oct. 16, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- State Treasurer Rob McCord, Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Mike Wallace, representatives of Visa Inc., and students of Allderdice High School today kicked off a statewide effort to improve financial literacy among Pennsylvania teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Treasurer McCord and Wallace led students in a high-energy game of Financial Football, a free educational video game and classroom curriculum Visa developed to improve the money management skills of middle and high school students. Visa will distribute the game and curriculum materials to every Pennsylvania middle and high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We need to teach children the fundamentals of personal finance while they are young, because a solid financial education will benefit them as adults. We want them to learn how to manage money properly and make it last in order to have a better shot at long-term economic security," Treasurer McCord said. "This is a great partnership between Treasury, Visa and the NFL, and we're proud to be a part of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The free Financial Football game, which simulates an NFL game with financial literacy questions in between downs, is available at practicalmoneyskills.com/football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"When it comes to financial literacy, practice makes perfect, just as it does on the football field," Treasurer McCord said. "Studies show that as little as 10 hours of personal financial education positively impacts a student's spending and savings habits. Financial Football is a great way to hone these skills."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Treasurer McCord has made financial literacy a priority for his administration. Most recently, Treasury offered a series of free online webinars targeted at adults to answer many of their most common financial questions. The series, called "MoneyWise 101," featured financial professionals with extensive knowledge on topics such as establishing a budget, planning for retirement, and managing debt, among others. To view the archived lessons, visit www.patreasury.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Treasurer McCord will participate in a similar event next week at a southeastern Pennsylvania high school with a member of the Philadelphia Eagles team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Zamansky  Associates Advises JPMorgan Employees It Has Been 
      Appointed Lead Counsel in &#8220;London Whale&#8221; JPMorgan ERISA Case
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Zamansky  Associates has been appointed by the Court to serve as sole 
      interim lead counsel in an ERISA class action on behalf of JPMorgan 
      Chase (&#8220;JPM&#8221;) employees. The case concerns the losses JPM employees 
      suffered as a result of the JPM&#8217;s stock drop once the &#8220;London Whale&#8221; 
      derivative trading losses were belatedly disclosed. ERISA imposes 
      fiduciary duties on companies to prudently manage and invest plan 
      assets. These duties were violated by JPM&#8217;s failure to effectively 
      monitor and disclose the risks associated with the &#8220;London Whale&#8221; trades.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On May 10, 2012, JPM shocked financial markets when it first disclosed 
      publicly that it had suffered a $2 billion trading loss from complex, 
      proprietary derivatives trades. Jamie Dimon, the CEO, has said, &#8220;This 
      should never have happened. I can&#8217;t justify it. Unfortunately, these 
      mistakes are self-inflicted.&#8221; Since that time, JPM&#8217;s loss from the 
      trading position has reportedly grown to as much as $6 billion. JPM 
      stock suffered steep declines once the losses were disclosed. On May 10, 
      2012, JPM opened at $41.25 per share, and within ten days had fallen to 
      $32.51. As a result, JPM&#8217;s retirement and 401(k) plans have suffered 
      hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. It was recently reported that 
      a criminal investigation into the losses has commenced.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Weak commodity revenues weigh on fixed income for Q3
    * Goldman says employed higher risk for trading commodities


    By Barani Krishnan
    Oct 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said
significantly lower revenues from commodities dragged down its
trading businesses in the third quarter, singling out weak
performance by an unit that had once been a pride of Wall
Street's biggest investment bank.
    Goldman posted a profit for the quarter, saying trading of
fixed income, currency and commodities done on behalf of its
clients contributed nearly 30 percent more revenue compared with
the second quarter. 
    But Goldman -- also one of the largest proprietary traders
at one time in commodities -- implied that the figure would have
been more if not for its weak performance in commodities.
    During the third quarter, there were "significantly higher
net revenues in mortgages and higher net revenues in credit
products, currencies and interest rate products, partially
offset by significantly lower net revenues in commodities",
Goldman said, without breaking down numbers.   
    Goldman said client activity remained generally low during
the third quarter  as broad market concerns persisted amid
monetary easing by central banks. 
    The bank has cited negative impact from commodities in
previous earnings. But rarely has it drawn this much focus to
the asset class for being a drag on revenue.
    Goldman's performance contrasts with strong commodity prices
in the last quarter. The Thomson Reuters-Jefferies CRB index
, a commodities bellwether, posted its biggest gain in
nearly two years during the quarter, helped by economic
stimulus. 
    For years, Goldman had ruled commodities trading on Wall
Street with a scale, savvy and expertise matched only by top
rival Morgan Stanley. Operating physical commodity
operations such as oil pipelines and crude shipping, the two
also ran huge proprietary trading books that bet large sums of
their own money on the energy, metals and agriculture markets,
among others.
    Their fortunes in commodities began dwindling after new U.S.
financial laws were passed in 2010 to limit excessive
risk-taking by banks, prompting Wall Street's best to dump their
"prop desks" and cater exclusively to client needs in trading
and hedging.
    Fast-growing new competitor JPMorgan Chase has also
stolen some of the luster in commodities from Goldman and Morgan
Stanley, reporting a bumper revenue from the sector last year. 
Trading mostly metals before pushing into oil in 2009, JPMorgan
has made a series of risky acquisitions and hires to ramp up its
commodities business. 
    
    HIGHER COMMODS RISK, LOWER REVENUE
    In the third quarter, the lower commodity revenue at Goldman
came despite higher risk levels employed by the bank for trading
the asset class.
    Goldman said its Value-at-Risk (VaR) in commodities averaged
$22 million per day in the three months to September, versus the
$20 million averaged in the second quarter and the $25 million
of 2011's third quarter.
    VaR is an important consideration for investment banks when
making trading and hedging decisions for an asset class.
    In Goldman Sachs' case, its VaR readings are based on a 95
percent confidence level of the potential loss it could make in
trading commodities and other assets over a one-day time
horizon.
    
    The following lists commodities VaR at leading Wall Street
banks over the past two years (in $ millions):        
                       Average commodities VaR by quarter

** Value-at-Risk based on a 99 percent confidence level      
 
Note: Citigroup has issued third quarter results but its
VaR readings are reported in a separate regulatory filing. Bank
of America, which will release Q3 results on Oct. 17,
also reports VaR in a later filing.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is setting the price of its new Surface tablet below comparable versions of Apple Inc's iPad, signaling its intent to grab a slice of the booming tablet market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which announced its surprise foray into computer manufacturing in June, said it would sell a 32-gigabyte (GB), Wi-Fi only version of its tablet at $499, versus $599 for a comparable version of Apple's new iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's tablet, which is taller and slightly heavier than an iPad, will go on sale on October 26 as the company launches the new touch-friendly Windows 8 operating system. A limited number will be available for pre-order from a Microsoft website from Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is hoping the Surface - along with Windows tablets from other hardware makers - will challenge the dominance of Apple's iPad, which has 70 percent of the tablet market after essentially inventing the category in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPad's popularity demolished the market for mini-laptops called netbooks, and crimped the sales of full-scale PCs, eating away at Microsoft's Windows market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a Nvidia Corp chip designed by ARM Holdings, the Surface will run a simplified version of Windows 8 that is not compatible with old Microsoft applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the tablet will feature new app-style versions of Office mainstays such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, and will include Xbox games, video and music apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Surface, with two cameras and a USB port, will be Wi-Fi only. Microsoft has made no mention of a wireless-enabled version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the basic model, Microsoft will also offer a 32GB model bundled with a black 'Touch Cover' - that doubles as a keyboard - for $599, and a 64GB version with a black Touch Cover for $699.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares to $699 for a 64GB Wi-Fi only version of the new iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since announcing the Surface in June, Microsoft had been silent on the price range, saying only that it would be "competitive" with similar products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some market watchers had speculated that Microsoft might price its first tablet even lower to compete with Apple's less-powerful iPad 2, which costs $399, or smaller rivals such as Amazon.com's Kindle Fire HD and Google Inc's Nexus 7, which start at $199.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Microsoft's physical stores in the United States and Canada, the Surface will be generally available online from October 26 for consumers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Britain and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second, heavier Surface tablet aimed at the new generation of lightweight laptops called "ultrabooks," running on traditional Intel Corp chips, is expected on the market in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Bill Rigby; Editing By Ryan Woo)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Surface 32GB Wi-Fi $499 vs $599 for new iPad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Limited numbers available for pre-order&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Available in Microsoft Stores from Oct. 26&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is
setting the price of its new Surface tablet below comparable
versions of Apple Inc's iPad, signaling its intent to
grab a slice of the booming tablet market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which announced its
surprise foray into computer manufacturing in June, said it

than an iPad, will go on sale on Oct. 26 as the company launches
the new touch-friendly Windows 8 operating system. A limited
number will be available for pre-order from a Microsoft website
from Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is hoping the Surface - along with Windows
tablets from other hardware makers - will challenge the
dominance of Apple's iPad, which has 70 percent of the tablet
market after essentially inventing the category in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPad's popularity demolished the market for mini-laptops
called netbooks, and crimped the sales of full-scale PCs, eating
away at Microsoft's Windows market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a Nvidia Corp chip designed by ARM
Holdings, the Surface will run a simplified version of
Windows 8 that is not compatible with old Microsoft
applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the tablet will feature new app-style versions of
Office mainstays such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, and will
include Xbox games, video and music apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Surface, with two cameras and a USB port, will be Wi-Fi
only. Microsoft has made no mention of a wireless-enabled
version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the basic model, Microsoft will also offer a 32GB
model bundled with a black 'Touch Cover' - that doubles as a
keyboard - for $599, and a 64GB version with a black Touch Cover
for $699.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares to $699 for a 64GB Wi-Fi only version of the
new iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since announcing the Surface in June, Microsoft had been
silent on the price range, saying only that it would be
"competitive" with similar products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some market watchers had speculated that Microsoft might
price its first tablet even lower to compete with Apple's
less-powerful iPad 2, which costs $399, or smaller rivals such
as Amazon.com's Kindle Fire HD and Google Inc's
 Nexus 7, which start at $199.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Microsoft's physical stores in the United States
and Canada, the Surface will be generally available online from
Oct. 26 for consumers in Australia, Canada, China, France,
Germany, Hong Kong, Britain and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second, heavier Surface tablet aimed at the new generation
of lightweight laptops called "ultrabooks," running on
traditional Intel Corp chips, is expected on the market
in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings from such bellwethers
as Goldman Sachs and Johnson &amp; Johnson alleviated concerns about
the slowing global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow components Johnson &amp; Johnson and UnitedHealth
Group, both raised their full-year profit views while
Goldman Sachs boosted its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J, the diversified healthcare company, rose 0.7 percent to
$69.11 while UnitedHealth, the largest health insurer, fell 0.4
percent to $57.24 after rallying in premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares slipped 0.5 percent to $123.63 after posting
earnings that beat expectations and revenue that more than
doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not only have the Dow components done very well today, but
Goldman is extremely positive," said Adam Sarhan, chief
executive officer at Sarhan Capital in New York. "That a
financial is able to have results like that in this kind of
low-growth environment bodes well for the economy as a whole."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was up 59.80 points,
or 0.45 percent, at 13,484.03. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index
 was up 6.30 points, or 0.44 percent, at 1,446.43. The
Nasdaq Composite Index was up 9.94 points, or 0.32
percent, at 3,074.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co also reported a rise in earnings, but 
quarterly revenue came in short of Wall Street expectations,
hurt by declines in Europe and Asia. Its shares fell 1 percent
to $37.59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup unexpectedly announced that Chief Executive
Vikram Pandit had resigned effective immediately, along with
Chief Operating Officer John Havens. Michael Corbat, previously
chief executive for Europe, Middle East and Africa, was named to
succeed Pandit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement came one day after a surprisingly strong
quarterly earnings report. Citi's shares rose 1 percent to
$37.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pandit is leaving at the top of the game and leaving the
company in great hands, but the timing of the move is shocking,"
Sarhan said. "Why they didn't announce it with the earnings is a
question that needs to be answered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarterly earnings season thus far has been mixed, with
some early pessimistic results giving the S 500 its worst week
since June last week. However, Citigroup's results helped spark
a rally on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profits of S 500 companies are seen dropping 2.5 percent
from the year-ago period, according to Thomson Reuters data.
With about 8 percent of S companies having reported, 61
percent have topped profit expectations, under the average beat
rate of 67 percent for the past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel and IBM report after the market
closes and are among the first major earnings reports of the
tech sector, which has been marked by a number of profit
warnings, including from Intel. IBM shares rose 0.4 percent to
$209.91 while Intel rose 3 percent to $22.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in September as the
cost of gasoline surged, while industrial output was up 0.4
percent in September. Wall Street was little influenced by the
data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earnings have been the primary driver for equities in
recent sessions, overshadowing some strong economic indicators,
investors will keep an eye on the meeting of European leaders
later this week. European shares rose 0.9 percent on
growing hopes the meeting would advance plans to tackle debt
problems in Spain and Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

			SeeWhy Opens Up 27 Real-Time Marketing Technologies for IBM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Companies Deliver Real-Time Triggered Marketing to Customers, Capable 
      of Achieving Up to 300 Percent More Campaign Revenue
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SeeWhy, 
      Inc. today announced a pre-packaged integration with the IBM Digital 
      Data Exchange, which makes it easier for companies to take advantage of 
      IBM and third-party services by providing a single tag for the 
      collection and distribution of real-time behavioral digital data. By 
      integrating with the Digital Data Exchange, SeeWhy brings the benefits 
      of its analytics-driven ecommerce hub to IBM and its customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM&#8217;s Digital Data Exchange partner program helps companies more 
      effectively collaborate on marketing activities. Through the exchange, 
      retailers and third-party digital marketing providers can relay 
      behavioral data to analyze and enhance specific processes and improve 
      the customer experience. The exchange also includes a &#8220;gold tag&#8221; 
      approach which ensures analytics and marketing partners are all 
      operating off of the same, relevant data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through this partnership, the Digital Data Exchange now includes SeeWhy 
      CORE&#8482;, the first analytics hub for ecommerce that integrates all of 
      the newest social marketing platforms to make connecting with online 
      shoppers easier for both brands and retailers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For example, brands and retailers can use SeeWhy CORE to more 
      effectively connect with customers who have failed to complete a 
      purchase by connecting with them either through an ad or an email. In 
      either case, SeeWhy CORE delivers a single message that can be carried 
      across at the precise right time and to the right channel in order to 
      re-engage the customer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Shopping cart abandonment is an issue that impacts every ecommerce 
      company. With the addition of SeeWhy to the Digital Data Exchange, we 
      strengthen our ability to help businesses deal with that issue head on,&#8221; 
      said Dan Demichele, program director, digital analytics and marketing, 
      IBM. &#8220;Moving forward, we will continue to expand the Digital Data 
      Exchange, giving businesses easy and quick access to technologies that 
      ensure their customers the best brand experiences possible.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited about the integration of SeeWhy and IBM,&#8221; said Elizabeth 
      Johnson, vice president of interactive marketing services at PFSweb. &#8220;As 
      a customer of both companies, we look forward to using the technology 
      and bringing the combined solution to market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a member of the Digital Data Exchange, customers can now take 
      advantage of a suite of high ROI ecommerce applications without having 
      to touch their site, since no additional website tagging is required,&#8221; 
      said Scott 
      G. Silk, CEO of SeeWhy. &#8220;This brings real-time abandoned shopping 
      cart remarketing and a host of other socially savvy, real-time marketing 
      platforms to the IBM community for the first time. The impact on website 
      conversion will be significant &#8212; for many sites, SeeWhy CORE can 
      generate 300 percent more revenue than batch-based approaches and easily 
      increase overall ecommerce revenues by 10 to 20 percent.&#8221;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Product to Provide Automatic Cost-Savings and Reduced Paper 
      Usage for Clients
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) Treasury Services today launched an enhancement 
      to its Check Print product suite, Network Check Conversion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Network Check Conversion is a new Check Print product which converts a 
      client's check disbursements from paper to image and then efficiently 
      routes the electronic payment and remittance details to the lockbox of a 
      J.P. Morgan receivables client. This reduces payment distribution costs, 
      saving payables clients an average of $0.21 per item.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We're leveraging the strength of our payables and receivables client 
      network to efficiently route payments and create new sources of value,&#8221; 
      said Stephen Markwell, Executive Director, J.P. Morgan Treasury 
      Services. &#8220;This is a &#8216;hands free&#8217; experience for Check Print clients &#8211; 
      they can take advantage of this solution without lifting a finger.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan deployed the Network Check Conversion solution to all 
      existing Check Print clients and will offer to all new Check Print 
      clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;J.P. Morgan delivered a unique solution that allowed Comcast to reduce 
      payment costs and become more efficient while not requiring any changes 
      to our processing or a new implementation,&#8221; said Michael Lippert, 
      Executive Director, AP Shared Services, Comcast Cable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;J.P. Morgan has created an eco-friendly solution that creates immediate 
      value for their clients through new payment distribution efficiencies,&#8221; 
      said Bob Meara, Senior Analyst, Celent. &#8220;Clients will see a direct 
      increase to their bottom line as a result of the cost savings that J.P. 
      Morgan has uncovered.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan executives will be on-hand to discuss Network Check 
      Conversion during the annual Association 
      for Financial Professionals conference (booth #1121), held at the 
      Miami Beach Convention Center from October 14-17, 2012.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's 
commodities trading risk rose slightly in the third quarter from
the previous three months, company results showed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street investment bank said its Value-at-Risk (VaR)
in commodities averaged $22 million per day in the three months
to September, versus the $20 million averaged in the second
quarter and the $25 million of 2011's third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VaR is an important consideration for investment banks when
making trading and hedging decisions for an asset class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Goldman Sachs' case, its VaR readings are based on a 95
percent confidence level of the potential loss it could make in
trading commodities and other assets over a one-day time
horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' rival, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, has also
reported a commodities VaR with little change for the third
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a
third-quarter profit versus a loss a year before, as revenue
more than doubled due to gains in stocks and bonds it holds as
investments and due to a sharp rise in investment banking
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank reported earnings of $1.5 billion, or
$2.85 per share, applicable to common shareholders, compared
with a loss of $428 million, or 84 cents per share, a year
earlier. Net revenue rose 133 percent to $8.35 billion from $3.6
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also raised its quarterly dividend to 50 cents per

      _____________
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This quarter&#8217;s performance was generally solid in the context of a 
      still challenging economic environment,&#8221; said Lloyd C. Blankfein, 
      Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;We continue to be disciplined in 
      managing our operations and capital, while effectively serving our 
      clients&#8217; needs. The focus on these priorities will serve our 
      shareholders and the firm well over the longer term.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Net Revenues
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investment Banking
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.16&#160;billion, 49% higher than 
      the third quarter of 2011 and 3% lower than the second quarter of 2012. 
      Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $509&#160;million, slightly lower 
      compared with the third quarter of 2011. Net revenues in the firm&#8217;s 
      Underwriting business were $655&#160;million, more than double the amount in 
      the third quarter of 2011, which had particularly low volumes. This 
      increase primarily reflected significantly higher net revenues in debt 
      underwriting, principally due to higher net revenues from leveraged 
      finance activity. Net revenues in equity underwriting were higher 
      compared with the third quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting an 
      increase in client activity. The firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction 
      backlog declined slightly compared with the end of the second quarter of 
      2012.&#160;(8)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Institutional Client Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $4.18&#160;billion, 3% 
      higher than the third quarter of 2011 and 8% higher than the second 
      quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution 
      were $2.22&#160;billion, 28% higher than the third quarter of 2011. This 
      increase reflected significantly higher net revenues in mortgages and 
      higher net revenues in credit products, currencies and interest rate 
      products, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in 
      commodities. During the third quarter of 2012, Fixed Income, Currency 
      and Commodities Client Execution operated in an environment generally 
      characterized by tighter credit spreads, as certain central banks took 
      steps to ease monetary policy; however, broad market concerns persisted 
      and levels of activity generally remained low.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Equities were $1.96&#160;billion, 16% lower than the third 
      quarter of 2011, primarily due to significantly lower commissions and 
      fees, reflecting lower market volumes, and lower net revenues in 
      equities client execution. In addition, net revenues in securities 
      services were slightly lower compared with the third quarter of 2011, 
      primarily reflecting the impact of lower average customer balances. 
      During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment generally 
      characterized by an increase in global equity prices and lower 
      volatility levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The net loss attributable to the impact of changes in the firm&#8217;s own 
      credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected 
      was $370&#160;million ($225&#160;million and $145&#160;million related to Fixed Income, 
      Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, 
      respectively) for the third quarter of 2012, compared with a net gain of 
      $450&#160;million ($308&#160;million and $142&#160;million related to Fixed Income, 
      Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, 
      respectively) for the third quarter of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investing  Lending
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investing  Lending were $1.80&#160;billion for the third 
      quarter of 2012. Investing  Lending net revenues were positively 
      impacted by tighter credit spreads and an increase in global equity 
      prices. Results for the third quarter of 2012 included a gain of $99 
      million from the firm&#8217;s investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial 
      and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), net gains of $824&#160;million 
      from other investments in equities, primarily in private equities, net 
      gains and net interest income of $558&#160;million from debt securities and 
      loans, and other net revenues of $323&#160;million, principally related to 
      the firm&#8217;s consolidated investment entities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investment Management
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.20&#160;billion, 2% lower than 
      the third quarter of 2011 and 10% lower than the second quarter of 2012. 
      The decrease in net revenues compared with the third quarter of 2011 
      reflected lower transaction revenues and slightly lower management and 
      other fees, partially offset by higher incentive fees. During the 
      quarter, assets under management increased $20&#160;billion to $856&#160;billion, 
      reflecting net market appreciation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating expenses were $6.05&#160;billion, 40% higher than the third quarter 
      of 2011 and 16% higher than the second quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Compensation and Benefits
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, 
      estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity 
      awards and other items such as benefits) for the third quarter of 2012 
      was $3.68&#160;billion, which was higher than the third quarter of 2011, due 
      to higher net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net 
      revenues for the first nine months of 2012 was 44.0%, consistent with 
      the first nine months of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Non-Compensation Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Non-compensation expenses were $2.38&#160;billion, 13% lower than the third 
      quarter of 2011 and 4% higher than the second quarter of 2012. The 
      decrease compared with the third quarter of 2011 primarily reflected 
      lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees which 
      principally reflected lower transaction volumes in Equities, lower 
      expenses related to the U.K. bank levy (approximately $100&#160;million 
      related to the enactment of the U.K. bank levy was included in other 
      expenses in the third quarter of 2011) and the impact of expense 
      reduction initiatives. The third quarter of 2012 included net provisions 
      for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $62&#160;million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Provision for Taxes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2012 was 
      33.5%, up slightly from 33.2% for the first half of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capital
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of September&#160;30,&#160;2012, total capital was $241.57&#160;billion, consisting 
      of $73.69&#160;billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity (common shareholders&#8217; 
      equity of $68.34&#160;billion and preferred stock of $5.35&#160;billion) and 
      $167.88&#160;billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common 
      share was $140.58 and tangible book value per common share&#160;(3) 
      was $129.69, both approximately 3% higher compared with the end of the 
      second quarter of 2012. Book value and tangible book value per common 
      share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock 
      units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 
      486.1&#160;million at period end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On September&#160;4,&#160;2012, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.) issued 
      5,000.1 shares of Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series&#160;F 
      (Series&#160;F Preferred Stock), for aggregate proceeds of $500&#160;million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the quarter, the firm repurchased 11.8&#160;million shares of its 
      common stock at an average cost per share of $106.17, for a total cost 
      of $1.25&#160;billion. The remaining share authorization under the firm&#8217;s 
      existing repurchase program is 34.2&#160;million shares.&#160;(9)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to bank 
      holding companies (Basel&#160;1), the firm&#8217;s Tier&#160;1 capital ratio&#160;(6) 
      was 15.0%&#160;(5) and the firm&#8217;s Tier&#160;1 common ratio&#160;(7) 
      was 13.1%&#160;(5) as of September&#160;30,&#160;2012, both 
      unchanged compared with June&#160;30,&#160;2012.

			Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking 
      Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This press release contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the 
      meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not 
      historical facts, but instead represent only the firm&#8217;s beliefs 
      regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently 
      uncertain and outside of the firm&#8217;s control. It is possible that the 
      firm&#8217;s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly 
      materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition 
      indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some 
      of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm&#8217;s future 
      results and financial condition, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part&#160;I, Item&#160;1A 
      of the firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form&#160;10-K for the year ended 
      December&#160;31,&#160;2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Certain of the information regarding the firm&#8217;s capital ratios, 
      risk-weighted assets, total assets, level&#160;3 assets and global core 
      excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates. These estimates are 
      forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly 
      materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Statements about the firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog also 
      may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject 
      to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that 
      they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, 
      that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, 
      possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors 
      that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a 
      transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting 
      transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic 
      conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities 
      markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer 
      of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a 
      decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate 
      financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the 
      transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a 
      discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the 
      firm&#8217;s investment banking transactions, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part&#160;I, 
      Item&#160;1A of the firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form&#160;10-K for the year ended 
      December&#160;31,&#160;2011.

          Tangible common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' 
          equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible 
          assets. Tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing 
          tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity by the number of common shares 
          outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees 
          with no future service requirements. Management believes that 
          tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible book value per 
          common share are meaningful because they are measures that the firm 
          and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common 
          shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible book value per common share are 
          non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP 
          measures used by other companies. The table below presents the 
          reconciliation of total shareholders' equity to tangible common 
          shareholders' equity:

            The Tier&#160;1 common ratio equals Tier&#160;1 common capital divided by 
            risk-weighted assets. As of September&#160;30,&#160;2012, Tier&#160;1 common 
            capital was $57.13&#160;billion, consisting of Tier&#160;1 capital of 
            $65.23&#160;billion less preferred stock of $5.35&#160;billion and junior 
            subordinated debt issued to trusts of $2.75&#160;billion. Management 
            believes that the Tier&#160;1 common ratio is meaningful because it is 
            one of the measures that the firm and investors use to assess 
            capital adequacy. The Tier&#160;1 common ratio is a non-GAAP measure 
            and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by 
            other companies. For a further discussion of the firm's capital 
            ratios, see &#8220;Equity Capital&#8221; in Part&#160;I, Item&#160;2 &#8220;Management's

            Unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable 
            rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are treated as a 
            separate class of securities in calculating earnings per common

            ended September&#160;30,&#160;2012 and June&#160;30,&#160;2012, and $0.05 for both the

      Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola

      results. We continue to deliver consistent and solid performance, with 
      our business growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% 
      year-to-date. Importantly, we realized growth in the quarter across all 
      five of our global geographic operating groups, despite continued 
      volatility in the worldwide economy. We have been able to crack the 
      calculus for growth in this environment. We have done this by 
      consistently investing in our system and our brands to ensure that our 
      global portfolio is more relevant and healthier today than it has ever 
      been. We remain resolutely focused on ensuring that we leverage our 
      wonderful heritage and fuse it with what is expected by our consumers 
      today in order to earn and sustain our place in their daily lives 
      tomorrow.&#8221;

			PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company reported strong worldwide volume growth of 4% in 
      the third quarter and 5% year-to-date. Volume growth in the quarter was 
      well-balanced around the world, with growth in all geographic operating 
      groups as well as growth across both developed markets (+2%) and 
      emerging markets (+7%). The Company reported solid growth in key 
      developed markets, including North America (+2%), Japan (+2%) and Europe 
      (+1%), which reported growth across all business units in the quarter. 
      In addition, the Company delivered strong volume growth in key emerging 
      markets such as Thailand (+19%) and India (+15%) in the quarter. Our 
      China business delivered 2% volume growth in the quarter and 6% growth 
      year-to-date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the third quarter, we grew global volume and value share in total 
      NARTD beverages, with volume and value share gains across nearly every 
      beverage category in which we compete. Brand health remains consistently 
      strong, with continued improvements in favorite brand scores and growth 
      among consumers who enjoy at least one product from our broad portfolio 
      of beverage brands per week. Through our occasion-based brand, package, 
      price and channel segmentation strategy, we remain closely connected to 
      our consumers with a dual focus on recruitment and affordability. Our 
      immediate consumption beverage volume continues to grow, up 4% globally 
      in the quarter and 5% year-to-date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide sparkling beverage volume grew 3% in the quarter and 
      year-to-date. This represents nearly 450 million incremental unit cases 
      year-to-date, or the equivalent of adding another Russia to our global 
      business. We grew volume and value share in global core sparkling 
      beverages in the quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola and reflecting a 
      balanced portfolio approach to growth in the core sparkling beverage 
      category. Worldwide brand Coca-Cola volume grew 2% in the quarter and 3% 
      year-to-date, with growth in the quarter across diverse markets, 
      including India (+34%), Russia (+18%), Brazil (+3%), Mexico (+3%) and 
      South Africa (+2%). In addition, worldwide Fanta volume grew 7% in the 
      quarter and 5% year-to-date, and Sprite volume grew 4% in the quarter 
      and 5% year-to-date, as we leveraged global marketing campaigns in 
      locally relevant ways.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide still beverage volume grew 10% in the quarter and 9% 
      year-to-date, with solid growth across beverage categories, including 
      packaged water, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink tea and coffee, 
      sports drinks and energy drinks. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, 
      still beverage volume grew 8% in the quarter and year-to-date. We grew 
      global volume and value share in total still beverages and delivered 
      share gains across all still beverage categories in which we compete. 
      Ready-to-drink tea volume grew 13% in the quarter, with continued strong 
      performance of key brands such as Gold Peak and Honest Tea in North 
      America, Ayataka green tea in Japan and Fuze Tea, which we continued to 
      expand across markets worldwide during the quarter. Packaged water 
      volume grew 10% in the quarter, driven by our focus on innovative and 
      sustainable packaging and immediate consumption occasions, most recently 
      with our new &#8220;PlantBottle with a Twist&#8221; campaign, first aired during the 
      summer 2012 Olympic Games. Energy drinks volume grew 19% in the quarter 
      driven by growth across our global portfolio of energy brands.

        Our Eurasia and Africa Group's volume grew 11% in the quarter and 
        year-to-date (up 8% and 9%, respectively, excluding the benefit of 
        acquired volume), cycling 6% growth in the prior year quarter. Growth 
        in the quarter was led by India, up 15%, Middle East and North Africa, 
        up 22% (up 12% excluding the benefit of acquired volume), Russia, up 
        7% and South Africa, up 7%. Reported net revenues for the quarter 
        increased 4%, reflecting a 10% increase in concentrate sales and 
        positive price/mix of 5%, partially offset by an 11% currency impact. 
        Concentrate sales in the quarter and year-to-date were slightly ahead 
        of unit case volume (excluding acquired volume) primarily due to 
        timing. For the full year, we expect concentrate sales to be roughly 
        in line with unit case sales. Comparable currency neutral net revenues 
        increased 15% in the quarter. Reported operating income declined 4% in 
        the quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating income increased 
        11% in the quarter, driven by pricing and product mix, partially 
        offset by increased investments in the business.
      
			
        During the quarter, Eurasia and Africa grew volume and value share in 
        total NARTD beverages as well as in core sparkling beverages, juices 
        and juice drinks, sports drinks and ready-to-drink tea. Sparkling 
        beverage volume grew 9% in the quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola, which 
        grew 10%. Sprite volume grew 10% in the quarter and Fanta volume grew 
        6%. Still beverage volume grew 21% in the quarter, including the 
        benefit of acquired volume which added 12&#160;points of growth. In India, 
        we gained volume and value share in total NARTD beverages as well as 
        in sparkling and still beverages in the quarter, with both sparkling 
        and still beverage volume growth of 15%. India sparkling beverage 
        growth was driven by a strong system focus behind brand Coca-Cola as 
        well as customized integrated marketing campaigns centered on music 
        and sports. During the quarter, brand Coca-Cola volume in India grew 
        34% and Sprite grew 15%, with balanced growth across our portfolio of 
        package sizes. India still beverage volume growth was driven by strong 
        performance in juices and juice drinks, including Minute Maid Pulpy 
        and Maaza mango juice drink. Russia volume growth in the quarter was 
        led by our sparkling beverage brands, including brand Coca-Cola, up 
        18%, Fanta, up 15% and Sprite, up 7%. We gained volume and value share 
        in core sparkling and still beverages in Russia, with a strong 
        marketing campaign tied to the 2012 Olympic Games as well as a 
        continued focus on packaging segmentation to drive household 
        penetration.

			Europe
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Europe Group's volume grew 1% in the quarter, cycling even 
        performance in the prior year quarter, with volume growth in all 
        business units despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty across the 
        region and poor weather in the first half of the quarter. Year-to-date 
        volume was even. Reported net revenues declined 8% in the quarter, 
        reflecting a 3% increase in concentrate sales offset by unfavorable 
        price/mix of 4% and a 7% currency impact. Concentrate sales in the 
        quarter were ahead of unit case sales due to timing. Year-to-date 
        concentrate sales were broadly in line with unit case sales. 
        Comparable currency neutral net revenues were even in the quarter. 
        Reported operating income declined 14% in the quarter. Comparable 
        currency neutral operating income declined 8% in the quarter, 
        reflecting shifts in product and channel mix across markets, input 
        cost pressures, incremental investments related to the 2012 Olympic 
        Games, and timing of marketing expenses.
      
		
		
			
        During the quarter, the Europe Group maintained share in core 
        sparkling and still beverages. Europe sparkling beverage volume grew 
        1% in the quarter and still beverage volume grew 6%. We continued to 
        leverage integrated marketing campaigns centered on our 2012 Olympic 
        Games partnership, summer activities and Coke and Meals programming. 
        Germany volume grew 3% in the quarter, cycling 4% growth in the prior 
        year quarter, driven by Olympics activation, music-themed integrated 
        marketing campaigns, a continued focus on low-calorie and no-calorie 
        sparkling beverages and packaging segmentation to drive recruitment 
        and household penetration. The Central and Southern Europe region grew 
        volume low single digits, with brand Coca-Cola up mid single digits 
        driven by robust Coke and Meals activation. Volume in both the 
        Northwest Europe  Nordics and Iberia regions was positive, rounding 
        to even in the quarter.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Latin America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Latin America Group's volume grew 5% in the quarter and 
        year-to-date, cycling 7% growth in the prior year quarter. Reported 
        net revenues for the quarter were even, reflecting concentrate sales 
        growth of 8% and positive price/mix of 6%, offset by a currency impact 
        of 13% and a 1% impact related to structural change. Concentrate sales 
        in the quarter were ahead of unit case volume due to timing. 
        Year-to-date concentrate sales were in line with unit case volume. 
        Comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 12% in the quarter. 
        Reported operating income declined 5% in the quarter, with comparable 
        currency neutral operating income up 9%, primarily reflecting solid 
        volume growth and favorable pricing across the group, partially offset 
        by continued investments in the business, including some initial 
        expenses related to the 2014 World Cup.
      
			
        During the quarter, the Latin America Group gained volume and value 
        share in total NARTD beverages. All business units in Latin America 
        grew volume in the quarter, with 6% growth in Mexico, Brazil and South 
        Latin, and 3% growth in Latin Center, all driven by a continued focus 
        on affordability using refillable packages, activation of the summer 
        2012 Olympic Games, and recruitment through investment in immediate 
        consumption and the continued placement of new cold drink equipment. 
        Sparkling beverage volume was up 3%, with a strong focus on developing 
        and growing our portfolio of flavored sparkling brands. Brand 
        Coca-Cola volume grew 3% in the quarter while Fanta was up 7% and 
        Sprite was up 6%. Still beverage volume grew 14% in the quarter, 
        driven by ready-to-drink tea, up strong double digits as a result of 
        the newly launched Fuze Tea, as well as 33% growth in sports drinks, 
        12% growth in packaged water and 8% growth in juices and juice drinks. 
        Both Mexico and Brazil grew volume and value share in the quarter in 
        total NARTD beverages as well as in sparkling and still beverages, 
        with a continued focus on both single-serve and returnable packaging.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			North America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our North America Group's volume grew 2% in the quarter and 
        year-to-date, cycling 1% organic growth in the prior year quarter. 
        Reported net revenues for the quarter increased 5%, reflecting volume 
        growth of 2% as well as positive price/mix of 3% and a 1% benefit from 
        structural changes, primarily the acquisition of Great Plains 
        Coca-Cola Bottling Company. Currency unfavorably affected reported net 
        revenues by 1%. Third quarter reported operating income grew 34%, 
        which includes the effect of items impacting comparability, 
        principally net gains/losses related to our economic hedges, primarily 
        commodities, as well as costs related to the integration of the former 
        North America business of Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE). Comparable 
        currency neutral operating income grew 3% in the quarter, a sequential 
        improvement from the first half of 2012, reflecting positive volume 
        growth and pricing, partially offset by higher commodity costs and 
        ongoing investment in marketplace executional capabilities.
      
			
        During the quarter, North America gained volume and value share in 
        total NARTD beverages as we continue to build strong value-creating 
        brands and strengthen customer service. In addition, we gained volume 
        share and maintained value share in sparkling beverages. We gained 
        both volume and value share in still beverages, with volume and value 
        share gains across multiple still beverage categories, including 
        juices and juice drinks, functional hydration, sports drinks, energy 
        drinks and ready-to-drink teas and coffees. Sparkling beverage volume 
        was even in the quarter with sparkling beverage price/mix growth of 
        3%, as we maintained the price increases put in place over the past 
        year. Coca-Cola Zero volume grew 9% in the quarter. Fanta volume was 
        up 5% in the quarter and Seagram's grew 11% in the quarter driven by 
        the continued expansion of Seagram's Sparkling Seltzer Water. Still 
        beverage volume grew 7% in the quarter, led by Powerade growth of 9% 
        with strong 2012 Olympic Games activation and the new &#8220;Power Through&#8221; 
        campaign as well as double-digit growth in Gold Peak tea and Fuze tea. 
        Our portfolio of juice and juice drink brands grew 6% in the quarter, 
        driven by growth in juice drinks and the Minute Maid Light portfolio, 
        while our premium chilled orange juice continued to gain value share. 
        Our water business grew 4% as Dasani maintained its premium pricing 
        position in the mainstream water segment, supported by our PlantBottle 
        PET packaging.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pacific
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Pacific Group's volume grew 3% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date, 
        cycling 5% growth in the prior year quarter. Reported net revenues for 
        the quarter declined 4%, reflecting 3% concentrate sales growth, 
        offset by unfavorable price/mix of 6% and a 1% impact due to 
        structural change. Concentrate sales in the quarter were in line with 
        unit case sales. For the full year, we expect concentrate sales to be 
        roughly in line with unit case sales. Comparable currency neutral net 
        revenues decreased 3% in the quarter. Reported operating income 
        decreased 1% in the quarter, reflecting shifts in product, channel and 
        geographic mix. In addition, third quarter reported operating income 
        reflects a 1% currency benefit. Comparable currency neutral operating 
        income decreased 2% in the quarter and increased 5% year-to-date.
      
			
        During the quarter, the Pacific Group gained share in core sparkling 
        and still beverages. Volume growth in the quarter was broad-based, 
        with 2% growth in Japan and China, and double-digit growth in both 
        Thailand and South Korea. Philippines volume was even in the quarter 
        as multiple typhoons impacted the overall industry, yet we grew brand 
        Coca-Cola 2% and gained volume and value share in sparkling beverages. 
        Pacific Group sparkling beverage volume grew 1% in the quarter, led by 
        13% growth in Fanta and 3% growth in Sprite. Still beverage volume 
        grew 6% in the quarter, with double-digit growth in packaged water, 7% 
        growth in ready-to-drink tea and 4% growth in sports drinks. Japan's 
        sparkling beverage volume declined 5% in the quarter, principally due 
        to the cycling of new product launches, and still beverage volume grew 
        5%. Our Japan business continued to gain share in total NARTD 
        beverages as well as volume and value share in still beverages in the 
        quarter. This positive result was driven by the sustained momentum of 
        our Georgia coffee brand as well as water and sports drink category 
        offerings, which led to consistent volume growth across channels, 
        including convenience retail outlets, drug stores and supermarkets. 
        Our business in China delivered 2% volume growth in the quarter, while 
        cycling 11% growth in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date growth in 
        China is a solid 6%, cycling 15% growth in the prior year. We remain 
        encouraged and excited about our opportunities in this region and 
        continue to believe that China will serve as a long-term growth driver 
        for our business despite a changing competitive landscape and the 
        current softness in the macroeconomy. Importantly, and in alignment 
        with our strategic priorities in China, we are growing transactions 
        ahead of volume through a broad range of package offerings, with total 
        transactions up 10% and sparkling transactions up 7% year-to-date. 
        China sparkling beverages gained volume and value share in the quarter.

			Bottling Investments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Bottling Investments Group's volume grew 4% in the quarter on a 
        comparable basis after adjusting for the effect of structural changes, 
        primarily the acquisition of the Vietnam, Cambodia and Guatemala 
        bottling operations. Reported volume, including the benefit of these 
        acquisitions, grew 8% in the quarter. The growth in comparable volume 
        was primarily driven by India and Germany, with volume growth and 
        share gains in core sparkling beverages across most of the group's 
        markets, led by growth in brand Coca-Cola. Reported net revenues for 
        the quarter declined 2%. This reflects the 4% growth in comparable 
        unit case volume, positive price/mix of 1% and a 4% benefit due to 
        structural changes, offset by a currency impact of 11%. Comparable 
        currency neutral net revenues increased 9% in the quarter. Reported 
        operating income in the quarter decreased 42% due to currency as well 
        as the impact of structural changes. Comparable currency neutral 
        operating income decreased 14% in the quarter, reflecting the increase 
        in revenues resulting from volume growth and positive pricing in 
        select markets, offset by shifts in package and channel mix and 
        continued investments in our in-market capabilities.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			FINANCIAL REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third quarter reported net revenues grew 1%, with comparable net 
      revenues also up 1%. This reflects a 5% increase in concentrate sales; 
      slightly positive price/mix, rounding to even, driven by the cycling of 
      higher price/mix comparisons from the prior year; and a 1% benefit due 
      to structural changes, principally the acquisition of bottling 
      operations. Currency had a 5% unfavorable effect on net revenues in the 
      quarter. As a result, comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 6% 
      in the quarter, in line with our long-term target. Unit case sales 
      slightly lagged concentrate sales in the quarter. For the full year, we 
      expect unit case sales to be in line with concentrate sales. Our 
      price/mix results in the quarter were in line with our expectations, as 
      the quarter is cycling higher price/mix comparisons from the prior year. 
      Despite the tougher comparisons, we continued to grow global NARTD value 
      share for the 21st consecutive quarter. We estimate our 
      full-year 2012 consolidated price/mix results to be 1% to 2%, in line 
      with our long-term target range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported cost of goods sold was even in the quarter, with comparable 
      cost of goods sold up 3% in the quarter, reflecting moderately higher 
      commodity costs compared to the prior year quarter, primarily in North 
      America and the Bottling Investments Group. Currency decreased 
      comparable cost of goods sold by 4% in the quarter. Items impacting 
      comparability in the quarter primarily included net gains/losses on 
      commodities hedging. We currently estimate full-year incremental 
      commodity costs of approximately $225 million compared to the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported SGA expenses grew 2% in the quarter and comparable SGA 
      expenses increased 3% in the quarter. Currency decreased comparable SGA 
      expenses by 4% in the quarter. Operating expense leverage in the quarter 
      declined by 4 points, consistent with the outlook we provided in our 
      second quarter 2012 earnings call. On a full-year basis, we expect to 
      achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage, as we will benefit 
      from two additional selling days in the fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third quarter reported operating income increased 1%, with comparable 
      currency neutral operating income also up 1%. Items impacting 
      comparability increased third quarter operating income by $3 million in 
      2012 and decreased third quarter operating income by $212 million in 
      2011. Currency reduced comparable operating income by 7% in the quarter. 
      Including our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our 
      prior year rates,
			we estimate currency will have a mid 
      single-digit unfavorable impact on operating income in the fourth 
      quarter and for the full year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Year-to-date net share repurchases totaled $2.3 billion. These 
      repurchases are in line with the targeted range of $2.5 to $3.0 billion 
      in net share repurchases for the full year. Following shareowner 
      approval, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation on July 
      27, 2012, to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock 
      from 5.6 billion to 11.2 billion and effect a two-for-one stock split of 
      the common stock. Accordingly, all share and per share data now reflects 
      the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split. The 
      stock split will not affect the targeted net share repurchase range for 
      the full year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third quarter reported EPS was $0.50 and comparable EPS was $0.51. Items 
      impacting comparability reduced third quarter 2012 reported EPS by a net 
      $0.01 and reduced third quarter 2011 reported EPS by a net $0.04. In 
      both periods, these items included restructuring charges, costs related 
      to global productivity initiatives, gains/charges related to equity 
      investees, net gains/losses related to our economic hedges, primarily 
      commodities, and certain tax matters. Items impacting comparability in 
      third quarter 2012 also included charges related to changes in the 
      structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide (BPW) and charges related to 
      the supply of Brazilian orange juice. Items impacting comparability in 
      third quarter 2011 also included CCE integration costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Year-to-date cash from operations increased 15%. Excluding incremental 
      pension contributions made in first quarter 2012 and 2011, cash from 
      operations also increased 15%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Effective Tax Rate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%. The 
      underlying effective tax rate on operations for the quarter was 24.0%. 
      The variance between the reported rate and the underlying rate was due 
      to the tax effect of various items impacting comparability, separately 
      disclosed in this document in the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP 
      Financial Measures schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of 
      significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when 
      they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Items Impacting Prior Year Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First quarter 2011 results included a net charge of $0.04 per share due 
      to restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity 
      initiatives and the CCE integration, and charges related to the natural 
      disasters in Japan, partially offset by a gain on the sale of the 
      Company's stake in Chilean bottler Coca-Cola Embonor S.A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second quarter 2011 results included a net gain of $0.03 per share due 
      to a noncash gain on the adjustment to fair value of our investment in 
      Mexican bottler Grupo Continental S.A.B., partially offset by 
      restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives 
      and the CCE integration, and charges related to the natural disasters in 
      Japan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third quarter 2011 results included a net charge of $0.04 per share due 
      to restructuring charges and costs related to global productivity 
      initiatives and the CCE integration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			NOTES
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        All references to growth rate percentages, share and cycling of growth 
        rates compare the results of the period to those of the prior year 
        comparable period.
      
			
        &#8220;Concentrate sales&#8221; represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, 
        beverage bases and powders sold by, or used in finished beverages sold 
        by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers.
      
			
        &#8220;Sparkling beverages&#8221; means NARTD beverages with carbonation, 
        including energy drinks and carbonated waters and flavored waters.
      
			
        &#8220;Still beverages&#8221; means nonalcoholic beverages without carbonation, 
        including noncarbonated waters, flavored waters and enhanced waters, 
        juices and juice drinks, teas, coffees, sports drinks and 
        noncarbonated energy drinks.
      
			
        All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit 
        case volume, except for the reference to volume included in the 
        explanation of net revenue growth for North America. This North 
        America volume represents Coca-Cola Refreshments' unit case sales 
        (which are equivalent to concentrate sales) plus non-Company-owned 
        bottling operations' concentrate sales. All volume percentage changes, 
        unless otherwise noted, are computed based on average daily sales. 
        &#8220;Unit case&#8221; means a unit of measurement equal to 24 eight-ounce 
        servings of finished beverage. &#8220;Unit case volume&#8221; means the number of 
        unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverages directly or 
        indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers.
      
			
        Year-to-date 2012 financial results were impacted by one less selling 
        day. Fourth quarter 2012 financial results will benefit from two 
        additional selling days. Unit case volume results are not impacted by 
        the variance in selling days due to the average daily sales 
        computation referenced above.
      
			
        Due to the refocusing in 2012 of the Beverage Partners Worldwide (BPW) 
        ready-to-drink tea joint venture with Nestl&#233; S.A. (Nestl&#233;), we have 
        eliminated the BPW joint venture volume and associated concentrate 
        sales from our reported results for both 2011 and 2012 in those 
        countries in which the joint venture is being phased out during 2012. 
        In addition, we have eliminated the Nestea licensed volume and 
        associated concentrate sales in the U.S. due to our current U.S. 
        license agreement with Nestl&#233; terminating at the end of 2012. These 
        changes did not materially impact the Company's reported volume 
        results for third quarter or year-to-date 2012 on a consolidated basis 
        or for any individual operating group. However, these changes 
        increased the Company's reported third quarter and year-to-date 2012 
        volume for still beverages by 2 points and 1 point, respectively, and 
        ready-to-drink tea by 12 points and 8 points, respectively.
      
			
        The Company reports its financial results in accordance with 
        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). 
        However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures 
        provide users with additional meaningful financial information that 
        should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. 
        Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making 
        financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the 
        Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in 
        addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported 
        results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial 
        information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.

			CONFERENCE CALL
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We are hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss 
      third quarter and year-to-date 2012 results today, October 16, 2012 at 
      9:30 a.m. EDT. We invite investors to listen to a live audiocast of the 
      conference call at our website, http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com 
      in the &#8220;Investors&#8221; section. A replay in downloadable MP3 format and 
      transcript of the call will also be available within 24 hours after the 
      audiocast on our website. Further, the &#8220;Investors&#8221; section of our 
      website includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that 
      may be used periodically by management when discussing our financial 
      results with investors and analysts to our results as reported under 
      GAAP.

						1 Effective January 1, 2012, the Company elected to 
            change our accounting methodology for determining the 
            market-related value of assets for our U.S. qualified defined 
            benefit pension plans. The Company's change in accounting 
            methodology has been applied retrospectively, and we have adjusted 
            all prior period financial information presented herein as 
            required.

      During the three months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the results of our 
      operating segments were impacted by the following items:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Intersegment revenues were $29 million for Eurasia and Africa, $165 
        million for Europe, $55 million for Latin America, $1 million for 
        North America, $147 million for Pacific and $26 million for Bottling 
        Investments.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $48 million for North America, $1 million for Pacific, $14 
        million for Bottling Investments and $10 million for Corporate due to 
        charges related to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program 
        as well as other restructuring initiatives. Operating income (loss) 
        and income (loss) before income taxes were increased by $1 million for 
        Pacific and $5 million for Corporate due to the refinement of 
        previously established accruals related to the Company's 2008-2011 
        productivity initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income (loss) 
        before income taxes were increased by $5 million for North America due 
        to the refinement of previously established accruals related to the 
        Company's integration of CCE's former North America business.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $9 million for North America due to costs associated with 
        the Company detecting residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not 
        registered in the U.S. for use on citrus products, in orange juice 
        imported from Brazil for distribution in the U.S. As a result, the 
        Company began purchasing additional supplies of Florida orange juice 
        at a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $1 million for Latin 
        America, $1 million for North America, $2 million for Pacific and was 
        increased by $1 million for Eurasia and Africa and $3 million for 
        Europe due to changes in the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide 
        ("BPW"), our 50/50 joint venture with Nestl&#233; S.A. ("Nestl&#233;") in the 
        ready-to-drink tea category.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $10 million for 
        Bottling Investments due to the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of 
        unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method 
        investees.

      During the three months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the results of our 
      operating segments were impacted by the following items:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Intersegment revenues were $34 million for Eurasia and Africa, $192 
        million for Europe, $64 million for Latin America, $121 million for 
        Pacific and $24 million for Bottling Investments.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $2 million for Europe, $2 million for Latin America, $52 
        million for North America, $2 million for Pacific, $14 million for 
        Bottling Investments and $26 million for Corporate due to the 
        Company&#8217;s productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives as 
        well as costs associated with the merger of Embotelladoras Arca, 
        S.A.B. de C.V. ("Arca") and Grupo Continental S.A.B. ("Contal").
      
		
		
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $2 million for North America and were increased by 
        $1&#160;million for Pacific due to charges associated with the earthquake 
        and tsunami that devastated northern and eastern Japan on March 11, 
        2011.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $36 million for 
        Bottling Investments due to the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of 
        unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method 
        investees.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $5 million for 
        Corporate due to the net charge we recognized on the repurchase and/or 
        exchange of certain long-term debt assumed in connection with our 
        acquisition of CCE's former North America business.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $5 million for 
        Corporate due to the finalization of working capital adjustments 
        related to the sale of all our ownership interests in Coca-Cola 
        Drikker AS (our "Norwegian bottling operation") and Coca-Cola Drycker 
        Sverige AB (our "Swedish bottling operation") to Coca-Cola 
        Enterprises, Inc. ("New CCE").
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $3 million for 
        Corporate due to the impairment of an investment in an entity 
        accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

						1 Effective January 1, 2012, the Company elected to

      During the nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the results of our 
      operating segments were impacted by the following items:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Intersegment revenues were $126 million for Eurasia and Africa, $488 
        million for Europe, $176 million for Latin America, $13 million for 
        North America, $372 million for Pacific and $66 million for Bottling 
        Investments.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $157 million for North America, $1 million for Pacific, $45 
        million for Bottling Investments and $18 million for Corporate due to 
        charges related to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program 
        as well as other restructuring initiatives. Operating income (loss) 
        and income (loss) before income taxes were increased by $3 million for 
        Europe, $1 million for Pacific and $5 million for Corporate due to the 
        refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company's 
        2008-2011 productivity initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income 
        (loss) before income taxes were increased by $5 million for North 
        America due to the refinement of previously established accruals 
        related to the Company's integration of CCE's former North America 
        business.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $20 million for North America due to changes in the 
        Company's ready-to-drink tea strategy as a result of our current U.S. 
        license agreement with Nestl&#233; terminating at the end of 2012.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $21 million for North America due to costs associated with 
        the Company detecting residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not 
        registered in the U.S. for use on citrus products, in orange juice 
        imported from Brazil for distribution in the U.S. As a result, the 
        Company began purchasing additional supplies of Florida orange juice 
        at a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $92 million for 
        Corporate due to a gain the Company recognized as a result of an 
        equity method investee issuing additional shares of its own stock 
        during the period at a per share amount greater than the carrying 
        amount of the Company's per share investment.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $33 million for 
        Bottling Investments due to the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of 
        unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method 
        investees.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $2 million for 
        Eurasia and Africa, $3 million for Europe, $3 million for Latin 
        America, $1 million for North America and $5 million for Pacific due 
        to changes in the structure of BPW, our 50/50 joint venture with 
        Nestl&#233; in the ready-to-drink tea category.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the nine months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the results of our 
      operating segments were impacted by the following items:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Intersegment revenues were $124 million for Eurasia and Africa, $537 
        million for Europe, $205 million for Latin America, $11 million for 
        North America, $306 million for Pacific and $66 million for Bottling 
        Investments.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $9 million for Eurasia and Africa, $5 million for Europe, 
        $3 million for Latin America, $229 million for North America, $3 
        million for Pacific, $58 million for Bottling Investments and $100 
        million for Corporate, primarily due to the Company&#8217;s productivity, 
        integration and restructuring initiatives as well as costs associated 
        with the merger of Arca and Contal.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $2 million for North America and $82 million for&#160;Pacific 
        due to charges associated with the earthquake and tsunami that 
        devastated northern and eastern Japan on March&#160;11,&#160;2011.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $19 million for North America due to the amortization of 
        favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition 
        of CCE's former North America business.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by a net $417 million 
        for Corporate, primarily due to the gain the Company recognized as a 
        result of the merger of Arca and Contal.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $102 million for 
        Corporate due to the gain on the sale of our investment in Coca-Cola 
        Embonor S.A. (&#8220;Embonor&#8221;), a bottling partner with operations primarily 
        in Chile. Prior to this transaction, the Company accounted for our 
        investment in Embonor under the equity method of accounting.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $41 million for 
        Corporate due to the impairment of an investment in an entity 
        accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $40 million for 
        Bottling Investments due to the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of 
        unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method 
        investees.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $8 million for 
        Corporate due to the net charge we recognized on the repurchase and/or 
        exchange of certain long-term debt assumed in connection with our 
        acquisition of CCE's former North America business.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $5 million for 
        Corporate due to the finalization of working capital adjustments 
        related to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations 
        to New CCE.

      The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting 
      principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred 
      to herein as "reported"). However, management believes that certain 
      non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful 
      financial information that should be considered when assessing our 
      ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial 
      measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in 
      evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should 
      be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company&#8217;s 
      reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP 
      financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of 
      accounting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following information is provided to give qualitative and 
      quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items 
      impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, 
      our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly 
      titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to 
      consider as "items impacting comparability" based on how management 
      views our business; makes financial, operating and planning decisions; 
      and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, 
      gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting 
      only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as 
      relating to different and unrelated underlying activities or events 
      across comparable periods, are generally considered "items impacting 
      comparability". In addition, we provide the impact that changes in 
      foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency 
      neutral").

			Asset Impairments and Restructuring
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Asset Impairments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the Company 
      recorded impairment charges of $3 million and $41 million, respectively, 
      due to the impairment of an investment in an entity accounted for under 
      the equity method of accounting. These impairment charges were recorded 
      in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Restructuring
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the Company 
      recorded charges of $14 million and $44&#160;million, respectively, 
      associated with the integration of our German bottling and distribution 
      operations as well as other restructuring initiatives outside the scope 
      of our recently announced productivity and reinvestment program. These 
      restructuring charges were recorded in the line item other operating 
      charges. See below for a discussion of our productivity and reinvestment 
      program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the Company 
      recorded charges of $18 million and $79&#160;million, respectively, 
      associated with the integration of our German bottling and distribution 
      operations as well as other restructuring initiatives outside the scope 
      of our productivity initiatives and the integration of CCE's former 
      North America business. These restructuring charges were recorded in the 
      line item other operating charges. See below for a discussion of our 
      productivity and CCE integration initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Productivity and Reinvestment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the Company 
      recorded charges of $59 million and $177&#160;million, respectively, in the 
      line item other operating charges related to our productivity and 
      reinvestment program which was announced in February 2012. This program 
      will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest 
      our resources to drive long-term profitable growth. The first component 
      of this program is a new global productivity initiative focused around 
      four primary areas: global supply chain optimization; global marketing 
      and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and operational 
      excellence; and data and information technology systems standardization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second component of our productivity and reinvestment program 
      involves beginning a new integration initiative in North America related 
      to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. The Company 
      has identified incremental synergies in North America, primarily in the 
      area of our North American product supply, which will better enable us 
      to serve our customers and consumers. We believe our new integration 
      efforts will result in costs of approximately $300 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a combined productivity and reinvestment program, the Company 
      anticipates generating annualized savings of $550 to $650 million which 
      will be phased in over four years starting in 2012. We expect to begin 
      fully realizing the annual benefits of these savings in 2015, the final 
      year of the program. See below for a discussion of the Company's 
      productivity and CCE integration initiatives that were completed in 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Productivity Initiatives
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the Company 
      reversed charges of $6 million and $9&#160;million, respectively, related to 
      previously established accruals associated with our 2008-2011 
      productivity initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the Company 
      recorded charges of $22 million and $76&#160;million, respectively, related 
      to our 2008-2011 productivity initiatives. These initiatives were 
      focused on providing additional flexibility to invest for growth and 
      impacted a number of areas, including aggressively managing operating 
      expenses supported by lean techniques; redesigning key processes to 
      drive standardization and effectiveness; better leveraging our size and 
      scale; and driving savings in indirect costs. These initiatives 
      delivered annualized savings of over $500 million beginning in 2011, 
      exceeding the upper end of the Company's original savings target of $400 
      to $500 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Equity Investees
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the Company 
      recorded a charge of $10 million and a gain of $33 million, 
      respectively, in the line item equity income (loss) &#8212; net. These amounts 
      represent the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of unusual or infrequent 
      items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the Company 
      recorded charges of $36 million and $40&#160;million, respectively, in the 
      line item equity income (loss) &#8212; net. These charges represent the 
      Company&#8217;s proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by 
      certain of our equity method investees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CCE Transaction
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the Company 
      reversed charges of $5 million related to previously established 
      accruals associated with the Company's integration of CCE's former North 
      America business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the Company 
      recorded charges of $54 million and $241&#160;million, respectively, related 
      to our integration of CCE's former North America business. These charges 
      were primarily due to the development, design and initial implementation 
      of our future operating framework in North America. The Company realized 
      nearly $350 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011 and 
      incurred total costs of $488&#160;million related to this program since its 
      inception. This initiative was completed at the end of 2011. See above 
      for a discussion of the Company's recently announced productivity and 
      reinvestment program which involves beginning a new integration 
      initiative in North America related to our acquisition of CCE's former 
      North America business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Transaction Gains
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the Company recognized 
      a gain of $92 million as a result of an equity method investee issuing 
      additional shares of its own stock during the period at a per share 
      amount greater than the carrying amount of the Company's per share 
      investment. The Company recorded this gain in the line item other income 
      (loss) &#8212; net.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the nine months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the Company recognized 
      a net gain of $417 million, primarily due to the merger of Arca and 
      Contal, two bottling partners headquartered in Mexico, into a combined 
      entity known as Arca Contal. The Company recorded this gain in the line 
      item other income (loss) &#8212; net. Prior to this transaction, the Company 
      held an investment in Contal that we accounted for under the equity 
      method of accounting. The merger of the two companies was a noncash 
      transaction that resulted in Contal shareholders trading their existing 
      Contal shares for new shares in Arca Contal at a specified exchange 
      rate. Subsequent to this transaction, the Company holds an investment in 
      Arca Contal that we account for as an available-for-sale security. 
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the Company 
      also recorded charges of $9 million and $35 million, respectively, 
      related to costs associated with the merger of Arca and Contal. The 
      Company recorded these charges in the line item other operating charges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the gain on the exchange of our shares in Contal, the 
      Company recognized a gain of $102 million during the nine months ended 
      September&#160;30, 2011, as a result of the sale of our investment in 
      Embonor, a bottling partner with operations primarily in Chile. Prior to 
      this transaction, the Company accounted for our investment in Embonor 
      under the equity method of accounting. The Company recorded this gain in 
      the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Certain Tax Matters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended September&#160;28, 2012, and September&#160;30, 
      2011, the Company recorded a net tax charge of $7 million and a net tax 
      benefit of $4 million, respectively, related to amounts required to be 
      recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest 
      and penalties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, and September&#160;30, 2011, 
      the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $26 million and a net tax 
      charge of $15 million, respectively, related to amounts required to be 
      recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest 
      and penalties. The net tax benefit recorded during the nine months ended 
      September&#160;28, 2012, also included the impact of the reversal of certain 
      valuation allowances.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Other Items
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Impact of Natural Disasters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake struck off the coast of Japan, 
      resulting in a tsunami that devastated the northern and eastern regions 
      of the country. As a result of these events, the Company made a donation 
      to the Coca-Cola Japan Reconstruction Fund which has helped rebuild 
      schools and community facilities across the impacted areas of the 
      country. During the three and nine months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the 
      Company recorded total charges of $1 million and $84&#160;million, 
      respectively, related to these events. These charges were primarily 
      related to the Company&#8217;s donation and assistance provided to certain 
      bottling partners in the affected regions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company uses derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price 
      risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing 
      process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these 
      derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge 
      accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair 
      values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for 
      outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our 
      non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying 
      exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of 
      income. We believe this adjustment provides meaningful information 
      related to the benefits of our economic hedging activities. During the 
      three and nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the net impact of the 
      Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities 
      described above resulted in a decrease to our non-GAAP operating income 
      of $74 million and $77 million, respectively. During the three and nine 
      months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the net impact of the Company's 
      adjustment related to our economic hedging activities described above 
      resulted in an increase to our non-GAAP operating income of $113 million 
      and $103&#160;million, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Repurchase of Long-Term Debt
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three and nine months ended September&#160;30, 2011, the Company 
      recorded net charges of $5 million and $8&#160;million, respectively, related 
      to the repurchase and/or exchange of certain long-term debt that we 
      assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America 
      business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Beverage Partners Worldwide and License Agreement with Nestl&#233; S.A.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the Company recorded 
      charges of $14 million due to changes in the structure of Beverage 
      Partners Worldwide ("BPW"), our 50/50 joint venture with Nestl&#233; S.A. 
      ("Nestl&#233;") in the ready-to-drink tea category. In addition, during the 
      nine months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the Company recorded charges of 
      $20&#160;million due to changes in our ready-to-drink tea strategy as a 
      result of our current U.S. license agreement with Nestl&#233; terminating at 
      the end of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Brazilian Orange Juice
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In December 2011, the Company learned that orange juice being imported 
      from Brazil contained residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not 
      registered in the U.S. for use on citrus products. As a result, the 
      Company began purchasing additional supplies of Florida orange juice at 
      a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice. During the three and nine 
      months ended September&#160;28, 2012, the Company incurred charges of $9 
      million and $21 million, respectively, related to Brazilian orange 
      juice, including the increased raw material costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Currency Neutral
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management evaluates the operating performance of our Company and our 
      international subsidiaries on a currency neutral basis. We determine our 
      currency neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as 
      appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results by 
      the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of 
      current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current 
      period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as 
      appropriate, the derived local currency operating results by the foreign 
      currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of the comparable 
      prior period currency hedging activities) used to translate the 
      Company's financial statements in the comparable prior year period to 
      determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would 
      have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not changed from 
      the comparable prior year period.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 16 (Marketwire) -- 
J.P. Morgan leads the All-America Research Team, Institutional Investor's
annual ranking of the country's best sell-side research analysts, for a
third year running. Barclays holds steady in second place, followed by
Bank of America Merrill Lynch in third.

    Complete survey results can be found at www.institutionalinvestor.com.

    J.P. Morgan adds three positions, for a total of 43, and widens its lead
over Barclays, which returns with 39. BofA Merrill, which tied with
Barclays last year, slips to third after losing five spots, leaving it
with 34. 

    Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank Securities are the big gainers --
leaping to fourth and fifth place, respectively, after picking up seven
positions each. Morgan Stanley, with 33 total, rises from No. 6; Deutsche
Bank, with 32, bolts from eighth place. 

    This year has been especially challenging for analysts, notes Thomas W.
Johnson, II's managing editor/research. "They must keep clients
up-to-date on the latest news -- much of which has been bad -- about
Europe's debt crisis, China's slowing growth, and political gridlock in
Washington," he says, "while also pointing out encouraging signs from
corporate America and the investment opportunities that exist. With the
U.S. hurtling toward a year-end fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax
hikes -- not to mention next month's presidential and congressional
elections -- the demands on analysts are only going to increase."

    Survey results reflect the opinions of nearly 3,300 individuals at some
950 buy-side institutions that manage an estimated $9.93 trillion in U.S.
equities, or 77.4 percent of the $12.83 trillion market capitalization of
the MSCI U.S. index at the time of polling.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S 500 rose for the third consecutive day on Wednesday after housing starts hit a four-year high, but the Dow was weighed down by IBM after it posted weak revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders' shares led gains after the Commerce Department said groundbreaking on new homes jumped 15 percent in September, the quickest pace since July 2008. The surge in housing starts was viewed as evidence that the housing sector's fledgling recovery is bolstering the recovery of the broader economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PHLX Housing Index .HGX rose 2.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) was a notable disappointment after the company said revenue fell short of expectations. The stock dropped 4.9 percent, exerting an 81-point drag on the Dow industrials. IBM has an outsized influence on the Dow, which is a price-weighted index. IBM's stock closed at $200.63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp (INTC.O), the world's largest chipmaker, lost 2.5 percent to end at $21.79 a day after giving a weak revenue outlook. The S technology sector index .GSPT slid 0.8 percent and ranked as the only loser among the S 500's 10 industry sectors on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it's still early in the earnings season, the results have been a bit better than anticipated. Fourteen percent of S 500 companies have already reported earnings, and of those companies, 65 percent have beaten analysts' expectations, ahead of the long-term average of 62 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results are just not that bad at all. And whenever people begin to get too far in one direction - meaning earnings are going to be terrible - generally reality is better than that, and we are seeing that now," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday afternoon, quarterly earnings for S 500 components are now expected to fall 1.7 percent from a year ago, a modest improvement in expectations from a forecast for a drop of 2.3 percent earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America (BAC.N) shares fell 0.2 percent to $9.44 after the second-largest U.S. bank reported that it earned just $340 million during the quarter, down 95 percent from the year-ago period. The bank also said it had provided $4.75 billion in first lien principal reductions and expected to meet total obligations within the first year of the National Mortgage Settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the financials, the bar was set very low. They topped the bar, but we didn't get a nice tailwind from post-announcement conference calls," said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., in Lake Oswego, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 5.22 points, or 0.04 percent, to 13,557 at the close. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 5.99 points, or 0.41 percent, to finish at 1,460.91.

posted weak revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders' shares led gains after the Commerce Department

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Oct 17 (Marketwire) -- 
Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALGN) today announced SmartTrack(TM), the
next generation of Invisalign clear aligner material. SmartTrack is a
highly elastic new aligner material that delivers gentle, more constant
force to improve control of tooth movements with Invisalign clear aligner
treatment. 

    "We are very excited to be introducing an innovative material to the
world of clear aligner treatment," said Dana Cambra, Align Technology's
vice president research and development and information technology.
"SmartTrack represents not just an improvement in aligner material --
it's a significant improvement in the entire Invisalign system and how we
leverage force systems for more predictable tooth movements."

    SmartTrack is a proprietary, custom-engineered material that delivers
gentle, more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth
movements. Conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial
percent of energy in the initial days of aligner wear, but SmartTrack
maintains more constant force over the two weeks that a patient wears the
aligners. The flexible SmartTrack material also more precisely conforms
to tooth morphology, attachments, and interproximal spaces to improve
control of tooth movement throughout treatment. A study* of over 1,000
patients treated with Invisalign aligners made with SmartTrack shows
statistically significant improvement in control of tooth movements such
as rotations and extrusions (p &lt; 0.001), compared to patients treated
with aligners made with current Invisalign material. 

    "The clinical results with SmartTrack have been excellent so far," said
Dr. Clark Colville, an orthodontist in Seguin, Texas and a participant in
the SmartTrack study. "The fit around the teeth from aligner to aligner
is better than with any group of patients I have treated with Invisalign
in my practice. Without a doubt, SmartTrack is the most exciting change
in Invisalign technology among the many that have been introduced in
recent years."

    "I'm very pleased with the new SmartTrack aligner material," said Dr.
Werner Schupp, an orthodontist practicing in Koeln, Germany and a
participant in the SmartTrack study. "The aligners fit better and are
much more comfortable for our patients, and the tooth movement is more
precise in all directions."

    SmartTrack will become the standard Invisalign aligner material in the
first quarter of 2013 for Invisalign clear aligner products in North
America and Europe, as well as other International markets.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp agreed to buy Celtic Exploration Ltd for C$2.6 billion ($2.64 billion), in a deal to raise its presence in some of Western Canada's most promising shale oil and gas regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction, announced Wednesday, will give Exxon vast tracts in the liquids-rich Montney shale gas region in northeastern British Columbia. It will join other world-scale energy companies looking to tap Montney's massive reserves to feed planned liquefied natural gas plants planned for province's Pacific coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also gain a stake in Alberta's promising Duvernay shale play, an early stage development where peers such as Chevron Corp and ConocoPhillips have already taken big stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and other global oil majors are buying oil and gas assets in North America as they struggle to boost output in a sector where vast energy resources are tightly controlled by countries like Brazil and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil started a big push into in unconventional resources like shale with its 2010 purchase of XTO Energy. Since then, Exxon has steadily added shale gas and shale oil reserves in North America as it works to boost production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This acquisition will add significant liquids-rich resources to our existing North American unconventional portfolio," Andrew Barry, president of ExxonMobil Canada, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Exxon agreed to buy Denbury Resources Inc's crude oil properties in the Bakken shale for $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it was formed in 2002, Celtic, led by Chief Executive David Wilson, has focused on finding liquids-rich gas reserves that fetch a premium compared with dry natural gas and on acquiring lands in the most promising of Canada's shale regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Montney region of British Columbia has 450 trillion cubic feet of gas in place, according the province's government, though only a fraction of that could be recovered using the hydraulic fracturing techniques that transformed oil and gas production elsewhere in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Duvernay shales, a 50,000 square-kilometer (19,300 square-mile) region stretching down the Rocky Mountain foothills of central Alberta, is estimated by some analysts to contain more than 750 tcf of liquids-rich gas, enough to support the ambitions of the world's largest oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It fits the bill for a company like Exxon," said Matthew Taylor, an analyst with National Bank Financial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celtic's "management team is known for its exploration expertise and they took it to the level where a major (oil company) can now step in and basically go into gas manufacturing mode," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said its Canadian subsidiary, ExxonMobil Canada, will pay C$24.50 for each share of Celtic, a 35 percent premium to Celtic's closing price on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday but below its 52-week high of C$27.08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for each common share tendered, Celtic shareholders will also receive half a share in a new spin-off company led by Celtic's current management team. The value of the new firm has yet to be determined..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the dust settles around this transaction and (Celtic) gets out there and talks a bit more about it, we'll see where it trades," Taylor said. "You would expect a spinco with this caliber of management to garner a premium."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new company will house a gas property at Grand Cache, Alberta; a liquids-rich natural gas property at Inga, British Columbia; and an oil prospect at Karr, Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's bid is the latest in a wave of takeovers in the energy rich provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, where the bulk of Celtic's assets are located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian government is currently reviewing a C$15.1 billion bid by Chinese state-owned oil major CNOOC Ltd for Nexen Inc for Progress Energy Resources Corp as it also looks for a foothold in the Montney region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said that Imperial Oil Ltd, its 70 percent owned Canadian affiliate, is not participating in the acquisition but has the option to take a half interest in the Celtic properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imperial said earlier this year it was examining the potential of developing an LNG plant that could ship gas from northeastern British Columbia to Asian markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celtic shares were up C$8.16, or 45 percent, to C$26.28 by late afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange while Exxon shares climbed 87 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $93.25 in New York after earlier touching $93.54, their highest since May 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of other Canadian companies with Western Canadian shale gas holdings also rose. Paramount Resources Ltd was up C$2.34, or 7.4 percent, to C$33.93 in Toronto, while Painted Pony Petroleum Ltd gained 68 Canadian cents, or 6.1 percent, to C$11.40 on the TSX Venture Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the acquisition, Exxon will add 545,000 acres of exploration lands in the Montney region and 104,000 acres of Duvernay properties that Celtic estimates contain 128 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved and probable reserves, three-quarters of which are natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celtic produces 72 million cubic feet of gas per day and 4,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including payments for Celtic's convertible debentures, and Celtic's bank debt and working capital obligations, the deal is valued at C$3.1 billion, Celtic said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal has been unanimously approved by Celtic's board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Euan Rocha in Toronto, Anna Driver in Houston and Ernest Scheyder in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, John Wallace and Sofina Mirza-Reid)&lt;/p&gt;

billion ($2.64 billion), in a deal to raise its presence in some
of Western Canada's most promising shale oil and gas regions.  
    The transaction, announced Wednesday, will give Exxon vast
tracts in the liquids-rich Montney shale gas region in
northeastern British Columbia. It will join other world-scale
energy companies looking to tap Montney's massive reserves to
feed planned liquefied natural gas plants planned for province's
Pacific coast.
    It will also gain a stake in Alberta's promising Duvernay
shale play, an early stage development where peers such as 
Chevron Corp and ConocoPhillips have already
taken big stakes. 
    Exxon and other global oil majors are buying oil and gas
assets in North America as they struggle to boost output in a
sector where vast energy resources are tightly controlled by
countries like Brazil and Russia. 
    Exxon Mobil started a big push into in unconventional
resources like shale with its 2010 purchase of XTO Energy. Since
then, Exxon has steadily added shale gas and shale oil reserves
in North America as it works to boost production.
    "This acquisition will add significant liquids-rich
resources to our existing North American unconventional
portfolio," Andrew Barry, president of ExxonMobil Canada, said
in a statement. 
    In September, Exxon agreed to buy Denbury Resources Inc's
 crude oil properties in the Bakken shale for $1.6
billion. 
    Since it was formed in 2002, Celtic, led by Chief Executive
David Wilson, has focused on finding liquids-rich gas reserves
that fetch a premium compared with dry natural gas and on
acquiring lands in the most promising of Canada's shale regions.
    The Montney region of British Columbia has 450 trillion
cubic feet of gas in place, according the province's government,
though only a fraction of that could be recovered using the
hydraulic fracturing techniques that transformed oil and gas
production elsewhere in North America. 
    The Duvernay shales, a 50,000 square-kilometer (19,300
square-mile) region stretching down the Rocky Mountain foothills
of central Alberta, is estimated by some analysts to contain
more than 750 tcf of liquids-rich gas, enough to support the
ambitions of the world's largest oil companies. 
    "It fits the bill for a company like Exxon," said Matthew
Taylor, an analyst with National Bank Financial. 
    Celtic's "management team is known for its exploration
expertise and they took it to the level where a major (oil
company) can now step in and basically go into gas manufacturing
mode," he said.
    Exxon said its Canadian subsidiary, ExxonMobil Canada, will
pay C$24.50 for each share of Celtic, a 35 percent premium to
Celtic's closing price on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday
but below its 52-week high of C$27.08.  
    And for each common share tendered, Celtic shareholders will
also receive half a share in a new spin-off company led by
Celtic's current management team. The value of the new firm has
yet to be determined.. 
    "As the dust settles around this transaction and (Celtic)
gets out there and talks a bit more about it, we'll see where it
trades," Taylor said. "You would expect a spinco with this
caliber of management to garner a premium."
    The new company will house a gas property at Grand Cache,
Alberta; a liquids-rich natural gas property at Inga, British
Columbia; and an oil prospect at Karr, Alberta.  
    Exxon's bid is the latest in a wave of takeovers in the
energy rich provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, where the
bulk of Celtic's assets are located. 
    The Canadian government is currently reviewing a C$15.1
billion bid by Chinese state-owned oil major CNOOC Ltd 
 for Nexen Inc NXY.TO, as well as a C$5.2 billion bid by
Malaysian state oil company Petronas for Progress
Energy Resources Corp as it also looks for a foothold
in the Montney region.  
    Exxon said that Imperial Oil Ltd, its 70 percent
owned Canadian affiliate, is not participating in the
acquisition but has the option to take a half interest in the
Celtic properties. 
    Imperial said earlier this year it was examining the
potential of developing an LNG plant that could ship gas from
northeastern British Columbia to Asian markets. 
    Celtic shares were up C$8.16, or 45 percent, to C$26.28 by
late afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange while Exxon shares
climbed 87 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $93.25 in New York after
earlier touching $93.54, their highest since May 2008.
    Shares of other Canadian companies with Western Canadian
shale gas holdings also rose. Paramount Resources Ltd 
was up C$2.34, or 7.4 percent, to C$33.93 in Toronto, while
Painted Pony Petroleum Ltd gained 68 Canadian cents, or
6.1 percent, to C$11.40 on the TSX Venture Exchange.
    With the acquisition, Exxon will add 545,000 acres of
exploration lands in the Montney region and 104,000 acres of
Duvernay properties that Celtic estimates contain 128 million
barrels of oil equivalent of proved and probable reserves,
three-quarters of which are natural gas. 
    Celtic produces 72 million cubic feet of gas per day and
4,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids. 
    Including payments for Celtic's convertible debentures, and
Celtic's bank debt and working capital obligations, the deal is
valued at C$3.1 billion, Celtic said in a statement.
    The deal has been unanimously approved by Celtic's board of
directors.

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2004 PNC1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 16 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2004-PNC1 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates (JPMCC 2004-PNC1). A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 3.4% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 6.7%, including losses already incurred. 
      The pool has experienced $48.9 million (4.5% of the original pool 
      balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 17 loans 
      (13.4%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes three specially 
      serviced assets (2.3%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the October 2012 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 33.3% to $733.7 million from $1.1 billion at 
      issuance. Per the servicer reporting, 17 loans (28.4% of the pool) are 
      defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes H through 
      NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is a 236 unit apartment 
      building (0.9% of the pool) located in Arlington, TX. The most recent 
      occupancy reported by the Master Servicer is 68% as of March 2012 and 
      the property is not producing sufficient income to meet its debt service 
      obligations. The loan remains current and the master servicer continues 
      to monitor performance of the loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the 
      specially-serviced 18,900 square foot (sf) office property located in 
      Las Vegas, NV. The loan transferred to the special servicer in June 2011 
      after the borrower indicated its inability to meet its debt service 
      payments due to a progressive decline in revenue and occupancy. The most 
      recent reported occupancy is 12% as of November 2011. A note sale is 
      expected within the current month.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is a 172,758 sf grocery 
      anchored retail center (1.7%) located in Palm Coast, FL. The loan 
      transferred to special servicing in April 2011 for imminent maturity 
      default. The special servicer reports occupancy of 58% as of December 
      2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Sept housing starts surge, buoying homebuilders' stocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Intel and IBM slump after results, weigh on Dow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Bank of America shares volatile in heavy trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow down 0.3 pct, S up 0.2 pct, Nasdaq off 0.2 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The S 500 rose on Wednesday,
putting the benchmark index on track for its third straight day
of gains, as U.S. housing starts hit a four-year high, but weak
results from tech bellwethers curbed the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders' shares climbed after data showed
groundbreaking on new homes jumped 15 percent in September, the
quickest pace since July 2008 - in a sign that the housing
sector's budding recovery is supporting the broader economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both Intel Corp and International Business
Machines Corp tumbled a day after they reported results,
keeping the Dow negative. IBM alone caused a drag of nearly 88
points on the blue-chip average. Intel also pulled on the Nasdaq
100 The S technology sector index lost 1
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel gave a weak fourth-quarter revenue outlook while IBM
posted third-quarter revenue that came in under expectations.
Intel dropped 3.1 percent to $21.65 while IBM lost 5.8 percent
to $198.73. Both were among the biggest drags on the Dow. Intel
also weighed on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America shares slipped 0.5 percent to $9.41
after the second-largest U.S. bank said earnings per share were
break-even and down sharply from the year-ago
period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of M Bank jumped 5 percent to $102.22 after
the company posted third-quarter results, helping push the KBW
Bank index up 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial companies' earnings have yielded mixed results so
far. Earlier this week, results from Citigroup and Goldman
Sachs indicated improvement in the financial sector,
though those reports followed disappointments from JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co and Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings "expectations were extremely conservative, and the
results are just not that bad at all. And whenever people begin
to get too far in one direction - meaning earnings are going to
be terrible - generally reality is better than that, and we are
seeing that now," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of
Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 33.22
points, or 0.25 percent, to 13,518.56. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index gained 2.25 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,457.17.
The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 4.83 points, or 0.15
percent, to 3,096.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the U.S. Commerce Department's report on housing
starts, the PHLX housing index rose 2.5 percent. The
index got a lift from P u lteGroup Inc, up 5.4 percent at
$17.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were very good numbers. It does seem to us that the
housing market really has bottomed. It's not going to roar
higher, but that is a good thing," Ghriskey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 achieved its best two-day advance in a month, a
rise of 1.8 percent through Tuesday's close, on the heels of
last week's drop - its worst weekly decline in four months.
Expectations for a disappointing earnings season, which prompted
the last week's slide, have been tempered this week as more
companies post quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning,
quarterly earnings for S 500 components are now expected to
fall 1.7 percent from a year ago. With 14 percent of S
companies having reported results so far, 64 percent have beaten
Wall Street's earnings expectations - less than the 67 percent
average for the past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apollo Group Inc shares plummeted 20 percent to
$21.99 as the S 500's biggest decliner a day after the
company, the owner of the largest for-profit college in the
United States, gave a weak 2013 outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASML, the world's leading chip gear maker, agreed
to buy Cymer - its key supplier of a light-based
technology crucial to making a new generation of much smaller
and smarter chips - for $2.5 billion. Cymer surged 46.7 percent
to $70.17. In contrast, the U.S.-listed shares of ASML 
dropped 8.8 percent to $48.87.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 17 (IFR) - Goldman Sachs and PNC Bank jumped
into the bond market on Wednesday, coming out with new issues to
take advantage of an investor rush into the red-hot financials
sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both banks announced better-than-expected earnings the
previous day, and are coming to market just as many investors
are furiously scooping up financial issues - not least to
unravel previous bets that the sector's rally would not hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some people have been doubting this recent rally in FIG
(Financial Institutions Group), and have been waiting for weeks
for spreads to back up," David Knutson, senior FIG strategist at
Legal &amp; General Investment Management America, told IFR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But in the last 24 to 48 hours we've seen a new phase in
the rally, because of (investors') capitulation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, FIG spreads have been tightening across the board,
even for names like Bank of America, which didn't wow the market
with its third-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is exactly what we thought would happen," said Michael
Collins, a chief investment officer at Prudential, whose team
bet on BoA bonds when they were at their widest last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big question now is whether the FIG sector can trade on
top or through the industrial sector," Collins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And I would argue yes, because banks should be seen as
something of a safe haven from event risk in industrial names."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and PNC are both
marketing new issues to top up their capital for regulatory
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is looking to do a benchmark-sized tier 1 perpetual
preferred non-cumulative issue in the US$25 par retail market,
and PNC Bank a US$1bn Tier II 10-year subordinated offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT, UP TIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest wave of FIG tightening began on Monday. Although
that is partly due to the insatiable demand for yield driving
corporate bonds tighter this week, some also see the thirst for
FIG as driven by traders who were short the sector and are being
forced by investment committees to cover those shorts before the
typical pre-holiday slowdown in November and December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs 5.75% 2022s tightened in 19bp on Wednesday
morning to 163bp, and are 31bp tighter since Friday's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America's 5.7% 2022s were 17bp tighter on Wednesday
morning at 124bp, from a Friday close of 155bp. The 22s were
340bp over Treasuries at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BoA's 5% 2021s were trading at 130bp on Wednesday, a
whopping 275bp tighter than the 405bp spread it traded at in
October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, FIG spreads overall are just a hair's breadth away
from trading through industrials again, as they had always done
before the onset of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Barclays Corporate Index, the FIG sector's
spread was 159bp at Tuesday's close - just 36bp away from the
159bp spread on the Barclays sub-index for industrials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already FIG's option-adjusted spread of 159bp in the
Barclays index is trading tighter than some sub-indexes of the
industrial sector, such as Basic Industry (178.6bp), and is
close to trading on top of Communications (152.9bp) and
Transportation (149.9bp).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early October last year the FIG spread of 361bp was a
massive 163bp wider than the 198bp spread for industrials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, many investors believe there's room for further
tightening still, especially given the continued chase for yield
and the flushing out of traders who still had shorts on certain
financial names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can bank spreads tighten to the point where the financial
sector regains its pre-crisis status as a blue-chip sector that
trades tighter than the industrial sector?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fundamentally banks are in very good shape," Prudential's
Collins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Industrials have exposure to a drop in exports as Europe
slows, and are more likely to leverage up than banks as they
look to return value to shareholders via share buybacks when
earnings are subdued in a slow growth environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors are even looking for higher-beta FIG names,
like European peripheral bank debt in dollars and euros, as well
as obscure European financials like LeasePlan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dutch bank debuted in the Yankee market on Monday with a
US$500m five-year issue - after attracting a stunning US$2.5bn
of orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the kind of name you wouldn't have bothered picking
up the phone for a month ago," one investor said. "And now
everyone wants it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other related fixed-income quotations, stories and

&lt;p&gt;* Housing starts surge in Sept, lifting homebuilders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Intel and IBM slump after results, weigh on Dow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Bank of America shares volatile in heavy trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow down 0.09 pct, S up 0.28 pct, Nasdaq up 0.09 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The S 500 rose on Wednesday,
heading for its third straight day of gains, as U.S. housing
starts hit a four-year high, but weak results from tech
bellwethers weighed on the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders climbed after data showed groundbreaking on new
homes jumped 15 percent in September, the quickest pace since
July 2008 and a sign the housing sector was supporting the 
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Intel Corp and IBM tumbled a day after
they reported results, keeping the Dow negative. IBM alone
caused a 66-point drag on the blue chip average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel gave a weak fourth-quarter revenue outlook while IBM
posted third-quarter revenue that came in under expectations.
Intel dropped 2.7 percent to $21.75 while IBM lost 4.3 percent
to $201.85. Both were among the biggest drags on the Dow and
Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America swung between small losses and small
gains in heavy, volatile trading after it said per-share
earnings were break-even and down sharply compared with the
previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But M Bank jumped 5 percent to $102.27 after
posting third-quarter results, helping to lift the KBW Bank
index 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings among financial stocks have yielded mixed results
thus far. Earlier this week, results from Citigroup and
Goldman Sachs indicated improvement in the group, though
those reports followed disappointments from JPMorgan Chase
 and Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems like it's a classic earnings period reaction.
Either people are too exuberant and expectations are raised too
high to beat when the actual number comes out or people are too
pessimistic and the earnings are just not as low," said Rick
Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital
Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the housing starts report the PHLX housing index
 rose 3.5 percent, led by a 4.9 percent climb in DR Horton
Inc to $21.69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The housing number gave people some confidence that maybe
we are moving in the right direction economically, so it's one
of those days where the glass seems half full more than half
empty." said Meckler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S just notched its best two-day advance in a month, a
rise of 1.8 percent, on the heels of its worst weekly decline in
four months. Expectations for a disappointing earnings season,
which prompted the decline, have been dampened this week as more
companies post quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 11.98
points, or 0.09 percent, to 13,539.80. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index gained 4.14 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,459.06.
The Nasdaq Composite Index added 2.88 points, or 0.09
percent, to 3,104.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning,
earnings for S 500 components are expected to decline 1.7
percent from a year ago. With 14 percent of S companies having
reported, 64 percent have beaten earnings expectations, less
than the 67 percent average for the past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apollo Group Inc plummeted 18.2 percent to $22.49
as the S's biggest decliner a day after giving a weak 2013
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASML agreed to buy Cymer, its key
supplier of a light-based technology crucial to making a new
generation of much smaller chips, for $2.5 billion. Cymer surged
55.9 percent to $74.55 while U.S.-listed shares of ASML shed 4.3
percent to $51.30.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;A number of stocks were upgraded and downgraded by equities research analysts today, as reported by Analyst Ratings Network (http://bit.ly/equitybriefdaily) and Equity Brief:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;FBR Capital raised its price target on shares of Goldman Sachs (GS) from $130.00 to $145.00. They have an outperform rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale downgraded shares of IBM (IBM) from a hold rating to a sell rating. They wrote, "With a negative 12m projected TSR of -9% (unchanged $188 TP + a $3.18 forward dividend) and no indication that the tide is turning positive we cut our rating from Hold to Sell. . Revenue miss is a worry as this is the fifth quarter in a row. Despite its revenue shortfall, IBM continued to deliver in line earnings and maintained its FY guidance, showing a strong ability to manage costs. Software acquisitions and new hardware products should help in Q4 12. . Sluggish spending environment in North America is a concern because the deceleration seems to be gathering pace in this region."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Janney Montgomery Scott downgraded shares of IBM (IBM) from a buy rating to a neutral rating.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Susquehanna downgraded shares of Imax Corporation (IMAX) from a positive rating to a neutral rating.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Zacks downgraded shares of Intel (INTC) from a neutral rating to an underperform rating. Their analysts now have a $20.00 price target on the stock. Zacks' analyst wrote, "We are downgrading Intel shares from Neutral to Underperform following the company's lowered expectations for the next quarter. We think that weakness in mature markets, economic headwinds in some emerging markets, and pressure from tablets and other competitors are taking a toll on the company. We think current trends overshadow Intel's $0.04 positive surprise versus the Zacks Consensus in the second quarter that was driven by strength in server and software businesses and supported by a moderate PC business. However, we remain positive about Intel's dominance in the high-margin server segment and promise of success in the mobile segment, although competition from ARM-based devices continues to intensify. We believe that Ultrabooks and Win-8 are wild cards this holiday season and could skew results either way. "&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Oct. 17, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Versant Corporation (Nasdaq:VSNT), a worldwide leader in developing data management software infrastructure for complex, mission-critical applications, today announced the general availability of Versant JPA, a Java-based API that supports high-performance database and analytics operations for the new era of Big Data applications. The new release greatly reduces the cost and risks of migration to other proprietary NoSQL technologies by being fully compliant with the latest JPA specifications, and offers several unique features, including the industry's first solution for zero-downtime schema changes, a Java standards-based analytics framework, and compliance with the highly popular JBoss Application Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Versant JPA's Java standards-based API allows developers to use existing coding skills to process previously unmanageable Big Data sets, and perform highly complex operations at speeds and scales unmatched by any other NoSQL technology. Enterprises can visit Versant's website now to learn more about how Versant JPA's Java-based interface can immediately tackle Big Data's challenges without the vendor lock-in risks of having to learn proprietary NoSQL programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Versant JPA server adds several features that were built based on direct feedback from thousands of Versant users around the world, and which expand on the original Java Persistence API's capabilities to offer true one-of-a-kind functionality. Foremost among these new features is Versant's Application Evolution, a first of its kind technology that ensures zero application downtime during schema modifications, allowing enterprises to seamlessly change application data models without impacting customer experiences due to restarts. Additionally, the Versant JPA server is compliant with the extremely popular JBoss Application Server, which is also Java standards-based, and ships with an Eclipse IDE plugin that allows for easy code development, offering enterprises further protection against vendor lock-in and future upgrade complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Despite society's always-on expectations, many enterprises still accept application downtime as an unavoidable side effect of migrating to Big Data technologies, or updating applications," said Carl Olofson, Research Vice President, Application Development and Deployment, IDC. "Enterprises also tend to equate Big Data with Big Money, and when economic uncertainty is still very high, they need ways to save while still enabling innovation. Standards-based, open source NoSQL technologies are rare, but they are hugely important for combatting both of these challenges, and for allowing enterprises to handle Big Data's inherently uncertain future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Versant JPA SDK also includes multiple technical previews that allow enterprises to take a large step toward implementing a complete Big Data architecture. Technical previews shipped in the Versant JPA SDK include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		Versant's Hadoop Connector, which allows enterprises to easily ingest data from a map/reduce process into their datastores.
			
		Versant's R-Integration, which enables enterprises to import data into the hugely popular open-source R analytics framework to perform statistical analysis.
			
		Versant's Java-based analytics framework, a fast, scalable, and sophisticated way for enterprises to ingest, transform, and efficiently aggregate data from multiple sources into existing data models.
		&lt;p&gt;
	"We put a high premium on quality and stress testing, so when we release new functionalities like this, we are confident they not only deliver what we promise, but that they perform very well," said Versant's Vice President of Technology, Robert Greene. "Our users are extremely loyal, and we in turn strive to provide them the features they need and ensure our solutions deliver outstanding performance.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 17 - Overview
     -- Greece-based beverage group Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. S.A.
 (CCH) has announced a voluntary exchange offer, which, if successful,
would involve the CCH group moving its domicile from Greece to Switzerland.
     -- We understand that this move is subject to a 90% shareholder 
acceptance as part of the voluntary share exchange offer.
     -- We are therefore keeping our 'BBB+/A-2' corporate credit ratings on 
CCH on CreditWatch negative, where they were initially placed on June 7, 2012.
     -- The CreditWatch negative primarily reflects the uncertainty 
surrounding the outcome of the transaction. 
Rating Action
On Oct. 17, 2012, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services kept its 'BBB+' long-term 
and 'A-2' short-term corporate credit ratings on Greece-based beverage group 
Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. S.A. (CCH) on CreditWatch with negative 
implications, where they were initially placed on June 7, 2012.

At the same time, we also kept our 'BBB' issue rating on CCH's senior 
unsecured debt on CreditWatch negative.

Rationale
The ongoing CreditWatch reflects our understanding that the group's announced 
change of domicile to Switzerland from Greece, and its subsequent listing on 
the London Stock Exchange (LSE), is subject to a 90% shareholder acceptance as 
part of a voluntary share exchange offer. We understand that 60.7% of shares 
have already been irrevocably tendered for exchange. In addition, the group 
may make a cash consideration as part of the transaction, which it intends to 
refinance. While we view these strategic management changes as positive from a 
credit perspective, the CreditWatch also reflects execution risk due to 
potentially volatile capital markets. The CreditWatch also incorporates our 
assessment of economic and political pressures in Greece (Hellenic Republic; 
CCC/Negative/C) and the potential negative implications for CCH in the event 
of a Greek exit from the eurozone (European Economic and Monetary Union or 
EMU). 

Our ratings on CCH are based on the group's stand-alone credit profile (SACP), 
combined with our view of implicit and extraordinary support from The 
Coca-Cola Co. (Coke; AA-/Stable/A-1+). CCH's SACP is based on our assessment 
of its "intermediate" financial risk profile and "satisfactory" business risk 
profile, as our criteria define these terms. We note that as part of the 
transaction, CCH's bottling agreements will be extended in full until 2023.

We note that CCH derives less than 10% of its earnings from Greece. Our 
criteria states that the ratings on CCH should not therefore be capped by the 
Greek sovereign rating. (See "Nonsovereign Ratings That Exceed EMU Sovereign 
Ratings: Methodology And Assumptions", published June 14, 2011, on 
RatingsDirect on the Global Credit Portal.) 

Continued weak consumer sentiment in southern Europe and potential input cost 
volatility are likely, in our view, to challenge CCH's profitability and 
volumes in 2013. In 2012 the group's profitability has continued to face 
pressure, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2011.

Liquidity
The short-term rating on CCH is 'A-2'. This reflects our long-term corporate 
credit rating on the group, as well as our view of CCH's liquidity as 
"adequate" under our criteria. We assess that liquidity sources will cover 
liquidity uses by at least 1.2x over the next 12 months. We estimate that 
CCH's liquidity sources over the next 12 months comprise:
     -- Cash and cash equivalents of EUR466 million at the end of June 2012;
     -- An undrawn EUR500 million committed credit facility maturing in 2016; 
and 
     -- Unadjusted funds from operations (FFO) of about EUR600 million (adjusted
FFO of about EUR650 million).

We estimate that CCH's liquidity uses over the next 12 months comprise:
     -- Short-term debt of close to EUR264.7 million at the end of June 2012;
     -- Capital expenditures of between EUR450 million and EUR500 million;
     -- A $500 million bond maturity in September 2013; and
     -- A dividend or capital return to shareholders of between EUR100 million 
and EUR150 million.

If the share exchange offer is successful the following facilities will also 
be available:

     -- A EUR550 million acquisition facility to be used to fund any cash 
consideration required as part of a compulsory buyout. This new facility 
matures in July 2014 or, if earlier, 18 months after the Swiss holding company 
issues a prospectus relating to admittance of the new shares to the LSE. 
     -- A EUR500 million revolving loan facility to be used for general 
corporate purposes, only if it is needed to replace the existing credit 
facility. This new facility matures in July 2014 or, if earlier, 18 months 
after the Swiss holding company issues a prospectus relating to admittance of 
the new shares to the LSE.
     -- A EUR500 million facility to be used if needed to refinance the group's 
long-term debt. This facility matures on either the date that the acquisition 
facility matures or in March 2014, whichever is later.

We note that there are no financial covenants under any of the facilities, 
including those in place prior to the exchange offer and those put in place as 
part of the exchange offer.

If the share exchange offer is unsuccessful and the group is unable to 
refinance its upcoming debt maturities, the "adequate" liquidity position 
could come under pressure.

CreditWatch
The ongoing CreditWatch primarily reflects the uncertainty surrounding the 
change of domicile and the LSE listing. If these can be successfully 
addressed, the future rating direction will depend on CCH's operating 
performance and support from Coke. If there is insufficient shareholder 
acceptance, a multi-notch downgrade could still be possible as a result of 
risks associated with Greece exiting the eurozone and the potential impact of 
Greek government policies on CCH's business and financial environment. As the 
exchange offer is subject to a shareholder agreement, we view the above risks 
as applicable to our analysis.

The ratings could also come under pressure if there is a deterioration in the 
group's operating performance. This could occur if continued weak consumer 
sentiment in Europe and/or input cost inflation put pressure on the group's 
volumes and/or margins. In addition, we could lower the ratings if CCH does 
not maintain an "adequate" liquidity position.

Furthermore, because the ratings on CCH incorporate our assumption of support 
from Coke, we could lower our ratings on CCH if we see deterioration in Coke's 
credit quality, a change in the level of implicit support from Coke, or a 
change in the mix of implicit and extraordinary support from Coke.

We aim to resolve the CreditWatch once we have more information about the 
success of the exchange and we have clarity about the amount and method of 
potential refinancing of any cash consideration. A successful exchange would 
likely reduce the downward rating pressure on resolution of the CreditWatch. 
If the exchange is unsuccessful, downward rating pressure would likely be 
greater; that said, assuming liquidity remains "adequate," we consider it 
unlikely that the ratings will fall into the speculative-grade category under 
such a scenario.

      for multiple trunks between mediation servers and gateways, intertrunk 
      routing that enables Lync Server to support different phone systems and 
      manage/delegate simultaneous ring and caller ID presentation, and Video 
      Gallery view to support up to five simultaneous video streams.

      mailboxes, use regular mailbox databases and can be integrated with a 
      database availability group for disaster recovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Cross Server Integration &#8211; such as Site Mailboxes which bring 
      Exchange emails and SharePoint documents together, a shared eDiscovery 
      center used by all three products, FAST search in Exchange for a more 
      consistent indexing and searching experience, a unified contact store 
      (between Exchange and Lync) and the Lync archiving connection to 
      Exchange Litigation Hold.

&lt;p&gt;* Societe Generale, Janney Capital cut ratings on IBM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* BMO cuts price target to $218 from $222&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares down 4 percent premarket&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 17 (Reuters) - IBM Corp's fifth consecutive
quarterly revenue miss prompted at least two brokerages to cut
their ratings on the company's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of IBM, considered a bellwether for the global
enterprise IT sector, were down 4 percent at $202.50 before the
bell on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp's third-quarter revenue
missed estimates as customers put off spending on big ticket
items and also due to a stronger dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sluggish spending environment in North America is a concern
because the deceleration seems to be gathering pace, Societe
Generale analyst Richard Nguyen said. Revenue from the Americas,
which accounts for 42 percent of total revenue, fell 4 percent
in the quarter ended Sept. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nguyen cut his rating on the stock to "sell" from "hold".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other large countries also disappointed in the
quarter, with Mexico and Australia "both down double digits,"
the company said on a conference call on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's results face headwinds in the short term from more
than just macro factors as its business services revenue -- 18
percent of total revenue -- has declined in the last three
quarters despite stable demand from Japan, one of its major
overseas markets, Janney Capital Markets analyst Joseph Foresi
wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lowered his rating on the stock to "neutral" from "buy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services revenue growth remains challenged and management's
commentary around future growth was fairly subdued, Robert W.
Baird &amp; Co said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Securities analyst John DiFucci said "IBM's ...
lackluster growth are a cautionary sign for business momentum in
the software sector, especially given management's comments
around a weak September and slipped deals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's roadmap to achieve a profit of $20 per share for
financial year 2015 depends much on cost cuts and share buyback
programs, rather than revenue growth, BMO Capital Markets
analyst Keith Bachman said. The company reported a profit of
$13.44 per share for 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Credit Suisse said IBM's transition to higher-value
services, increased operational efficiency and targeted M
should allow for a steady march to $20 per share in earnings, if
not more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has shifted its focus to higher-margin software
and services from tech products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS Investment Research raiseed its price target on the
stock to $210 from $203.&lt;/p&gt;

			Grupo FSM Chooses Esker for Invoice Automation in a Microsoft 
      Dynamics NAV Environment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capturing supplier invoices, sending electronic invoices and 
      digitizing delivery notes for a more efficient and streamlined process
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Esker, 
      a world leader in document 
      process automation solutions, has announced that its technology will 
      be used by Grupo 
      F&#233;lix Santiago Meli&#225;n (FSM) for a centralized automated invoicing 
      solution that will operate in a Microsoft 
      Dynamics NAV environment and serve all group companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To promote how users of MS Dynamics solutions can leverage a single 
      platform to automate multiple business processes, Esker will be 
      exhibiting at Booth #340 in Seattle, WA, at the AXUG 
      Summit (Oct. 17-19), GPUG 
      Summit (Oct. 17-19) and NAVUG 
      Forum (Oct. 16-18). Attendees will recognize the Esker booth by its 
      puzzle theme and &#8220;All the Pieces, One Automated Platform&#8221; messaging.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Seeking a new solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prior to Esker, FSM received all of its supplier invoices via paper, 
      half of which were for transactions between companies in the group, with 
      a total volume of 2,300 per month. Of these, 95% were delivered in 
      person. Additionally, the group manually processed around 750 customer 
      invoices and 8,000 delivery notes per month, with an invoice date before 
      the 5th of each month.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In order to streamline its document transaction process, FSM will 
      integrate the Esker solution into the MS Dynamics NAV application 
      environment. Supplier invoices will be captured with a workflow that 
      involves two approval levels: 1) Sending electronic invoices and 
      corresponding delivery notes to customers; and 2) Digitizing delivery 
      notes to be sent with invoices and digitally archived.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Considering the variety of businesses that FSM operates, it was crucial 
      to automate the workflows that support financial management, such as our 
      invoices and all related documents,&#8221; said Pedro Cubas, CFO of FSM.
			&#8220;Esker 
      is a great partner for simplifying entire management processes and 
      finding business efficiency points, which cuts costs and saves time.
			Now, 
      our new paperless way of working allows us to be much more efficient in 
      our day-to-day transactions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Supplier invoices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To better manage its supplier invoices, FSM expects the new solution to 
      streamline its approval processes, reduce paper handling and errors, 
      shorten payment cycles, and trim down administrative tasks. 
      Simultaneously, it will free up office space, provide a single point of 
      access for all documents, allow greater flexibility in searching for 
      invoices, and lessen the likelihood of losing documents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To that end, the Esker 
      DeliveryWare solution, which is integrated into the FSM management 
      system, consists of four key functional units: reception and 
      digitization, document capture and data extraction, data validation, and 
      data and document loading.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Customer Invoices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The use of digitized invoices and digital signatures will allow FSM to 
      send official customer invoices by email, meaning invoices can be sent 
      and received faster. In addition, this will decrease the number of 
      errors, lower costs, improve productivity by assigning more strategic 
      tasks to employees, provide access to documents from a single point, and 
      improve efficiency when searching for invoices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the Esker solution, invoices are generated within MS Dynamics NAV 
      and then printed by a virtual printer that forwards them directly to 
      Esker, where they are processed according to rules specific to invoice 
      type. The information is then matched with delivery note information and 
      grouped to be sent by email, with a digital signature and the FSM 
      company seal, to the end customer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Visa Estimates $109.1 Trillion in Global Commercial Spend in 2011
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tweet this: #Visa estimates global commercial spend surpassed $100 
      trillion for the first time ever @VisaNews
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today released the annual global Commercial 
      Consumption Expenditure (CCE) index, which estimates that global 
      commercial spending reached $109.1 trillion in 2011. This represents 12 
      percent growth from the $97.4 trillion spent in 2010 and marks the first 
      time since Visa created the CCE in 2004 that this spending surpassed 
      $100 trillion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The strongest year-over-year growth rates came from Latin 
      America/Caribbean region (19.4 percent), followed by Central/Eastern 
      Europe, Middle East Africa region (17.4 percent) and Asia Pacific region 
      (14.9 percent). Asia Pacific reported the largest share of global CCE 
      spend, followed by Europe, the United States, Central/Eastern Europe, 
      Middle East and Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, and Canada. In this 
      year&#8217;s (2011) index, Asia Pacific&#8217;s spending share surpassed Europe&#8217;s 
      for the second consecutive year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Despite a slow, but sustained economic recovery, we continue to see 
      healthy expansion in commercial spending,&#8221; said Tad Fordyce, head of 
      global Commercial Solutions, Visa Inc. &#8220;Underneath this growth lies a 
      clear opportunity for financial institutions to optimize their 
      commercial card programs to capture more spend with electronic payments 
      and ultimately better meet the needs of their commercial and government 
      clients.&#8221;

			CCE Methodology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The annual Visa CCE report provides standardized tracking of business 
      and government spending globally and is recognized as an industry 
      benchmark for measuring commercial spending. The CCE index captures 
      business-to-business purchases to acquire goods and services used in 
      production, wholesale and retail purchases of final goods, business 
      capital expenditures, and government spending on goods and services. 
      Adjustments are made to exclude capitalized expenditures such as 
      construction and durable defense spending. Calculations measure 
      transactions at basic prices, which include taxes on production. 
      Retroactive adjustments are made as necessary to include revisions in 
      officially published statistics and economic data for current and prior 
      years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Data sources used to calculate the U.S. CCE index include the Bureau of 
      Economic Analysis (BEA) and U.S. Census Bureau, which conducts the 
      Retail and Wholesale Trade Surveys. A variety of data sources were used 
      in the calculation of the Global CCE index including the Organization 
      for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Eurostat database, 
      the STructural ANalysis (STAN) database, the General Government Accounts 
      from the National Accounts of OECD Countries, the United Nations 
      Statistics Division National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, 
      Economist Intelligence Unit proprietary databases, and government data 
      from several countries. A model developed by the Economist Intelligence 
      Unit was used to estimate results for countries where government data 
      was unavailable.

&lt;p&gt;  CALGARY, ALBERTA, Oct 17 (MARKET WIRE) --
Exxon Mobil Corporation ("ExxonMobil") (NYSE:XOM) and Celtic Exploration
Ltd. ("Celtic") (TSX:CLT) today announced that Canadian affiliates of
ExxonMobil, including Exxon Mobil Canada Ltd. ("ExxonMobil Canada"), and
Celtic have entered into an agreement for the purchase by a subsidiary of
ExxonMobil Canada of all of Celtic's outstanding common shares at a cash
price of C$24.50 per share. Additionally, Celtic shareholders will
receive 0.5 of a share of a new company, 1705972 Alberta Ltd. ("Spinco"),
for each Celtic common share.

    Including the amount to be paid for Celtic's outstanding convertible
debentures and including Celtic's bank debt and working capital
obligations, the transaction is valued at approximately C$3.1 billion
(excluding the estimated value of Spinco shares). The transaction is to
be completed by way of an arrangement under the Business Corporations Act
(Alberta). 

    Highlights


--  Cash price is C$24.50 per Celtic share 
--  Celtic shareholders also receive 0.5 of a share of a new company to be
    led by Celtic's current management team 
--  Transaction has received the unanimous approval of Celtic's Board of
    Directors 


    Based on the cash consideration (not including the value of Spinco
shares), the transaction price represents a premium of 35% over Celtic's
closing share price on the Toronto Stock Exchange of C$18.12 on October
16, 2012, and 34% over Celtic's 30-trading day volume weighted average
trading price of C$18.28 per share ending on October 16, 2012.

    Information regarding the Transaction

    Following an extensive review and analysis of the proposed transaction
and consideration of other available alternatives, the Board of Directors
of Celtic has unanimously determined that the arrangement is in the best
interests of Celtic and is fair to Celtic's securityholders. The Board of
Directors of Celtic has unanimously approved the transaction and
determined to recommend that Celtic's shareholders and debentureholders
vote in favour of the arrangement. Each of the officers and directors of
Celtic, representing in aggregate approximately 17.5% of the outstanding
common shares (on a fully diluted basis), have entered into lock-up
agreements with ExxonMobil Canada supporting the transaction, pursuant to
which they have agreed to vote their common shares and convertible
debentures held in favour of the approval of the arrangement.

    The Board of Directors of Celtic has received from each of FirstEnergy
Capital Corp. and RBC Capital Markets, opinions that, as of the date of
the arrangement agreement, the consideration to be paid to Celtic's
shareholders and debentureholders is fair from a financial point of view
to Celtic's securityholders.

    The agreement between ExxonMobil Canada and Celtic provides for, among
other things, a non-solicitation covenant on the part of Celtic, subject
to "fiduciary out" provisions that entitle Celtic to consider and accept
a superior proposal and a right in favour of ExxonMobil Canada to match
any superior proposal. The arrangement agreement provides for a C$90.0
million termination fee payable by Celtic in certain circumstances if the
transaction is not completed.

    Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions,
including receipt of court, shareholder and regulatory approvals,
including under the Investment Canada Act and Competition Act. Celtic's
securityholders will be asked to vote on the transaction at a special
securityholders meeting and the completion of the transaction will
require the approval of two-thirds of the votes cast by shareholders in
person or by proxy at the meeting. 

    Under the proposed transaction, the holders of the Celtic convertible
unsecured subordinated debentures outstanding will receive Celtic common
shares, including shares pursuant to the make whole payments provided
under the terms of the debentures in total equal to the amount they would
otherwise receive, following the completion of the arrangement if they
were not acquired under the arrangement, plus accrued interest to the
closing date, plus additional interest for 32 days. The Celtic common
shares received by debentureholders under the arrangement will be
exchanged, as part of the arrangement, for the same $24.50 in cash and
0.5 of a Spinco share to be received by other holders of Celtic common
shares.

    Celtic's debentureholders will be asked to vote on the arrangement;
however, completion of the arrangement is not conditional on their
approval. If debentureholder approval is not obtained, the debentures
will be excluded from the arrangement and will remain outstanding
following completion of the arrangement and continue to be governed by
the terms of their indenture.

    An information circular regarding the arrangement is expected to be
mailed to securityholders in late November for a special meeting of the
holders of common shares and debentures to take place in late December,
with closing expected to occur as soon as reasonably practicable
following the securityholder vote and regulatory approval. 

    A copy of the arrangement agreement and the information circular and
related documents will be filed with Canadian securities regulators and
will be available at www.sedar.com. 

    FirstEnergy Capital Corp. and RBC Capital Markets have each provided the
Board of Directors of Celtic with a fairness opinion regarding the
proposed transaction for the shareholders and debentureholders. A copy of
each opinion will be included in the information circular to be sent to
Celtic securityholders for the special meeting to be called to consider
the arrangement. Borden Ladner Gervais LLP is acting as legal counsel to
Celtic.

    The forward-looking statements and information are based on certain key
expectations and assumptions made by Celtic, including, but not limited
to, expectations and assumptions concerning the ability to obtain all
required regulatory approvals for the transaction, including, but not
limited to, shareholder, Court and regulatory approvals. Although Celtic
believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such
forward-looking statements and information are based are reasonable,
undue reliance should not be placed on the forward looking statements and

correct.

    Since forward-looking statements and information address future events

changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or
capital expenditures; the uncertainty of reserve and resource estimates;
health, safety and environmental risks; commodity price and exchange rate

    Measurements and Abbreviations

    All dollar amounts are referenced in Canadian dollars, except when noted
otherwise. Where amounts are expressed on a barrel of oil equivalent
("BOE") basis, natural gas volumes have been converted to oil equivalence
at six thousand cubic feet per barrel and sulphur volumes have been
converted to oil equivalence at 0.6 long tons per barrel. The term BOE
may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion
ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel is based on an energy
equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and
does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. References to
"oil" in this discussion include crude oil and natural gas liquids
("NGLs"). NGLs include condensate, pentane, propane, butane and ethane.
References to "gas" in this discussion include natural gas and sulphur.

    This release does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation
of an offer to sell any security, or a solicitation of votes with respect
to any security. Celtic securityholders are urged to read the information
circular carefully before making any decision with respect to the
arrangement.

		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil Canada today announced an agreement with Celtic Exploration 
      Ltd. (&#8220;Celtic&#8221;) under which an ExxonMobil Canada affiliate will acquire 
      Celtic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the agreement, ExxonMobil Canada will acquire 545,000 
      net acres in the liquids-rich Montney shale, 104,000 net acres in the 
      Duvernay shale and additional acreage in other areas of Alberta.

      Current production of the acreage to be acquired is 72 million cubic 
      feet per day of natural gas and 4,000 barrels per day of crude, 
      condensate and natural gas liquids. The assets were estimated by 
      Calgary-based Celtic Exploration at December 31, 2011 to include an 
      estimated 128 million oil equivalent barrels of proved plus probable 
      reserves, of which 24 percent are crude, condensate and natural gas 
      liquids and 76 percent natural gas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;This acquisition will add significant liquids-rich resources to our 
      existing North American unconventional portfolio,&#8221; said Andrew Barry,

      producer which has expertise in developing tight gas, shale oil and gas 
      and coal bed methane.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said its kidney cancer drug did not meet the main goal of showing a statistically significant improvement in survival in a late-stage trial without the cancer getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial was testing the drug Inlyta in patients who have received no prior treatments and compared its effects with another kidney cancer drug, sorafenib. Inlyta is already approved to treat kidney cancer that has not responded to prior therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorafenib is marketed as Nexavar by Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc and Germany's Bayer AG.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Announces Top-line Results From Phase 3 Trial Of INLYTA&#174; 
      (axitinib) In Treatment-Na&#239;ve Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today that a Phase 3 study of INLYTA&#174; 
      (axitinib) did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating 
      statistically significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS), 
      versus sorafenib, in treatment-na&#239;ve patients with advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A preliminary review of the data showed that overall the median PFS for 
      INLYTA exceeded the median PFS for sorafenib, but did not meet 
      statistical significance. In a pre-specified subgroup of patients 
      classified as good Performance Status (ECOG PS 0), the median PFS for 
      INLYTA exceeded the median PFS for sorafenib. In another pre-specified 
      subgroup of patients classified as intermediate Performance Status (ECOG 
      PS 1), there was no difference between INLYTA and sorafenib.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Adverse events for INLYTA were generally consistent with previous 
      findings in INLYTA patients with advanced RCC who had been treated with 
      a prior systemic therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These data will be further analyzed and presented at an upcoming medical 
      congress.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We narrowly missed the primary endpoint in this trial,&#8221; said Dr. Mace 
      Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical development and medical 
      affairs for Pfizer's Oncology Business Unit. &#8220;We are analyzing the study 
      findings to determine whether further evaluation of INLYTA in specific 
      subpopulations of treatment-na&#239;ve patients with advanced RCC would be 
      warranted.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AGILE 1051, a trial of more than 280 treatment-na&#239;ve patients with 
      advanced RCC, was powered to show a 78 percent improvement in PFS 
      benefit with INLYTA over sorafenib. The primary endpoint of the study 
      was PFS. The secondary endpoints of the study included overall survival, 
      response rate and safety. Pre-specified subgroups were also analyzed and 
      included patients with either good Performance Status (ECOG PS 0) or 
      intermediate Performance Status (ECOG PS 1). ECOG performance status is 
      a standard measure used to assess functional status of patients and 
      these were stratification factors at randomization.

      Earlier this year, INLYTA was approved for patients with previously 
      treated advanced RCC in the U.S., EU, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Korea, 
      and Australia. In its registrational Phase 3 AXIS trial, INLYTA 
      significantly extended PFS with a median PFS of 6.7 months as compared 
      to 4.7 months for those treated with sorafenib. The differences in PFS 
      observed in the subgroups in the AXIS trial favored INLYTA over 
      sorafenib, including in the ECOG PS 0 and ECOG PS 1 subgroups.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We set a high bar in our INLYTA trials to understand how it compares to 
      another VEGF-targeted therapy,&#8221; said Dr. Rothenberg. &#8220;Since approval, 
      INLYTA has established its utility in the second-line setting where it 
      is an important treatment option for many patients with advanced kidney 
      cancer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Pfizer is also investigating axitinib in the AGILE 1046 study, a 
      randomized Phase 2 clinical trial in treatment-na&#239;ve patients with 
      advanced RCC. Blinded efficacy data from this ongoing study were 
      presented at ASCO earlier this year. Axitinib is also being studied in a 
      randomized Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC), which is currently closed to enrollment. Additionally, 
      under a collaborative development agreement between Pfizer and SFJ 
      Pharma Ltd. II, SFJ is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in Asia 
      studying axitinib for adjuvant treatment of patients at high risk of 
      recurrent RCC following nephrectomy (kidney removal).

			About INLYTA&#174; (axitinib)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INLYTA is indicated for the treatment of advanced RCC after failure of 
      one prior systemic therapy. INLYTA, a kinase inhibitor, is an oral 
      therapy that is designed to inhibit tyrosine kinases, including vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2 and 3; these receptors 
      can influence tumor growth, vascular angiogenesis and progression of 
      cancer (the spread of tumors).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important INLYTA&#174; (axitinib) Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hypertension including hypertensive crisis has been observed. Blood 
      pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor 
      for hypertension and treat as needed. For persistent hypertension, 
      despite use of antihypertensive medications, reduce the dose. 
      Discontinue INLYTA if hypertension is severe and persistent despite use 
      of antihypertensive therapy and dose reduction of INLYTA, and 
      discontinuation should be considered if there is evidence of 
      hypertensive crisis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arterial and venous thrombotic events have been observed and can be 
      fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk or who 
      have a history of these events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have been reported. INLYTA 
      has not been studied in patients with evidence of untreated brain 
      metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be 
      used in those patients. If any bleeding requires medical intervention, 
      temporarily interrupt the INLYTA dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, including death, have 
      occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal 
      perforation or fistula. Monitor for symptoms of gastrointestinal 
      perforation or fistula periodically throughout treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement has been reported. 
      Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically 
      throughout, treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stop INLYTA at least 24 hours prior to scheduled surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been 
      observed. If signs or symptoms occur, permanently discontinue treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Monitor for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically 
      throughout, treatment. For moderate-to-severe proteinuria, reduce the 
      dose or temporarily interrupt treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liver enzyme elevation has been observed during treatment with INLYTA. 
      Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
      (AST), and bilirubin before initiation of, and periodically throughout, 
      treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the starting dose should 
      be decreased. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe 
      hepatic impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to 
      the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving INLYTA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors. If unavoidable, reduce the dose. 
      Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase INLYTA plasma 
      concentrations and should be avoided.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inducers and, if possible, avoid moderate CYP3A4/5 
      inducers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common (&#8805;20%) adverse events (AEs) occurring in patients 
      receiving INLYTA (all grades, vs sorafenib) were diarrhea, hypertension, 
      fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, dysphonia, hand-foot syndrome, 
      weight decreased, vomiting, asthenia, and constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common (&#8805;10%) grade 3/4 AEs occurring in patients receiving 
      INLYTA (vs sorafenib) were hypertension, diarrhea, and fatigue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common (&#8805;20%) lab abnormalities occurring in patients receiving 
      INLYTA (all grades, vs sorafenib) included increased creatinine, 
      decreased bicarbonate, hypocalcemia, decreased hemoglobin, decreased 
      lymphocytes (absolute), increased ALP, hyperglycemia, increased lipase, 
      increased amylase, increased ALT and increased AST.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct 17 - Fitch Ratings says that the announced changes 
to JPMorgan Liquidity Funds' two euro sub-funds will not have any impact on 
their 'AAAmmf' ratings. The changes aim at adapting the funds' structural 
features to a potential further move of euro short-term rates into negative 
territory, which would ultimately also push euro money-market funds (MMF) into 
posting negative yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative MMF yields stemming from the short-term market rate environment would 
not be a negative rating factor per se for Fitch-rated MMFs, including for those 
rated at 'AAAmmf', as the agency indicated in a comment dated 18 September 2012 
(see 'Fitch: Potentially Negative Euro Yields Won't Impact MMF Ratings' at 
www.fitchratings.com). Fitch recognises that MMFs yields are to be consistent 
with prevailing safety and liquidity costs, commensurate with alternative 
high-quality short-term instruments. The agency also highlights that Fitch MMF 
ratings are and must remain a ranking of funds on the basis of their liquidity, 
market and credit risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Liquidity Funds' board of directors has decided to make share class 
amendments and to update the investment objectives for both the JPMorgan Euro 
Government Liquidity Fund and the JPMorgan Euro Liquidity Fund, two sub-funds of 
JPMorgan Liquidity Funds, a Luxembourg-domiciled SICAV managed by JP Morgan 
Asset Management (UK) Limited and JPMorgan Investment Management Inc, 
subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share class changes include the closure of the existing distributing (dist.) 
share classes and the creation of new (flex dist.) share classes, which will 
pass on potential negative yields resulting from a negative short-term rate 
environment to investors by redeeming an appropriate number of shares. Through 
this mechanism, the net asset value of the share classes is still aimed at being 
kept stable at the initial subscription price per share. In a positive yield 
environment, the (flex dist.) share class will behave similarly to the existing 
(dist.) one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors in the existing (dist.) share classes may switch into either the new 
(flex dist.) or the accumulating share classes of the sub-funds. Alternatively, 
they may also elect to redeem their shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjustments to the sub-funds' investment objectives introduce explicitly the 
notion of relativity to prevailing money market rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - Euro Liquidity Fund's and JPMorgan - Euro Government 
Liquidity Fund's money market fund ratings were affirmed at 'AAAmmf' on 30 
January 2012. Fitch receives weekly fund holdings information and other 
pertinent fund data from the funds' administrator to conduct surveillance 
against ratings guidelines and maintain its money market fund ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At end-August 2012, the two sub-funds had EUR4.3bn and EUR13.8bn in assets under 
management, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

			B2B Enterprise Customer Care Program Delivers Marketing Metrics 
      and Revenue for Microsoft with Strategic Customer Communications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE: PBI) has announced at the DMA 2012 Conference 
      Las Vegas, Nevada that Microsoft 
      was named the winner of the 2012 
      Pitney Bowes Personal Connections ECHO Award. The winning B2B 
      initiative, developed and executed by Microsoft and its agency partner Wunderman, 
      was the Enterprise Customer Care program, which delivered superior 
      marketing metrics and revenue for Microsoft by creating personal 
      connections with strategic customer communications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s Enterprise Customer Care program had the goal to use 
      relationship management best practices to improve customer satisfaction 
      through targeted, relevant, and synchronized communications while also 
      enabling field sales and marketing to manage their annuity business. The 
      three main elements to the winning program were first, to ensure 
      satisfaction for customer retention; second, to deliver content that 
      drives a learning relationship where Microsoft is continuously learning 
      from the customer, evolving program messaging, and reflecting that 
      intelligence back in the next communications. And, third, proactively 
      generating and communicating thought leadership to enterprise customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Congratulations to Microsoft for demonstrating the value of personal 
      connections in customer communications,&#8221; said Murray D. Martin, 
      Chairman, President and CEO of Pitney Bowes, Inc. (NYSE: PBI), sponsor 
      of the ECHO Award. &#8220;As marketing technologies evolve, strategic customer 
      communications deliver the ability to retain customers, grow business 
      and consistently delight customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ECHOs are judged by client-side marketers, agency account directors, 
      and senior creative professionals. ECHO judges select the biggest and 
      best ideas, the most creative use of response-based direct marketing 
      strategies, and the finest executions. Judges assess campaigns based on 
      strategy, creativity, and results. Each year, more than 1,000 marketers 
      and agencies enter the competition.

&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft fiscal Q1 profit $0.53/shr vs Wall St view
$0.56/shr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Windows sales fall in tough economy, rise of tablets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Hopes that Windows 8 next week will ignite PC sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares fall 1.3 percent after hours&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's 
quarterly profit fell a greater-than-expected 22 percent, as
sales of computers running its Windows operating system dipped
and some revenue was deferred ahead of upcoming releases of its
core Windows and Office products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp decline surprised investors, who had
underestimated the effect of weak personal computer sales,
sending Microsoft's shares down 1.3 percent in after-hours
trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To us it seems like the macro conditions certainly
deteriorated and no tech company will be immune to it," said
Trip Chowdhry, analyst at Global Equities Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Thursday Google Inc reported sharply
lower profit amid slowing advertising, following downbeat
reports from Intel Corp and International Business
Machines Corp this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of PCs are expected to fall this year for the first
time since 2001, according to research firm IHS, due to the weak
economy and inability of the latest crop of lightweight laptops
to compete with Apple Inc's iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is betting the release of touch-friendly Windows 8
will rev up sales of PCs, laptops and Windows-compatible tablets
as soon as it launches next week, and break Microsoft's heavy
reliance on PC sales for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't control the macro-environment, but there's a huge
opportunity in the explosion of devices," Microsoft Chief
Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. "There's
demand for compelling devices and a connected set of cloud
experiences. That's what Windows 8 is all about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEEP DIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software company, said fiscal
first quarter profit fell to $4.47 billion, or 53 cents per
share, from $5.74 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the
year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street had expected earnings of 56 cents per share,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 8 percent to $16.01 billion, largely caused by
the dip in demand for personal computers running Windows, as
consumers held off new purchases in the tight economy or opted
to buy tablet devices instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue decline was exaggerated by Microsoft's deferral
of some $1.36 billion in revenue, chiefly from its Windows unit,

&lt;p&gt;SANTIAGO Oct 18 (Reuters) - Chilean retail giant Cencosud
said on Thursday it signed a $2.5 billion loan agreement with JP
Morgan Chase Bank to finance its  purchase of French retailer
Carrefour's Colombian assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cencosud, which has operations in Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, said it expected to close the
deal with Carrefour, Europe's biggest retailer, by the
end of the year.

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Final Ratings to JPMCC 2012-C8
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigned its final ratings to fourteen 
      classes of JPMCC 2012-C8, a $1.14 billion CMBS multi-borrower 
      transaction collateralized by 43 fixed rate commercial mortgage loans 
      that are secured by 84 properties. Concurrently, we have withdrawn our 
      preliminary ratings on the certificates, which were assigned on 
      September 20, 2012 (see our ratings listed below).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mortgage loan sellers are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association 
      (JPMCB) and CIBC Inc. (CIBC). The respective contribution of each seller 
      to the pool balance is as follows: JPMCB (37 loans, 87.8%), and CIBC (6 
      loans, 12.2%). The majority of the loans (31 loans, 78.7%) were used to 
      refinance existing debt, while the proceeds from 12 loans (21.3%) were 
      used for property acquisitions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loans have principal balances that range from $4.2 million to $125.0 
      million for the largest loan in the pool, which is secured by 
      Battlefield Mall (11.0%), a regional mall property located in 
      Springfield, Missouri. The top five loans, which also include National 
      Industrial Portfolio (8.1%), 5th and Yesler (7.4%), Gallery 
      at Harborplace (7.2%) and Ashford Office Complex (5.4%), represent 39.1% 
      of the initial pool balance, and the top 10 loan exposures represent 
      58.5%. The properties are geographically diverse and located across 22 
      states with the three largest state concentrations being Texas (19.6%), 
      Maryland (12.7%) and Missouri (11.0%). The pool has exposure to three 
      property types with concentrations in excess of 10%: office (35.6%), 
      retail (26.2%) and mixed use (16.3%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower 
      rating process that begins with our analysts' evaluation of underlying 
      collateral properties' financial and operating performance, which 
      determine KBRA&#8217;s estimate of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA 
      value. The analysis included a detailed evaluation of the underlying 
      collateral properties&#8217; financial and operating performance using our 
      CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines to determine Kroll Net Cash Flow 
      (KNCF), which on an aggregate basis was 3.8% less than the issuer cash 
      flow. KBRA capitalization rates were applied to each asset&#8217;s KCNF to 
      derive individual property values that, on an aggregate basis, were 
      32.5% less than third party appraisal values. The pool has an in-trust 
      KLTV of 96.2% and an all-in LTV of 99.1%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KNCF and KBRA capitalization rates were among the key inputs used in our 
      credit modeling process. The model deploys rent and occupancy stresses, 
      probability of default regressions, and loss given default calculations 
      to determine losses for each collateral loan that were used by KBRA to 
      assign our credit ratings for this transaction.

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Oct 18 (Marketwire) -- 
Dataguise (http://www.dataguise.com), a leading innovator of data
security intelligence and protection solutions, today announced it will
present DG for Hadoop(TM) at the 2012 Information On Demand conference in
Las Vegas, NV from October 21-25. The comprehensive security solution for
Apache Hadoop delivers enterprise-class detection and protection for
sensitive data aggregated in these expansive data deployments. For the
first time at the conference, Dataguise will demonstrate the solution in
conjunction with IBM InfoSphere BigInsights for secure, high-performance
analytics.

    Information On Demand 2012 is a venue for premier discussions on the
future of information management. In one global event, attendees gain
access and exposure to the full breadth of IBM Information Management
technologies and experts. Following this theme, Dataguise will showcase
DG for Hadoop in booth #224 and demonstrate how sensitive data can be
detected and secured by either encryption or masking.

    "With the topic of data security heating up around Apache Hadoop, we are
pleased that IBM customers will have the chance to experience
next-generation technology from Dataguise at this year's event," said
Bruce Weed, Program Director, IBM Big Data. "As an IBM Express Advantage
Partner, Dataguise is collaborating with IBM to protect this new data
landscape with DG for Hadoop, a flexible and agile solution for securing
sensitive data."

    As large organizations increasingly turn to Apache Hadoop to manage and
administer exponentially larger volumes of data, they need to be assured
that their environment can scale efficiently without concerns for data
security or integrity. The combination of IBM InfoSphere BigInsights, and
DG for Hadoop provides the solution needed to intelligently manage and
protect data without risk or concerns about scalability.

    IBM InfoSphere BigInsights enhances Apache Hadoop to withstand the
demands of the enterprise, adding administrative, workflow, provisioning,
and security features, along with best-in-class analytical capabilities
from IBM Research. The result is that users get a more developer and
user-friendly solution for complex, large scale analytics. IBM allows
enterprises of all sizes to cost effectively manage and analyze the
massive volume, variety and velocity of data that consumers and
businesses create every day.

    DG for Hadoop works with IBM InfoSphere BigInsights to locate and
identify sensitive data types that are either custom defined or already
preconfigured, addressing the requirements of regulations such as HIPAA,
PCI, GLBA, and HiTech. Users can leverage DG for Hadoop to analyze search
results and assess the company's risk exposure. The solution can also be
used to detect sensitive data in real-time during aggregation and apply
the appropriate remediation policies, such as masking, either before or
after the data is placed into Apache Hadoop.

    "With IBM's position as a premier provider of Apache Hadoop solutions, we
look forward to ongoing efforts with them as we work jointly to improve
the security and protection of the massive data stores found in Apache
Hadoop," said Manmeet Singh, CEO, Dataguise. "As a member of the IBM
partner program and the first security company to deliver sensitive data
detection, protection and actionable intelligence for Apache Hadoop, our
mutual customers will benefit now and in the future."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil wants to leave its giant oilfield project in southern Iraq, diplomatic sources said, in a move likely to aggravate the country's internal tensions and hamper Baghdad's ambitious energy expansion plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire of the world's largest publicly traded oil company to quit was due to prospects of slim profits from the estimated $50 billion West Qurna-1 project, the sources said. An exit from the project would contrast with a deal Exxon signed a year ago to explore in Iraq's autonomous northern Kurdish region, where incentives are better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad deemed the Kurdish deal illegal and promised to punish Exxon by ripping up its contract for West Qurna-1, which has reserves of 8.7 billion barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives at the company this week told U.S. State Department officials it was looking to sell its 60 percent stake in the project, diplomats from two Western countries said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is telling Baghdad: 'We are letting you know we're looking to leave,'" one of the diplomats said. "They are shopping around and looking at all the options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company declined to comment, as did the U.S. State Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The departure of Exxon from southern Iraq now hinges on its ability to find a company willing to buy out its stake in West Qurna-1, industry sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they can find the right buyer, they will pull out," said an industry executive. "It's an unusual move for Exxon. They usually don't give up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources said Baghdad is keen to replace Exxon with companies from Russia, or even China, to teach Western oil majors a lesson. This could alter the diplomatic and political influences in Iraq but, technologically, Chinese and Russian companies may have less to offer the oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did not comment on Exxon during a speech on energy diplomacy at Georgetown University on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in response to a question about whether Russian companies might dominate in Iraq if the Exxon leaves the project, she was not worried. Russian, American, French and Chinese companies all will be competing in Iraq and will be operating within the economic marketplace the global market place sets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton praised Iraq's progress in boosting oil output by 900,000 barrels per day since 2010 to 3.2 million bpd today as a "major Iraqi success story helped by the (U.S) Departments of State and Energy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department added an energy diplomacy office last year which has helped Iraqis identify infrastructure bottlenecks, improve investment plans, and get oil to market, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BROADER BATTLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, a global oil company based in Texas, was the first to flex its muscles and challenge Baghdad's authority by signing up for exploration deals with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Others, such as Chevron, Total and Russia's Gazprom Neft followed just months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon stock barely budged on the news, indicating there may be more at stake for Iraq, Kurdistan and regional politics than for Exxon shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute over oil contracts is part of a broader battle between Baghdad and Kurdistan over oil rights, territory and regional autonomy that is straining Iraq's uneasy federal union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has gone so far as to ask U.S. President Barack Obama to force Exxon to pull out of West Qurna, saying its actions are a threat to peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani met Exxon executives in Baghdad this summer and threatened to kick the company out, practical and legal constraints limit Baghdad's scope for action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Qurna-1 now pumps about 400,000 barrels per day of Iraq's overall production of just over 3 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shahristani declined to say on Thursday whether Exxon was pulling out but told Reuters in an email that Baghdad was sticking to its line that all contracts signed with the KRG without the approval of the central government were illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All companies that entered in such contracts were asked to cancel them or pull out," he said. "Exxon Mobil can be contacted about their decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISING PROFILE IN KURDISTAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Baghdad's tough talk, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said in March the company was committed to expanding output at West Qurna, where it is in charge, as well as exploring in Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it has been business-as-usual for Exxon at West Qurna-1, which generates a hefty chunk of Iraq's central government revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, with minority partner Royal Dutch Shell, signed up in early 2010 for the project, which targets output of 2.825 million barrels per day by 2017. By the end of last year, the pair had spent just under $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Qurna-1 is central to Baghdad's plan to more than triple output in the next decade and to rival Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producer. Iraq now ranks second behind Riyadh in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the pace of expansion has been slow. Exxon, like other foreign operators, has complained that infrastructure bottlenecks, payment delays and red tape are hampering progress. Tough terms and slim margins on Iraq's service fee contracts are also drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was that frustration, say oil executives, that led Exxon to move into Kurdistan, which offers more lucrative production sharing contracts and a safer operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is now raising its profile in Kurdistan, with drilling set to begin in a few months. A senior Exxon delegation was last week in the region's capital Arbil, where the company is setting up an office, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Peg Mackey and Timothy Gardner; Additional reporting by Ahmed Rasheed in Baghdad and Andrew Quinn in Washington; Editing by Anthony Barker and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said its fiscal first-quarter profit fell on Thursday, hurt by a dip in computer sales running its Windows operating system and the deferral of some revenue ahead of upcoming releases of its core Windows and Office products.&lt;/p&gt;

It did not just start with Microsoft but Google too, and also HP and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To us it seems like the macro conditions certainly deteriorated in the third month, and no tech company will be immune to it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY FORREST, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see Microsoft as a business-orientated software company. The shortfall stemming from PC or lack of PC sales, isn't troubling. Everybody told you this would happen. That's where I think the shortfall came in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm surprised at strength in server and tools. I was surprised to see that the unearned revenue - businesses buying licenses on a subscription basis -- were what we expected. It's a little bit ahead of what the Street expected for those."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DANIEL IVES, ANALYST, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors were not expecting a home run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All expectations are on the launch of Windows 8 and the entrance into the tablet market.

There's more focus on the coming year with Windows 8 and the Surface tablet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Liana Baker and Nicola Leske in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Oct 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said its
fiscal first-quarter profit fell on Thursday, hurt by a dip in
computer sales running its Windows operating system and the
deferral of some revenue ahead of upcoming releases of its core
Windows and Office products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company said quarterly profit
fell to $4.47 billion, or 53 cents per share, from $5.74
billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 8 percent to $16.01 billion, partly caused by the
dip in demand for PCs running Windows, as consumers held off new
purchases in the tight economy or opted to buy tablet devices
instead. The decline was exaggerated by Microsoft's deferral of
some revenue which it will regain next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping to revive PC sales next week with the
launch its new Windows 8 system on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank also urged the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not to follow through on a threat to suspend its market-based rate authority, which would force it to sell power at a significantly lower rate and probably would drive it out of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulator has said the bank broke the law by submitting misleading information to the commission and the California grid operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission's latest probe comes on the heels of a separate lawsuit, in which it has accused JPMorgan of bidding up electricity prices in California and the U.S. Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said any omission of facts was inadvertent and contended that it should not be penalized with revocation of its ability to profitably trade in electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...we respectfully submit that suspension of (J.P.

region, where incentives are better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad deemed the Kurdish deal illegal and promised to
punish Exxon by ripping up its contract for West Qurna-1, which
has reserves of 8.7 billion barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives at the company this week told U.S. State
Department officials it was looking to sell its 60 percent stake
in the project, diplomats from two Western countries said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is telling Baghdad: 'We are letting you know we're
looking to leave,'" one of the diplomats said. "They are
shopping around and looking at all the options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company declined to comment, as did the U.S. State
Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The departure of Exxon from southern Iraq now hinges on its
ability to find a company willing to buy out its stake in West
Qurna-1, industry sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they can find the right buyer, they will pull out," said
an industry executive. "It's an unusual move for Exxon. They
usually don't give up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources said Baghdad is keen to replace Exxon with
companies from Russia, or even China, to teach Western oil
majors a lesson. This could alter the diplomatic and political
influences in Iraq but, technologically, Chinese and Russian
companies may have less to offer the oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did not comment on
Exxon during a speech on energy diplomacy at Georgetown
University on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in response to a question about whether Russian
companies might dominate in Iraq if the Exxon leaves the
project, she was not worried. Russian, American, French and
Chinese companies all will be competing in Iraq and will be
operating within the economic marketplace the global market
place sets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton praised Iraq's progress in boosting oil output by
900,000 barrels per day since 2010 to 3.2 million bpd today as a
"major Iraqi success story helped by the (U.S) Departments of
State and Energy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department added an energy diplomacy office last
year which has helped Iraqis identify infrastructure
bottlenecks, improve investment plans, and get oil to market,
she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BROADER BATTLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, a global oil company based in Texas, was the first to
flex its muscles and challenge Baghdad's authority by signing up
for exploration deals with the Kurdistan Regional Government
(KRG). Others, such as Chevron, Total and
Russia's Gazprom Neft followed just months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon stock barely budged on the news, indicating there may
be more at stake for Iraq, Kurdistan and regional politics than
for Exxon shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute over oil contracts is part of a broader battle
between Baghdad and Kurdistan over oil rights, territory and
regional autonomy that is straining Iraq's uneasy federal union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has gone so far
as to ask U.S. President Barack Obama to force Exxon to pull out
of West Qurna, saying its actions are a threat to peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani met
Exxon executives in Baghdad this summer and threatened to kick
the company out, practical and legal constraints limit Baghdad's
scope for action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Qurna-1 now pumps about 400,000 barrels per day of
Iraq's overall production of just over 3 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shahristani declined to say on Thursday whether Exxon was
pulling out but told Reuters in an email that Baghdad was
sticking to its line that all contracts signed with the KRG
without the approval of the central government were illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All companies that entered in such contracts were asked to
cancel them or pull out," he said. "Exxon Mobil can be contacted
about their decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISING PROFILE IN KURDISTAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Baghdad's tough talk, Exxon Chief Executive Officer
Rex Tillerson said in March the company was committed to
expanding output at West Qurna, where it is in charge, as well
as exploring in Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it has been business-as-usual for Exxon at West Qurna-1,
which generates a hefty chunk of Iraq's central government
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, with minority partner Royal Dutch Shell,
signed up in early 2010 for the project, which targets output of
2.825 million barrels per day by 2017. By the end of last year,
the pair had spent just under $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Qurna-1 is central to Baghdad's plan to more than
triple output in the next decade and to rival Saudi Arabia, the
world's top oil producer. Iraq now ranks second behind Riyadh in
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the pace of expansion has been slow. Exxon, like other
foreign operators, has complained that infrastructure
bottlenecks, payment delays and red tape are hampering progress.
Tough terms and slim margins on Iraq's service fee contracts are
also drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was that frustration, say oil executives, that led Exxon
to move into Kurdistan, which offers more lucrative production
sharing contracts and a safer operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is now raising its profile in Kurdistan, with drilling
set to begin in a few months. A senior Exxon delegation was last
week in the region's capital Arbil, where the company is setting
up an office, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

      Walton Westphalia Development Corporation Announces Thirteenth and 
      Fourteenth Closings of Private Placement
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Westphalia Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announces that it has completed its thirteenth and fourteenth closings 
      on its previously announced private placement offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation closed on aggregate proceeds of $1,579,000 and issued 
      157,900 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit is comprised of 
      $5.00 principal amount of 8% unsecured, subordinated, convertible, 
      extendable debentures (the &#8220;Debentures&#8221;) and one non-voting share 
      of the Corporation having a price of $5.00 (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The proceeds from this closing will be utilized by the Corporation and 
      its U.S. subsidiary for working capital purposes and to repay a portion 
      of the loan it received from affiliated entities to purchase interests 
      in the approximately 310 acre &#8220;Westphalia&#8221; property located in Prince 
      George&#8217;s County, Maryland, USA (the &#8220;Property&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation will provide further updates as additional closings of 
      the private placement occur.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation has been incorporated to provide investors with the 
      unique opportunity to participate in the returns available on the 
      residential and commercial development of the Property. The 
      Corporation&#8217;s investment objectives are to (a) preserve the capital 
      investment of the purchasers in the Units; (b) make annual cash 
      distributions on the Units (comprised of payments of interest and/or 
      principal on the Offering Debentures and/or dividends or other 
      distributions on the Shares) beginning in June of 2013 until the final 
      distribution of funds from the Project, which is anticipated to be in 
      March of 2019; and (c) achieve a net internal rate of return of 15.0% on 
      the $10.00 purchase price of the Units from the cash distributions 
      referred to in (b) above.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P., and the 
      development of the Property is managed by Walton Development

&lt;p&gt;* Greg Smith about to publish "Why I left Goldman Sachs"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Publicly accused Goldman of ripping off clients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Goldman says Smith was angry over status, pay and review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Just days before publication of
a book promising to expose a rampant culture of greed at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc, the Wall Street company is writing its
own story about the book's author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg Smith, a 32-year-old former derivatives salesman who in
March published an explosive op-ed article in The New York Times
outlining his grievances, was a low-performing and
self-aggrandizing employee with an ax to grind, according to a
Goldman source familiar with the firm's investigation of his
charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm has been selectively leaking its version of the
Smith story to the media, wary that the book, "Why I Left
Goldman Sachs," will revive articles depicting Goldman as the
poster child for Wall Street malevolence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the New York Times article, the native South African, 
depicted himself as an altruistic individual who increasingly
felt out of tune with Wall Street culture. A spokesman at Grand
Central Publishing, which will officially publish "Why I Left
Goldman Sachs" on Oct. 22, did not respond to a request for
comment from Smith&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the race against stiff competition from Amazon EC2 and Rackspace, Microsoft&#160;announced today that it has acquired cloud-integrated storage device, StorSimple, the complement to its cloud-based infrastructure, Azure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With today&#8217;s acquisition for an undisclosed sum, Microsoft has lifted the veil off its long-term strategy. Instead of luring enterprises away from the competition, it is focusing on an entirely new subset of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CloudBeat 2012 will assemble the biggest names in the cloud&#8217;s evolving story to learn about real cases of revolutionary cloud adoption. Unlike other cloud events, customers &#8212; the users of cloud technologies &#8212; will be front and center. Their discussions with vendors and other experts will give you rare insights into what really works, who&#8217;s buying what, and where the industry is going. CloudBeat happens November 28-29 in Redwood City, Calif. Register today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan is to win over large enterprises that are still using traditional disks before Amazon or Rackspace can get to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customers faced with explosive growth in data are looking to the cloud to help them store, manage, and archive that data. But, to be effective, cloud storage needs to integrate with IT&#8217;s current&#160;investments,&#8221; said Michael Park, corporate vice president, Server and Tools Division for Microsoft, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A technology like StorSimple is attractive to investors and potential acquirers because it&#160;connects with&#160;multiple cloud services &#8212; including ones offered by Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Rackspace &#8212; and an enterprise&#8217;s on-premise storage.&#160;It is breaking down the barriers that have prevented large enterprises from selecting cloud-based services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The StorSimple&#160;device sits in between the cloud storage&#160;infrastructure and its applications and makes it look like&#160;they are talking to a local disk,&#8221; explained Mike Volpi, an enterprise-focused investor at Index Ventures who has been an advisor to the company since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Microsoft will be able to offer customers all the software components they require, without the involvement of a third-party supplier.&#160;For several years, it has been selling StorSimple as a bundle with the Azure product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They saw it was working very well and was helping Azure gain market traction,&#8221; said Volpi. His firm, Index Ventures, participated in all three of StorSimple&#8217;s funding rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is typically the case with acquisitions of this magnitude, StorSimple will be rebranded as a Microsoft product. The founding team will remain in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft officials say that StorSimple will continue to support rival storage partners, whether on-premise or in the cloud (click here to view the list of partners on the company&#8217;s website).&#160;However, it is not yet clear whether StorSimple&#8217;s features will be altered to enhance Azure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image via Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Cloud, Deals, Enterprise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (GS.N), one of the biggest banks in commodity trading, has called an end to the oil price super-cycle, reversing years of bullish recommendations, citing a rise in unconventional oil supplies in the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been highest predictor among major oil price forecasters but said on Thursday "long-dated" or five-year forward Brent crude may be anchored at about $90 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also cut its 2013 Brent forecast to $110 a barrel from $130. Brent trade near $112 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the past three years long-dated Brent crude oil prices have shown signs of stabilizing around $90 per barrel. This suggests a return to the pricing regime that characterized the crude oil market in the 1990s," Goldman's analysts Jeffrey Currie and David Greely said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect that going forward long-dated oil prices will be anchored by the potential for substantial growth in crude oil supplies from U.S. shale, Canadian oil sands, and the deepwater. Net, we see a return to a structurally stable, but cyclically tight market," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. shale oil boom has seen the country's oil production rise to multi-decade highs, catching many industry watchers surprise, reshaping global oil flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is now importing less crude from West Africa and the Middle East, leaving more volumes for booming demand in Asia. Some expect North America including Mexico and Canada to become a net oil exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was a lead forecaster during the 2003-2008 oil price boom when unexpectedly robust demand in Asia outpaced global supply and prices soared as spare capacity in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell close to zero and the refining industry struggled to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just after the bank predicted a "super spike" to $200 a barrel in 2008, financial crisis hit the global economy. Oil prices collapsed from a peak of $147 in July 2008 to below $40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Goldman was slow to acknowledge bearish trends in U.S. light crude, closing its trading recommendation to buy September 2012 U.S. light sweet crude futures at loss on paper of 10.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman was a little out of kilter with their $130 (Brent) call.

&lt;p&gt;* Sees 5-year forward Brent anchored near $90/bbl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Cuts 2103 Brent forecast from $130 to $110&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Rising U.S. oil output reshapes global market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Claire Milhench&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs
, one of the biggest banks in commodity trading, has
called an end to the oil price super-cycle, reversing years of
bullish recommendations, citing a rise in unconventional oil
supplies in the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been highest predictor among major oil price
forecasters but said on Thursday "long-dated" or five-year
forward Brent crude may be anchored at about $90 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also cut its 2013 Brent forecast to $110 a
barrel from $130. Brent trade near $112 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the past three years long-dated Brent crude oil prices
have shown signs of stabilizing around $90 per barrel. This
suggests a return to the pricing regime that characterized the

independence and a subsequent shift to lower oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The growth will likely put a cap on long term oil prices,
making any runaway increase in average prices much above
$110-$115 per barrel, beyond geopolitical or economic reasons,
increasingly difficult," said Amrita Sen at thinktank Energy
Aspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen previously worked as energy analyst at Barclays
, which together with Goldman, Deutsche Bank,

		&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs upgraded shares of Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG) from a neutral rating to a buy rating. They wrote, "HOG shares are down 19% since their April 25 peak (vs. SP 500 +4.5%) driven by a slowing of retail sales and concern about production constraints persisting into 2013. We see this as a good entry point into the shares, which we expect to react positively to a reacceleration of sales in September and upward estimate revisions to overly conservative 4Q12 estimates. We also expect longer-term upward EPS estimate revisions driven by a housing construction employment recovery and stepped up buybacks given the company's healthy cash position."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;BMO Capital Markets lowered its price target on shares of IBM (IBM) to $218.00. They have a market perform rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

JJ's 3Q12 EPS of $1.25 were better than expected on a slightly higher topline and lower SGA expenses. Excluding FX and Synthes, sales were up 5%, which marks the best quarter in a number of years as JJ anniversaries patent expirations and sees growth driven by new product launches. The MDD businesses continue to see more modest growth due to muted utilization trends."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank raised its price target on shares of Coca Cola (KO) from $40.00 to $42.00. They have a buy rating on the stock. They wrote, "Making it happen. Trademark Coke and sparkling volumes remain tepid, with faster growing but lower margin still portfolio (including water), boosting total company volume and soft drink shares but also negatively impacting mix. While relative valuation is somewhat extended, fundamentals should improve as company laps currency, commodities and EM slowdown, with potential for enhanced returns from bottler divestitures. Easy money has clearly been made, but path to 10%+ total shareholder return achievable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Robert Campbell is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Robert Campbell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - For years the energy story out of Canada has been exclusively about the emergence of Alberta's oil sands as a massive, if costly new source of crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the rise of the oil sands was always seen as a happy solution to the country's dwindling conventional oil production and the crumbling economics of Alberta's natural gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a funny thing has been happening. The shale revolution has come to Canada's oil sector in a big way. And like similar developments in the United States, the hottest play seems to be closely linked to the place where conventional oil production started decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in Texas and Oklahoma, Alberta's oil patch is seeing renewed interest in old acreage. Indeed, the latest transaction in the sector is aimed in part at the source rock - the Duvernay shale - of the famous Leduc No. 1 well that touched off Alberta's postwar oil boom in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp's proposed $2.6 billion acquisition of much of the assets of Canada's Celtic Exploration instantly makes the supermajor a key player in both the Duvernay and the larger Montney shale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the takeover is far too small to transform a company the size of Exxon, it speaks volumes about the shale potential in Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the takeover is likely to force a lot of international companies to re-evaluate the potential of Alberta's conventional oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil sands will remain huge, but could it be that cheaper and easier-to-develop shale oil captures the imagination?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OIL IS THE KEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon tends to get acquisitions right, and the company's reputation for long-term thinking means the Celtic buy has to be looked at strategically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celtic's assets and current production are mostly gas-rich, but Exxon has played up the liquids angle in the transaction. That is the nature of most shale plays, though: They offer exposure to both oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the longer-term picture for Western Canadian natural gas may improve with potential exports to Asia in the form of liquefied natural gas, the current picture is ugly and seems likely to stay that way for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberta's natural gas sector is being squeezed by the shale revolution that is opening up production closer to its main markets in Eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is hammering the economics of Albertan gas production, especially as dwindling volumes on major pipelines force up transportation tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, both oil and natural gas liquids look far more promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberta is already a major petrochemical producer, and the oil sands require condensates for shipping. Therefore, anyone producing natural gas liquids and condensates in the province enjoys an advantage over producers who have to ship their product in by pipeline or rail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil is similarly advantageous.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Robert Campbell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 18 (Reuters) - For years the energy story out
of Canada has been exclusively about the emergence of Alberta's
oil sands as a massive, if costly new source of crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the rise of the oil sands was always seen as a happy
solution to the country's dwindling conventional oil production
and the crumbling economics of Alberta's natural gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a funny thing has been happening. The shale revolution
has come to Canada's oil sector in a big way. And like similar
developments in the United States, the hottest play seems to be
closely linked to the place where conventional oil production
started decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in Texas and Oklahoma, Alberta's oil patch is seeing
renewed interest in old acreage. Indeed, the latest transaction
in the sector is aimed in part at the source rock - the Duvernay
shale - of the famous Leduc No. 1 well that touched off
Alberta's postwar oil boom in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp's proposed $2.6 billion acquisition
of much of the assets of Canada's Celtic Exploration 
instantly makes the supermajor a key player in both the Duvernay
and the larger Montney shale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the takeover is far too small to transform a
company the size of Exxon, it speaks volumes about the shale
potential in Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the takeover is likely to force a lot of
international companies to re-evaluate the potential of
Alberta's conventional oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil sands will remain huge, but could it be that cheaper and
easier-to-develop shale oil captures the imagination?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OIL IS THE KEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon tends to get acquisitions right, and the company's
reputation for long-term thinking means the Celtic buy has to be
looked at strategically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celtic's assets and current production are mostly gas-rich,
but Exxon has played up the liquids angle in the transaction.
That is the nature of most shale plays, though: They offer
exposure to both oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the longer-term picture for Western Canadian
natural gas may improve with potential exports to Asia in the
form of liquefied natural gas, the current picture is ugly and
seems likely to stay that way for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberta's natural gas sector is being squeezed by the shale
revolution that is opening up production closer to its main
markets in Eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is hammering the economics of Albertan gas production,
especially as dwindling volumes on major pipelines force up
transportation tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, both oil and natural gas liquids look far
more promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberta is already a major petrochemical producer, and the
oil sands require condensates for shipping. Therefore, anyone
producing natural gas liquids and condensates in the province
enjoys an advantage over producers who have to ship their
product in by pipeline or rail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil is similarly advantageous. Unlike more speculative
plays, Alberta is an established oil center, replete with
infrastructure and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes development cheaper and easier. Moreover Canada's
legal and regulatory regime is relatively stable, so that
returns are more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps what most attracts Exxon is that Canada's oil
and gas industry suffers from a lot less of the political
constraints that American producers face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of the United States' pretensions of supporting
global free trade in energy, it is clear that crude oil exports
from Texas and Oklahoma, however economically rational, are
going to be politically controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas exporters are also facing calls for restraint,
notably from industrial users who hope to benefit from cheap
fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada, on the other hand, has a more coherent policy that
favors energy producers. It wants to boost the price its
producers receive by trying to build a pipeline to the Pacific,
even in the face of local opposition in the province of British
Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These should be the parameters for assessing the Celtic
takeover. It is a transaction that gives Exxon exposure to
non-oil sands crude and liquids in Canada as well as potential
long-term upside from a recovery in Western Canadian gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also raises interesting possibilities for future oil
production. Could it be that Western Canada will be an even
bigger producer a decade from now than currently believed if the
conventional oil sector rebounds rather than declines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if so, where is this oil going to go? The last decade

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 18 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil wants to pull
out of its contract to develop the supergiant West Qurna-1
oilfield in southern Iraq, diplomatic sources said on Thursday,
because of concerns over the profitability of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has informed Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister for Energy

intentions, said a Western diplomat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is telling Baghdad: 'We are letting you know we're

shopping around and looking at all the options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

			As technology partners with IBM in delivering business continuity 
      solutions for high performance synchronously distributed databases, 
      Obsidian has chosen the Information On Demand event to launch its next 
      generation Longbow device, the C400.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM's pureScale is a clustered DB2 implementation that leverages 
      InfiniBand LAN technology to scale out from small to very large server 
      node counts at a single site while maintaining high transaction rates 
      and fault tolerance. However, until GDPC (Geo-Dispersed PureScale 
      Cluster) DB2 configurations using Obsidian's Longbow technology were 
      released, pureScale was confined to a single location &#8211; vulnerable to 
      single-site failures. Longbows transparently extend the cluster's 
      InfiniBand fabric over tens of miles, allowing a single InfiniBand 
      cluster to be physically dispersed across remote sites - while still 
      functioning as a synchronous, active:active mirror. In normal operation 
      both sites are concurrently active, relying on Longbow connectivity to 
      maintain storage and metadata coherence. In the event of a site failure, 
      traffic automatically fails over to the surviving site, and fails back 
      when services are restored.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Obsidian's 100-series Longbow products are based on 10Gbits/s WAN 
      interfaces, running at 4X Single Data Rate (SDR) InfiniBand LAN speeds. 
      At IOD, Obsidian is launching the Longbow C400, which operates at 4X 
      Quad Data Rate (QDR) InfiniBand speeds over up to four aggregated 
      10Gbits/s WAN channels using Wavelength Division Multiplex (WDM) 
      technology across a single fiber pair.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While building on the heritage of our first-generation Longbow C100s 
      with four times the throughput in the same physical and power footprint, 
      the C400s go further to offer advanced features such as the graceful 
      tolerance of WAN channel loss, Forward Error Correction (FEC) options 
      and even lower latencies&#8221;, remarked Obsidian's CVO, Dr. David Southwell, 
      &#8220;By leveraging any regional/metro area WAN link supporting one, two or 
      four 10G wavelengths, Obsidian has bridged high-performance 40G LANs 
      with pervasive and cost-effective 10G WAN infrastructure in a fault 
      tolerant way. This translates directly to higher GDPC transaction rates 
      for DB2 pureScale users, intrinsically robust WAN connectivity and a 
      simplification of the management of the optical WAN circuits.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - For much of the last decade, energy researchers at Goldman Sachs have been among the most influential and bullish forecasters in the oil market, predicting, much of the time correctly, that prices would continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like others, the bank failed to foresee the cataclysm that overtook the market in late 2008. But it won respect for correctly predicting the smaller downturn in prices ahead of the flash crash in May 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both its short term and medium price views have been hugely influential, especially among hedge funds and institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the bank's decision to call an end to the structural bull market and predict that oil prices have leveled off could herald a much more widespread reconsideration of the medium and long-term price outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is increasing evidence of an important structural shift in the crude oil market that will likely keep Brent crude oil prices range-bound over the long-term," the bank wrote in a landmark note published on Wednesday ("Energy Watch: A cyclically tight but structurally stable oil market" Oct 17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This holds out the potential that as the economic recovery continues, the oil market will remain structurally stable, like the oil market of the 1990s, but with long-dated prices anchored near $90 per barrel rather than $20 per barrel, rather than return to the structural bull market of 2003 - H12008."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spot prices could still remain elevated by short-term concerns over supplies. The spot market is expected to stay above long-dated futures prices much of the time: the bank forecasts Brent will average $110 per barrel in 2013, though that is down from its previous forecast of $130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But long-dated prices themselves are set to remain steady and provide an important anchor for the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the potential for substantial growth in crude oil supplies from U.S. shale, Canadian oil sands, and the deepwater holds the potential to keep long-dated prices stable," Goldman explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways the bank is reacting to, rather than leading, a change in consensus thinking. Goldman is not the first forecaster to suggest prices might be leveling off. Most other major banks active in the commodity markets have already tempered their bullishness about continued price rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears about peaking oil production, which animated many forecasters and investors between 2004 and 2008, have long been allayed by the shale boom and a growing recognition of the almost unlimited supply of liquid fuels at prices below $100 per barrel from tight oil, tar sands, deepwater and technologies such as gas to liquids and coal to liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman was the most high-profile bull, and its conversion to a more neutral long-term stance marks a big shift in the debate. It also opens up an intriguing contrast with the other big bulls, especially the research team at Barclays Capital, which continues to see upward pressure from the rising marginal cost of exploration and production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCHISM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays, and some others such as Bernstein, point to rising break-even prices for major projects, and believe the impact of shale oil will be too small to have a significant impact on aggregate supply costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman sees shale and other technologies having a bigger effect: "While much of the oil industry continues to struggle with the same problems of high and rising decline rates on existing production and high break-even prices on new production ... successful deepwater exploration and the revolution in U.S. shale oil production are increasing the amount of oil production that can be brought to market between $80 and $100 per barrel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could be seeing the emergence of an oil market regime where long-dated Brent crude oil prices are anchored by the cost of new technology, like U.S. shale oil, with shale oil production and the use of strategic reserves filling the role of swing supply."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the mega projects beloved by the oil majors, the bank explains, shale production is far less capital intensive and can be added incrementally and much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The divergence among former oil bulls should open up a long-overdue debate about the influences driving supply costs in the medium term: tensions in the Middle East, resource nationalism and the increasing complexity of drilling environments offshore and in the Arctic, versus the potential for technology and innovation to cut costs and improve efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the big institutions active in commodity markets have already started to shift their investment strategies from a passive long-only approach, designed to benefit in a secular bull market, towards more active market-timing systems that aim to add value if oil and other commodity prices remain range bound and benefit from roll yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's conversion is likely to accelerate that trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

especially among hedge funds and institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the bank's decision to call an end to the structural bull market and
predict that oil prices have levelled off could herald a much more widespread
reconsideration of the medium and long-term price outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is increasing evidence of an important structural shift in the crude
oil market that will likely keep Brent crude oil prices range-bound over the
long-term," the bank wrote in a landmark note published on Wednesday ("Energy
Watch: A cyclically tight but structurally stable oil market" Oct 17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This holds out the potential that as the economic recovery continues, the
oil market will remain structurally stable, like the oil market of the 1990s,

to have a significant impact on aggregate supply costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman sees shale and other technologies having a bigger effect: "While
much of the oil industry continues to struggle with the same problems of high
and rising decline rates on existing production and high break-even prices on
new production ... successful deepwater exploration and the revolution in U.S.
shale oil production are increasing the amount of oil production that can be
brought to market between $80 and $100 per barrel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could be seeing the emergence of an oil market regime where long-dated
Brent crude oil prices are anchored by the cost of new technology, like U.S.
shale oil, with shale oil production and the use of strategic reserves filling
the role of swing supply."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the mega projects beloved by the oil majors, the bank explains, shale
production is far less capital intensive and can be added incrementally and much
more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The divergence among former oil bulls should open up a long-overdue debate
about the influences driving supply costs in the medium term: tensions in the
Middle East, resource nationalism and the increasing complexity of drilling
environments offshore and in the Arctic, versus the potential for technology and
innovation to cut costs and improve efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the big institutions active in commodity markets have already

		&lt;p&gt;
      Given annually, Data Virtualization Leadership Awards recognize 
      individuals who use data virtualization to drive significant business 
      and IT value to their organizations. &#8220;Award winners represent the best 
      in data virtualization leadership, concepts, results and evangelism. Not 
      only did they guide important and sustainable progress benefiting their 
      organizations, they also made significant contributions to data 
      virtualization&#8217;s overall advancement,&#8221; said Bob Reary, Composite 
      Software Director of Customer Value.

&lt;p&gt;* See long-dated Brent oil prices at $90/bbl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Previously one of most bullish 2013 forecasters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Claire Milhench&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs
, one of the biggest banks in commodity trading, slashed
its oil price forecast following years of super-bullish
recommendations as it said oil output was soaring in the United
States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which up until now had the highest oil price
prediction among major forecasters, said on Thursday it cut its
2013 Brent crude oil price forecast to $110 a barrel
from the previous $130 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a longer term basis, the bank now expects Brent prices to
stabilise at $90 a barrel. Brent was trading at around $112.8 on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the past three years long-dated Brent crude oil prices
have shown signs of stabilizing around $90 per barrel. This
suggests a return to the pricing regime that characterized the
crude oil market in the 1990s," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect that going forward long-dated oil prices will be
anchored by the potential for substantial growth in crude oil
supplies from U.S. shale, Canadian oil sands, and the deepwater.
Net, we see a return to a structurally stable, but cyclically
tight market," said Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. shale oil boom, which saw the country's oil
production rising to multi-decade highs, caught many industry
watchers and specialists by surprise and has dramatically
reshaped the global oil flows over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is now importing less crude from West
Africa and the Middle East, leaving more volumes for booming
demand in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was one of the main and most accurate forecasters of
the 2003-2008 oil price boom, when unexpectedly robust demand in
Asia outpaced global supply and prices soared on fears that the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would
lack spare capacity to meet further demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was, however, slow to revise its bullish forecast
downwards when financial crisis hit the global economy in 2008
and oil prices fell four-fold to below $40 per barrel from their
peaks of $147 in July 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Goldman was also slow to acknowledge bearish
trends in U.S. light crude, closing its trading
recommendation to buy September 2012 U.S. light sweet crude
futures, crystalising  an embarrassing loss of 10.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman was a little out of kilter with their $130 call. We
have nudged up to that level on occasion but that's when you see
U.S. gasoline go above $4 a gallon and that has a behavioural
response," said Will Riley, who helps co-manage $284 million at
the Guinness Global Energy Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"$110 is still a high price for oil globally, but it's
probably more affordable for people and you are less likely to
see demand destruction at that level," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 18 (Marketwire) -- 
J.P. Morgan outpaces the competition when it comes to providing access to
company presidents and CEOs, money managers tell Institutional Investor.
The firm tops the magazine's inaugural ranking of America's Top Corporate
Access Providers. 

    Complete survey results can be found at www.institutionalinvestor.com.

    Three firms -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays and Morgan Stanley
-- tie for second place. Deutsche Bank Securities ranks fifth. 

    "There is no question that demand for corporate access has increased
dramatically since the crisis," declares Michael Lynch, head of U.S.
research sales for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "As trust and
accountability have become even more paramount to the investment process,
face-to-face meetings allow a different layer of understanding and
transparency." 

    Meeting attendees have something to offer too. "Management teams find
these [events] an efficient and productive use of their time," observes
Michael Bossidy, who oversees Americas research distribution for J.P.
Morgan. "We consistently arrange high-quality interactions and, in many
cases, potential additions to their shareholder bases."

    Institutional Investor 's inaugural ranking of America's Top Corporate
Access Providers reflects the opinions of buy-side analysts and money
managers at more than 250 institutions that collectively manage an
estimated $3.89 trillion in U.S. equities. 

    The new survey was inspired by the findings of the All-America Executive
Team survey, in which 90 percent of buy-side analysts and 95 percent of
sell-side analysts told Institutional Investor that their opinion of a
company's leaders either "very much" or "somewhat" affects their stock
recommendations. The results of that survey were released earlier this
year and can also be found at www.institutionalinvestor.com.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW Oct 17 (Reuters) - An Exxon Mobil executive
has taken up the newly created position of offshore projects
chief at Rosneft, which is gearing up for exploration
in Arctic seas, Russia's biggest oil producer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said Zeljko Runje, who has been working at Exxon and
Rosneft's joint venture to produce oil and gas on the Russian
Pacific island of Sakhalin, has been appointed to the position
of vice president for offshore projects at Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-controlled Rosneft has recently struck up
multi-billion dollar exploration and development deals with
Western majors, including Exxon, Norway's Statoil and
Italy's Eni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft, the holder of the world's largest oil reserves, has
been aggressively pursuing expansion plans under the leadership
of powerful chief executive Igor Sechin, a confidant of Russian
President Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Wednesday a source told Reuters that Rosneft has
offered to buy into Anglo-Russian crude producer TNK-BP
, proposing $28 billion for a 50 percent stake
.

&lt;p&gt;(Note: Language in paragraph 14 may be offensive to some readers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Karen Freifeld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A judge refused to dismiss a $1.07 billion lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group that accuses it of selling risky debt that it intended to lose value to an Australian hedge fund, causing the fund to become insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York state Supreme Court Justice Shirley Kornreich denied Goldman Sachs' bid to toss claims of fraud, unjust enrichment and negligence, among others, by the Basis Yield Alpha Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund accuses Goldman of making false and misleading statements in connection with the sale of securities to offload toxic subprime mortgages from its books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has argued the losses were caused by the collapse of the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fraud claims survive for the "big picture of fraudulent conduct," not only on the representations in the complaint, Kornreich wrote in her decision, citing a similar case in Manhattan federal court against Goldman by Dodona I, LLC, a hedge fund that invested in another CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined comment Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very pleased the court agrees with us that Goldman needs to answer for its conduct," said Washington, D.C., attorney Bruce Grace, a partner in Lewis Baach, who represents the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's CDO practices have drawn regulatory scrutiny. In April 2010, Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it sold the risky Abacus 2007-AC1 CDO while letting hedge fund billionaire John Paulson bet against it. The bank did not admit wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield Alpha Fund is seeking to recoup $67 million of losses plus $1 billion of punitive damages from transactions known as Timberlake and Point Pleasant. Basis Yield was managed by Sydney-based Basis Capital Funds Management Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her decision, made public Friday, the judge also denied Goldman's claim that the New York court was an inconvenient forum, noting that Goldman's headquarters and many witnesses are in New York. She also refused to compel arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kornreich did dismiss claims for breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Among the fraud claims she left were for fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield filed the lawsuit in New York state court in October 2011, three months after a U.S. judge dismissed a similar case, saying the fund could not sue in federal court under U.S. securities laws because its investment in the Timberwolf 2007-1 collateralized debt obligation did not qualify as a "domestic" transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timberwolf was cited in a scathing U.S. Senate panel report in April 2011 that faulted Goldman and others for pushing debt they expected to perform poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel report said Goldman kept marketing Timberwolf even after an executive in an email to a colleague called Timberwolf "one shitty deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield said it lost $56.3 million on Timberwolf in less than six weeks, and $10.8 million on Point Pleasant in less than three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master) v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 652996/2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Karen Freifeld; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

it of selling risky debt that it intended to lose value to an
Australian hedge fund, causing the fund to become insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York state Supreme Court Justice Shirley Kornreich
denied Goldman Sachs' bid to toss claims of fraud, unjust
enrichment and negligence, among others, by the Basis Yield
Alpha Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund accuses Goldman of making false and misleading
statements in connection with the sale of securities to offload
toxic subprime mortgages from its books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has argued the losses were caused by the collapse of
the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fraud claims survive for the "big picture of fraudulent
conduct," not only on the representations in the complaint,
Kornreich wrote in her decision, citing a similar case in
Manhattan federal court against Goldman by Dodona I, LLC, a
hedge fund that invested in another CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined
comment Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very pleased the court agrees with us that Goldman
needs to answer for its conduct," said Washington, D.C.,
attorney Bruce Grace, a partner in Lewis Baach, who represents
the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's CDO practices have drawn regulatory scrutiny. In
April 2010, Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it sold the
risky Abacus 2007-AC1 CDO while letting hedge fund billionaire
John Paulson bet against it. The bank did not admit wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield Alpha Fund is seeking to recoup $67 million of
losses plus $1 billion of punitive damages from transactions
known as Timberlake and Point Pleasant. Basis Yield was managed
by Sydney-based Basis Capital Funds Management Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her decision, made public Friday, the judge also denied
Goldman's claim that the New York court was an inconvenient
forum, noting that Goldman's headquarters and many witnesses are
in New York. She also refused to compel arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kornreich did dismiss claims for breach of contract and
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Among
the fraud claims she left were for fraudulent inducement and
fraudulent concealment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield filed the lawsuit in New York state court in
October 2011, three months after a U.S. judge dismissed a
similar case, saying the fund could not sue in federal court
under U.S. securities laws because its investment in the
Timberwolf 2007-1 collateralized debt obligation did not qualify
as a "domestic" transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timberwolf was cited in a scathing U.S. Senate panel report
in April 2011 that faulted Goldman and others for pushing debt
they expected to perform poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel report said Goldman kept marketing Timberwolf even
after an executive in an email to a colleague called Timberwolf
"one shitty deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield said it lost $56.3 million on Timberwolf in less
than six weeks, and $10.8 million on Point Pleasant in less than
three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master) v. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County,
No. 652996/2011.&lt;/p&gt;

finding an oil sheen in the water near Barataria Bay, Louisiana.
    Exxon said it planned to resume its operations later

&lt;p&gt;Oct 19 - Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said today that the announcement
of third-quarter 2012 results by General Electric Co. (GE;
AA+/Stable/A-1+) does not affect our ratings or outlook on the company. 

Industrial revenues were up 6%, including adverse foreign exchange. Industrial 
organic revenue growth in the quarter was 8%. The equipment backlog declined, 
while the service backlog reached a record high $153 billion. Order pricing 
for energy and health care was down, but it was up slightly in the quarter for 
the overall industrial segment. Industrial segment profit was up 11% and 
margins rose to 14.4% year over year, albeit down sequentially from 15%. 
Industrial cash from operating activities (CFOA excluding dividends from GE 
Capital) was down sequentially at $1.6 billion. Industrial CFOA for the first 
nine months was $5.6 billion (excluding pension). We still assume industrial 
CFOA for all of 2012 will be at least $11 billion after pension contributions. 
Strong cash generation in the fourth quarter (as in 2011), including favorable 
working capital benefits, will be necessary to achieve this goal. 

GE reported consolidated earnings from continuing operations of $3.5 
billion--up 4% from the same period in 2011. Industrial segment profits were 
all up year over year. We assume margins will improve in 2012 and 2013 because 
of product mix and pricing. 

GE ended the second quarter with industrial parent-level cash of $8.4 
billion--flat with early 2012 after capital spending and common 
dividends-share repurchases of $8.4 billion. We assume ongoing cash balances 
at the industrial parent will be about $8 billion or more. In fourth-quarter 
2012 the company issued parent-level debt to repay the February 2013 maturity 
of $5 billion.

GE has reduced its expectation for required pension funding by at least $2 
billion between 2012 and 2013. The company stated that its pension strategy 
(including plan changes) continues to focus on being fully funded in its 
primary plan. Our rating assumption continues to be that GE will address its 
large post-retirement obligation (which represents a majority of adjusted 
industrial debt), causing credit metrics to improve.

General Electric Capital Corp.'s improved performance continued. Pretax 
earnings were $1.8 billion, up 10% from 2011, while ending net investment 
(excluding cash) was down 6%. The real estate segment profit was $217 million, 
compared with a loss in 2011.

&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average fell 103.10 points,

			Biofuels ISOCONVERSION process licensed by Aemetis to produce 100% 
      replacement renewable jet and diesel fuels from plant and algal oils
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aemetis, Inc. (OTCPK: AMTX), an advanced fuels and renewable chemical 
      company, announced today that the company signed an expanded, global 
      license agreement with Chevron Lummus Global (CLG) for the inexpensive, 
      rapid production of renewable jet and diesel fuel by the conversion of 
      existing biofuels and petroleum refineries. The expanded license 
      agreement grants Aemetis Advanced Fuels, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary 
      of Aemetis, the use of the Biofuels ISOCONVERSION process to produce 
      fuels that meet the necessary ASTM requirements for 100% replacement, 
      renewable jet fuel and diesel in Aemetis biorefineries and joint 
      ventures throughout the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Unlike most other process technologies, the renewable fuels produced by 
      this process are fungible replacements for petroleum-based jet and 
      diesel fuel. The Biofuels ISOCONVERSION process includes patented 
      Catalytic Hydrothermolysis (CH) reactor technology, developed by Applied 
      Research Associates (ARA), which utilizes water as a catalyst to quickly 
      and inexpensively convert plant and algal oils into stable intermediate 
      oil products, which are very similar to petroleum crude oil. The 
      intermediate oils are processed with hydrogen using CLG&#8217;s ISOCONVERSION&#8482; 
      catalysts to produce renewable jet fuel and diesel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This agreement includes a Master Services Agreement for CLG and ARA 
      Engineering Services and expands the use of this unique, low cost 
      refining process beyond North America to global jet and diesel fuels 
      production, including the upgrade of the existing 50 million gallon per 
      year Aemetis biodiesel plant in Kakinada, India and other Aemetis 
      projects worldwide,&#8221; said Leon de Bruyn, Managing Director of Chevron 
      Lummus Global.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This agreement will enable Aemetis to produce and deliver 100% drop-in 
      alternative jet and diesel fuels with lower capital and operating costs 
      than existing technologies, meeting commercial and military demand in 
      Europe, Asia and other regions,&#8221; stated Chuck Red, Biofuels Program 
      Manager for ARA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The refining technology developed by Chevron Lummus Global and ARA 
      produces lower-cost, renewable replacements for existing petroleum 
      products,&#8221; said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. &#8220;As global 
      fuel supply chains seek to become less dependent on crude oil due to 
      supply and price uncertainty, the availability of replacement jet and 
      diesel fuel from sustainable, renewable feedstocks will be rapidly 
      adopted as a primary source of storable, transportable, dense energy for 
      military and commercial operations.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Barclays Capital cut its price target on Microsoft Inc's (MSFT.O) stock after the world's largest software company reported a greater-than-expected dip in its quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most brokerages maintained their ratings and price targets on the stock ahead of next week's Windows 8 launch, described by Credit Agricole Securities as the most comprehensive product refresh cycle in Microsoft's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported a 22 percent drop in profit on Thursday due to a fall in sales of computers running the Windows operating system in a weak PC market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First-quarter sales fell 8 percent to $16.01 billion and some revenue was deferred ahead of upcoming releases of its core Windows and Office products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company, which closed at $29.49 on Thursday on the Nasdaq, were set to open 2 percent lower on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the weakness in the Windows business was expected, the poor showing by the Office business and the server and tools division was a surprise, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenschow lowered his price target on the stock to $34 from $36, but maintained his "equal weight" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... We still prefer to wait on the sidelines until after the Windows 8 launch next week," he said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is betting on the release of the touch-friendly Windows 8, which will also run on tablets, to break its heavy reliance on PC sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC sales are expected to fall this year for the first time since 2001, according to research firm IHS (IHS.N), due to the weak economy and the inability of the latest crop of lightweight laptops to compete with Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft needs to be successful in tablets to mitigate structural concerns of eroding market share and margin in its core Windows and Office businesses, Lenschow added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenschow is rated four stars for the accuracy of his estimates on Microsoft's earnings, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Credit Agricole said they were looking beyond the first-quarter results and expected momentum to build through financial year 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferies analyst Ross MacMillan said he was "yet to be convinced on Windows 8" and maintained his "hold" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft's Surface tablet, expected to go on sale on October 26, holds much promise, it may need some time to work out the issues that have historically characterized new Microsoft offerings, J.P.

&lt;p&gt;* Most other brokerages maintain ratings and targets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares set to open 2 pct down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 19 (Reuters) - Barclays Capital cut its price target on
Microsoft Inc's stock after the world's largest
software company reported a greater-than-expected dip in its
quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most brokerages maintained their ratings and price
targets on the stock ahead of next week's Windows 8 launch,
described by Credit Agricole Securities as the most
comprehensive product refresh cycle in Microsoft's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported a 22 percent drop in profit on Thursday
due to a fall in sales of computers running the Windows
operating system in a weak PC market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First-quarter sales fell 8 percent to $16.01 billion and
some revenue was deferred ahead of upcoming releases of its core
Windows and Office products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company, which closed at $29.49 on Thursday on
the Nasdaq, were set to open 2 percent lower on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the weakness in the Windows business was expected, the
poor showing by the Office business and the server and tools
division was a surprise, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenschow lowered his price target on the stock to $34 from
$36, but maintained his "equal weight" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... We still prefer to wait on the sidelines until after

Windows 8, which will also run on tablets, to break its heavy
reliance on PC sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC sales are expected to fall this year for the first time
since 2001, according to research firm IHS, due to the
weak economy and the inability of the latest crop of lightweight
laptops to compete with Apple Inc's iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft needs to be successful in tablets to mitigate
structural concerns of eroding market share and margin in its
core Windows and Office businesses, Lenschow added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenschow is rated four stars for the accuracy of his
estimates on Microsoft's earnings, according to Thomson Reuters
Starmine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Credit Agricole said they were looking beyond
the first-quarter results and expected momentum to build through
financial year 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferies analyst Ross MacMillan said he was "yet to be
convinced on Windows 8" and maintained his "hold" rating on the
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft's Surface tablet, expected to go on sale on
Oct. 26, holds much promise, it may need some time to work out
the issues that have historically characterized new Microsoft
offerings, J.P. Morgan analyst John DiFucci said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not assuming much impact of Surface to our model at

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The tell-all book that Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) former equity derivatives salesman Greg Smith has delivered may end up being remembered more for the marketing skills he picked up at the Wall Street bank than for any bombshell revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith created a furor earlier this year when he resigned from the blue chip Wall Street firm, alleging in a New York Times Op-Ed column that the firm had engendered a "toxic" culture of treating clients as "muppets" - slang in Britain for idiots - and relieving them of their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith then promised a book about the bank, building up expectations of an expos&#233; with new insights about the culture at Goldman. The threat prompted a public relations campaign and internal inquiries at the bank, as it tried to avoid another hit to its image after suffering a barrage of bad publicity in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith reportedly received $1.5 million as an upfront payment for the book, which is being published by Grand Central Publishing, a unit of Hachette. He has lined up a series of interviews, including one with Reuters, to talk about the book "Why I left Goldman Sachs", which will be released on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reviews of Smith's 288-page book are now in, and they aren't good. Reviewers, who received copies of the full book, have panned it for being a sleepy read with no big revelations -- or worse, misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tawdriest revelations are about a bachelor party in Las Vegas with a topless woman, and Smith having seen Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, in the buff after showering at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were no examples of a toxic culture at work, no actual names of morally bankrupt people and no examples of a client getting ripped off," wrote James Stewart, himself the author of top selling business books such as Den of Thieves, in his column in the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Smith's book might even bolster Goldman's reputation. After all, if Mr. Smith is the ultimate insider, and this is as bad as it gets &#8212; Mr. Smith in a hot tub at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas with a topless woman &#8212; then he hasn't made much of a case," said Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stewart also cast doubt on some of the anecdotes Smith tells in his story, interviewing people who were in his internship class, such as Teddy Schwarzman, son of Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) CEO Stephen Schwarzman. Schwarzman and others say the incidents Smith described, such as an intern running out of a room crying after being humiliated by a more senior Goldman executive, never happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other early reviews have also been critical. The financial blog Dealbreaker mocked less-than-revelatory anecdotes in Smith's book, including one in which a managing director threw out a "cheddar cheese salad" that an intern had brought him for lunch, instead of the cheese sandwich he had asked for. That anecdote led to more jokes on Twitter and other financial blogs about what, exactly, a cheddar cheese salad is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith's publicist, Jimmy Franco, did not respond to a request for comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith's ability to so easily build up buzz about his book over the past few months shows how difficult it has been for Goldman to try to counter perceptions that it is the poster child for all that's wrong on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the bank of betting against clients on a mortgage trade, charges that were later settled, but nevertheless led to a firestorm of criticism.

Smith spent 12 years at the investment bank. By the time of his resignation, he was a vice president, earning about $500,000 a year, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has said that it looked into Smith's assertions and did not find any evidence of employees misbehaving or treating clients poorly. Blankfein told CNBC recently that the firm "went over everything like crazy and, frankly, we could find nothing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marketing strategy for the book shines a spotlight on tactics used by publishers and authors to drum up sales for upcoming publications - and the problems that it can create when the book in question fails to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears to be "a typical example of overpromising and under-delivering," said George Belch, chair of the marketing department at San Diego State University and an expert on consumer behavior, who noted that he has not yet read the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they do is try to drum up publicity and whet the public appetite, and clearly Goldman Sachs, for certain portions of the population, is intriguing.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Congressman Barney Frank defended the largest U.S. bank on Monday, saying in a statement that the government was wrong to go after JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co for the alleged misdeeds of Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank, who served as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee during the Bear Stearns acquisition, said federal and state officials should reconsider holding financial firms liable for the wrongdoing of institutions they absorbed at the government's urging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The decision now to prosecute J.P. Morgan Chase because of activities undertaken by Bear Stearns before the takeover unfortunately fits the description of allowing no good deed to go unpunished," said Frank, who was also the co-author of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank by assets, on October 1 over mortgage-backed securities packaged and sold by Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Schneiderman gained support from former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer who said in a statement that the complaint catalogs evidence of "platform-wide wrongdoing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a necessary action to bring accountability for the mortgage meltdown and the financial collapse. Widespread misconduct should not disappear simply because one bank has been acquired by another."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon lashed out at the lawsuit, saying it could make financial firms think twice about rescuing their failing rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His bank and its shareholders were still paying the price for doing the Federal Reserve "a favor" by buying Bear Stearns in early 2008, when its instability was threatening the larger financial system, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In defending JPMorgan, Frank, who is retiring at the end of this term, backed up Dimon's assertion that the government pushed Bear Stearns onto JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal officials urged JPMorgan "to do a good deed by taking over an institution which, I believe, the bank would never have sought to acquire absent that urging," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank also drew a line between what he said were fair legal actions and unfair ones, noting he was not advocating for immunity for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he said Bank of America should probably be shielded from government legal action related to Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America took over in part because of federal officials' urging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Frank said he was aware of no federal urging that led former Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis to take over Countrywide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Aruna Viswanatha.

misconduct should not disappear simply because one bank has been
acquired by another."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon
lashed out at the lawsuit, saying it could make financial firms
think twice about rescuing their failing rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His bank and its shareholders were still paying the price
for doing the Federal Reserve "a favor" by buying Bear Stearns
in early 2008, when its instability was threatening the larger
financial system, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In defending JPMorgan, Frank, who is retiring at the end of
this term, backed up Dimon's assertion that the government
pushed Bear Stearns onto JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal officials urged JPMorgan "to do a good deed by
taking over an institution which, I believe, the bank would
never have sought to acquire absent that urging," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank also drew a line between what he said were fair legal
actions and unfair ones, noting he was not advocating for
immunity for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he said Bank of America should probably
be shielded from government legal action related to Merrill
Lynch, which Bank of America took over in part because of
federal officials' urging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Frank said he was aware of no federal urging that
led former Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis to take over
Countrywide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BALTIMORE, Oct. 22, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Goldman Small Cap Research, a stock market research firm focused on the small cap and micro cap sectors, has issued research coverage of Fairmont Resources Inc. (TSX-V:FMR) (OTCPK:FRSSF), an aggressive explorer focused on the development of strategic properties in the Thunder Bay region of Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Fairmont Resources' key projects, Marmion South Contact, Powell-Clay, and Houghton Creek properties are all located in the mining friendly jurisdiction of Ontario, which have a history of not only past production but recent discovery. One of these properties, Marmion South Contact, is contiguous with Osisko's well-known Hammond Reef gold deposit which contains an 43-101 compliant inferred resource of 10.52 million ounces of gold at 0.62 g/t. The Hammond Reef project has been one of the largest drilling/exploration projects in North America in the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In the Goldman Opportunity Research report on the Company, analyst Rob Goldman outlines his investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Given that Hammond Reef is the most advanced project in Osikso's pipeline with all indicators pointing to its being Osikso's next mine and the potential for Fairmont to discover significant gold mineralization on its contiguous Marmion South Contact property, we view FMR as an inexpensive way to play the likely blockbuster success of Hammond Reef."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 22 (Reuters) - Democratic Congressman Barney

&lt;p&gt;By Antony Currie
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs expos&#233; by a disgruntled former trader hasn&#8217;t gone quite according to plan. Greg Smith, who quit the bank earlier this year by publishing an op-ed in the New York Times, doesn&#8217;t blow the lid on anything new or untoward about Goldman or even the industry. The real revelation is what his tenure says about the firm&#8217;s apparent erosion of employment standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By most accounts, Smith was a decent trader after 12 years at Goldman who was trusted enough to run a desk in London. But he also comes across as na&#239;ve and willfully ignorant about the longstanding ways of Wall Street. Most of the book, &#8220;Why I Left Goldman Sachs,&#8221; fails to deal explicitly with the two major beefs Smith identified in his public letter of resignation: the loss of what made Goldman&#8217;s culture special and the tendency to rip off clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clients Smith professes to advocate don&#8217;t make much of an appearance. And his failure to mention the history of conflicts of interest and dodgy dealings by bankers, including at Goldman, is at best peculiar. Instead, the tome is largely a collection of bland career reminiscences, including Smith&#8217;s preference for an electric razor and a narrow escape when he lacked the money to pay for lap dances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely Smith will upend the investment banking establishment as he says he&#8217;d like to do. Michael Lewis&#8217;s explosive &#8220;Liar&#8217;s Poker&#8221; disclosed far greater detail about the salacious culture of trading  and yet managed to spark more careers than it ended. And the disillusionment over greed and a lost commitment to relationships has been done before and better by Goldman and Morgan Stanley veteran Jonathan Knee, whose career at Evercore Partners continued after the publication of &#8220;The Accidental Investment Banker.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most damning thing to come out of the episode for Goldman is that one of its alumni produced a work so unremarkable. Goldman&#8217;s own talking points about Smith reinforce the point. Clients and shareholders couldn&#8217;t be blamed for wondering just how many more Greg Smiths are toiling away inside Goldman. Unlike Smith&#8217;s publisher, though, at least Goldman never gave him a check for $1.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By&#160;all accounts, neither Michael Lewis nor Frank Serpico should be concerned about competition from Greg Smith, the erstwhile Goldman Sachs vice president whose supposed tell-all, Why I Left Goldman Sachs, was published Monday. Ive only read the first chapter excerpt thats been floating around the Internet since last week, but Smith clearly lacks Lewiss humor and narrative verve, and reviewers who read advance copies of the entire book have said theres&#160;not much substance&#160;to his assertions about Goldmans culture. I suspect that Smith will have a short shelf life as a Wall Street chronicler and whistle-blower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in an&#160;interview Sunday night&#160;with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes, Smith caught my attention when he echoed an accusation thats become a meme of financial crisis litigation: Goldman abused the trust of unsuspecting clients when it offloaded its exposure to mortgage-backed securities via complex financial instruments. These are very complicated derivative securities which (it) takes a PhD in physics or in engineering to understand, Smith told Cooper,&#160;according to a transcript. There are pension funds and mutual funds that represent peoples 401(k)s and retirement savings that are trading the most complex instruments out there without fully understanding them, he said. Getting an unsophisticated client was the golden prize. The quickest way to make money on Wall Street is to take the most sophisticated product and try to sell it to the least sophisticated client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the law, as you know, an investors sophistication is not an incidental question.&#160;Courts expect&#160;that so-called sophisticated investors engage in their own due diligence and dont rely entirely on what sellers tell them. Sophisticated investors have a higher bar for claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation than ordinary people who buy and sell securities. So, as a matter of law, were the Goldman clients that bought the toxic CDOs Smith mentioned really unsophisticated? Or just less sophisticated than Goldman Sachs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different judges have answered that question quite differently in litigation over Goldmans subprime-stuffed CDOs. U.S. District Judge&#160;William Pauley&#160;of Manhattan, in a ruling&#160;affirmed by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appealslast May, said that Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg couldnt show that it justifiably relied on Goldman when it decided to invest in the $2 billion Davis Square CDO because the German regional bank had the expertise to evaluate the CDOs risks. But the other state and federal judges who have ruled in Goldman CDO cases have agreed with Smiths assessment of Goldmans alleged dupes. The latest of these decisions came Friday, when New York State Supreme Court Justice&#160;Shirley Kornreichrefused to dismiss&#160;fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims against Goldman by a defunct Cayman Islands hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund, Basic Yield Alpha Fund (Master), said Goldman misrepresented the underlying assets and its own position in the notorious Timberwolf CDO, which defaulted within weeks of BYAFMs investment. Kornreich referenced Goldman Sachss alleged campaign to purge subprime mortgage exposure, calling the assertions big picture fraud and citing U.S. District Judge&#160;Victor Marrerosruling last March&#160;in another hedge funds very similar case against Goldman, this one involving the allegedly rigged-to-fail Hudson CDOs. Kornreichs colleague in state court in Manhattan, Justice&#160;Barbara Kapnick, has also&#160;described&#160;Goldmans allegedly fraudulent offloading of subprime exposure in a decision last April that permitted the bond insurer ACA to proceed with claims that it was misled into backing yet another infamous Goldman CDO, Abacus. All three rulings suggest that, however sophisticated Goldmans counterparties were, the bank withheld crucial information that would have informed their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has refused to concede that point. In fact, in two of the cases, the bank has revived sophisticated investor arguments in counterclaims against its alleged dupes. I told you in May about&#160;Goldmans allegations about the Hudson investor, a fund founded by a former Salomon asset-backed trader that marketed its expertise in mortgage-related CDOs. Last week, the banks lawyers at&#160;Sullivan  Cromwell&#160;filed&#160;a new brief&#160;in the ACA case, asserting that if the insurer is telling the truth about relying on Goldman Sachs emails describing the selection of the securities underlying the Abacus CDO, then ACA breached its own representations about the deal in the Abacus offering circular. The bond insurer, Goldman asserts, cant have it both ways: It cant tell CDO investors one thing about its due diligence but say another in court. The bank hasnt yet filed counterclaims in the BYAFM case, in which it is represented by Boies, Schiller  Flexner, but its a good bet well see allegations that the hedge fund was an experienced CDO investor with a record of battling Goldman Sachs margin calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the CDO counterparties suing Goldman quite fits the role of victim in the scenario Smith sketched for Cooper in Sundays 60 Minutes interview, in which, according to Smith, the bank allegedly sought out philanthropies or endowments or teachers retirement pension funds in Alabama or Virginia or Oregon as buyers of its incomprehensible-to-mere-mortals derivatives. Frankly, Smiths scenario sounds a lot like the allegations against Morgan Stanley in the&#160;Cheyne and Rhinebridge CDO cases.&#160;(And Goldman has&#160;denied any allegation&#160;that it put the banks interest before those of its clients.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But right now, as you can see from the different outcomes Goldman has had in essentially parallel cases, the line that defines fraudulent and perfectly legal interactions between CDO sponsors and investors is blurrier than it should be. As the Goldman CDO cases move forward, theyre going to provide important focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to&#160;Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration should pressure Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) to slow down dealings with Iraqi Kurdistan as they could worsen disputes between Baghdad and the northern province, Iraq's ambassador to the United States said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon angered Baghdad a year ago by signing an exploration deal with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in the north. The KRG quickly struck similar deals with other global oil companies but the central government in Baghdad deemed all the deals null and void.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disputed areas between partly autonomous Kurdistan and Baghdad are seen as a potential flashpoint as tensions between regions of Iraq rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need the American government to exert some pressure on this company," Jabir Habeb, Iraq's ambassador to the United States, told reporters about Exxon after a panel on Iraq's energy potential at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ambassador said he met with a U.S. energy official recently who told him the U.S. government could not apply a lot of pressure on Exxon because the company makes decisions that benefit its shareholders.

&lt;p&gt;JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president who publicly accused the bank of taking advantage of unsuspecting clients said he never intended his book to be an expose of practices at the Wall Street firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary reviews of Greg Smith's "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," which hits bookstores on Monday, have been lackluster. Critics say the book contains few revelations, given that it had been hyped as a "tell all" look at the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, a native of South Africa, told Reuters in a phone interview on Sunday that his book was not meant to be a manual for change on Wall Street. Instead, he said he wanted to shine a light on what was wrong in investment banking and how ordinary people - not the super-wealthy - pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are looking for something sensationalist and expose-like," said Smith, who sold equity derivatives at Goldman. "I would like people to look at it in a thoughtful manner, with an objective sense that Wall Street has do to things that are right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't write this book for Wall Street, I just wanted to give the Main Street people a window into what goes on, so they could make their own judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith created a furor earlier this year when he resigned from Goldman, saying in a New York Times op-ed column that the firm had engendered a "toxic" culture of treating clients as "muppets" - slang in Britain for idiots - and relieving them of their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith then promised the book about the bank, building up expectations of new insights about the culture at Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grand Central Publishing, a unit of Hachette, planned a print run of 150,000 copies for the book. That is considered a relatively big number for a first run, although many will also be sold through e-book formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publisher declined to say how much it had paid Smith for the book, but media reports said he had received $1.5 million as an upfront payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith's op-ed piece and his plans to write a book prompted a public relations campaign and internal inquiries at the bank, as it tried to avoid another hit to its image after suffering a barrage of bad publicity in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Goldman Sachs Mr. Smith describes is not one our employees would recognize," a spokesman for the firm said on Sunday. "Mr. Smith has asked for answers, yet he did not respond to our repeated attempts to contact him after his abrupt departure earlier this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has said it looked into Smith's allegations - including the use of "muppet" in emails - and turned up little. The bank says that unless Smith provides specific examples, it cannot check what he is alleging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although "Why I Left Goldman Sachs" does not reveal a new scandal at the firm, Smith said he believed his book shines a spotlight on a worsening culture of greed on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, who worked for Goldman in London, said the company would overcharge customers, such as charities or funds managing the pensions of teachers and firemen, or sell them products they did not need and did not understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Smith said, traders would use knowledge of the clients' business to make easy bets against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're trying to make an extra $2 million off a teachers' retirement fund, it doesn't jive at least with the values that I felt," he said. "There is no criminal activity because it's legal. But it should not be allowed, because it's unethical."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, who quit his $500,000-a-year job at the bank, said he would do more to push for change in finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am in a rush to spread a message and get mainstream people to realize there is a big problem and to be outraged that no one fixed it," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a real absence of people within the financial industry trying to advocate for positive reform," he said. "I would like to try to be part of that conversation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Exxon signed exploration deal with Kurdistan last October&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The US oil company wants to leave giant oilfield in south&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Iraq wants Exxon to stay in the south&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The Obama administration
should pressure Exxon Mobil to slow down dealings with
Iraqi Kurdistan as they could worsen disputes between Baghdad
and the northern province, Iraq's ambassador to the United

this company," Jabir Habeb, Iraq's ambassador to the United
States, told reporters about Exxon after a panel on Iraq's
energy potential at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ambassador said he met with a U.S. energy official
recently who told him the U.S. government could not apply a lot
of pressure on Exxon because the company makes decisions that
benefit its shareholders. Habeb said he told the official the
issue could cause political and social problems so it should not
be seen as a shareholder issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy company is hoping to exit its flagship West
Qurna-1 oilfield project in southern Iraq, diplomatic sources
said last week, as profits there are thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts have said other oil companies from Russia and
elsewhere may not have the know-how and resources to maximize
production from the giant Qurna field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habeb said Iraq wants Exxon to stay in the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We prefer them to be there and I think the potential of oil
in the south of Iraq there's no comparison with the north of
Iraq, so I think they understand this fact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Paris-based International Energy Agency released a
report on Iraq this month that said oil production in the south

&lt;p&gt;Greg Smith, the ex-Goldman Sachs salesman who stunned the investment bank with a scathing public resignation in March, is now on the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, whose book, &#8220;Why I Left Goldman Sachs&#8221; hits bookstores today, has been facing the wrath of Goldman, media critics, and online commenters since last week, when bits and pieces of his book began to leak out and Goldman quickly jumped at the chance to characterize him as an&#160;undistinguished&#160;ex-employee with an&#160;ax&#160;to grind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said Smith quit because he&#160;didnt&#160;get the raise or position he wanted. It has also tried to cast doubt on the veracity of his claims by making other current and ex-Goldman employees available for media interviews to dispute Smith&#8217;s characterization of events in his book anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, a 33-year-old South Africa native and ping-pong champion, has also gotten some criticism from those who have read the book and found his story too na&#239;ve, too silly or, in some cases, too dishonest to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith spoke with Reuters&#8217; South Africa correspondent, David Dolan, about why he wrote the book, and responded to some criticisms from Goldman and the chattering class. He said he has received over 4,000 messages of support through email, Facebook and elsewhere since taking his concerns public in a New York Times op-ed. (Not to add another volley to this PR ping-pong game, but, in response to Smith&#8217;s response to their response, Goldman said his claims are not specific enough to investigate and that he did not respond to their repeated efforts to contact him.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some additional comments Smith made to Dolan can be found below, edited for clarity and space:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why he went public with concerns:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did this Business Standards Committee study and I just saw over and over and over again how it was lip service&#8230;After I had gone through a process of speaking to a lot of partners, I could see that even though a lot of people agreed, there was no incentive to change anything. I had this overwhelming feeling that it was the right thing to do to try to repair the system by saying something publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the reaction sparked by his op-ed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My initial reaction was I was very excited and proud that it was sparking a debate which Wall Street does not want to haveI did not expect this kind of attention, this media barrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On criticism that the book does not have any big, new revelations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that overcharging a teachers&#8217; pension fund or convincing a client to do the exact opposite of what you believe&#8230; or selling a product they don&#8217;t understand that will pay the firm a few extra million dollars, I don&#8217;t think those things as acceptable and I do see those things as serious charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On whether he&#8217;s just out to embarrass Goldman:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was one of the proudest proponents of Goldman Sachs. I actually bought into the culture. There was the old Goldman principle of the long-term: if you do right by clients and tell them what you really think, ultimately they are going to trust you and come back to you. I want Goldman to be that again. I did not do this to embarrass Goldman or to do anything untoward. I want Goldman to take this seriously and address the problem and try to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Goldman&#8217;s response to his accusations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep denying there is a cultural or ethical problem is not just honest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind closed doors, people acknowledge this is a problem. That&#8217;s what in my mind is so disappointing about Goldman just blanketly saying &#8216;there is no problem, we searched for the word &#8216;muppet&#8217; and didn&#8217;t find it and therefore there is no problem.&#8217; The thing I&#8217;m really surprised the media doesn&#8217;t see through is calling someone a name is what Wall Street is &#8211; it&#8217;s banter. That&#8217;s not a terrible thing. The terrible thing is you called a teachers&#8217; pension fund a muppet because they did not understand the product they were trading and paid the firm an extra $2 million. That is the problem, not name calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I&#8217;m really looking forward to is raising these questions and hopefully getting answers that do not have to do with searching emails but have to do with teachers retirement funds, betting against clients and overcharging them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Goldman&#8217;s characterization of him as a mediocre employee who quit because of compensation, or because he was likely to be fired:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t seem to realize is that by doing this, they are almost confirming the things I said in the op-ed. This idea of, &#8216;win at all costs&#8217; &#8211; the erosion of integrity. They are not addressing one single point that I&#8217;ve actually made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was doing well in my career. I was at the place for 12 years I survived in one of the most cutthroat environments in Wall Street. Out of the 75 people I started with as a summer intern, there were only 7 of us left.&#160; My reviews were excellent and I would ask Goldman to release all my reviews. Release the emails from the seven partners who told me within before I left what a stellar job &#8230; There was a lot of praise coming in, and I grew the business there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think in a sense, talking about compensation and leaking reviews does not address the problem and, No. 2, I just think the idea of releasing confidential employee information does not strike me as high integrity way to go about addressing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why relate the anecdote of Blankfein in the gym naked?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn&#8217;t write a proscriptive, boring book&#8230; I wanted to reach a wide audience to show them what Wall Street&#8217;s really like and give them a window into it. I needed to tell my own story and make it accessible to people, so anything I write in the book, I mean in good spirits or good humor, I was not trying to embarrass anyone or hurt anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are you going to do when you are done promoting the book?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a real absence of people within the financial industry trying to advocate for positive reform. I would like to try to be part of that conversation in the medium term, whether that is helping regulators give insight into what goes on, whether its speaking to an audience of students, whether its writing more about it, I haven&#8217;t figured out what the right way to do it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Oct 22 (Marketwire) -- 
Egnyte, the leading provider of cloud file sharing infrastructure for
business, today announced that beginning October 26, it is extending
support to Microsoft Windows 8, including browser support for Internet
Explorer 10 and Egnyte Mobile App support for Windows Mobile 8. The
company is updating Egnyte access to ensure that users have the same
quality, speed, security and accessibility to all their files after
upgrading to Windows 8.

    "Microsoft remains a key player in not just the enterprise, but in every
business worldwide," said Vineet Jain, CEO of Egnyte. "That means that
creating a Windows 8 version of our product is an important part of our
support for every Egnyte customer and we're excited to offer it."

    To support Windows 8, Egnyte will be updating its methods of access to
Egnyte HybridCloud file server:


--  Browser: Users can already access files online using any standard web
    browser. Support for Windows 8 now extends that access to the new
    Internet Explorer 10. Through the web interface, users have access to
    a wide range of Egnyte functionalities such as file upload, download,
    sharing and editing.
--  Personal Local Cloud: Providing sync capabilities between the Windows
    8 desktop and the online file server, the Personal Local Cloud
    provides seamless synchronization of selected folders to the Cloud
    File Server, providing offline access to files as well as the ability
    to share using online file storage.
--  Mapped Drive: Accessing files via the mapped drive is like accessing
    any other folder or hard disk drive on the computer: search, open,
    move, copy, rename, delete files just like any other file. Egnyte now
    supports these capabilities on Windows 8.
--  Mobile Apps: Users can access files on their mobile devices in two
    ways: by using a standard mobile web browser or using Egnyte's mobile
    applications. Now with support for Windows Mobile 8, the Egnyte mobile
    app not only lets users create, access, manage, share and edit files,
    but also download files locally on their mobile device for offline
    access.

&lt;p&gt;JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) vice president who publicly accused the bank of taking advantage of unsuspecting clients said he never intended his book to be an expose of practices at the Wall Street firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary reviews of Greg Smith's "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," which hits bookstores on Monday, have been lackluster. Critics say the book contains few revelations, given that it had been hyped as a "tell all" look at the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, a native of South Africa, told Reuters in a phone interview on Sunday that his book was not meant to be a manual for change on Wall Street. Instead, he said he wanted to shine a light on what was wrong in investment banking and how ordinary people - not the super-wealthy - pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are looking for something sensationalist and expose-like," said Smith, who sold equity derivatives at Goldman. "I would like people to look at it in a thoughtful manner, with an objective sense that Wall Street has do to things that are right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't write this book for Wall Street, I just wanted to give the Main Street people a window into what goes on, so they could make their own judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith created a furor earlier this year when he resigned from Goldman, saying in a New York Times op-ed column that the firm had engendered a "toxic" culture of treating clients as "muppets" - slang in Britain for idiots - and relieving them of their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith then promised the book about the bank, building up expectations of new insights about the culture at Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grand Central Publishing, a unit of Hachette, planned a print run of 150,000 copies for the book. That is considered a relatively big number for a first run, although many will also be sold through e-book formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publisher declined to say how much it had paid Smith for the book, but media reports said he had received $1.5 million as an upfront payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith's op-ed piece and his plans to write a book prompted a public relations campaign and internal inquiries at the bank, as it tried to avoid another hit to its image after suffering a barrage of bad publicity in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Goldman Sachs Mr. Smith describes is not one our employees would recognize," a spokesman for the firm said on Sunday. "Mr. Smith has asked for answers, yet he did not respond to our repeated attempts to contact him after his abrupt departure earlier this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has said it looked into Smith's allegations - including the use of "muppet" in emails - and turned up little. The bank says that unless Smith provides specific examples, it cannot check what he is alleging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although "Why I Left Goldman Sachs" does not reveal a new scandal at the firm, Smith said he believed his book shines a spotlight on a worsening culture of greed on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, who worked for Goldman in London, said the company would overcharge customers, such as charities or funds managing the pensions of teachers and firemen, or sell them products they did not need and did not understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Smith said, traders would use knowledge of the clients' business to make easy bets against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're trying to make an extra $2 million off a teachers' retirement fund, it doesn't jive at least with the values that I felt," he said. "There is no criminal activity because it's legal. But it should not be allowed, because it's unethical."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, who quit his $500,000-a-year job at the bank, said he would do more to push for change in finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am in a rush to spread a message and get mainstream people to realize there is a big problem and to be outraged that no one fixed it," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a real absence of people within the financial industry trying to advocate for positive reform," he said. "I would like to try to be part of that conversation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS, Nev., Oct. 22, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - The Walters Group is immediately offering for sale 150 acre feet of fully transferable Las Vegas Water Rights at the rate of $25,500 per acre foot which is current market value.   The water rights are fully transferable. The nature of these Las Vegas water rights is the most highly valuable designation for water rights available in the State of Nevada.  Investors may elect to purchase these water rights in full, as single transaction of all one hundred and fifty (150) acres or in blocks of as few as two (2) acres.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All appropriate documentation of the water rights will be provided by seller. For immediate reference purposes please refer to application number 24909, certificate number 8017 and permit numbers 23088, 23089 and 24904. Only serious inquiries will be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Buy Water Rights?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevada's Water Rights law is based on statutes enacted in 1903 and 1905 and are founded on the principal of Prior Appropriation. Unlike some other states, Nevada has a statewide system for the administration of both ground water and surface water. Appropriative water rights are based on the concept of applying water to Beneficial Use and "First in Time, First in Right." Appropriative water rights can be lost through nonuse and they may be sold or transferred apart from the land. Due in large part to the relative scarcity of water in Nevada and numerous competing uses, Nevada has had a thriving market for water rights transfers for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drought and future water supply are cause for growing concern. Global climate scientists continue to raise questions that put old models and studies in question. Future demographic shifts and increased demand for food will strain existing allocations and systems. The unintended consequences of surface water use, and diversion has created devastating results in some areas already. Today pumping of ground water in some areas of the United States has lowered water tables hundreds of miles away. Recharge rates based in time may be measured in thousands of years. Looking forward one thing is certain; the demand for water will only increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About The Walters Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Walters Group is a multifaceted entrepreneurial group of businesses that includes residential and commercial developments and various land holdings. The Walters Group is a leader in the development and operation of quality, high-end golf facilities.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 22 (Marketwire) -- 
IBM Information on Demand - Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC)
announced today the latest release of its v7.1 product suite for IBM(R)
FileNet(R) P8, which includes IGC's unique role-based redaction
technology. IGC, a leader in viewing, collaboration and redaction
technology, demonstrates the combined functionality of Brava!(R)
Enterprise and Redact-It(R) Enterprise 7.1 at the IBM Information on
Demand conference at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada at IGC booth #1114.

    The new v7.1 integration makes it easy for companies to protect sensitive
data stored in the FileNet P8 repository. With role-based redaction,
documents can be redacted on the fly based on predefined business rules.
Redact-It includes built-in macros to automatically redact personal
information like Social Security numbers and allows administrators to
create custom search criteria using regular expressions. For standard
forms, they can create zone-based redaction templates, too. 

    Role-based redaction eliminates the need to store redacted versions of
documents and allows sensitive data to be accessed by the people who need
to see it and protected from those who don't. When users view a file in
Brava, it will automatically deliver the appropriate view (redacted or
not redacted) based on the permissions assigned to their role in FileNet.
This helps companies reduce liability and achieve regulatory compliance
without sacrificing workow efficiency. Brava's redaction
technology is a secure way to protect intellectual property, employee and
customer data, patient records and more.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 22 (Marketwire) -- 
IBM Information on Demand - Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC)
unveils Brava!(R) 7.1 for the IBM(R) FileNet(R) P8 platform, a
high-performance viewer that provides unmatched functionality and
security, and now offers a zero-footprint, cross-platform HTML5 client
option in addition to its ActiveX client. IGC, a leader in viewing,
collaboration and redaction technology, demonstrates Brava 7.1 at the IBM
Information on Demand conference at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Conference attendees can see a live demonstration of the software at the
IGC booth, #1114.

    Brava makes it easy to view, annotate and collaborate on almost any file,
including office and PDF documents, CAD drawings and image files. Now,
the new Brava HTML5 client provides a zero-footprint, cross-platform
option, making Brava available to more users than ever. Because it is
HTML-based, there is nothing to install on the user's workstation, no
browser plug-in or other technology needed and it can be run on virtually
any platform (including PC, Mac and Linux) and in virtually any web
browser (including Chrome, IE, Safari and Firefox).

    "I'm very proud of the innovative engineering that went into our new,
robust HTML5 client and its seamless integration to IBM's Content
Navigator," said IGC CEO Gary Heath. "IGC continues to invest in new
technology, like HTML5, and in staying current with our partners'
offerings." Responsive to the range of IBM products, IGC will release
Brava 7.1 for IBM Content Navigator supporting both P8 and CM8
integrations in addition to FileNet Workplace/XT. 

    The HTML5 client offers the rich collaboration features Brava users
depend on, including Changemark(TM) annotations, which offer threaded
discussions where users can make and reply to comments -- recording a
complete audit trail of both the discussion and the outcome. It also
offers IBM FileNet users an excellent, scrollable viewing experience,
thumbnails for quick document navigation, search with term-hit
highlighting, publishing to PDF or TIFF, document redaction and much more.

    Also in this release is Brava's shared cache feature, which enhances
viewing performance, reduces server-side processing and provides
additional failover. Shared cache is an example of IGC's commitment to
deliver speed, performance, scalability and enterprise readiness.

      Pharma, NextWave&#8217;s technology and 
      manufacturing partner. Quillivant XR is built on Tris&#8217; OralXR+ platform.

      Unit. &#8220;By combining the advantages of Quillivant XR with Pfizer&#8217;s 
      commercialization expertise, we will be able to provide ADHD patients 
      and their caregivers a new treatment option.&#8221;

      Capture, Offering Prepaid Users Immediate Access to Funds
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tweet this: #Prepaid users can deposit checks with their #mobile

      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and Chexar Networks, Inc. (&#8220;CHEXAR&#8221;) announced today 
      the launch of a network platform to digitize traditional banking 
      services for consumers. Initially, the platform will enable millions of 
      Visa prepaid users to deposit paper checks to their reloadable Visa 
      prepaid card using their mobile device, by simply snapping a photo of a 
      paper check. Powered by Chexar&#8217;s technology, including its remote 
      deposit capture platform, the service provides Visa cardholders with 
      immediate access to funds on their Visa prepaid card, enhancing 
      convenience and security and reducing costs for consumers. Later this 
      year, new and existing prepaid cardholders with RushCard, AccountNow 
      and Plastyc, 
      as well as select FSV Payment Systems cardholders, will be able to 
      enroll their Visa prepaid card, and immediately begin making remote 
      deposits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The platform will support check deposits to Visa cards, funds transfers 
      between Direct Deposit Accounts (DDAs) and payment cards, 
      person-to-person payments and bill payment services whether in-person, 
      online, on a mobile device or at an ATM. Transactions originate and 
      terminate with a financial institution partner and consumer funds sit 
      within an FDIC-insured account. As consumers move between devices and 
      deposit channels, their prepaid account now moves seamlessly with them 
      and works reliably from any device. Chexar predicts that 11 percent (770 
      million) of consumer checks will be deposited using a mobile device by 
      2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We see this network utility as more than a technology, it&#8217;s an 
      evolution in the way people deposit and move funds and our goal is to 
      make that process frictionless and immediate for consumers,&#8221; said Drew 
      W. Edwards, Chexar founder and CEO. &#8220;It&#8217;s no secret that reloadable 
      prepaid cards are growing in popularity, and we are happy to provide 
      consumers with a secure and convenient way to deposit funds and have 
      immediate access to their money. Our agreement with Visa represents an 
      inflection point for the prepaid industry, and will only grow as mobile 
      devices become more ubiquitous.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Visa research, nearly 35 million consumers receive wages 
      and government disbursements via paper check and 34 percent of the 
      study&#8217;s participants revealed that direct deposit was not an option 
      available through their employer. Additionally, a study of payment 
      trends by McKinsey  Company estimated $1.18 trillion in 
      person-to-person payments were made by check in 2009. According to the Federal 
      Deposit Insurance Corporation, more than 28 percent of U.S. 
      households in 2011 weren&#8217;t connected to the traditional banking system. 
      As an alternative, many consumers have turned to prepaid. In 2011, 
      prepaid card use rose by 18 percent according to Javelin 
      Strategy and Research.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Consumers are choosing reloadable prepaid cards at an increasing rate, 
      and for many of the same reasons that consumers embrace other electronic 
      payment options &#8212; security, convenience and reliability,&#8221; said Hyung 
      Choi, head of U.S. Prepaid, Visa Inc. &#8220;Mobile technology and other 
      payment innovations are enabling us to enhance Visa&#8217;s prepaid experience 
      and bring all the conveniences of traditional banking options to 
      consumers who choose to use prepaid.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reloadable Visa prepaid cards offer a secure, convenient and 
      cost-effective alternative to cash and checks, providing consumers a 
      better way to make everyday purchases, pay bills and now, make check 
      deposits. As with all Visa prepaid products, users can make purchases 
      everywhere that Visa debit cards are accepted &#8212; in stores, online or 
      over the phone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Gigwalk Announces $6 Million in Funding, Expands Relationship With 
      Microsoft, and Names New CEO
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Gigwalk adds August Capital to roster of investors, expands 
      relationship with Microsoft to place more than 100,000 Gigs for Bing 
      Maps, and announces Bob Bahramipour as CEO
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gigwalk (http://www.gigwalk.com) 
      today announced $6 Million in Series A venture funding, with the 
      addition of August Capital to existing investors Greylock, Harrison 
      Metal, SoftTech VC, Founder Collective, and AdMob founder Omar Hamoui. 
      Gigwalk&#8217;s mobile work marketplace gives businesses instant access to 
      talented, smartphone-enabled workers across the country.&#160;This round of 
      funding will be used to extend and enhance Gigwalk&#8217;s marketplace and 
      mobile technology. Additionally, Gigwalk recently launched one of its 
      largest Gigs, expanding a relationship with Microsoft&#8217;s Bing that will 
      place over 100,000 photo-capture Gigs in 3,500 cities across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With customer adoption of Gigwalk&#8217;s products accelerating, the company 
      has named former VP of Business Development Bob Bahramipour as CEO to 
      increase its focus on scaling customer acquisition and operations, while 
      CTO and Co-founder Matt Crampton will be expanding his role to CTO and 
      Head of Product. &#8220;Watching Gigwalk&#8217;s growth over the past two years has 
      been awe-inspiring. I couldn&#8217;t be prouder of where Gigwalk is now. Bob 
      is the perfect person to lead Gigwalk to the next level,&#8221; said founder 
      Ariel Seidman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Mobility is disrupting the way businesses go about finding people to 
      get work done, and the smartphone has become the most important tool in 
      business today. Gigwalk is tapping into this trend to give businesses 
      unprecedented access to a contingent workforce that was once a long and 
      arduous process to hire,&#8221; said Howard Hartenbaum, general partner at 
      August Capital.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gigwalk significantly reduces the time and cost for businesses to find, 
      filter, and hire high-quality temporary workers in multiple 
      locations.&#160;At the same time, with the unemployment rate remaining 
      stubbornly at around 8% nationally, smartphone owners can use the 
      Gigwalk app to take part in the $70 billion local freelance labor market 
      -- turning their phones into a second paycheck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expansion of the Microsoft relationship demonstrates this business 
      need for an instant, easy-to-access workforce. Last year, thousands of 
      Gigwalk workers completed tens of thousands of Gigs for Bing across 
      major metro areas. This year&#8217;s new crop of Bing Gigs will include cities 
      of all sizes in every state, including Alaska and Hawaii.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Gigwalk allows us to cost-effectively mobilize thousands of reliable 
      workers to collect rich information and images that would normally be 
      expensive and time consuming to access,&#8221; said David Gedye, principal 
      program manager at Microsoft. &#8220;What really impressed us last year was 
      how quickly we were able to collect&#160;Photosynths (rich 3D wraparound 
      immersive panoramas -&#160;http://photosynth.net/)&#160;of 
      local businesses, and the quality of the work that was delivered. We 
      look forward to seeing the results again this year as we expand the 
      scope of these Gigs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Businesses post Gigs, such as mystery shopping, store audits, field 
      photography, and much more through Gigwalk.com. These are instantly 
      delivered to user&#8217;s phones through the Gigwalk app, where users can earn 
      money by completing the Gigs. Individuals have earned up to $14,000 on 
      Gigwalk since 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In 20 years in China, Microsoft Corp hasn't had much luck. It is the world's largest market for PCs and yet with piracy rates as high as 77 percent, the software company is seeing only a fraction of the revenue it could collect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might change with the launch of its Surface tablet, which goes on sale online in China at the same time as a handful of other countries. The Surface is a rare piece of Microsoft hardware, and will run the company's new Windows 8 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both Windows 8 and the Surface are Microsoft's global challenge to assaults by Apple Inc's iPad and tablets running Google Inc's Android operating system, analysts say the company's splash is a sign of its determination to crack the elusive yet vital China market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that there is no (release) delay and they are treating China as one of their primary markets reflects how important China is to Microsoft and I think that's evident in how they plan to launch Surface," said Adam Leach, a London-based analyst with technology consulting firm Ovum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft chose Shanghai as its first global site for what it called a "pre-launch" of Windows 8 on Tuesday. Speaking to an enthusiastic audience, Windows head Steve Sinofsky began his speech in Mandarin before launching into his sales pitch for Windows 8. The full launch will take place in New York on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tablet will be sold from Friday in China through Suning Appliance Co Ltd's website and retail stores as well as Microsoft's online China store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, has long struggled to monetize China. Its biggest problem has been piracy. Since opening its first Beijing office in 1992, Microsoft has found it hard to gain traction among Chinese consumers unwilling to pay full price for software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Business Software Alliance report in May, China had an illegal software market worth nearly $9 billion last year or a piracy rate of 77 percent. A pirated copy of Microsoft Office can be found for as little as $2 -- against an official price of up to 398 yuan ($63.63).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIGHTING PIRATES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of symbolic raids on software pirates and pronouncements, Microsoft has in recent years changed tack, prodding the government to get pirated software off its computers and replace it with legitimate copies. Although progress is being made, it is not necessarily benefiting Microsoft, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-owned enterprises have offices and subsidiaries spread across the country, slowing down the process, said Bryan Wang, China principal analyst at Forrester Research, while those who do replace their pirated software tend to opt for a much cheaper local variant called Kingsoft WPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to take some time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's other businesses have also not fared so well in China. Since its launch in 2009, Microsoft's search engine Bing is still in beta mode and a sales ban on video game consoles in China means its popular Xbox cannot be sold legally in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, Microsoft's smartphone software had a negligible share of the market while Apple's iPhone accounted for 6 percent of the market and Android phones for 83 percent, according to Analysys International. Local media reported that Nokia is due to launch its first Windows 8 Phone in China by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first blush it faces a similar uphill battle in tablets. Sales of Apple's iPad accounted for 71 percent of tablets sold in the third quarter. Lenovo Group garnered 11 percent and Samsung Electronics 4 percent. Apple announced on Tuesday a smaller version of its iPad, adding to the already crowded field of choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft believes it has prepared the ground to win over skeptics. In its favor is a fast-growing collection of software applications -- usually called apps -- already popular among Chinese users of Apple and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has persuaded Chinese developers such as Tencent Holdings, Sina Corp and PPTV to develop Windows 8 versions of their popular apps that will run on the Surface in advance of the launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that while globally the Surface will have fewer apps than Google's Play store and the Apple's App Store, the Windows App Store in China will have the second-highest number of apps globally when Windows 8 is launched, according to Ralph Haupter, Microsoft's China chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atop that is the familiarity of Microsoft's operating system and office applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I already have an iPad and a Galaxy Note but there are two major constraints with both products, they can't use USB and they can't handle Microsoft Office documents," said one customer who gave only her surname, Ma, who ordered her RT Surface online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also working in its favor is the price. A 32-gigabyte model of the Surface will sell in China for 3,688 yuan ($590), about 800 yuan cheaper than a similar model of iPad sold by Apple. Pricing for the iPad mini was set at $329, which was higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some doubt this is low enough to win over users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chinese consumers like foreign brands but they are still price sensitive. Microsoft's dominance is in software and while the introduction of Surface is good for the Chinese market it needs to be even cheaper if it wants to be more competitive," said Li Yanyan, an analyst with Beijing-based research firm Analysys International. ($1 = 6.2547 Chinese yuan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jeremy Wagstaff in Singapore and the Shanghai newsroom; Editing by Emily Kaiser and Chris Gallagher)&lt;/p&gt;

say the company's splash is a sign of its determination to crack
the elusive yet vital China market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that there is no (release) delay and they are

Microsoft has found it hard to gain traction among Chinese
consumers unwilling to pay full price for software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Business Software Alliance report in May, 
China had an illegal software market worth nearly $9 billion
last year or a piracy rate of 77 percent. A pirated copy of
Microsoft Office can be found for as little as $2 -- against an
official price of up to 398 yuan ($63.63).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIGHTING PIRATES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of symbolic raids on software pirates and
pronouncements, Microsoft has in recent years changed tack,
prodding the government to get pirated software off its
computers and replace it with legitimate copies. Although
progress is being made, it is not necessarily benefiting
Microsoft, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-owned enterprises have offices and subsidiaries spread
across the country, slowing down the process, said Bryan Wang,
China principal analyst at Forrester Research, while those who
do replace their pirated software tend to opt for a much cheaper
local variant called Kingsoft WPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to take some time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's other businesses have also not fared so well in
China. Since its launch in 2009, Microsoft's search engine Bing
is still in beta mode and a sales ban on video game consoles in
China means its popular Xbox cannot be sold legally in the
country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, Microsoft's smartphone software had a
negligible share of the market while Apple's iPhone accounted
for 6 percent of the market and Android phones for 83 percent,
according to Analysys International. Local media reported that
Nokia is due to launch its first Windows 8 Phone in China by the
end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first blush it faces a similar uphill battle in tablets.
Sales of Apple's iPad accounted for 71 percent of tablets sold
in the third quarter. Lenovo Group garnered 11 percent
and Samsung Electronics 4 percent. Apple announced
on Tuesday a smaller version of its iPad, adding to the already
crowded field of choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft believes it has prepared the ground to win
over skeptics. In its favour is a fast-growing collection of
software applications -- usually called apps -- already popular
among Chinese users of Apple and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has persuaded Chinese developers such as Tencent
Holdings, Sina Corp and PPTV to develop 
Windows 8 versions of their popular apps that will run on the
Surface in advance of the launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that while globally the Surface will have fewer
apps than Google's Play store and the Apple's App Store, the
Windows App Store in China will have the second-highest number
of apps globally when Windows 8 is launched, according to Ralph
Haupter, Microsoft's China chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atop that is the familiarity of Microsoft's operating system
and office applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I already have an iPad and a Galaxy Note but there are two
major constraints with both products, they can't use USB and
they can't handle Microsoft Office documents," said one customer
who gave only her surname, Ma, who ordered her RT Surface
online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also working in its favor is the price. A 32-gigabyte model
of the Surface will sell in China for 3,688 yuan ($590), about
800 yuan cheaper than a similar model of iPad sold by Apple.
Pricing for the iPad mini was set at $329, which was higher than
expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some doubt this is low enough to win over users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chinese consumers like foreign brands but they are still
price sensitive. Microsoft's dominance is in software and while
the introduction of Surface is good for the Chinese market it
needs to be even cheaper if it wants to be more competitive,"
said Li Yanyan, an analyst with Beijing-based research firm
Analysys International.&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms J.P. Morgan Tax-Exempt Pass-Through Trust, Series 2011-2
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings on the three classes of 
      certificates issued by J.P. Morgan Tax-Exempt Pass-Through Trust, Series 
      2011-2 (the issuer):
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$16,433,941 class A-1 certificates at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$39,084,559 class A-2 certificates at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$7,500,000 class A-3 certificates at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction represents a pass-through of all proceeds received in 
      respect of the three underlying mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) owned by 
      the trust. The ratings are based on the credit quality of the MRBs, 
      currently rated 'AAA' with a Negative Outlook by Fitch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Proceeds from the certificate issuance were used to purchase three MRBs 
      issued by the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA). The MRBs 
      are currently collateralized by 25 underlying Ginnie Mae (GNMA) and 54 
      Fannie Mae (FNMA) guaranteed mortgage-backed securities totaling 
      approximately $63 million, which is the same balance of the outstanding 
      certificates. The MRBs are all rated 'AAA' with a Negative Outlook by 
      Fitch based on the GNMA and FNMA guarantees of full and timely payment 
      of principal and interest on its securities. The guaranties are backed 
      by the rating of the U.S. treasury, which carries the rating of the 
      United States of America (the U.S. government; rated 'AAA/F1+' with a 
      Negative Outlook by Fitch).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction relies, to a lesser extent, on a series of 
      counterparties to perform particular roles, including the trustee (U.S. 
      Bank, N.A.; rated 'AA-/F1+', Outlook Stable) and the bank at which the 
      certificate account is established (also U.S. Bank). All distributions 
      from the underlying MRBs are deposited into the certificate account 
      where they are held uninvested, and are subsequently withdrawn by the 
      trustee prior to each payment date. The certificate account is a 
      segregated trust account, separated from the assets of the bank in the 
      event of its insolvency. In its role as both issuer account bank and 
      trustee, U.S. Bank continues to satisfy the eligibility criteria 
      described in Fitch's 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance 
      Transactions'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The CUSIPS for the three underlying IHDA MRBs are: 45201YYF8, 45201YYG6, 
      and 45201YYH4. Fitch's last rating commentary for the IHDA MRBs on July 
      19, 2012 titled 'Fitch Affirms Certain Municipal Ratings Directly Linked 
      to U.S. Sovereign' is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed for a second time a ruling on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's controversial plan to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) physically backed by copper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator set a new deadline of December 14 to rule on one of two planned ETFs. It said it needed more time to consider the issues surrounding the fund, which has ignited fears among U.S. copper fabricators about its potential impact on metal flow and prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed (fund)," it said in a release. The SEC had been due to issue a decision last Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has tried for two years to get approval for its fund, which would effectively allow U.S. retail investors to trade physical copper easily for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. copper fabricators have fought to have the fund blocked, saying it would disrupt supply and inflate prices by removing a large chunk of metal from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, the SEC postponed making a decision on JPM's XF Physical Copper Trust until October 17 and asked the U.S. bank for more details on the potential impact of its plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is due to rule on another fund, the iShares Copper Trust proposed by BlackRock Inc, by December 24, but that can be extended for another 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC declined to comment beyond the statement. JPM did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;END-USER OPPOSITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A consortium of U.S. copper fabricators - SouthWire Co, Encore Wire Corp, Luvata and AmRod - as well as Red Kite, a large hedge fund and physical trader, has opposed the JPMorgan and BlackRock funds in a series of filings and meetings with the SEC since May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say the removal of up to 180,000 metric tons (198416 tons) of copper, which would be used as collateral against shares in the funds, would have a "devastating" effect on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that is only a tiny part of a 20-million-tonne global market, fabricators worry that it accounts for the majority of the metal available in exchange-bonded warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue there is not enough metal available outside the exchange networks for immediate delivery to prevent a squeeze in supply because it is tied up in long-term contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-running dispute has divided traditional industrial consumers, which use copper in everything from air-conditioning units to cars, from banks looking to attract investors seeking exposure to the potentially lucrative copper market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, U.S. Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said the funds would cause a boom-and-bust cycle in the copper market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and BlackRock say such fears are unfounded because the funds would be miniscule compared with the global market. Emphasis on exchange stocks as a measure of spot metal availability has been overdone, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETF would sell investors shares in a fund backed by physical metal as collateral. JPMorgan and BlackRock have said this would make it easier for smaller investors to get exposure to copper prices, which have more than doubled in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's fund would store LME brand-approved copper valued at up to $499,761,150 - equivalent to about 62,000 tonnes based on a copper price of $8,000 per tonne. BlackRock's iShares Copper Trust would use up to 121,200 tonnes of copper as guarantee against shares in its fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by Dale Hudson)&lt;/p&gt;

people briefed on the discussions in its report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we constantly evaluate all our businesses, senior
management never seriously looked at spinning out all or part of
our commodity business," Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Sophie
Bullock said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes as Morgan Stanley, Goldman's
traditional rival in commodity markets on Wall Street, is
weighing a possible sale of a majority stake in its commodities
business to Qatar's sovereign wealth fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks, including Goldman, Morgan Stanley and
JPMorgan, face tougher regulatory restrictions on
proprietary trading under the Volcker rule contained in the
Dodd-Frank Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their ownership of physical commodity assets, like power
plants, oil storage tanks and metals warehouses, are also in
jeopardy after Goldman and Morgan Stanley converted to Bank
Holding Companies at the peak of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank Holding Company Act allows banks to trade in
physical commodity markets, but restricts their ownership of the
underlying assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule limits banks to largely trading on behalf
of their clients.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 23, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- State Treasurer Rob McCord, Philadelphia Eagles wideout Jeremy Maclin and two teams of students from Benjamin Franklin High School went head-to-head today in a high-energy game of Financial Football, a free educational game from Visa Inc. that is designed to improve students' money management skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The partnership between the Pennsylvania Treasury, Visa and the NFL is part of Treasurer McCord's ongoing effort to improve financial literacy among Pennsylvanians because of its correlation to greater personal economic security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"It's important that we help Pennsylvania's young people understand the fundamentals of personal finance, because there is a lot of evidence a student who receives lessons in financial education is more likely to enjoy greater economic security throughout their life," said Treasurer McCord. "This game is a great way to teach those lessons in a way that engages and excites students."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Financial Football simulates an NFL game with financial literacy questions in between downs. It is available for free at practicalmoneyskills.com/football. Visa will distribute the game and curriculum materials to every Pennsylvania middle and high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Just as in football, the more you practice, the better you will perform on the field come game day," Treasurer McCord said. "Financial Football presents students with real-life questions about personal finance. The hope is a student who has played this game will make the right decision for their own finances when confronted with a similar question in their daily life. We appreciate that Visa is helping to put this game in classrooms across the state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Treasurer McCord has made financial literacy a priority for his administration. Most recently, Treasury offered a series of free online webinars targeted at adults to answer many of their most common financial questions. The series, called "MoneyWise 101," featured financial professionals with extensive knowledge on topics such as establishing a budget, planning for retirement, and managing debt, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Treasurer McCord participated in a similar event last week in western Pennsylvania with a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Rafinerija Nafte Brod Selects Technology from Honeywell&#8217;s UOP and 
      ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company to Improve Quality of 
      Refined Lubricants and Fuels
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			First initiative under new licensing alliance between Honeywell&#8217;s UOP 
      and ExxonMobil Research  Engineering Company
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      UOP LLC, a Honeywell (NYSE: HON) company, and ExxonMobil Research 
      and Engineering Company (EMRE) announced today that Rafinerija Nafte 
      Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina&#8217;s sole oil refinery, has selected UOP and 
      EMRE technology to improve the quality of refined lubricants and fuels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The licensing agreement is the first under a joint licensing alliance 
      formed by Honeywell UOP and EMRE last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new technology will allow Rafinerija Nafte Brod to improve its 
      product quality and environmental performance. The refiner will combine 
      Honeywell UOP Unicracking&#8482; hydroprocessing solutions with EMRE&#8217;s 
      distillate and lubricant de-waxing technologies to produce ultra-clean 
      jet and diesel fuels and high-quality lubricant base stocks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pete Piotrowski, vice president and general manager of Process 
      Technology and Equipment for Honeywell&#8217;s UOP said, &#8220;The new Unicracking 
      complex will help the refinery increase their fuel and lube yields 
      through an integrated and cost-effective approach.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The EMRE technology platform provides a one-stop solution for 
      Rafinerija Nafte Brod&#8217;s hydroprocessing and fuel de-waxing needs,&#8221; said 
      Vince Alberico, manager of Technology, Sales and Licensing for EMRE.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Unicracking complex will include Honeywell&#8217;s UOP two-stage 
      Unicracking process integrated with EMRE&#8217;s MSDW&#8482; process for selective 
      dewaxing lubricant feedstocks and EMRE&#8217;s MIDW&#8482; processes for dewaxing 
      diesel feedstocks. The complex will upgrade more than 45,000 barrels per 
      stream day of kerosene, diesel and vacuum gas oil feedstock into 
      high-quality diesel and jet fuels. It will also produce high-quality 
      base oils that will be used for the production of Group II and Group III 
      lubricants at Refineria Ulia Modricha, which is part of the oil refining 
      production chain in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The new complex is scheduled 
      to start operations in 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Honeywell&#8217;s UOP Unicracking technology provides flexibility to upgrade a 
      variety of feedstocks to high-quality, lighter transportation fuel 
      products. It can also be used to produce low-sulfur naphthas for 
      reforming into gasoline, or to upgrade FCC products for additional 
      distillate production or sulfur removal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EMRE&#8217;s MSDW and MIDW processes are advanced proprietary technologies to 
      optimize production of lubricants and distillate fuels. The MSDW process 
      is designed to overcome high-sulfur environments and provides the 
      highest yields and viscosity available in the industry. MIDW is a 
      selective catalytic dewaxing process that can improve yields of 
      high-quality diesel with excellent cold flow properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Honeywell&#8217;s UOP has been developing and licensing hydroprocessing 
      solutions, including advanced catalysts and specialty equipment, for 
      nearly 100 years. As a major research and engineering organization, EMRE 
      develops a broad spectrum of refining technologies to safely and 
      reliably respond to an array of process challenges.

			Perficient Wins Integration Excellence Award at IBM&#8217;s IOD 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IBM recognizes Perficient for its innovative work with Premier 
      healthcare alliance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Perficient, 
      Inc. (NASDAQ: PRFT), a leading information technology consulting 
      firm serving Global 2000 and other large enterprise customers throughout 
      North America, today announced it received IBM&#8217;s 2012 Information 
      Management Integration Excellence Award. Perficient was recognized for 
      its work with Premier 
      healthcare alliance and IBM 
      in developing and delivering PremierConnect, a technology platform that 
      houses the largest virtual healthcare community in the country. The 
      award was announced during the Business Partner Information Management 
      keynote session of IBM&#8217;s 
      Information On Demand 2012 conference, which is being held Oct. 21 &#8211; 
      25 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Best practices show that healthcare organizations that partner under a 
      collaborative model across geographies and include physicians and 
      patients in the design of care models are more successful,&#8221; said John 
      Jenkins, vice president of Perficient&#8217;s IBM Business Group. &#8220;In 
      partnering with Premier and IBM, our goal was to create a new data model 
      and accountable care solution that gives healthcare providers the 
      ability to be more responsive and provide innovative products that 
      enable members to improve and transform their healthcare delivery 
      systems. Perficient is honored that IBM has recognized us with the 
      prestigious IBM Integration Excellence Award for our work in developing 
      PremierConnect.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Premier 
      healthcare alliance, a provider-owned performance improvement 
      alliance of more than 2,700 U.S. hospitals and 90,000-plus other 
      healthcare sites, maintains the nation&#8217;s largest clinical, financial and 
      outcomes database. It contains information on one in every four patient 
      discharges, 2.5 million real-time clinical transactions a day and close 
      to $43 billion in annual purchasing data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With increasing pressure on healthcare organizations to assume risk for 
      populations of patients, sophisticated data analytics that leverage the 
      full spectrum of healthcare data &#8211; from hospital to physician office to 
      home health &#8211; is no longer optional. Launched in June 2012, PremierConnect 
      is a technology platform that houses the largest virtual healthcare 
      community in the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s healthcare providers are forced to rethink the standard 
      healthcare delivery model if they want to decrease sky rocketing 
      healthcare costs and improve the quality of patient care,&#8221; said Denise 
      Hatzidakis, Premier&#8217;s chief technology officer. &#8220;Through our work with 
      Perficient and IBM, we have built a solution that enables healthcare 
      providers to allow their customers and contributors to have a single, 
      portal interface that promotes collaboration and connections with fellow 
      doctors, nurses and administrators.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PremierConnect allows alliance members to collaborate with each other in 
      communities of common interest where they share learnings, data and 
      strategies based on thousands of patient outcomes and documented best 
      practices. It delivers the right analytics at the right time in the 
      context of the provider&#8217;s job, and creates an environment where 
      providers can collaborate to solve issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Perficient&#8217;s team was instrumental in the development and deployment of 
      PremierConnect,&#8221; continued Hatzidakis. &#8220;Their consultants provided 
      significant expertise in helping design, build and deliver our platform 
      that allows providers to receive the information that is most important 
      to them at a time when they need to act fast.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At previous IOD events, Perficient has been honored with awards 
      including the 2011 Business Analytics Solution Provider Achievement 
      Award, the 2011 Information Management Solution Excellence Award, and 
      the Warehouse Pack Partner of the Year, Information Agenda Partner of 
      the Year, Best of Show 2010 for Retail Analytics awards and multiple

    The consistent delivery of accurate analyses relies solely on two
factors, namely: market awareness and industry insight. Recent market
drivers include the spark of U.S. housing starts soaring past
expectations to a four-year high in September, industrial production
rising 0.4% in September 2012 beating expectations for a 0.2% increase
and the recent upward surprise in initial jobless claims bouncing upward
to 388,000 above expectations of 365,000 in the latest week. When it
comes to discovering the right edge at the right time, all these factors
play into effect. For a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind
these events and how it can affect your portfolio, please refer to our

    The consistent delivery of accurate analyses relies solely on two
factors, namely: market awareness and industry insight. Recent market
drivers include the spark of U.S. housing starts soaring past
expectations to a four-year high in September, industrial production
rising 0.4% in September 2012 beating expectations for a 0.2% increase
and the recent upward surprise in initial jobless claims bouncing upward
to 388,000 above expectations of 365,000 in the latest week. When it
comes to discovering the right edge at the right time, all these factors
play into effect. For a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind

			U.S. Bank to Offer V.me by Visa Making It 
      Easier for Customers to Pay for Online Purchases With Their Visa Debit 
      or Credit Cards
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. Bank is giving its customers access to Visa&#8217;s new digital wallet 
      service, V.me by Visa, making online purchases simple and secure because 
      customers do not need to repeatedly enter account number, bill-to and 
      ship-to information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. Bank customers will be able to enroll their existing Visa and other 
      payment card accounts, allowing them to pay online by simply entering a 
      user name and password at checkout, whether transacting on a PC or 
      mobile device. As V.me acceptance continues to gain momentum at a 
      growing number of eCommerce merchants, Visa will work closely with U.S. 
      Bank to broadly deliver the service to its customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;V.me presents a new service for our customers that addresses the 
      growing consumer desire to shop online from any device with ease and 
      simplicity,&#8221; said Clifford Cook, chief marketing officer for U.S. Bank 
      Retail Payment Solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      V.me presents an opportunity for issuing banks to strengthen account 
      holder relationships by offering them a new service that allows 
      consumers to shop online &#8211; from any web-enabled device simply and 
      securely. Through U.S. Bank branding and backed by Visa, account holders 
      can shop with comfort knowing they are protected by layers of security 
      within Visa&#8217;s industry-leading network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa is committed to delivering a new dimension of convenience and 
      security, one where consumers are no longer required to share personal 
      account and billing and shipping information at checkout,&#8221; said Jennifer 
      Schulz (@Jen_Schulz), global head of eCommerce, Visa Inc. &#8220;Visa and U.S. 
      Bank have a close relationship dating back many years, making U.S. Bank 
      a critical part of our go-to-market strategy for V.me, and giving their 
      customers a distinct eCommerce advantage this holiday season.&#8221;

			Better ATM Services Launching ATM-Dispensed Visa Prepaid Cards 
      Nationwide
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Durable, Thin Prepaid Cards Are On the Front Line of Prepaid 
      Innovation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Better ATM&#174; Services (www.betteratmservices.com), 
      a technology innovator in the ATM industry, today announced they will 
      expand the ATM-dispensed Visa prepaid card program throughout the U.S. 
      The decision to grow the program followed the enthusiastic response from 
      consumers and financial institutions during an in-market pilot program 
      conducted through financial institutions in Arizona.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Better ATM&#174; Services enabled ATMs at participating 
      pilot financial institutions to use on-screen options and minor hardware 
      adjustments to allow customers to purchase Visa prepaid cards directly 
      from the ATM. Menus allow consumers to select between cash or Visa 
      prepaid cards. While the pilot program allowed the selection of fixed 
      value cards, menu options now allow account holders to designate the 
      value to load on each card they purchase. ATM-dispensed Visa prepaid 
      cards are made of a durable yet thin material, allowing cards to easily 
      pass through the cash mechanisms of ATMs. These cards meet Visa&#8217;s 
      rigorous standards for reliable, secure acceptance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Better ATM&#174; Services CEO Todd L. Nuttall said, &#8220;ATM 
      networks are secure distribution channels that are already in place in 
      high traffic areas throughout the U.S. and are ideal for new features 
      and services such as Visa prepaid cards. This joint market pilot has 
      demonstrated that they are the perfect vehicle to deliver value-driven 
      products that meet consumer needs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The prepaid market is estimated to be $549.7 billion in 2012. According 
      to Mercator Advisory Group, by 2013, consumers will load $117 billion 
      onto prepaid cards, which would mark a 200 percent usage increase in 
      just three years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;ATM-dispensed Visa prepaid cards are another example of prepaid serving 
      as a platform for innovation,&#8221; said Hyung Choi, head of US prepaid, Visa 
      Inc. &#8220;By supporting this new distribution channel, Visa is providing 
      consumers with convenient prepaid card access via a familiar, well 
      established and secure interface.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Visa prepaid cards will be issued by Visa member financial 
      institutions under license from Visa U.S.A. Inc.

      2012 and .NET Community

			TestComplete 9.1 Introduces &#8216;Continuous Testing and Integration&#8217; to 
      Automated Windows and Web Applications Testing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SmartBear 
      Software today announced expanded test automation support for 
      Microsoft platforms including Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, Windows 8 
      and Internet Explorer 10. By equipping development teams with tools that 
      are easy to try, buy and use such as TestComplete 
      9.1, SmartBear is removing the barriers associated with adoption of 
      test automation. TestComplete integration with Visual Studio 2012 
      creates an environment for development and continuous testing of Web and 
      desktop applications such as WPF, ASP.NET and HTML5 technologies so that 
      companies can deliver quality software in record time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Advanced object recognition technology in TestComplete allows .NET 
      developers to record, edit and run tests without having to learn new 
      programming paradigms. TestComplete provides support for VBScript, 
      JScript, C++Script and C#Script, featuring an advanced script editor 
      familiar to the Visual Studio users. With TestComplete 9.1, the .NET 
      community practitioners can integrate TestComplete projects into Team 
      Foundation Server 2012 and launch tests from within Visual Studio 2012 
      test projects. In addition, Web and desktop testers can create work 
      items and post bug reports to the Team Foundation Server 2012 database 
      directly from the TestComplete IDE.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to welcome SmartBear to the Visual Studio Industry 
      Partner (VSIP) program and have SmartBear&#8217;s tools support the latest 
      Microsoft platforms and developer products,&#8221; said Tom Lindeman, Director 
      of the VSIP 
      program at Microsoft. &#8220;SmartBear&#8217;s expertise in test automation and 
      its robust, sophisticated solutions help streamline the creation of new 
      Windows and web applications, providing development teams using Visual 
      Studio 2012 a great complementary tool.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Modern web applications must function on multiple browsers and operating 
      systems as well as devices such as tablets and smartphones. Teams 
      developing these applications need modern testing tools to support them. 
      SmartBear delivers robust and affordable testing tools with advanced 
      capabilities such as HTML5 
      support, cross-browser test automation as well as distributed 
      testing in virtual labs and virtual test environments. By ensuring tight 
      integration with the .NET platform, SmartBear is bringing testing and 
      development activities closer together so that teams are more productive 
      and reduce waste.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We get great satisfaction from delivering software quality tools for 
      development teams who are on the cutting edge of technology,&#8221; said 
      Sergei Sokolov, Product Director for testing tools at SmartBear. &#8220;Our 
      goal is to provide tools that are easy to acquire and to use, are

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' reputation for hard-nosed efficiency faces a test in the chaos of Indian building standards, according to architects hired by the Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction is due to start soon on a Bangalore campus for some 4,000 back-office Goldman Sachs staff, but a report by Toronto-based architect Adamson Associates seen by Reuters said the project faces a string of obstacles including shoddy construction, corruption, poor sanitation and an on-site tomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"India's industry standards of construction quality for commercial office space have not yet reached international standards, much less GS standards," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It recommended developers "provide extra margins of tolerance (i.e. a 'sloppy fit')" and "not design anything that requires total precision" for the 22-acre site, which is close to a busy stretch of Bangalore's six-lane outer ring road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Adamson Associates declined to comment. The bank's reaction to Adamson's recommendations is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report gives a rare behind-the-scenes insight into the way multinational companies in India view local standards and some locals have reacted angrily to the suggestion Goldman will have to lower its expectations so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a wrong notion. A wrong perception is being created. I would like to really confront a person who thinks like this," said Lalit Kumar Jain, national president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a prejudiced mind without really understanding the reality on the ground of this country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reaction to the architect's report will generate further publicity for the intensely scrutinised bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a bit of a cheap shot for a foreign architect to throw stones at Indian construction standards," said one international developer operating in India who did not want to be named for fear of drawing criticism. "The standards are not the same but then neither is the cost. And that is why Goldman Sachs is putting a million square feet in India."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction costs in India are about 75 to 80 percent lower than in London, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ramesh Mysore, a Bangalore-based director of corporate real estate at outsourcing company Convergys, which entered India more than a decade ago and has more than 10,000 staff in the country, said the report only stated the obvious. Red tape and inexperienced developers are a big hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenge in India is there is still ambiguity in people giving a commitment and achieving it. In other countries, there is more promptness and respect," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BIG BANG"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the financial crisis forces Western banks to rein in costs, they have increasingly turned to emerging economies to set up operations with lower wages and rents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies can save between 40 and 70 percent in places such as India, Asia's third-largest economy, according to a report this year by U.S. business consultant Everest Group and NASSCOM, an Indian industry body for technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month Goldman Sachs announced a third-quarter profit of $1.5 billion versus a $428 million loss in 2011 against the backdrop of a $1.9 billion cost cutting programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its Bangalore project - codenamed "Big Bang" inside the bank - will move workers from four offices elsewhere in Bangalore into a single campus about 15 km (9 miles) south-east of the city centre by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents, more than 2,000 pages in all, underline the huge scale of Goldman's plans in the country. The Bangalore operation accounts for about 12 percent of the bank's global staff but that could more than quadruple to 18,000, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campus, which measures 900,000 square feet, comprises two buildings. Floor space will double if Goldman exercises development options. That would give it a site not much smaller than its 2.2 million-square-foot HQ in New York, a skyscraper on which Adamson was the executive architect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman will pay an annual rent of about 565 rupees per square foot, local real estate agents said. That compares to a typical figure of 55 pounds in London's financial district or about $90 in the midtown Manhattan area of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, HSBC, JPMorgan and RBS also have functions like risk and fraud management, finance and accounting in self-contained Bangalore sites known in India as "captive centres".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEWAGE AND STRAY DOGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, building in India is not always straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a Reuters reporter visited the area where the Goldman Sachs campus will be located earlier this month, he saw a site fenced off with corrugated metal sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of steel reinforcement rods was the only evidence of planned construction work at the site, which, based on maps contained in the Adamson report, appeared to be the future home of the Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stray dogs wandered through pot-holed streets and dirt and rubbish were piled up in the surrounding areas, at odds with the glass-fronted modern office blocks which house firms including JP Morgan, Nokia and Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large sewage canal ran nearby, where a breeze blew foam into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architect report notes the canal and warns of the possibility of foul odours, depending on "time of year (and) wind direction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adamson underlined how closely Goldman Sachs should monitor the build, recommending "extensive use of mock-ups" that require approval before the final phases of building work proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keep the design simple, straightforward and easily understandable. Complex shapes will not likely be well-constructed," it said, while emphasising the building had to be the best quality office block in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delays and shoddy construction at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, India's capital, exposed the dearth of skilled labour, building technology and expertise in the country. But things have improved since then, say people in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What happened at the Commonwealth Games was not good but the important thing to note is not everything happens like that," said Convergys Corporation's Mysore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you get attracted to a developer because the building looks great, is cheap and comes with some goodies, you are being misguided. You need to exercise caution," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic boom of recent years has helped to improve construction standards, local developers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of our buildings are better than some American ones," said J. C. Sharma, chairman of Bangalore-based Sobha Developers, which has built more than 24 million square feet of space for technology company Infosys. "Foreign architects should come and see the buildings here to realise India is also improving, although more slowly than China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, Goldman will still have to overcome the lack of a municipal sewer system and an unreliable water supply network. The report recommends the Bangalore campus treat waste on-site and install waterless urinals, even though it acknowledges associated "odours and cleanliness issues".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further hurdles include what the architect refers to as a tomb on the site that Goldman will have to take into account when positioning the perimeter wall. The Reuters reporter saw a gravestone marked with the dates '1913-1981' near the perimeter fence of the site presumed to be the future Goldman campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will also struggle to fit lifts in its building that are up to its usual standards, Adamson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Indian market does not seem to value elevators as an aesthetic element," it said. "An aggressive full coverage preventative maintenance programme" was the only way to ensure they didn't break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman faces considerable "reputational risks" associated with the project, given India's reputation for corruption, use of child labour and the often basic conditions in construction worker camps, the report warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international developer working in India said the bank would have to minimise risks and increase security. "There are so many people waiting for Goldman to make a mistake."

			Research and Markets: 2012 Report on the $1 Trillion US Technology 
      Sector Featuring Major Companies such as ATT, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ws34bx/technology_sector) 
      has announced the addition of the "Technology 
      Sector" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The technology sector in the US includes about 145,000 companies with 
      combined annual revenue of more than $1 trillion. Major companies 
      include AT T, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft. Industry concentration is high 
      in many segments: the largest 50 participants often generate more than 
      50 percent of segment revenue. The technology sector includes 
      telecommunications, IT services, semiconductor manufacturing, software, 
      Internet services, biotechnology, and scientific research, including 
      aerospace research.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global technology exports total nearly $1.6 trillion annually, according 
      to the World Bank. Leading exporters include China ($300 billion), 
      Germany ($140 billion), the US ($130 billion), Singapore ($95 billion), 
      and Japan ($95 billion). Leading technology companies based outside the 
      US include Japanese telecom firm Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
      Corporation, South Korean semiconductor manufacturer Samsung Group, and 
      German process-control instrument maker Siemens.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Competitive Landscape:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand often depends on the income of consumers or the profitability of 
      business customers, because many technology products and services are 
      expensive. The profitability of individual companies is driven by their 
      ability to develop and market new products. Large companies often have 
      advantages in access to capital and marketing. Small companies can 
      compete successfully if they have expertise in a particular field of 
      knowledge. The industry is capital-intensive: average annual revenue per 
      worker is about $340,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Products, Operations  Technology:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Companies in the technology sector take advantage of scientific 
      discoveries and turn them into marketable products.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/MUMBAI Oct 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' reputation
for hard-nosed efficiency faces a test in the chaos of Indian
building standards, according to architects hired by the Wall
Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction is due to start soon on a Bangalore campus for
some 4,000 back-office Goldman Sachs staff, but a report
by Toronto-based architect Adamson Associates seen by Reuters
said the project faces a string of obstacles including shoddy
construction, corruption, poor sanitation and an on-site tomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"India's industry standards of construction quality for
commercial office space have not yet reached international
standards, much less GS standards," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It recommended developers "provide extra margins of
tolerance (ie a 'sloppy fit')" and "not design anything that
requires total precision" for the 22-acre site, which is close
to a busy stretch of Bangalore's six-lane outer ring road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Adamson Associates declined to comment.
The bank's reaction to Adamson's recommendations is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report gives a rare behind-the-scenes insight into the
way multinational companies in India view local standards and
some locals have reacted angrily to the suggestion Goldman will
have to lower its expectations so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a wrong notion. A wrong perception is being
created. I would like to really confront a person who thinks
like this," said Lalit Kumar Jain, national president of the
Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a prejudiced mind without really understanding the
reality on the ground of this country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reaction to the architect's report will generate further
publicity for the intensely scrutinised bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a bit of a cheap shot for a foreign architect to throw
stones at Indian construction standards," said one international
developer operating in India who did not want to be named for
fear of drawing criticism. "The standards are not the same but
then neither is the cost. And that is why Goldman Sachs is
putting a million square feet in India."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction costs in India are about 75 to 80 percent lower
than in London, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ramesh Mysore, a Bangalore-based director of corporate
real estate at outsourcing company Convergys, which entered
India more than a decade ago and has more than 10,000 staff in
the country, said the report only stated the obvious. Red tape
and inexperienced developers are a big hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenge in India is there is still ambiguity in
people giving a commitment and achieving it. In other countries,
there is more promptness and respect," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BIG BANG"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the financial crisis forces Western banks to rein in
costs, they have increasingly turned to emerging economies to
set up operations with lower wages and rents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies can save between 40 and 70 percent in places such
as India, Asia's third-largest economy, according to a report
this year by U.S. business consultant Everest Group and NASSCOM,
an Indian industry body for technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month Goldman Sachs announced a third-quarter
profit of $1.5 billion versus a $428 million loss in 2011
against the backdrop of a $1.9 billion cost cutting programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its Bangalore project - codenamed "Big Bang" inside the bank
- will move workers from four offices elsewhere in Bangalore
into a single campus about 15 km (9 miles) south-east of the
city centre by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents, more than 2,000 pages in all, underline the
huge scale of Goldman's plans in the country. The Bangalore
operation accounts for about 12 percent of the bank's global
staff but that could more than quadruple to 18,000, the report
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campus, which measures 900,000 square feet, comprises
two buildings. Floor space will double if Goldman exercises
development options. That would give it a site not much smaller
than its 2.2 million-square-foot HQ in New York, a skyscraper on
which Adamson was the executive architect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman will pay an annual rent of about 565 rupees ($11) 
p er square foot, local real estate agents said. That compares to
a typical figure of 55 pounds ($89) in London's financial
district or about $90 in the midtown Manhattan area of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
Barclays, HSBC, JPMorgan and RBS
 also have functions like risk and fraud management,
finance and accounting in self-contained Bangalore sites known
in India as "captive centres".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEWAGE AND STRAY DOGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, building in India is not always straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a Reuters reporter visited the area where the Goldman
Sachs campus w ill be located earlier this month, he saw a site
fenced off with corrugated metal sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of steel reinforcement rods was the only
evidence of planned construction work at the site, which, based
on maps contained in the Adamson report, appeared to be the
future home of the Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stray dogs wandered through pot-holed streets and dirt and
rubbish were piled up in the surrounding areas, at odds with the
glass-fronted modern office blocks which house firms including
JP Morgan, Nokia and Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large sewage canal ran nearby, where a breeze blew foam
into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architect report notes the canal and warns of the
possibility of foul odours, depending on "time of year (and)
wind direction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adamson underlined how closely Goldman Sachs should monitor
the build, recommending "extensive use of mock-ups" that require
approval before the final phases of building work proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keep the design simple, straightforward and easily
understandable. Complex shapes will not likely be
well-constructed," it said, while emphasising the building had
to be the best quality office block in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delays and shoddy construction at the 2010 Commonwealth
Games in New Delhi, India's capital, exposed the dearth of
skilled labour, building technology and expertise in the
country. But things have improved since then, say people in the
industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What happened at the Commonwealth Games was not good but
the important thing to note is not everything happens like
that," said Convergys Corporation's Mysore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you get attracted to a developer because the building
looks great, is cheap and comes with some goodies, you are being
misguided. You need to exercise caution," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic boom of recent years has helped to improve
construction standards, local developers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of our buildings are better than some American ones,"
said J. C. Sharma, chairman of Bangalore-based Sobha Developers
, which has built more than 24 million square feet of
space for technology company Infosys. "Foreign
architects should come and see the buildings here to realise
India is also improving, although more slowly than China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, Goldman will still have to overcome the lack of a
municipal sewer system and an unreliable water supply network.
The report recommends the Bangalore campus treat waste on-site
and install waterless urinals, even though it acknowledges
associated "odours and cleanliness issues".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further hurdles include what the architect refers to as a
tomb on the site that Goldman will have to take into account
when positioning the perimeter wall. The Reuters reporter saw a
gravestone marked with the dates '1913-1981' near the perimeter
fence of the site presumed to be the future Goldman campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will also struggle to fit lifts in its building
that are up to its usual standards, Adamson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Indian market does not seem to value elevators as an
aesthetic element," it said. "An aggressive full coverage
preventative maintenance programme" was the only way to ensure
they didn't break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman faces considerable "reputational risks" associated
with the project, given India's reputation for corruption, use
of child labour and the often basic conditions in construction
worker camps, the report warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international developer working in India said the bank
would have to minimise risks and increase security. "There are
so many people waiting for Goldman to make a mistake."&lt;/p&gt;

			Visa Study Reveals Mobile Money Drives Demand for Financial Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Multi-country study reveals sophisticated payment needs and 
      behaviors of unbanked consumers in developing economies. Preventing 
      theft, ability to send money quickly drives mobile money adoption.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Fundamo, the Visa-owned mobile money platform, 
      today announced the results of a study that reveals consumers in six 
      developing countries are already highly aware of mobile money services &#8211; 
      the ability to make payments or send funds simply by accessing an 
      account on their mobile phone. Nearly 90 percent of consumers surveyed 
      by Visa expressed interest in making use of these services in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Visa Mobile Money study analyzed the financial services needs and 
      expectations of mobile money among nearly 2,500 consumers, mobile money 
      agents, and merchants in Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Nigeria 
      and Pakistan. The results reveal that consumers&#8217; needs for financial 
      services are far more sophisticated than previously believed and go well 
      beyond the established transaction set offered by mobile money services 
      today. The study also found that security concerns associated with 
      carrying cash and the need to quickly send money to family members 
      living far away are among the key drivers for mobile money adoption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Thanks to the mobile money community, millions of previously unbanked 
      people are now able to make basic electronic transactions such as 
      person-to-person and bill payments. Our potential for driving far 
      reaching social and economic change, while at the same time growing 
      transaction volumes in developing countries, is significant. But we&#8217;ll 
      limit that potential if we don&#8217;t learn to stop and really listen to our 
      customers,&#8221; said Hannes van Rensburg, CEO of Fundamo and Group Country 
      Manager, sub-Saharan Africa, Visa Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Visa study suggests that the success of mobile financial services is 
      determined by how deeply a mobile money provider understands its 
      customers and tailors the service to the needs of consumers and mobile 
      money agents &#8211; from service menus, to marketing and education. The study 
      also uncovered key barriers to adoption and identified best practices 
      for mobile money providers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key Findings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Awareness of mobile money is high
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Visa study found there is high awareness of mobile money services 
      and capabilities among consumers in developing economies. Across the six 
      countries surveyed, average awareness stood at 56% and three countries 
      stood out in particular: In Ghana, awareness was at 93% with MTN 
      identified as the most known mobile money provider; in Pakistan 89% of 
      the public are mobile money aware and easyPaisa is the most recognized 
      brand; and 53% of consumers in Bangladesh were aware of mobile money and 
      identified bKash as the leading brand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumers have complex, sophisticated financial services needs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While many survey participants did not have a formal financial account, 
      several examples of complex and sophisticated money management systems 
      emerged across the six markets. Using a range of techniques, the 
      majority of respondents shared how they set money aside for education, 
      healthcare, emergencies and life events. The majority of consumers 
      surveyed intend to use mobile money to send money to family members 
      (81%), pay utility bills (56%) and save money for their family (52%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Preventing theft, ability to quickly send money drives adoption
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The primary driver and reason to adopt mobile financial services, 
      according to the study, is not to establish formal savings, but rather 
      the need to protect funds from theft and the ability to more easily send 
      funds, pay bills, school fees, etc. Across the six countries, 80% of 
      respondents cited &#8220;safety of not having to carry around a lot of cash&#8221; 
      as the primary perceived benefit of mobile money, while 63% of 
      respondents listed &#8220;speed of getting money to family members living far 
      away&#8221; as the second most important benefit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ease of use, trust and lack of interoperability are barriers to 
      adoption
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Across the countries where surveys took place, respondents cited ease of 
      use (64%), lack of trust in mobile money providers and agents (55%), and 
      lack of interoperability with other mobile money services (28%), as 
      primary barriers to adoption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, lack of accessibility to mobile money agents, mobile 
      network reliability, communication and education appear to be major 
      barriers, preventing activation and usage of mobile money accounts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Best Practices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Listen to Your Customers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The results of Visa&#8217;s study suggest that fine tuning how a mobile money 
      operator markets its service can have an impact on consumers&#8217; desire to 
      adopt such a service. For example, the study found that &#8220;safe keeping&#8221; 
      rather than &#8220;saving&#8221; money is a primary driver for why consumers in 
      developing countries are interested in using mobile money services. This 
      suggests that mobile money providers should invest in additional 
      research to better understand their customers&#8217; needs, tailor 
      information, education and marketing efforts to the needs of consumers 
      and mobile money agents, and adopt local terminology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;One key learning from this study could be summarized as &#8216;it&#8217;s not what 
      you say, it&#8217;s how you say it,&#8217;&#8221; said Gavin Krugel, Head of Emerging 
      Market Customer Strategy and Market Activation, Visa Inc. &#8220;This single 
      insight has massive implications for the vernacular used in mobile money 
      menu structures, the education of mobile money agents and consumers, and 
      creation of mass market advertising.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ensure mobile money services are easy to use and offer a 
      transparent fee structure
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ease of use was listed as the biggest barrier to adoption by survey 
      respondents (64%). Consumers, merchants, and agents alike also cited the 
      importance of offering a clear pricing structure as a key need of a 
      mobile money program. Individuals are price sensitive and evaluate 
      alternative options meticulously. For example, the cost of calls was the 
      primary reason for choosing a mobile network operator in five of the six 
      markets surveyed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Build an extensive mobile money agent network
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Not having prevalent accessibility to mobile money agents is ranked as a 
      key barrier to the adoption of mobile money. In order to drive adoption, 
      cash and customer service will need to be readily accessible to meet 
      expectations. 54% of consumers cited quick and easy access to cash as a 
      key benefit of mobile money.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Visa Mobile Money study was conducted February through August 2012. 
      Visa surveyed nearly 2,500 individuals in six countries and 15 cities 
      through a combination of field surveys, in-depth in-person interviews, 
      and focus groups with men and women ages 18 to 44 years of age. 
      Respondents had to own a mobile phone. The study included both in-depth 
      qualitative and quantitative research on money management needs, habits 
      and practices as well as factors that need to be addressed for the 
      successful adoption of mobile money services. Particular focus was 
      placed on understanding the needs of unbanked consumers as well as the 
      needs of merchants and agents who will be offering mobile money in both 
      urban and rural areas within these markets.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co (PG.N) Chief Executive Bob McDonald's efforts to fend off activist investor William Ackman are not likely to be helped by the company's quarterly results this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors is expected to post its third consecutive decline in revenue and earnings per share when it issues fiscal first-quarter results on October 25. Analysts trimmed their targets when P gave a forecast in August that was below Wall Street's view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will also be watching for a forecast for the current fiscal second quarter and, less likely, any changes to the full-year forecast for signs that McDonald's plans for turning the company around are starting to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If he comes in weak would anybody be surprised that the Bill Ackmans of the world have more power?" said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl &amp; Gaynor, which manages $7.3 billion, including 4.89 million P shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P disappointed investors by cutting its fiscal guidance multiple times during fiscal 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said that McDonald, who has run P since July 2009, may be running out of time to show that his strategy is working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is P's 10th-largest shareholder, has publicly blamed P's top brass for high costs and declining revenue while saying that he understands the board wants to give McDonald time to repair years of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ackman met with board members in early September at a meeting in New York, where he laid out his complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I attribute a lot of those problems to senior management," Ackman said on October 1, adding that it will pay off to wait for "this CEO or the next CEO" to shape up the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P, which McDonald has admitted lost its footing as its stream of innovation slowed down, is now focused on its 40 biggest businesses, 20 biggest new products and 10 key developing markets. A $10 billion restructuring has led to thousands of job cuts, some even earlier than planned, though some analysts believe P could reduce costs even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But given the recent history of having to lower its forecasts, setting an overly optimistic one now could just set a trap for later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to set something low so they can hopefully beat it or at least not miss it," said Caris &amp; Co analyst Linda Bolton Weiser. "They can't miss guidance, they can't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"PLEASE BUY MORE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ackman could press harder for change at the top, investors at P's October 9 annual meeting largely backed the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm really proud of you, Mr. McDonald," investor James Sakelos said during the meeting, held blocks away from P's headquarters in Cincinnati. "You are doing an excellent job and we do have to be patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald, in an unscripted moment during the highly orchestrated event, even got a joke in about P's share price, which rose after Ackman bought in during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a little stock in P, which I'm thankful (for)," Sakelos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please buy more," McDonald replied, getting laughs from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a degree of conviction there that is something that you normally don't see from Procter people," said Bahl &amp; Gaynor's McCormick, who attended the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bottom line is a lot of investors are going to be intensely interested in these upcoming results," he said. "If they are to the upside and exceed expectations people are going to give McDonald the benefit of the doubt for at least another quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as P's 10th-largest shareholder, Ackman's stake is small. Pershing Square holds 21.92 million shares, or 0.79 percent of the company's outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expect P to post sales of $20.77 billion and earnings of 96 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter that ended in September, down from sales of $21.92 billion and earnings of $1.03 per share a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In August, P forecast a profit of 91 cents to 97 cents per share, while analysts at that time had expected a profit of $1.03 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of P have risen since Ackman's stake was disclosed in July but have trailed the gains in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which they are a component, so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Disgraced Wall Street titan and philanthropist Rajat Gupta was sentenced to two years in prison on Wednesday, a much lighter sentence than U.S. prosecutors had demanded, by a judge who called his insider trading crimes "disgusting" and "a terrible breach of trust."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta was also ordered to pay a $5 million fine. He was convicted in Manhattan federal court last June for leaking Goldman Sachs boardroom secrets to Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund manager at the center of a U.S. government crackdown on insider trading over the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some legal experts said Wednesday's sentence came as a surprise, while others said the judge struck a fine balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff told a somber courtroom audience, including Gupta's wife and four adult daughters, that the illegal sharing of corporate secrets at the height of the 2008 financial crisis "was the functional equivalent of stabbing Goldman in the back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 63, gave no visible reaction to the sentence, which was given at the end of a 30-minute statement in which the judge spelled out the businessman's "extraordinary" philanthropy over decades that stood in stark contrast to his crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates, Microsoft Corp's co-founder, and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan were among 400 friends and luminaries who had written letters to the judge urging leniency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, the court heard how Gupta had tipped off his then friend and business associate Rajaratnam between September and October of 2008. Within minutes of a conference call of members of Goldman's board on September 23, 2008, Gupta told Rajaratnam that influential investor Warren Buffett was infusing $5 billion into the investment bank. Rajaratnam traded on the information as the market was closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rakoff said during the two-and-a-half hour sentencing proceedings that the tip "was not only overwhelming, but it was disgusting in its implications ... a terrible breach of trust" at a time when Goldman Sachs was in turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the judge also said: "I have never encountered a defendant whose past history suggests such an extraordinary devotion ... to people in need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years for securities fraud and five years for conspiracy. Federal judges have wide leeway in sentencing and Rakoff has a reputation for veering from guidelines for courts in handing down punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MINIMUM SECURITY PRISON SOUGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rakoff ordered Gupta to begin his sentence on January 8, 2013. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons will decide where, but his lawyer asked for the minimum security prison in Otisville, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge denied Gupta's lawyer's bid to have him freed on bail pending an appeal, which could last as long as two years. His lawyer, Gary Naftalis, said in a statement that "we believe the facts of this case demonstrate that Mr. Gupta is innocent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Goldman director is the most influential corporate figure to be convicted in the wide U.S. probe of insider trading involving fund managers, traders, consultants and executives. He is a former global head of the McKinsey &amp; Co management consultancy, and once sat on the boards of Procter &amp; Gamble Co and American Airlines, as well advising philanthropies including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta was born poor in India and orphaned as a teenager but rose to the top of the corporate and philanthropic elite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His sentence was less than the eight to 10 years sought by prosecutors, but more than the probation and community service in Rwanda sought by Gupta's lawyers. The judge dismissed that proposal as "a kind of Peace Corps for insider traders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also less than some other insider trading defendants who were jailed for between four and 10 years. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence, one of the longest for insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, a U.S. appeals court in New York is set to hear Rajaratnam's appeal. He argues prosecutors should not have been able to play phone taps of his conversations at his trial because he says they were improperly obtained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SANCTITY OF CORPORATE CONFIDENCE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Tarlowe argued for a sentence of at least eight years, telling the court "Mr Gupta knew as much about the sanctity of these types of corporate confidences as anybody, and that's what makes it so shocking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York securities class action and shareholder rights lawyer Mark Rifkin said the judge "understood both sides of the argument, and the relatively light sentence he imposed balances Gupta's misuse of his position against a lifetime of good work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Andrew Stoltmann, an attorney and investor rights advocate based in Chicago, wondered whether Gupta's "Mother Teresa-like halo" had warranted a sentence that was "little more than a slap on the wrist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had such an important role at some of these companies that it is kind of the ultimate betrayal of trust," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Gupta addressed the court, he read from a statement for six minutes, using bland language that stopped short of fully admitting his conduct, but apologizing to "extraordinary institutions and outstanding people" and to his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel terrible that they have been burdened with totally undeserved negative attention. I apologize to them and ask for their forgiveness," Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naftalis, arguing for a lenient sentence, said his client had suffered a "fall from grace of Greek tragedy proportions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was an iconic figure who had been a role model for countless people around the globe," he said. "He is no more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v Gupta, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-cr-907.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Martha Graybow, Matthew Lewis, Gary Hill and Paul Tait)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Disgraced Wall Street titan and philanthropist Rajat Gupta was sentenced to only two years in prison, a much lighter sentence than U.S. prosecutors had demanded, even though the federal judge who imposed it on Wednesday called his insider trading crimes "disgusting" and "a terrible breach of trust."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta was also ordered to pay a $5 million fine. He was convicted in Manhattan federal court last June for leaking Goldman Sachs boardroom secrets to Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund manager at the center of a U.S. government crackdown on insider trading over the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some legal experts said the sentence came as a surprise, while others said the judge struck a fine balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff told a somber courtroom audience, including Gupta's wife and four adult daughters, that the illegal sharing of corporate secrets at the height of the 2008 financial crisis "was the functional equivalent of stabbing Goldman in the back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 63, gave no visible reaction to the sentence, which was given at the end of a 30-minute statement in which the judge spelled out the businessman's "extraordinary" philanthropy over decades that stood in stark contrast to his crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates, Microsoft Corp's co-founder, and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan were among 400 friends and luminaries who had written letters to the judge urging leniency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Gupta's trial, the court heard how Gupta had tipped off his then friend and business associate Rajaratnam between September and October of 2008. Within minutes of a conference call of members of Goldman's board on September 23, 2008, Gupta told Rajaratnam that influential investor Warren Buffett was infusing $5 billion into the investment bank. Rajaratnam traded on the information as the market was closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his statement on Wednesday, the judge said the tip "was not only overwhelming, but it was disgusting in its implications ... a terrible breach of trust" at a time when Goldman Sachs was in turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the judge also said: "I have never encountered a defendant whose past history suggests such an extraordinary devotion ... to people in need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rakoff ordered Gupta to begin his sentence on January 8, 2013. He denied Gupta's lawyer's bid to have him freed on bail pending an appeal, which could last as long as two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Goldman director is the most influential corporate figure to be convicted in the wide U.S. probe of insider trading involving fund managers, traders, consultants and executives.

The judge dismissed that proposal as "a kind of Peace Corps for insider traders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence was also less than some other insider trading defendants who went to trial and received four, five and even 10 years imprisonment. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence, one of the longest for insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Tarlowe on Wednesday argued for a sentence of at least eight years, telling the court "Mr Gupta knew as much about the sanctity of these types of corporate confidences as anybody, and that's what makes it so shocking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York securities class action and shareholder rights lawyer Mark Rifkin said the judge "understood both sides of the argument, and the relatively light sentence he imposed balances Gupta's misuse of his position against a lifetime of good work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Andrew Stoltmann, an attorney and investor rights advocate based in Chicago, wondered whether Gupta's "Mother Teresa-like halo" had warranted a sentence that was "little more than a slap on the wrist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had such an important role at some of these companies that it is kind of the ultimate betrayal of trust."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Gupta took his turn to address the court, he read for six minutes from a prepared statement, using bland language that stopped short of fully admitting his conduct, but apologizing to "extraordinary institutions and outstanding people" he knows and to his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel terrible that they have been burdened with totally undeserved negative attention.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Firm sales numbers for Microsoft Corp's Windows 8 and its new Surface tablet will not be available for three months, but it may be clear long before then if it has a hit on its hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can definitely gauge it by chatter," said Emily Chan, an analyst at Bernstein Research. "There is a slight learning curve, so I don't think we will see that big pop that iPad saw."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is desperate for the new-look, touch-friendly Windows 8 to grip customers' imaginations, as it looks to regain ground lost to Apple Inc and Google Inc in mobile computing and shake up the moribund PC market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more important is its new own-brand tablet called the Surface, available only through its own stores and website, which will challenge Apple's iPad head on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd want to know the sales - and return rate - of the Surface," said Sarah Rotman Epps at tech research firm Forrester. "But those numbers will be hard to get since Microsoft is the only retailer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reviews of the Surface have been mixed, generally praising the slick hardware, but faulting battery life and the limited software and applications available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some worry that the first Surface model, which runs on a stripped-down version of Windows 8 called RT that is not compatible with old Windows programs, will cause some confusion and dissatisfaction among customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three models for sale on Microsoft's U.S. website are already on back order, suggesting strong demand, but it is not known how many Surfaces Microsoft has manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact it's back ordered is indicative that there's consumer interest," said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner. "How Microsoft introduces it, evangelizes it and explains it will determine long term success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BALLMER NOISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not said if it will reveal sales figures for Windows 8 or of the Surface before its next scheduled earnings on January 24. The company tends to trumpet good news and stay silent otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the launch of Windows 7 three years ago, CEO Steve Ballmer waited only a month to announce strong sales. A year later, he waited only 10 days to report record-breaking sales of the Kinect, the motion-sensing add-on for the Xbox. But Microsoft has never shared the sales of Windows-powered phones, which have a lowly 3 percent of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Ballmer stays silent about Windows 8 sales, it might indicate a less than stellar performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would definitely take it a sign that it's not super, super strong, but I won't take it as something negative," said Chan at Bernstein, who is expecting 8.3 million Surface sales by the middle of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That averages out at about 1 million a month, a third the rate of the iPad, which notched up its first million sales in 28 days and has now sold more than 100 million units, averaging about 3.2 million a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gartner forecasts that Surface and other tablets running Windows RT will sell about 2.3 million units this year and 9.3 million next year, grabbing about 2 percent and 5 percent of the worldwide tablet market, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOOR-BUSTERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retail activity will be closely watched. Microsoft will have more than 60 brick and mortar stores open for the release of Windows 8 on Friday, half of them 'pop-up' stores that will stay open for the holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-party retailers are cautiously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen pretty good response to our pre-orders for Windows 8," said Best Buy Co Inc spokesman Jeff Haydock. "Quite honestly, I don't know what to expect from Friday. I don't know if there will be lines or not. My sense is it will take some time for people to kind of come into the stores and check it out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best Buy may give some color on how PC sales are going when it reports earnings on November 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the No. 1 U.S. retailer, said U.S. pre-orders for Windows 8 PCs "have been better than expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online retailers Amazon.com Inc, Newegg Inc and TigerDirect Inc have been silent on Windows 8 pre-orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full impact of PC sales on retailers will not be evident until chains report same-store sales for November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUICK REACTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One early indicator of Windows 8's success will be the contents of the online Windows Store. Microsoft has had a harder time drumming up interest among developers for Windows 8, given the risk that there will be fewer users than competing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will not disclose numbers, but there are expected to be 5,000 or so third-party apps available to U.S. users, in comparison with the iPad's 275,000. Some big names such as Facebook Inc will be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In social media, the tenor of comments on the Twitter hashtags #Windows8 and #Surface will give an indication of their reception after Ballmer unveils them both on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many users likely will be shocked by the new design, which dispenses with the Start button and features square tiles for apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public reaction to the new UI will depend how well Microsoft explains why 'different' is better and teaches how the new experience works," said Gartenberg. "That all starts on Thursday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BY THE NUMBERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate test for Windows 8 will be PC sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry trackers are expecting a bump for PC sales in the last two months of the year, but not enough to rescue the whole year, which is forecast to dip for the first time since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts had expected an uptick in production of laptops ahead of the Windows 8 launch, but PC makers facing an uncertain global economy have been wary about committing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chip maker Intel Corp, which is a good gauge of future PC demand due to its position early in the production process, expects the PC business to grow at only half the normal seasonal rate in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Paul Otellini recently told analysts he expects to have a better understanding of the success of Windows 8 in 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Baker, an analyst at retail research firm NPD Group, is expecting a 10 percent jump in PC sales for November and December over last year, but said comparisons will be difficult given a profusion of new devices and the volatility of year-ago data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter PC shipment numbers from research firms Gartner and IDC will not be published until early January, although analysts say PC makers might start to drop hints about demand before then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will likely be many milestones, but very few will ultimately be decisive. The key point is will PC sales continue to shrink or will they experience a boost," said Al Hilwa at research firm IDC. "We can probably begin to properly judge that with some ambiguity in January."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting By Dhanya Skariachan in New York, Jessica Wohl in Chicago and Noel Randewich in San Francisco.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Ocwen Financial Corp (OCN.N) and Walter Investment Management Corp WAC.A on Wednesday prevailed in a bankruptcy auction for Residential Capital LLC's mortgage business with a $3 billion bid that topped rival Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc (NSM.N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which needs bankruptcy court approval, is the latest example of non-bank financial companies expanding in the mortgage business in the wake of the financial crisis. The sale will raise money for bankrupt ResCap, which is looking to repay creditors including its parent, auto lender Ally Financial Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ocwen and Walter teamed up to buy a mortgage servicing operation that handles payments for 2.4 million home loans with a balance of about $374 billion. ResCap, once a major subprime lender, also has a mortgage lending operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the bidding arrangement, the smaller Walter, based in Tampa, Florida, will get the right to administer $50 billion in loans owned by government-controlled mortgage finance company Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB). It also acquires ResCap's lending and capital markets businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlanta-based Ocwen has been serially acquiring companies that collect payments on subprime mortgages, known as servicers, as banks and private equity firms look to shed them because of new regulations and capital requirements. The businesses can bring legal headaches, but can also bring profits as the housing market recovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Ocwen agreed to buy mortgage lender Homeward Residential Holdings from Wilbur Ross' private equity firm for $750 million in cash and stock. At the end of June, Ocwen said it had a $127 billion servicing portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are capitalizing on the current weakness in the servicing market and the fact that banks are shunning it," said Guy Cecala, publisher of industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. "They can get good prices and there's not much competition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction had been Nationstar's to lose. The Lewisville, Texas-based mortgage servicer agreed to buy ResCap's mortgage business when it filed for bankruptcy in May, pending the outcome of the auction. It had set the opening bid at $2.45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously we are disappointed in the outcome of the auction, but in the end our judgment was that the price of the assets would not represent a compelling investment opportunity for us," Nationstar Chief Executive Jay Bray said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationstar said it was now entitled to a breakup fee. A hearing on the auction will begin on November 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUFFETT BIG WINNER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest winners in the auction is Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), which bid for the mortgage assets at one point even though most observers were certain Warren Buffett's conglomerate did not actually want them. It failed to unseat Nationstar as the opening bidder and did not participate in the auction that began Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire held nearly $1 billion in ResCap junior secured debt as of this summer, and Nationstar's initial $2.4 billion bid was thought to be worth 93 cents on the dollar to bondholders like Berkshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A purchase price of $3 billion increases the likelihood that Buffett will make close to a full recovery on the debt - which perhaps was the whole point of his bid, some investors speculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire is the opening bidder for a loan package that ResCap is also selling. Its $1.44 billion topped ResCap's parent Ally, which had said it would buy the loans if no one else did. That auction begins on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock prices for Ocwen and Nationstar have soared this year, as investors eye future growth. Ocwen shares are up 161 percent this year after climbing 4.3 percent on Wednesday. Nationstar's shares fell 9.6 percent on Wednesday, but are up about 122 percent since the company went public in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ResCap filed for bankruptcy in May in an effort to shed liabilities tied to soured loans sold to investors during the housing boom. Its parent Ally, which is majority owned by the U.S. government after a series of bailouts, is looking to focus on U.S. auto lending and banking after taking huge losses on ResCap's mortgages. It is also selling international businesses to help pay back taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital advised Ocwen on the ResCap transaction. Mayer Brown served as primary deal counsel to Ocwen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, N.C.; Additional reporting by Ben Berkowitz; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Tim Dobbyn and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

bondholders like Berkshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A purchase price of $3 billion increases the likelihood that
Buffett will make close to a full recovery on the debt - which
perhaps was the whole point of his bid, some investors
speculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire is the opening bidder for a loan package that
ResCap is also selling. Its $1.44 billion topped ResCap's parent
Ally, which had said it would buy the loans if no one else did.
That auction begins on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock prices for Ocwen and Nationstar have soared this year,
as investors eye future growth. Ocwen shares are up 161 percent
this year after climbing 4.3 percent on Wednesday. Nationstar's
shares fell 9.6 percent on Wednesday, but are up about 122
percent since the company went public in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ResCap filed for bankruptcy in May in an effort to shed
liabilities tied to soured loans sold to investors during the
housing boom. Its parent Ally, which is majority owned by the
U.S. government after a series of bailouts, is looking to focus
on U.S. auto lending and banking after taking huge losses on
ResCap's mortgages. It is also selling international businesses
to help pay back taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital advised Ocwen on the ResCap transaction.
Mayer Brown served as primary deal counsel to Ocwen.&lt;/p&gt;

Awarded Winning Bid for ResCap's Mortgage Servicing and Origination Platform</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct. 24, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, the mortgage servicing arm of Ocwen Financial Corporation (NYSE:OCN), and Walter Investment Management Corp. (NYSE MKT:WAC) today were jointly awarded the highest and best bid for the mortgage servicing and origination platform assets of Residential Capital, LLC (ResCap) in a Bankruptcy Court sponsored auction. The bid with a purchase price of $3 billion is subject to definitive documentation and Bankruptcy Court approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	ResCap, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ally Financial Inc., was servicing at March 31, 2012 over 2.4 million loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance (UPB) of approximately $374 billion. Of these, approximately 68% of the loans (by UPB) are owned, insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. ResCap has operations in Ft. Washington, PA, Waterloo, IA, Dallas, TX, Burbank and Costa Mesa, CA and Minneapolis, MN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"The acquisition of ResCap significantly advances Ocwen's planned growth initiative to add high return servicing assets to our portfolio and to expand our servicing capacity through retention of a significant portion of ResCap's high quality servicing organization," said Ocwen's Executive Chairman William Erbey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Under the joint bidding arrangement, Walter Investment Management Corp. will acquire the Fannie Mae mortgage servicing rights (MSR) portion of ResCap's servicing portfolio, representing approximately $50.4 billion in UPB, as well as the origination and capital markets platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We are quite pleased to have won the joint bid with Ocwen to acquire these assets on what we believe are very attractive terms," said Mark J. O'Brien, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Walter Investment. "We believe our long-established relationships with Fannie Mae and history of driving strong performance from their portfolios makes us ideally suited to acquire the Fannie MSR portfolio from ResCap. Further, the opportunity to acquire the ResCap Origination platform will allow us to profitably achieve additional scale in our originations business. We are excited by the opportunities the origination and capital markets platforms and people bring to our business. These opportunities are indicative of the growth and acceleration of prospects in our $500 billion active pipeline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ron Faris, CEO of Ocwen said, "ResCap has been an outstanding performer in the mortgage industry. We share a common philosophy of foreclosure prevention through loan modifications that are net present value positive for investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Thomas Marano, CEO of ResCap added, "The scope of the financial commitment between Ocwen and Walter in ResCap's people and&#160;franchise is an indication of their joint commitment to US housing market and the current significant opportunity that exists in the US housing sector.&#160;The advanced technology offered by the teams at Ocwen and Walter provides an excellent opportunity for growth and continued success."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The transaction is subject to completion of definitive acquisition documents which are expected to provide representations, warranties and covenants that are customary for a transaction of this nature, as well retained liabilities provisions relating to certain pre-closing liabilities.&#160; The sale approval hearing before the Bankruptcy Court is set for November 19, 2012. &#160;&#160;Neither Ocwen nor Walter anticipates the need to raise any additional equity capital to close the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Barclays Capital provided Ocwen financial advisory and investment banking services in connection with this purchase transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Quarterly net profit up 53 pct, tops expectations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Recent acquisitions of Mexican rivals drive sales growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Decision on Philippines purchase seen by year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Continues to tread Latin America for M opportunities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa
, Latin America's biggest coke bottler, said
third-quarter profit jumped 53 percent on recent acquisitions
and it hoped to decide on another purchase in the Philippines by
year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, a joint venture of Coca-Cola Co and
Mexican retailer and beverage company Femsa, said
earnings increased to 3.54 billion pesos ($276 million) from
2.31 billion pesos a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results beat market expectations. Analysts polled by
Reuters were looking for earnings of 3.15 billion
pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue jumped 20 percent to 36.19 billion pesos, helped by
the integration of Mexican rivals Grupo Tampico, Grupo CIMSA and
Grupo Fomento Queretano, the company said. About 1,000 people
have been laid off as a result of these transactions so far this
year and more headcount reduction could take place in the
current quarter, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which is in talks to buy a controlling stake in
Coca-Cola Co operations in the Philippines, said it expected a
decision on the deal by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it has a very good potential ... we are finalizing
negotiations with Coca-Cola Co. As they say in baseball, it's
not over till it's over," the company said during a conference
call with analysts Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deal could mean the beginning of more activity in Asia
for the Mexican company although it did not give details about a
possible next target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola FEMSA added during the call that while there were
limited purchase chances left in Latin America, it would
continue to tread the region for more opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company operates in Mexico, Central America, Colombia,
Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said acquisitions combined with more-stable
prices of raw materials have greatly helped the company's
results in recent quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After facing a very tough commodity and volatile currency
environment over the past several quarters, we look forward to a
strong close of the year," said Carlos Salazar, chief executive
officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa shares, up 29 percent so far this year, rose
0.34 percent to 172.26 pesos on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The award is based in part of compensation Scharf is leaving behind at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saunders received $11.8 million in total pay in 2011, according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the credit and debit-card network were up less than 1 percent at $137.48 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jochelle Mendonca in Bangalore and David Henry in New York; Editing by Supriya Kurane and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

			Endomondo and The Coca-Cola Company Join Forces 
      to Encourage More People to Get Active and Have Fun along the Way
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global Strategic Alliance Marks the Third Collaboration for The 
      Coca-Cola Company
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leaders from The Coca-Cola Company this morning took to the running 
      trails of New York to celebrate the launch of a strategic alliance with 
      Endomondo (www.endomondo.com), 
      a social fitness community with more than 12 million users worldwide. 
      The newly formed collaboration combines the global reach of Coca-Cola 
      (through its POWERADE&#174; brand) with Endomondo&#8217;s first-of-its kind mobile 
      app and social network to bring communities around the world together 
      with the tools they need to reach their fitness goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Endomondo brings together cutting-edge technology, including 
      location-based GPS, with social networking capabilities to motivate 
      users toward more fun and greater fitness. Under the new agreement, 
      Coca-Cola will help Endomondo grow its existing user base and enter into 
      new markets and territories, while helping develop the app&#8217;s 
      functionality and drive innovation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We were immediately attracted to the dynamic team at Endomondo and 
      their vision and commitment to creating a world where everybody 
      exercises,&#8221; said Emmanuel Seuge, Head of Worldwide Sports and 
      Entertainment Marketing, The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;We believe in the power 
      of Endomondo&#8217;s vision, application and most importantly &#8211; its people.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company&#8217;s first contribution can be seen through a new POWERADE&#174; 
      hydration feature, which educates users about how much they need to 
      drink during and after each workout for optimum hydration levels to 
      enhance performance. Research has shown that dehydration resulting in as 
      little as a 2 percent decrease in body mass can begin to reduce both 
      physical and mental performance. By being properly hydrated athletes can 
      perform at higher levels. Endomondo&#8217;s new hydration feature supports 
      effective functioning of the body, and promotes general health and 
      well-being.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Through the innovation and network of Endomondo, we have an incredible 
      opportunity to continue to establish Powerade as a true sports brand,&#8221; 
      explained Seuge. &#8220;The application will allow sports men and women from 
      around the world to motivate and compete with each other while they 
      strengthen and condition to become better all-round athletes.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Endomondo joins music licensing start-up Music Dealers and digital music 
      service Spotify in The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s strategic alliance portfolio 
      as the first global sports-related endeavour. Similar to The Company&#8217;s 
      pacts with Music Dealers and Spotify, the collaboration is rooted in 
      shared value, an evolving approach to partnerships, leveraging the scale 
      and reach of The Coca-Cola Company to achieve bottom line efficiencies 
      for both parties. Coca-Cola and Endomondo expect to finalize an 
      agreement that will enable Coca-Cola to become an investor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are incredibly excited to announce Endomondo&#8217;s first-ever global 
      brand collaboration,&#8221; said Endomondo Co-founder Christian Birk. &#8220;Our 
      relationship with The Coca-Cola Company will pull together the 
      innovative resources from both partners to create new, unique 
      experiences that helps people around the world have fun while leading a 
      more active lifestyle."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have told Microsoft not to repeat the mistake of denying consumers a choice of rival Web browsers in its new Windows 8 operating system, in a dispute that has already cost the software giant more than a billion euros ($1.3 billion) in fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said on Wednesday he had spelt out his concerns to Microsoft about Windows 8, its new flagship software product which is set for release on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have precisely transmitted ... my concerns, what kind of presentation should be avoided if they don't want to take the risk of a new investigation," Almunia told a news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it had taken heed of the warning, indicating its desire to draw a line under its decade-long battle with the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After discussions with the Commission, we are changing some aspects of the way the browser choice screen works on Windows 8 and will have those changes implemented when Windows 8 launches later this week," Microsoft spokesman Robin Koch said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almunia's warning came with charges that Microsoft had broken a promise to offer European consumers a choice of rival browsers in its previous version of Windows, which could result in a substantial fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft promised three years ago to offer browser choices, to settle an EU antitrust investigation and avoid a penalty that could have been as much as 10 percent of its global turnover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the European Commission said Microsoft had not fulfilled its pledge between February last year and July this year, confirming an earlier Reuters report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If companies enter into commitments, they must do what they are committed to do or face the consequences. Companies should be deterred from any temptation to renege on promises or even to neglect their duty," Almunia told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could face a significant fine as it is the second time it has failed to comply with an EU order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sanction could top $7.4 billion or 10 percent of its revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 - but the final figure is expected to be lower, as the infringement covered a relatively short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has already been penalized to the tune of 1.6 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in the last decade for infringing EU rules, apologized. It has four weeks to reply to the Commission's "statement of objections" or charge sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although this was the result of a technical error, we take responsibility for what happened, and we are strengthening our internal procedures to help ensure something like this cannot happen again," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO TABLET PROBE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EC action should serve as a warning to other companies, said Susanne Zuehlke, a partner at Brussels-based law firm Latham &amp; Watkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It shows that the Commission takes its enforcement seriously and follows up on cases even when they appeared closed," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almunia said he had no reason to go after Microsoft's operating system for tablets, a market that includes rivals Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have looked at Windows RT and on the basis of our investigation so far there are no grounds to pursue further investigation on this particular issue," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said in July several companies had accused Microsoft of only allowing its own Internet Explorer browser to be installed on devices running Windows RT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's share of the European browser market has roughly halved since 2008 to 29 percent, on a par with Google's Chrome but behind Mozilla's 30 percent share, according to Web traffic analysis firm Statcounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Microsoft case heading for resolution, the next Web-related battle for the Commission is likely to be with Google, the target of complaints by Microsoft and more than a dozen other rivals over its core search engine business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's most popular search engine is now in talks with the EU watchdog that could help it avoid sanctions which could amount to some $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=0.7711 euros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sophie Hares and Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

operating system for tablets, a market that includes rivals
Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have looked at Windows RT and on the basis of our
investigation so far there are no grounds to pursue further
investigation on this particular issue," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said in July several companies had accused
Microsoft of only allowing its own Internet Explorer browser to
be installed on devices running Windows RT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's share of the European browser market has roughly
halved since 2008 to 29 percent, on a par with Google's Chrome
but behind Mozilla's 30 percent share, according to Web traffic
analysis firm Statcounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Microsoft case heading for resolution, the next 
Web-related battle for the Commission is likely to be with
Google, the target of complaints by Microsoft and more than a
dozen other rivals over its core search engine business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's most popular search engine is now in talks with
the EU watchdog that could help it avoid sanctions which could
amount to some $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer&#8217;s XALKORI&#174; Receives Conditional 
      Marketing Authorization from the European Commission for the Treatment 
      of Adults with Previously Treated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell 
      Lung Cancer in the EU
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today that the European Commission has given 
      conditional marketing authorization for XALKORI&#174; (crizotinib) 
      in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adults with previously 
      treated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the field of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, XALKORI 
      represents a major advancement. It brings to the patients with 
      ALK-translocated tumors an oral compound that can achieve tumor 
      shrinkage and delay disease progression,&#8221; said Dr. Jean-Charles Soria, 
      professor of Medicine and Medical Oncology at South-Paris University and 
      cancer specialist at Institut Gustave Roussy, France.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Similar to accelerated approvals in the United States, conditional 
      marketing authorizations in the EU are granted to medicinal products 
      with a positive benefit/risk assessment&#160;that address unmet medical needs 
      and whose availability would result in a significant public health 
      benefit. A conditional marketing authorization is renewable annually. 
      Now that XALKORI has been granted a conditional marketing authorization, 
      Pfizer will be required to submit data to the European Medicines Agency 
      (EMA) from the recently completed PROFILE 1007 study, which was 
      presented in September at the ESMO 2012 Congress in Vienna, Austria. The 
      study met its primary endpoint in previously treated ALK-positive 
      advanced NSCLC patients. Following review of the 1007 results by the 
      EMA&#8217;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the 
      European Commission will consider converting the conditional marketing 
      authorization to a normal marketing authorization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s approval is a significant milestone for adults with 
      ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in Europe,&#8221; said Dr. Andreas Penk, president 
      of Pfizer Oncology Europe. &#8220;XALKORI is a first-in-class medicine and 
      demonstrates Pfizer&#8217;s commitment to targeting specific molecular 
      abnormalities and providing the right treatment to the right patient at 
      the right time.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XALKORI is an oral, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor.1 
      By inhibiting the ALK fusion protein, XALKORI blocks signaling in a 
      number of cell pathways that are believed to be critical for the growth 
      and survival of tumor cells, which may lead to growth inhibition or 
      regression of tumors.2,3
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About XALKORI (crizotinib)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XALKORI is a first-in-class medicine that has received conditional 
      marketing authorization in Europe. XALKORI was first approved in the 
      U.S. in August 2011 for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic 
      NSCLC that is ALK-positive as detected by a Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA)-approved test. This indication is based on response rate. There 
      are no data available demonstrating improvements in patient-reported 
      outcomes or survival with XALKORI. XALKORI also has received approval in 
      a number of other countries, including Switzerland, Canada, South Korea 
      and Japan. Additional applications are under regulatory review in 
      several countries worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important XALKORI(crizotinib)Safety Information4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatotoxicity: Drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome has 
      occurred. Transaminase elevations generally occurred within the first 2 
      months of treatment. XALKORI should not be used in patients with severe 
      hepatic impairment. Liver function tests including alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total 
      bilirubin should be monitored twice a month during the first 2 months of 
      treatment, then once a month and as clinically indicated, with more 
      frequent repeat testing for Grades 2, 3, or 4 elevation. Temporarily 
      suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI as indicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumonitis: XALKORI has been associated with severe, life-threatening, 
      or fatal treatment-related pneumonitis in clinical trials with a 
      frequency of 4 in 386 (1%) patients. All of these cases occurred within 
      2 months after the initiation of treatment. Patients with pulmonary 
      symptoms indicative of pneumonitis should be monitored. XALKORI 
      treatment should be withheld if pneumonitis is suspected. Other causes 
      of pneumonitis should be excluded and XALKORI should be permanently 
      discontinued in patients diagnosed with treatment-related pneumonitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      QT Interval Prolongation: QTc prolongation has been observed, which may 
      lead to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. 
      Torsades de Pointes) or sudden death. The risk of QTc prolongation may 
      be increased in patients concomitantly taking antiarrhythmics and in 
      patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or 
      electrolyte disturbances (e.g., secondary to diarrhea or vomiting). 
      XALKORI should be administered with caution to patients who have a 
      history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, or who are taking 
      medicinal products that are known to prolong the QT interval. When using 
      XALKORI in these patients, periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms 
      and electrolytes should be considered. Permanently discontinue XALKORI 
      for grade 4 QTc prolongation. XALKORI should be withheld for grade 3 QTc 
      prolongation until recovery to &#8804; grade 1. Permanently discontinue 
      XALKORI if grade 3 QTc prolongation recurs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ALK Testing: An accurate and validated ALK assay is necessary for the 
      selection of patients for treatment with XALKORI. Assessment for 
      ALK-positive NSCLC should be performed by laboratories with demonstrated 
      proficiency in the specific technology being utilized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pregnancy: XALKORI may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
      woman. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are no 
      data in pregnant women using XALKORI. This medicinal product should not 
      be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the mother 
      requires treatment. Pregnant women, or patients becoming pregnant while 
      receiving XALKORI, or treated male patients as partners of a pregnant 
      women, should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Adverse Reactions: Safety of XALKORI was evaluated in 386 patients with 
      previously treated ALK-positive NSCLC in 2 single-arm clinical trials 
      (Study 1001 and PROFILE 1005). The most common any-grade adverse 
      reactions (20%) across both studies were vision disorder, nausea, 
      diarrhea, vomiting, edema, constipation, and fatigue. The most common 
      Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (&#8805;3%) across both studies were increased 
      ALT and neutropenia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Vision disorder including diplopia, photopsia, vision blurred, visual 
        impairment, and vitreous floaters was experienced by 76 (61%) patients 
        in Study 1001 and 149 (57%) patients in PROFILE 1005. Ophthalmological 
        evaluation should be considered if vision disorder persists or worsens 
        in severity.
      
			
        Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation were the most commonly 
        reported gastrointestinal events, and were primarily Grade 1 in 
        severity. Supportive care for gastrointestinal events may include 
        standard antiemetic and/or antidiarrheal or laxative medicinal 
        products.
      
			
        Neuropathy, primarily peripheral neuropathy, was experienced by 11 
        (9%) patients in Study 1001 and 33 (13%) patients in PROFILE 1005, and 
        was primarily Grade 1 in severity. Dizziness and dysgeusia were also 
        very commonly reported in these studies, but were all Grades 1 or 2 in 
        severity.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Drug Interactions: The concomitant use of XALKORI with strong CYP3A4 
      inhibitors/inducers and CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic 
      indices should be avoided.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Breast-feeding: It is not known whether XALKORI and its metabolites are 
      excreted in human milk. Because of the potential harm to the infant, 
      mothers should be advised to avoid breast-feeding while receiving 
      XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatic Impairment: XALKORI has not been studied in patients with 
      hepatic impairment. Treatment with XALKORI should be used with caution 
      in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. XALKORI should 
      not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Renal Impairment: No starting dose adjustment is recommended for 
      patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. No data are available 
      for patients with severe and end-stage renal disease. Therefore, no 
      formal dosing recommendation can be made.

			Virtual Bridges Delivers Enhanced Cloud Management and Mobility 
      Capabilities with IBM Software
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New VERDE Features Help Customers Including Birmingham Metropolitan 
      College Address Key Economic and Complexity Issues Associated with 
      Traditional VDI
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Virtual 
      Bridges, Inc. today announced that new features of its VERDE 
      Cloud Branch and on-premises deployment solution have been incorporated 
      into the IBM Virtual Desktop solution to support the growing demand for 
      scalability and simplicity with mobile computing. As a result, clients 
      can now more easily manage and secure employee desktops from any 
      location. This new solution is now part of IBM&#8217;s Endpoint Management and 
      Mobile portfolio, integrating with IBM SmartCloud management solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Featuring VERDE, the IBM Virtual Desktop is used by organizations around 
      the world to lower the barriers of virtual desktop management &#8211; reducing 
      cost, complexity and security risks &#8211; to allow employees to use their 
      desktops remotely from anywhere with any device.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Birmingham Metropolitan College (BMet), one of the largest colleges in 
      the UK with more than 35,000 students and 1,300 employees, is deploying 
      the solution across all campuses to create a &#8220;Classroom in the Cloud.&#8221; 
      It provides access to desktops, applications and learning materials at 
      any time, from any location or device.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s students will have much greater access to technology than ever 
      before. But supporting all of these emerging devices across our campus, 
      and providing access to learning materials can be a significant 
      challenge,&#8221; said Jamie Smith, Director Systems and Policy Development, 
      Birmingham Metropolitan College. &#8220;IBM Virtual Desktop, powered by VERDE, 
      is a game- changer. By creating a virtual desktop environment, we will 
      provide students with a flexible, location independent learning 
      environment, that has changed the way our faculty can teach and our 
      students can learn. In the next 3-5 years, I expect all large 
      universities will follow our lead and deploy virtual desktops.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      VERDE&#8217;s focus on Cloud Branch has allowed the IBM Virtual Desktop 
      solution to support large-scale enterprise customers in addition to 
      mid-enterprise and smaller organizations. It features a single, 
      comprehensive, yet clear management interface for VDI environments. 
      Patent-pending storage optimization features also address the &#8220;Achilles 
      Heel&#8221; of VDI by cutting IOPS by 80 to 90 percent, disconnected VDI 
      support for mobile users and robust disaster recovery capabilities. The 
      solution will now be sold both directly by IBM as well as through IBM 
      partner channels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IBM and Virtual Bridges are partnering to helping businesses more 
      effectively transition to the profound value of mobile-savvy cloud 
      environments,&#8221; said Scott Hebner, Vice President, Cloud  Business 
      Infrastructure Management, IBM. &#8220;By supporting the Virtual Bridges 
      technology in our solutions, we&#8217;ve addressed the most common challenges 
      our clients face when delivering cloud services to virtual desktops: 
      security, choice and scalability.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Organizations benefit from key VERDE enhancements including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Bare-metal install reduces cost and complexity for VDI deployments by 
        requiring no pre-existing OS and allowing users to provision a Windows 
        or Linux virtual desktop in under 30 minutes, including automated 
        configuration of all internal storage applications and peripherals. 
        This lowers operating and capital costs by improving customer time to 
        value, eliminating operating system skills from the VDI server 
        installation and reducing operating system costs associated with 
        scaling a solution - no operating system licenses are required for 
        initial installation or future growth.
      
			
				Cloud Branch provides a best-of-breed end user experience by 
        combining cloud-based management with an on-premise virtual desktop 
        deployment. This combination centralizes management in the Cloud or 
        Data Center while providing unique and industry leading remote office 
        support that brings local-area-network availability and performance to 
        virtual desktop users in remote offices connected over 
        wide-area-networks. These new branch capabilities make delivery of VDI 
        environments now possible in &#8220;brick and mortar&#8221; banking environments, 
        retail and distribution stores, etc.
      
			
				A sophisticated network management system reduces complexity and 
        improves security by providing a virtual switch that enables easy 
        configuration of VLANs, MAC addresses, and other sophisticated network 
        configurations.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Users and organizations are arriving at an inflection point in the 
      evolution of end user computing. On the one hand users are adopting a 
      wide range of devices and expect to use these at work, as well as on the 
      go. While at the same time, organizations are struggling to manage 
      inefficient and costly desktop upgrade cycles, not to mention the 
      increased threat of data loss from laptops and other devices,&#8221; said Jim 
      Curtin, CEO of Virtual Bridges. &#8220;Launched by the most trusted brand in 
      the world, the IBM Virtual Desktop is the right product at the right 
      time to help organizations overcome these challenges.&#8221;

			Visa Announces CEO Succession Plan, Charles W. Scharf to Become Chief 
      Executive Officer; Joseph W. Saunders to Serve as Executive Chairman
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced that the company&#8217;s Board of 
      Directors has elected Charles W. Scharf, formerly Chief Executive 
      Officer of Retail Financial Services for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPMorgan 
      Chase), to succeed Joseph W. Saunders as Visa&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, 
      effective November 1, 2012. Mr. Scharf&#160;is a former director of Visa Inc. 
      (and its predecessor Visa U.S.A). Mr. Saunders, who has served as the 
      company&#8217;s CEO since 2007, will continue his duties as executive chairman 
      of the company during the period of his employment, which extends to 
      March 31, 2013. After Mr. Saunders retires, the Board intends to appoint 
      a new non-executive independent chairperson. The Board has also expanded 
      from 10 to 11 directors, and Mr. Scharf&#160;has been appointed a director, 
      effective November 1, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Scharf is currently Managing Director at One Equity Partners, which 
      manages $10 billion of investments and commitments for JPMorgan Chase. 
      He previously spent nine years at JPMorgan Chase and its predecessors as 
      the Chief Executive Officer of Retail Financial Services, one of 
      JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s six lines of business, and a major issuer of Visa 
      branded cards. The business generated revenue of $30 billion annually 
      with 130,000 employees. He was previously Chief Financial Officer of 
      Bank One from 2000 to 2002 and spent 13 years at Citigroup and its 
      predecessor companies, serving as Chief Financial Officer for 
      Citigroup&#8217;s Global Corporate and Investment Bank prior to joining Bank 
      One. He served on the Board of Visa U.S.A. from 2003 to 2007 and the 
      Visa Inc. Board from 2007 to January 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It has been a pleasure and an honor to lead Visa through its transition 
      to public listing,&#8221; said Mr. Saunders. &#8220;Over the past five years, we 
      have put the company on a clear path towards continued long-term growth. 
      We have executed on our strategy to grow our core business, expand 
      internationally and innovate to evolve our offerings to meet rapidly 
      changing market conditions. This has allowed us to deliver value to our 
      clients and investors.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Saunders continued, &#8220;I have known Charlie Scharf for almost a decade 
      and I believe he is uniquely qualified to lead Visa in the future. He 
      has a record of profitably growing businesses, and managing complex, 
      large-scale global enterprises. He has demonstrated that he knows how to 
      deliver value to customers and to shareholders. I am confident that 
      under his leadership, Visa will continue to grow its core business 
      globally and deliver innovation that meets customer needs. I look 
      forward to working with him to make this transition seamless.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The board has been working with Joe Saunders to ensure that we found a 
      leader to succeed him who could build on his success and also address 
      the opportunities Visa will face in the future,&#8221; said John A. Swainson, 
      lead independent director of the Visa Board. &#8220;On behalf of the entire 
      Board, we thank Joe for his tireless work and leadership. The Visa that 
      he will hand over to Charles Scharf is in every way stronger and 
      well-positioned for long-term growth. Joe finalized the merger that 
      created Visa Inc. and led the company through its successful public 
      listing, which provided Visa with an opportunity to fulfill its 
      potential &#8211; to invest in global growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Swainson continued, &#8220;Charlie&#160;is an experienced, versatile leader. 
      While at Chase, he built one of the premier retail banking operations in 
      the U.S, and at Citi he served as CFO of a complex global business that 
      operated in more than 110 countries providing securities, transaction 
      processing and banking services to institutional clients. We believe 
      that his proven ability to set strategy, lead large teams, and drive 
      growth and innovation through technology make him the best person to 
      accelerate the execution of Visa&#8217;s strategic plan. Charlie&#160;understands 
      the payments business &#8211; and the priorities of our clients &#8211; through his 
      deep, rich history in the payments space both as one of the senior 
      executives responsible for the payments business at JPMorgan Chase, one 
      of our largest clients, and as a former Visa director for almost eight 
      years.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Scharf&#160;said, &#8220;The payments industry is an exciting place to be with 
      both the continued migration across the globe to electronic payments and 
      the development of ground-breaking new technologies, and Visa plays an 
      important role in enabling both. Visa is uniquely positioned in this 
      industry to continue its robust growth by providing innovative solutions 
      to its financial institution clients, merchants and their customers 
      everywhere. The management team Joe has led has made Visa into the 
      industry leader and I am excited to build on that momentum in an 
      evolving and dynamic market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Scharf added, &#8220;As both a client and a director, I have had many 
      opportunities to work closely with Visa&#8217;s management team, and I truly 
      believe that Visa is one of the world&#8217;s great companies. Great 
      organizations are driven by talented people who are focused on execution 
      excellence. To be a true industry leader also requires constantly 
      innovating, taking risks, and building products and services for the 
      future. I am honored to be able to continue to lead the Visa team 
      towards this end.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Joe Saunders&#8217; accomplishments, in building the outstanding company that 
      Visa is today, set a challenging record for any new CEO to exceed. The 
      CEO role at Visa is one of the greatest leadership positions in any 
      industry. I am grateful for the opportunity, and I look forward to a 
      very smooth transition and productive collaboration with the rest of the 
      Visa leadership team,&#8221; Mr. Scharf concluded.

&lt;p&gt;In an interview on CNBC, Buffett said it was anyone's guess 
what would happen at P, where there has been some pressure for
change at the top of the company. Buffett said he has been
selling P shares to fund other purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA, Oct 24 (MARKET WIRE) --
Immunovaccine Inc. ("Immunovaccine" or the "Company") (TSX VENTURE:IMV),
a clinical stage vaccine company, today announced positive results from a
preliminary study of an anti-cocaine vaccine in collaboration with Weill
Cornell Medical College. The vaccine, which added Immunovaccine's
DepoVax(TM) adjuvanting technology to Weill Cornell's novel anti-cocaine
vaccine (dAd5GNE), was being evaluated in rodents for its ability to
produce antibodies capable of blocking cocaine from being delivered to
the brain in an effort to prevent its physiological effect.

    The study showed that the DepoVax-enhanced vaccine produced high levels
of target antibodies that were able to sequester cocaine in the blood of
immunized mice and block its delivery to the brain. Immunovaccine hopes
to build on this interesting proof of concept work and is currently
evaluating opportunities to further develop the program. Further
potential studies would aim to confirm these results and explore the
duration of immunity produced by the vaccine. There are research efforts
to develop an anti-cocaine vaccine that is able to effectively induce and
maintain a sufficient immune response without requiring frequent
immunizations. 

    "Immunovaccine's delivery system holds the vaccine at the site of
injection allowing the immune system to process the vaccine differently
than other vaccines," said Dr. Marc Mansour, the company's chief science
officer. "This results in strong immunity against the target, in this
case cocaine. The next time cocaine appears in the blood the subject's
immune system seizes the molecules and neutralizes their effect." 

    In March 2012, Immunovaccine and Weill Cornell announced a research
agreement to explore the company's technology with a vaccine being
developed for treating cocaine addiction. The project builds on earlier
cocaine vaccine work, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), at Weill Cornell. The
goal of this particular study was to evaluate the ability DepoVax(TM) to
trigger a strong immune response with Weill Cornell's dAd5GNE vaccine.
There currently are no anti-cocaine vaccines approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

    Cocaine abuse is estimated to affect approximately 4.8 million Americans
annually with an additional one million Americans using crack cocaine at
least once each year. A safe and effective anti-cocaine vaccine has the
potential to significantly address the healthcare and societal problem
associated with cocaine abuse and addiction.

    About DepoVax

    DepoVax(TM)is a patented formulation that provides controlled and
prolonged exposure of antigens plus adjuvant to the immune system,
resulting in a strong, specific and sustained immune response with the
capability for single-dose effectiveness. The DepoVax platform possesses
impressive flexibility, allowing it to work with a broad range of target
antigens in various therapeutic applications. The technology is also
commercially scalable, with potential for years of stability and ease of
use in the clinic.

    About Immunovaccine

    Immunovaccine Inc. applies its novel adjuvanting platform to the
development of vaccines for cancer therapy, infectious diseases and
animal health. The Company's DepoVax(TM) platform is a patented
formulation that provides controlled and prolonged exposure of antigens
plus adjuvant to the immune system. Immunovaccine has advanced two
DepoVax-based cancer vaccines into Phase I human clinical trials. The
Company is also advancing a broad infectious disease pipeline including
vaccines in such indications as malaria, respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) and anthrax. In addition to the Company's human health vaccine
strategy, it continues to capture value from animal health vaccine
applications. Immunovaccine has key partnerships in the animal health
sector including an agreement with Pfizer Animal Health. Connect at

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 24 (Marketwire) -- 
Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ: QLYS), a pioneer and leading provider of cloud
security and compliance solutions, today announced at the Qualys Security
Conference in Las Vegas, twitter #qsc2012, that QualysGuard(R)
Vulnerability Management will now feature vulnerability prediction
capabilities within a new dashboard and threat reports for zero-days and
Microsoft Patch Tuesday Analysis. These reports provide security
professionals with insight into zero-days and upcoming security patches
along with exposure ratings, helping them plan and prioritize remediation
of the associated vulnerabilities including Verisign's iDefense exclusive
zero-day vulnerabilities and global threats.

    "Analyzing the impact of Patch Tuesday and zero-day vulnerabilities is a
challenging task for IT departments," said Charles Kolodgy, research vice
president, Secure Products, for IDC. "Providing an instant view of where
the impact of the new vulnerabilities are will help customers better
assess their risk exposures and therefore allow them to allocate the
needed resources to eliminate or mitigate these threats."

    Without launching any new scans, the new dashboard and threat reports
leverage the vulnerability predictive analytics engine to provide the
following:


--  Dashboard widget that provides easy-to-read view of the latest
    Microsoft security bulletins including the percentage of potentially
    impacted IT assets in the network.
--  Microsoft bulletin references linked to vulnerabilities with detailed
    descriptions of threat, impact and solutions, in addition to potential
    associated known exploits and malware from multiple sources.
--  Vulnerability prediction report per Microsoft bulletin with affected
    host breakdown by asset groups in the network.
--  Search capabilities to search, scan and report on vulnerabilities over
    specific time periods, affecting different products or software.
--  Latest information and signatures for iDefense exclusive zero-day
    threats with customizable alerts on new zero-days along with a threat
    report providing the list of IT assets that are potentially impacted
    by the zero-day.

    

"Two years back we introduced a patch report in QualysGuard to help
IT professionals drive remediation efforts more effectively," said
Philippe Courtot, chairman and CEO for Qualys. "Today we are taking
another step forward by providing an innovative vulnerability prediction
engine for zero-days and Microsoft Patch Tuesday vulnerabilities that
predicts potential impact without the need to perform additional scans,
so customers can take action the day of the release to minimize their
risk of exposure."

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Oct 24 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators charged
Microsoft on Wednesday for breaching a 2009 order to
offer a choice of web browsers to consumers on its Windows 7
operating system, the first step to a possible hefty fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's No. 1 software company agreed with the European
Commission three years ago to offer browser choices, in a bid to
settle an antitrust investigation and avoid a penalty that could
have been as much as 10 percent of its global turnover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the executive EU Commission, which acts as antitrust
watchdog in the European Union, said in July this year that
Microsoft had not complied with the order from February last
year until then. The company blamed the lapse on a technical
problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its
preliminary view that Microsoft has failed to comply with its
commitments to offer users a choice screen enabling them to
easily choose their preferred web browser," the Commission said

charge sheet to Microsoft detailing the infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia will hold a news

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp put its Surface tablet center stage at its Windows 8 launch event, hoping the sleek new device will spark a fightback against Apple Inc and Google Inc in the exploding mobile computing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With interest in traditional computers waning, the world's largest software company is attempting to reinvent the Windows PC in a new format and directly challenge Apple's all-conquering iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One person called it historic, unique," said Steven Sinofsky, head of Microsoft's Windows unit and the driving force behind Windows 8, who opened the launch event in New York in front about 1,000 media and PC industry partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's twice the amount of storage as a competing tablet for the same price," Sinofsky said, comparing the entry level 32 GB Surface with the cheapest 16 GB model of Apple's latest full-sized iPad, which both cost $499.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky and his team showed off a range of devices running Windows 8 from PC makers such as Lenovo Group Ltd and Acer Inc, but devoted most of their energy to the second half of the presentation and the Surface tablet, the first computer Microsoft has made itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panos Panay, head of the Surface project, demonstrated the tablet's features, beaming video and music to other screens, showing off the ultra-thin cover that doubles as a keyboard, and hooking up a camera to the device's USB port. He even dropped the device on the floor to demonstrate its durability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft stressed that the Surface, featuring a pre-installed version of Office, is not just for entertainment but also for work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device has generated a lot of curiosity, but so far has not garnered rave reviews and users seem unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really a new class of device that sees the tablet and PC experiences merging into a single device instead of discrete ones," said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner, who attended the launch. "Microsoft's challenge now will be to educate the market as to why different is also better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook wasted no time shooting back at Microsoft's challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I haven't personally played with the Surface yet, but what we're reading about it is that it's a fairly compromised, confusing product," Cook said on Apple's quarterly earnings conference call with analysts. "I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I don't think it would do all of those things very well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DEPARTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 was introduced three years ago, but Windows 8 represents the biggest change in Microsoft's user interface since Windows 95 came out 17 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've reimagined Windows, and we've reimagined the whole PC industry," Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told Reuters Television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The radical redesign, which dispenses with the Start button and features square tiles for apps, may surprise some users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky sought to quell fears by emphasizing that the new system was built on the base of Windows 7, Microsoft's best-selling software that recently passed 670 million license sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Enough consumers don't know where to go; they are still confused by Windows 8," Envisioneering Group technology consulting Richard Doherty said at the New York event. "There were no developers here (at the event). I don't know if developers will embrace it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial demand for Windows 8 appeared solid, but customers are wary of spending money on unnecessary technology in the tight economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've seen steady pre-order sales on Windows 8 devices from early adopters," said Merle McIntosh, senior vice president of product management at online electronics retailer Newegg. "However, we expect that most average consumers are waiting until after launch to make a purchase decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering several versions of the new system. The basic Windows 8, the full Windows 8 Pro and Windows 8 Enterprise for large organizations will all run on the traditional PCs, laptops and new tablets using Intel Corp chips. Windows RT is a new version of Windows that will be pre-installed on its Surface tablet and other devices using low-power chips designed by ARM Holdings Plc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the end of January, users running Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 can download an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro for $40.

&lt;p&gt;* Inflation, financial system focus of policy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Says while NZ$ high, intervention to cap it would not work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Approach seen signalling no major changes

 (Updates with details, market reaction)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Naomi Tajitsu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WELLINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of New
Zealand is focused on keeping inflation in check and the
financial system healthy, prerequisites for a stronger economy,
the central bank's new governor said on Friday as he doused
expectations of measures to lower the currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graeme Wheeler made the comments in his first public speech
as governor, a day after the central bank held the official cash
rate (OCR) at a record-low 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Price stability and financial stability remain the Reserve
Bank's central objectives for monetary policy and prudential
policy," said Wheeler, who took over from Alan Bollard at the
end of last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our economy is growing at an annual rate of around 2
percent and the Reserve Bank has scope to lower interest rates
if needed," he said, but added it was not the role of monetary
policy to target growth rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst said the speech showed there would not be any
major surprises from a Wheeler-led central bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is not going to revamp the monetary policy framework or
introduce quantitative easing and declare a futile war on the
exchange rate," ANZ senior economist Mark Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheeler said the economy would benefit from a lower exchange
rate if it could be achieved without compromising other policy
goals, and so while lower interest rates might initially push
down the currency there was unlikely to be a sustained impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we reduced the OCR without sound reasons, the exchange
rate might drop initially but rise later when the inflationary
implications of the rate cut became clear," Wheeler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand dollar has gained around 10 percent
since hitting its low point for the year in early June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLEAR CRITERIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RBNZ had clear criteria for currency intervention,
including whether it would work, whether the currency was
exceptionally high, and whether the market conditions were right
-- and Wheeler indicated those conditions had not been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes little sense to risk incurring losses to taxpayers
by intervening when currency flows supporting the New Zealand
dollar are particularly strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheeler also dismissed the practicality of capital controls,
saying they would damage the credibility and stability of the
financial sector, and increase the real cost of capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kiwi dollar fell nearly half a cent to a low of $0.8159
after the comments, before settling back around $0.8190.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheeler said his policy agreement with the government had
reinforced the importance of controlling inflation, in
particular aiming for the mid-point of the 1-3 percent target
band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time, attaining this outcome should help to anchor
inflation expectations around the mid-point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted the central bank also had macro-prudential tools,
such as core funding ratios, capital buffers, sectoral risk
weights, and housing loan-to-value ratio limits, to deal with 
any inflation bubbles that developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantitative easing of the sort undertaken in the United
States, Europe, and Japan were not needed in New Zealand, he
said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp put its Surface tablet center stage at its Windows 8 launch event, hoping the sleek new device will spark a fightback against Apple Inc and Google Inc in the exploding mobile computing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With interest in traditional computers waning, the world's largest software company is attempting to reinvent the Windows PC in a new format and directly challenge Apple's all-conquering iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One person called it historic, unique," said Steven Sinofsky, head of Microsoft's Windows unit and the driving force behind Windows 8, who opened the launch event in New York in front about 1,000 media and PC industry partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's twice the amount of storage as a competing tablet for the same price," Sinofsky said, comparing the entry level 32 GB Surface with the cheapest 16 GB model of Apple's latest full-sized iPad, which both cost $499.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky and his team showed off a range of devices running Windows 8 from PC makers such as Lenovo Group Ltd and Acer Inc, but devoted most of their energy to the second half of the presentation and the Surface tablet, the first computer Microsoft has made itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panos Panay, head of the Surface project, demonstrated the tablet's features, beaming video and music to other screens, showing off the ultra-thin cover that doubles as a keyboard, and hooking up a camera to the device's USB port. He even dropped the device on the floor to demonstrate its durability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft stressed that the Surface, featuring a pre-installed version of Office, is not just for entertainment but also for work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device has generated a lot of curiosity, but so far has not garnered rave reviews and users seem unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really a new class of device that sees the tablet and PC experiences merging into a single device instead of discrete ones," said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner, who attended the launch.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co's (PG.N) profit rose more than expected, indicating that the world's largest household products company is making progress in cutting costs and giving Chief Executive Bob McDonald a little relief after months of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of P, the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, rose to their highest level in four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, shares of rival Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) slid as much as 3.3 percent after it announced plans to cut jobs as it strives to operate more nimbly as economies slow in many countries. Colgate's quarterly profit matched expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P is cutting $10 billion of costs and focusing on key markets, products and countries. The company's goals as well as McDonald, who is also chairman, have been under intense scrutiny since activist investor William Ackman bought shares this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They cleared a low hurdle," said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. "The fact that they did report solid results is a plus, but I don't know if the pressure is necessarily off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P had given a quarterly forecast in August that was below Wall Street's view at the time, leading analysts to lower their expectations.

Its sales grew 7 percent in China, but that was below China's household-products market growth of 11 percent. China is P's second-largest market in terms of sales and profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P still expects to post core earnings per share of $3.80 to $4 this fiscal year.

 (Adds details from Colgate, analyst comment, updates stock
activity)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jessica Wohl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 25 (Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co's profit rose
more than expected, indicating that the world's largest
household products company is making progress in cutting costs
and giving Chief Executive Bob McDonald a little relief after
months of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of P, the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette
razors, rose to their highest level in four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, shares of rival Colgate-Palmolive Co slid
as much as 3.3 percent after it announced plans to cut jobs as
it strives to operate more nimbly as economies slow in many
countries. Colgate's quarterly profit matched expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P is cutting $10 billion of costs and focusing on key
markets, products and countries. The company's goals as well as
McDonald, who is also chairman, have been under intense scrutiny
since activist investor William Ackman bought shares this
summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They cleared a low hurdle," said Morningstar analyst Erin
Lash. "The fact that they did report solid results is a plus,
but I don't know if the pressure is necessarily off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P had given a quarterly forecast in August that was below
Wall Street's view at the time, leading analysts to lower their
expectations. P ultimately beat the initial analyst
expectations, helped by sales that met the high end of its
forecast and some relief in commodity costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of P rose as much as 4 percent to $70.83 on
Thursday, their highest level since October 2008. The shares
were up 3 percent at $70.11 by midafternoon. Colgate's shares
were down 1.9 percent at $104.49 in the afternoon, off an
earlier low at $103.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wouldn't surprise me if we're seeing some people saying

Colgate's outperformance year to date," said JP Morgan analyst
John Faucher, who has a "neutral" rating on Colgate and an
"overweight" rating on P&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several consumer goods makers are trimming jobs, including
P, as concerned consumers hold off on some purchases and
growth slows in major markets such as China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P is on track to cut 4,200 jobs by the end of October on
its way to eliminating 5,700 jobs by the end of its fiscal year.
Colgate's plans, including moving away from single-country units
toward regional hubs, should lead the toothpaste maker to trim
about 2,300 jobs, or roughly 6 percent of its workforce, by the

year that began in September, in part because it plans to ramp
up marketing support behind new products being introduced later
in the year, and because it has to spend more to obtain an
absorbent material for Pampers diapers, its largest brand,
following a plant explosion in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P earned $1.06 per share in the fiscal first quarter on a

accounting for more than $10 billion in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nippon Shokubai is one of the world's biggest makers of

is used in diapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P has found other sources of the material and while any
impact to consumers should be "minor," it has to spend more
obtain the supplies it needs, said Chief Financial Officer Jon
Moeller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies diapers, said on
Wednesday it was not affected by the explosion since Nippon
Shokubai was not its supplier.

      Research and Markets: Home Networks Newsletter 2012 Provides Coverage of 
      This Fast Evolving Market with Players such as Intel, 3Com and Microsoft

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/32zhh2/home_networks) 
      has announced the addition of the "Home 
      Networks Newsletter" subscription to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The market for home networks is about to take off, driven by the 15 
      million homes with two or more PCs requiring interconnection. Sensing 
      the potential opportunity, large players like IBM, Lucent, Intel, 3Com, 
      Microsoft and Compaq to name only a few have formed Home Networking 
      business units poised to pursue multiple approaches to home networking. 
      This newsletter will provide coverage of this fast evolving market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Home networking has not grown in the last decade as expected even though 
      standards exist. These standards are for low-speed wiring and protocols 
      that do not meet the future demands of the digital age. Groups like 
      VESA, 1394, Home Phoneline Alliance and the Home Wireless Alliance are 
      only a few groups that have announced plans to develop standards to fill 
      this need.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Top Mexican broadcaster Televisa's joint mobile telephone venture with Grupo Salinas will require $800 million in investments in the coming three years, Televisa's executive vice president said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell could either issue debt or Televisa and Grupo Salinas could split the investment evenly, executive vice president Alfonso de Angoitia said on a conference call with investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We estimate Iusacell will have additional capital needs of approximately 800 million dollars in total within the next 3 years.

&lt;p&gt;* Windows 8, Surface tablet on sale at midnight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* CEO Ballmer sees Windows 8 recasting PC industry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Windows 7 has sold 670 mln licenses-exec&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nicola Leske&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
launched its new Windows 8 operating system and Surface tablet
on Thursday in a bid to revive interest in its flagship product
and regain ground lost to Apple Inc and Google Inc
 in mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've reimagined Windows and we've reimagined the whole PC
industry," Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told Reuters
Television early Thursday ahead of the launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 devices and the company's new Surface tablet,
which aims to challenge Apple's popular iPad head on, go on sale
at midnight on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky, head of Microsoft's Windows unit and the
driving force behind Windows 8, opened the launch event in New
York in front about 1,000 media and PC industry partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He showed off Windows 8's new look, but stressed that the
system was built upon the base of Windows 7, Microsoft's
best-selling software that recently passed 670 million license
sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new design of Windows, which dispenses with the Start
button and features square tiles for apps, may surprise some
users. Initial demand appeared solid, but customers were wary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reviews of the Surface tablet were mixed, with praise
for its slick hardware, but concerns about battery life and
limited software and applications available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've seen steady pre-order sales on Windows 8 devices from
early adopters," said Merle McIntosh, senior vice president of
product management at online electronics retailer Newegg.
"However, we expect that most average consumers are waiting
until after launch to make a purchase decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors were uncertain about the prospects for success of
Windows 8, but many feel a solid launch could help Microsoft's
stock, which has languished between $20 and $30 for much of the
last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's shares have significantly outperformed Microsoft's
over the past 10 years, and its market value is now more than
double Microsoft's. Microsoft was little changed at $27.87;
Apple fell 0.7 percent at $612.73.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This really is about debunking the notion that Microsoft is
a dinosaur and they are relevant in a new climate of tablets and
mobile," said Todd Lowenstein, portfolio manager at HighMark
Capital Management, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Extreme pessimism and almost utter failure is priced into
the shares, so any kind of positive delivery on units, customer
perception, would be really beneficial to the stock."&lt;/p&gt;

			JPMorgan Chase Announces More Than 4,500 Veterans Hired at Firm; 82 
      Companies Now Part of the 100,000 Jobs Mission
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase announced today it has hired more than 4,500 veterans 
      since 2011. The firm attributes its early success to the momentum gained 
      through the 100,000 Jobs Mission, internal training programs on veteran 
      employment and a recruiting effort dedicated to hiring transitioning 
      servicemembers and veterans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase and ten other companies launched the 100,000 Jobs Mission 
      in early 2011 with a commitment to collectively hire at least 100,000 
      veterans by 2020. Since then, the grassroots coalition of private sector 
      companies has grown from eleven employers to eighty-two who have 
      collectively hired 28,186 veterans through September 30, 2012. The 
      100,000 Jobs Mission continues to grow by adding like-minded companies 
      that are committed to hiring the nation&#8217;s veterans and reducing veteran 
      unemployment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Speaking to the early success of the program, Frank Bisignano, JPMorgan 
      Chase Chief Operating Officer and Mortgage Banking CEO said, &#8220;To have 
      achieved more than a quarter of our goal in less than two years is a 
      testament both to the commitment of the coalition and to the quality and 
      drive of our returning service men and women. But we remain focused on 
      our goal. The number of unemployed veterans remains high, and more 
      businesses need to recognize the tremendous talent, intellect and skill 
      our servicemen and women can bring to their organizations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase also established a centralized Military Recruiting Team 
      that has assisted in hiring more than 4,500 veterans at the firm since 
      2011 &#8211; at a rate of about ten veterans a day. Thirteen out of fifteen 
      recruiters on the team are former military, or are still in the Guard or 
      Reserves, helping to remove the obstacle servicemembers face in 
      translating military skills into corporate jobs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Training Programs Facilitate Transition from Military to Corporate 
      Culture
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While military experience develops many skills necessary to succeed in 
      the private sector including leadership, a team-oriented attitude and 
      strong work ethic, JPMorgan Chase has established several training 
      programs to grow the next generation of leaders for the firm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier this month, Chase launched an innovative Branch Manager Training 
      Program for military veterans. Chase will recruit, hire and train twenty 
      veterans to be branch managers in New York, Dallas, Columbus and Tampa. 
      The candidates will train in a twelve-month program focused on 
      developing branch banking skills that complement the candidates&#8217; 
      existing skills gained in the military. The program combines classroom, 
      online and on-the-job instruction. Once the training is successfully 
      completed, the candidates will be branch managers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase also developed Body Armor to Business Suits, an 
      internal training program designed to help new military-experienced 
      employees assimilate into the firm. Another internal training program, Military 
      101, helps hiring managers and other non-military-experienced 
      employees better understand veterans&#8217; backgrounds and the experiences 
      they bring to the workplace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Maureen Casey, Managing Director of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Office of Military 
      and Veterans Affairs commented, &#8220;Veteran employment is a major 
      initiative for the firm. Our collective efforts are not simply about 
      helping veterans find jobs but also providing them with the skills and 
      support they need to excel in their new roles and make their transition 
      from the military to the private sector seamless. Long-term success 
      requires that we put as much effort into assimilating and retaining 
      veterans as we do on recruiting and hiring them.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Employment Partnerships
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the 100,000 Jobs Mission, JPMorgan Chase also partnered 
      with Syracuse University to establish the Institute for Veterans and 
      Military Families (IVMF) in June 2011. IVMF is the first national center 
      in higher education focused on the social, economic, education and 
      policy issues impacting veterans and their families post-service. Since 
      the Institute&#8217;s launch, IVMF has issued monthly reports documenting the 
      change in the employment situation of America&#8217;s veterans; they have 
      published two major publications on veteran employment including The 
      Business Case for Hiring a Veteran: Beyond the Clich&#233;s and Guide 
      to Leading Policies, Practices  Resources: Supporting the Employment of 
      Veterans and Military Families; they have released 32 research 
      briefs on employment, education, wellness and family; and its newest 
      offering, &#8220;Operation Boots to Business: From Service to Startup,&#8221; is a 
      three-phase training program offered in cooperation with the U.S. Small 
      Business Administration to train transitioning servicemembers on 
      business ownership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			J.P. Morgan Expands Global Reach Through New Products, Services and 
      Client Mandates Announced at Sibos 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			J.P. Morgan clients benefit from firm&#8217;s global footprint, regulatory 
      understanding and culture of innovation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan today announced a series of new products, services and 
      client mandates designed to capitalize on the firm&#8217;s global footprint, 
      understanding of changing regulatory environments and innovative 
      approach to issues affecting financial institutions. These announcements 
      are being released in conjunction with Sibos 2012, held in Osaka, Japan 
      from October 29 to November 2, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our commitment to our clients, combined with the array of services we 
      can deliver to financial institutions regardless of region, has made 
      J.P. Morgan a natural choice for their treasury needs,&#8221; said Don McCree, 
      head of Treasury Services for J.P. Morgan. &#8220;We are consistently 
      developing new solutions that our clients can use to streamline their 
      business and respond to a changing regulatory and technological 
      landscape. Our team has the deep understanding of global markets to help 
      financial institutions navigate this environment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The evolving global regulatory situation presents a host of challenges 
      for financial institutions that must comply with changing collateral and 
      custody requirements,&#8221; said Dinkar Jetley, J.P. Morgan&#8217;s head of 
      Worldwide Securities Services. &#8220;As these requirements affect more and 
      more financial institutions in all regions, a firm with a global 
      footprint is the best partner in helping to understand and comply with 
      the rules. J.P. Morgan is a global bank recognized for its expertise, 
      and we will continue to provide counsel and offer the products and 
      services that our clients, and financial institutions generally require.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan remains at the forefront of developing solutions for 
      financial institutions that require best-in-class products for their 
      cash, liquidity, trade, clearing and custodial needs. For instance, the 
      firm&#8217;s Treasury Services business has emphasized technological 
      innovation through upgrades and expansion of its J.P. Morgan ACCESS&#174; and 
      MorganDirect Commercial platforms. Worldwide Securities Services has 
      developed products that help institutions manage their market risk 
      through derivatives collateral management and tri-party collateral 
      management&#8212;two areas that are seeing increased regulatory and market 
      focus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increasingly cross-border nature of the industry requires products 
      and services that help financial institutions efficiently and cleanly 
      handle complex cash management needs. J.P. Morgan is addressing this 
      evolution through enhancements to its robust product suite, including 
      U.S. Dollar clearing, cross-currency payments, unitized time deposits 
      and direct custody and clearing. Additional details on each of these are 
      available below.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IBM Rational Rhapsody and LDRA tool suite streamline model to 
      verification process
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Intelligent integration offers UML/SysML modelers immediate access to 
      code review, test generation and unit testing capabilities of LDRA tool 
      suite
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LDRA, 
      the leading provider of automated software verification, source code 
      analysis and test tools, has fully integrated the LDRA tool suite&#174; 
      with IBM&#174; Rational&#174; Rhapsody&#174; ensuring 
      a seamless workflow from model-driven development to test and 
      verification. IBM 
      Rational Rhapsody, a UML-based modeling and code-generation tool, 
      speeds the design of complex systems that often must meet industry 
      certification standards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Thanks to this integration, developers can easily and efficiently access 
      the LDRA tool suite from within the Rhapsody platform to ensure that 
      their generated code complies with industry standards, follows 
      best-practice programming guidelines and is fully tested. The LDRA tool 
      suite intelligently obtains information from the model and automates the 
      development and configuration of the potentially complex test harness. 
      Freed from this labor-intensive and typically error-prone process, the 
      developer can concentrate on the analysis and testing of the application.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LDRA 
      Tool Suite Tests from within Rhapsody Process
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the power of the LDRA tool suite fully accessible through the 
      Rhapsody model-driven development process, developers can select the 
      section of code they are working on, quickly perform code review and 
      gain immediate insight into the quality of their code. The ability to 
      review call graphs, flow graphs or metrics such as code complexity can 
      be done for each class without leaving the Rhapsody environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In 
      creating the test harness, the LDRA tool suite uses information from 
      the Rhapsody model to intelligently configure the test harness, and 
      automatically creates appropriate test stubs, depending on the level of 
      verification required. For rigorous certification requirements that 
      require proof that any and all possible options within the application 
      code are fully tested, Rhapsody developers can use TBeXtreme, 
      an LDRA tool suite component that automatically creates test cases that 
      can prove all code has been fully tested and complete code coverage 
      obtained.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Manage 
      Verification of Model-Driven Development
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Avionics systems with their leap from eight percent software in the 
      1960s to eighty percent in this decade reflect an industry norm,&#8221; noted 
      Ian Hennell, LDRA Operations Director. &#8220;To cope with this steep increase 
      in the amount of software while also striving for certification, 
      improved software quality and shorter time to market, many companies are 
      adopting model-driven development to abstract away the complexities of 
      the applications. By tying those models into an automated test process, 
      companies accelerate the path to improved code quality as typically 
      error-prone manual processes are replaced with automated and independent 
      verification activities, ensuring that the code performs correctly and 
      as specified.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complete 
      integration of the LDRA tool suite and IBM Rational Rhapsody enables 
      developers and project managers to perform code review, quality review 
      and dynamic analysis on the whole model as well as to regress any unit 
      tests. Although an interactive execution session may be appropriate on 
      smaller projects, large project verification activities can be 
      controlled via batch files, saving a significant amount of time and 
      ensuring that project managers can more easily delve into and assess 
      project progress while identifying and correcting any problems at the 
      model level.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The LDRA tool suite plug-in is currently available for the Windows 
      platform, with a Linux version planned for a future release.

&lt;p&gt;OSLO (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Chevron (CVX.N) plans to look for shale gas in Lithuania after buying a stake in a local oil company, the prime minister said on Thursday, showing the country hopes to follow neighbor Poland in seeking new supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has set energy independence from Russia, its sole gas supplier, as a key goal.

" ... in the coming months, this company will commence exploration activities in Lithuania on behalf of its owners," the company added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has an option to buy the remaining shares in the company, previously 50 percent owned by Danish company Jylland Olie and 50 percent by a local businessman, the newspaper said.

      CCE achieved third-quarter volume growth of &#189; percent. This reflects 
      improved weather trends in August and September, offset by the impact of 
      the French excise tax increase and ongoing challenging macroeconomic 
      conditions. A key factor in these results was a low single-digit decline 
      in sparkling beverages, including declines in regular Coca-Cola, 
      partially offset by double-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero, a modest 
      increase in sparkling flavored beverages, and double-digit growth in 
      energy drinks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, we achieved solid growth in still beverages, including 
      Capri Sun juice drinks, tea, and Schweppes Abbey Well and Chaudfontaine 
      waters. Reformulated Nestea increased more than 30 percent. On a 
      territory basis, total volume in Great Britain grew &#189; percent, while 
      volume in continental Europe (including Norway and Sweden) was 
      essentially flat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the third quarter, net pricing per case grew 4&#189; percent and cost of 
      sales per case grew 5&#189; percent, both including the impact of the French 
      excise tax increase. Excluding the impact of the French excise tax 
      increase, net pricing per case increased 2&#189; percent, and cost of sales 
      per case increased 2 percent. Operating expenses increased 4 percent 
      driven by timing and planned marketplace initiatives, including the 2012 
      London Olympic Games. These figures are comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Despite difficult operating conditions, we believe the third quarter 
      was an important success as CCE employees responded in an exceptional 
      way to the significant opportunities and demands of the 2012 London 
      Olympic and Paralympic Games,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, executive vice 
      president and president, European Group. &#8220;We will build on the long-term 
      benefits of our involvement with the Games while working diligently to 
      enhance efficiency and maximize effectiveness in ways that sustain 
      customer service and drive value for customers, consumers, and our 
      shareowners.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SHARE REPURCHASE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter, CCE repurchased $225 million of its shares, 
      bringing the total year to date repurchases to $600 million under a $1 
      billion share repurchase program that was announced in September 2011 
      and began in January 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This program allows for total repurchases of $1 billion, and as 
      previously disclosed, is capped at a cumulative total of 65 million 
      shares, including the prior repurchase program completed in 2011. As of 
      the end of the third quarter, CCE has repurchased just over 59 million 
      shares and now expects to repurchase the remaining shares planned under 
      the 65 million share cap by the end of 2012. CCE is also reviewing 
      options for future share repurchase plans and will provide an update 
      later this year. Share repurchase plans may be adjusted depending on 
      economic, operating, or other factors, including acquisition 
      opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FULL-YEAR 2012 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2012, CCE now expects comparable earnings per diluted share in a 
      range of $2.20 to $2.24, including the negative impact of currency 
      translation. Based on recent rates, currency translation would decrease 
      comparable full-year earnings per diluted share approximately 8 percent 
      relative to prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both net sales and operating income for 2012 are now expected to grow in 
      a low to mid-single-digit range. This revision is primarily driven by 
      customer and marketplace conditions in France due in part to the French 
      excise tax increase, an increased competitive landscape in Great 
      Britain, and the impact of ongoing challenging macroeconomic conditions. 
      Our outlook for earnings per diluted share, net sales, and operating 
      income includes the impact of the French excise tax increase and is 
      comparable. Net sales and operating income guidance is also currency 
      neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on recent currency rates, the company continues to expect 2012 
      free cash flow in a range of $475 million to $500 million, with capital 
      expenditures in a range of $375 million to $400 million. Weighted 
      average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the 
      effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be in a range of 26 percent 
      to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE has announced a program to support new operating business 
      initiatives that will improve our platform for long-term, sustainable 
      growth as we manage through continued marketplace challenges. This 
      program, which is subject to consultations with workers&#8217; councils, 
      includes initiatives to restructure portions of our finance back-office 
      functions and new initiatives to restructure portions of our 
      go-to-market model.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subject to the consultations with workers&#8217; councils, we anticipate this 
      program to be completed by the end of 2014 and to include non-recurring 
      restructuring charges of approximately $200 million. This program is 
      designed to increase the effectiveness of our sales teams, improve 
      operational efficiency, generate approximately $100 million in ongoing 
      benefits by 2015, allow us to continue to invest in our business, and 
      improve our platform for long-term, sustainable growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Trends and Consumption Demographics in Soft 
      and Hot Drinks Featuring Coca-Cola, Danone and Costa Coffee
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/89tbvv/global_trends_and) 
      has announced the addition of Canadean Ltd's new report "Global Trends 
      and Consumption Demographics in Soft and Hot Drinks" to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report offers a completely fresh look at consumer's Soft and Hot 
      Drink habits, allowing marketers to understand people's consumption 
      patterns like never before. This offers unique opportunities to 
      effectively target new consumer groups, behaviors, and trends based on 
      actual empirical data in Soft and Hot Drinks consumption across 10 core 
      countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report looks to test the stereotypes about beverage and consumption 
      perceptions that the industry may have. The report illustrates that an 
      in-depth study of the consumer exposes the trends to exploit and the 
      anomalies to address. Only by looking at who is drinking, what they are 
      drinking, when they are drinking, where they are drinking, and why they 
      are drinking, can you put together the best marketing strategy to 
      capitalize on the opportunities that exist in the Soft and Hot Drinks 
      sectors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is an assumption that Soft Drinks are drunk by the young and as 
      consumers mature they drink more Hot Drinks. Many believe that there is 
      a shift from Soft to Alcoholic drinks when consumers reach the legal age 
      to drink. In fact, Older Consumers are a key age group to target in both 
      Soft and Hot Drinks, particularly in the Non-BRIC region where aging 
      populations limit volumes with younger consumers. Marketers risk 
      underestimating the irresistible forces of demography.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The high growth rates seen in the developing world are an obvious 
      attraction to beverage operators, but adding value to refreshment 
      products in the developed world where growth rates are more sluggish 
      provides just as appealing an opportunity. BRIC markets are often 
      characterized by low margins and while Non-BRIC markets may be slowing, 
      the affluence of drinkers provides them with the resources to pay more 
      for their refreshment, despite the depressed economic climate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although often categorized together, consumers in each of the BRIC 
      markets have very different tastes and characteristics; low per capita 
      beverage consumption is probably the main factor that they have in 
      common. For instance, Brazil is the most developed beverage market 
      within BRIC and has consumer consumption patterns more closely aligned 
      to the Non-BRIC region than anywhere else.

&lt;p&gt;OSLO Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Chevron 
plans to look for shale gas in Lithuania after buying a stake in
a local oil company that holds a prospecting license, business
daily Verslo Zinios reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Global Energy bought 50 percent of
Lithuania-registered oil company LL Investicijos, which holds a
license to prospect for oil and gas at the 2,400 square
kilometre Rietavas field, Verslo Zinios said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithuania Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius confirmed the
investment and said, "Chevron is such a company that is not
afraid to step into Gazprom's field (of influence)," the paper
reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian gas group Gazprom is the sole gas supplier
to the ex-Soviet Baltic state, now a member of the European
Union and NATO, which has no alternative gas import routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has an option to buy the remaining shares in the
Lithuanian company, previously 50 percent owned by Danish
company Jylland Olie and 50 percent by a local businessman, the
paper said. It did specify which of the two owners has sold
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Chevron and LL Investicijos could not
immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company also plans to take part in a tender to
acquire licenses in two new fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government called a tender in June for shale gas
exploration in a move to cut its energy
dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baltic country consumed 3.4 bcm of gas in 2011, all of
which was imported from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Yereth Rosen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska Oct 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp
 on Friday received a major federal permit it needed to
start construction on the Point Thomson oil and gas field on the
eastern North Slope of Alaska, officials said, after an extended
delay that threatened some leases there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granted Exxon a
wetlands-fill permit for construction of drill pads, roads, an
airstrip, pipeline, and docking and other facilities needed for
production at the long-languishing field - production the state
of Alaska has accused the company of dragging its heels on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Army Corps permit followed a detailed environmental
impact study that began in 2009. While there remain a few
outstanding state permits, the wetlands-fill authorization was
the major approval needed for construction, said Mike Holley,
northern branch team leader for the state's Army Corps district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holley said Exxon, backed by partners BP Plc and
ConocoPhillips, hopes to begin construction soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are planning on doing as much of the construction this
winter as possible," he said, adding that ice roads, which are
built by spraying water on the tundra, would accommodate that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production was expected to be about 10,000 barrels per day
of liquids, starting in the winter of 2015-2016, Exxon
spokeswoman Kim Jordan said in an email - timing that would be a
year later than once expected. Jordan declined to comment on
when construction would start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point Thomson has been the subject of long-running dispute
between the state of Alaska and the oil companies. The state
contended the companies were improperly delaying development at
the field, where leases date back to the 1960s. The state began
procedures to revoke the leases so they could be re-auctioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I applaud both Exxon and the Army Corps for staying at the
table and working out this permit," Senator Mark Begich, an
Alaska Democrat, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field holds an estimated 8 trillion to 9 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas and hundreds of millions of barrels of oil
and natural-gas condensates, state officials say. Exxon and its
partners argued development was challenged by extraordinary
high-pressure conditions in the reservoir, among other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, the state reached a comprehensive settlement with
Exxon and its partners. Prior partial settlements resulted in
new exploration drilling and plans for production of liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies had targeted a 2014 start, but the
environmental impact study process took longer than expected,
Holley said. It took a long time for the Army Corps to select
action alternatives, and once the draft EIS was issued, there
was more reaction than expected, he said, citing about 1,600
requests for modifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is in an area important to polar bears and to
local Inupiat Eskimo hunters. Holley said many commenters sought
to avoid conflicts with subsistence food-gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 26 (IFR) - JP Morgan is holding the trump cards to lead
a multi-billion dollar financing package for Chilean retailer
Cencosud after it put down US$2.5bn to help the company finance
the acquisition of the Colombian unit of Carrefour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the US bank has been mandated on the
equity follow-on - and other banks are now vying for ancillary
business as JP Morgan approaches institutions to participate in
the syndication of the 18-month bridge to bond and equity
take-out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond offering will be presented to the board of
directors in the next 90 days, with a size of about US$1bn,
while the roughly US$1.5bn capital raising will be put before
the board in the next 120 days. Both will be used to assist in
the improvement of the company's capital structure and debt
repayment schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Moody's and Fitch placed their Baa3 and BBB- ratings on
negative watch as leverage increases in the wake of the
acquisition. The bridge take-outs, particularly the equity
offering, will be key in appeasing the rating agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company is expected to raise equity to fund a portion
of the acquisition. The equity raised will have to be
substantial to avoid a downgrade," Fitch noted on October 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cencosud's pro forma total adjusted debt-to-Ebitdar
ratio will increase to around 5.5 times following the
acquisition versus a consolidated total adjusted debt-to-Ebitdar
of 4.8 times at the end of June, Fitch estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This company is a mega-conglomerate across not only Chile,
but Brazil, Argentina, Peru and now deeper into Colombia," said
an ECM banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't imagine its ratings or stock will suffer because of
this acquisition. It's strategic - and straight out of a
corporate finance textbook in how it's financing its growth
strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cencosud came to the market on June 21 with a follow-on
offering of US$546.4m, its ADR (American depositary receipt)
debut and part of a US$1.3bn global capital increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS were joint
bookrunners on the trade, along with BBVA and Santander. The
retailer went public with a US$327m IPO in March 2004. Its
shares fell 6.2% the day after the acquisition announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cencosud's operations include 726 supermarkets, 81 home
improvement stores, 74 department stores and 25 shopping
centers. Meanwhile, Carrefour has more than 100 stores,
including supermarkets and convenience stores, in Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a play on the growing middle class in the
country," said an equity trader in Bogota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More M activity is expected next year, not only in retail,
but in financial institutions as well, according to ECM bankers.
Chilean bank Corpbanca made public its acquisition of
Colombia's Helm Bank for US$1.28bn in early October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other related fixed-income quotations, stories and

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ll56xd/successes_and) 
      has announced the addition of the "Successes 
      and Failures Case Study: Discover your Coca-Cola Zero Campaign" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Discover your Coca-Cola Zero Campaign is part of Datamonitor Consumer's 
      Successes and Failures series. These case studies examine best-in-class 
      examples of innovation and marketing - supported by Datamonitor's 
      consumer insight - to drive success.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Effective innovation is difficult to come by, but it is the key to 
      sustained competitive advantage in the consumer packaged goods industry. 
      Lessons can be learned from both successes and failures. This case study 
      looks at how Coca-Cola has reinvigorated the Coke Zero brand in Brazil 
      by tapping into the appeal of customization benefits to re-engage with 
      young adult consumers in the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Scope
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Access comprehensive analysis of global successes and failures in the 
      consumer packaged goods industry to drive ideation and inspiration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Obtain country-specific consumer insight to understand the consumer 
      attitudes and needs that underpinned innovation success/failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Avoid costly investments by learning important lessons from companies 
      and brands that have failed or under-delivered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Obtain a broader appreciation of the consumer packaged goods industry 
      by gaining insights from both within and outside of your category.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Around 80% of new product innovation fails, highlighting the challenge 
      that industry players face in innovating in today's competitive market 
      landscape. Failed innovation can severely undermine profits and brand 
      reputations. Conversely, the rewards for successful innovation are 
      substantial.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Datamonitor is constantly monitoring the big winners and losers in the 
      consumer packaged goods industry. This case study looks at the example 
      of the Discover your Coca-Cola Zero campaign in Brazil. The brand 
      capitalized on the importance of personalized communication to re-engage 
      with young adult consumers.

    The consistent delivery of accurate analyses relies solely on two
factors, namely: market awareness and industry insight. Recent market
drivers include a rise in new home sales to 5.7% in September to an
annualized pace of 389,000 units, slightly stronger than market
expectations for an increase to 385,000, recent confirmation of continued
monetary stimulus and an unchanged FOMC policy and recent moderation of
existing home sales in the US to 4.75 million annualized units in
September 2012 from 4.83 million reported in the previous month. When it
comes to discovering the right edge at the right time, all these factors
play into effect. For a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind
these events and how it can affect your portfolio, please refer to our

			Coca-Cola Announces US$300 Million Investment 
      for Strong and Sustainable Growth in Vietnam
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Infrastructure, Jobs, Partnerships, Brand Building, 
      Sustainability Programs Underline Vietnam Commitment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company today announced a new system investment of US$300 
      million over the next three years in Vietnam to further capture growth 
      opportunities in one of the world&#8217;s major emerging consumer markets. The 
      stepped-up investment, commencing in 2013, will bring to US$500 million 
      the total investment that The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling 
      partners have committed to Vietnam from 2010 through 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Vietnam is an important growth market in Asia Pacific as we work to 
      achieve our 2020 Vision goal of doubling system revenues this decade,&#8221; 
      said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company, during a 
      visit to Hanoi. &#8220;Vietnam&#8217;s economy has maintained healthy growth in 
      recent years and this new financial commitment is more than an 
      investment in Coca-Cola&#8217;s expansion in Vietnam, it is also an important 
      acknowledgement of our belief in the long-term potential of this key 
      market. Our continued investments in Vietnam underscore our commitment 
      to building new infrastructure to support strong and sustainable growth, 
      applying world-class marketing practices, creating new jobs, developing 
      local talent, developing stronger partnerships with our local customers 
      and investing heavily in the thousands of communities across Vietnam we 
      proudly serve.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through investments completed during the last three years, the Coca-Cola 
      Vietnam system has increased local manufacturing and distribution 
      capacity with new filling lines and the installation of new cold-drink 
      coolers with local customers, helping local businesses boost beverage 
      sales. The Company&#8217;s most popular beverages in Vietnam include sparkling 
      brands Coca-Cola, Coke Light, Fanta and Sprite, and still brands Minute 
      Maid Teppy, Minute Maid Nutriboost, Samurai, Real Leaf and Dasani.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The system also directly created 500 new jobs locally in Vietnam, with 
      99 percent of its total labor force filled by local Vietnamese 
      employees. These direct jobs then generated an estimated additional 
      5,000 job opportunities in supporting industries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola also has continued to invest heavily in building sustainable 
      communities in Vietnam with approximately US$1.5 million dedicated to 
      local projects since 2010. These projects have included watershed 
      conservation in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), specific 
      disaster relief programs in conjunction with Red Cross Vietnam and 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s &#8220;Clean Water for Community&#8221; initiative alongside UN-Habitat 
      and CEFACOM, which has provided 10,000 Vietnam residents with access to 
      clean water in 2012 alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are committed to integrating sustainability into everything we do,&#8221; 
      said Basil Sidky, Indochina General Manager of Coca-Cola Southeast Asia. 
      &#8220;It is our way of contributing to a more sustainable community, 
      fostering innovation across our business and creating shared value for 
      everyone we touch. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re passionate about and committed 
      to for the long-haul in Vietnam.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian prosecutors are investigating the murder of a British oil executive who was shot and killed in unexplained circumstances in front of his wife as they walked to their car after dinner at an Italian restaurant in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Mockford, who worked for U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil, was shot on October 14 after an evening meal, but prosecutors declined to say if they were investigating the case as a possible contract killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who lived opposite where the couple had parked their car told Reuters she had heard three shots and then called the police. When she went out to investigate, she recognized Mockford's wife as a customer of her husband's hairdresser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was clearly shocked and she said that they had demanded money, money, car, car. Those were the words she heard. One would imagine it was a car-jacking," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police initially suspected Mockford had been killed in a failed car hijacking, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters, though the couple's Lexus sports utility vehicle had not been taken after the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcello Minacapelli, the owner of the Italian restaurant, said the couple, who were not regulars, had left at about 10 p.m. on the Sunday evening, but he had not seen the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brussels prosecutors said they were not prepared to comment further on the details or circumstances of the case until the perpetrators were caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mockford, 59, was a manager within the chemicals arm of ExxonMobil and had worked over a period of 38 years in Britain, Belgium and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Belgium confirmed he had worked as a department head at its office in Machelen, on the outskirts of Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course we are all shocked," a company spokesman said. "There is no indication that the incident was work-related."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one was willing to comment when Reuters called Mockford's family home in Grimbergen, an affluent town just north of the capital Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's Foreign Office confirmed that a British national had been killed and that it was providing consular assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop and Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Rex Merrifield and Giles Elgood)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  BIRMINGHAM, AL, Oct 26 (Marketwire) -- 
Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSE: WLT), the world's leading, publicly
traded "pure-play" producer of metallurgical (met) coal for the global
steel industry, today announced that it is anticipating a third quarter
non-cash goodwill impairment charge. 

    As a result of changes in the global outlook for met coal and recent
weakness in worldwide demand, the Company is performing an interim
goodwill impairment test based upon decreased equity market valuations.
Preliminary indications are that all or substantially all of the
Company's $1.1 billion of goodwill could be impaired and a corresponding
non-cash charge recognized in third quarter financial statements.

			UpToDate&#174; Unveils App for Microsoft Windows 8 Platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Platform Expansion Provides Clinicians with More Options for Mobile 
      Access
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Wolters 
      Kluwer Health, a leading global provider of information for 
      healthcare professionals and students, announced today that UpToDate, 
      part of Wolters Kluwer Health, unveiled an UpToDate App for the new 
      Windows 8 platform. As a featured app, UpToDate&#8217;s leading evidence-based 
      clinical decision support system is now even more widely available to 
      clinicians focused on improving patient care.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to a recent report by market research firm IDC, &#8220;Worldwide 
      Windows Client Operating Environment: 2011-2015 Forecast,&#8221; the Windows 
      platform is growing across both consumer and commercial segments. By 
      offering a featured UpToDate app on Windows 8, clinicians can download 
      the app directly from the Windows store onto their Windows 8 and Windows 
      RT devices, including the new Microsoft Surface tablet. All UpToDate 
      apps are optimized for tablet access, providing subscribers with the 
      latest evidence-based information and graded recommendations to diagnose 
      and treat patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The adoption of mobile applications among clinicians is on the rise. 
      Physicians in over 60 countries are currently using an UpToDate mobile 
      application, accounting for 25 percent of individual usage in the past 
      year alone. This is driven in part by the popularity of mobile apps 
      among medical students, as 40 percent of trainee individual usage is 
      delivered via an UpToDate mobile application. By expanding mobile 
      capabilities across platforms, UpToDate continues to deliver on its 
      mission of improving patient care, everywhere.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The UpToDate app for Windows 8 comes on the heels of favorable reviews 
      for both its iPhone and Android mobile apps. In a review of the recently 
      launched Android app, Dr. Michael Wong wrote on imedicalapps.com, 
      &#8220;Not too often do we come across an app that impacts patient care as 
      directly as Wolters Kluwer Health&#8217;s UpToDate.&#8221; He went on to say, 
      &#8220;Carrying significant weight and responsibility on its shoulders, 
      UpToDate is one among the very few on the Android system that has a 
      significant and influential role on the physicians and patient care.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;UpToDate has a very strong track record of developing and delivering 
      mobile apps that enable clinicians to make the right medical decisions 
      at the point of care, so it made sense for us to expand our mobile 
      offerings to the Windows 8 platform,&#8221; said Denise Basow, President, 
      UpToDate at Wolters Kluwer Health. &#8220;This additional app underscores our 
      commitment to offering clinicians the most current, authoritative and 
      easily accessible clinical information available on any clinical topic, 
      on any device.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. told employees
in an internal memo Sunday that the firm will be open for
business on Monday as Hurricane Sandy approaches, though only
employees "critical" to operations will be asked to get to
downtown Manhattan, and then only if they can do so safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman will have other employees working from Greenwich,
Connecticut, and Princeton, New Jersey, and many employees will
work from home as well, the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  EINDHOVEN, THE NETHERLANDS, Oct 29 (Marketwire) -- 
Today, NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI) announced that
Microsoft's(R) Windows Phone 8 operating system will integrate the
software stack of NXP's NFC controller, the PN544, enabling rich user
experiences and convenient interactions for mobile users. By being
pre-integrated and end-to-end validated by Microsoft, NXP's NFC
technology becomes the smart choice for handset manufacturers to deliver
NFC enabled smartphones based on Windows Phone 8 quickly to market. 

    As the worldwide leader in operating systems, Microsoft advances the NFC
ecosystem with its support of NXP solutions. Providing access to an open
source NFC implementation, OEMs can be assured that they will be
designing a working, advanced NFC solution that provides superb user
experiences. Multiple Microsoft OEM partners have already announced
Windows Phone 8 handsets with NFC, including HTC, Nokia and Samsung.

    Windows Phone 8 smartphones with NFC will be able to leverage a range of
exciting NFC applications that provide contactless convenience and
simplicity but also security for mobile transactions. Users can tap a tag
to check in at a restaurant, tap a smart poster to access links to a
website, or tap another NFC enabled device to share content such as a
picture or video. With a secure element, NFC also enables a virtual
wallet with credit cards, loyalty cards and coupons for mobile
transactions, plus solutions for mobile ticketing and access control,
where NXP has a proven leadership position in the smart card-based
Identification market. The integration of NFC into the operating system
layers ensures the user convenience of accessing all these powerful
functions through a simple tap. Additionally, NFC further enables
interoperability by connecting Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8-based
devices such as laptops, ultrabooks and tablets. 

    "Enabling scenarios between NFC devices is a key component of Microsoft's
shared Windows core. Thus, it was natural to work with NXP since they
offer market leadership and a proven complete NFC portfolio that brings a
great user experience to mobile devices," said Michael Connolly,
principal program manager, Windows Phone division, Microsoft. 

    "NXP is pleased to work with Microsoft as a solution provider to
integrate NFC into its operating system. OEMs can now easily integrate
NFC into Windows Phone 8 handsets," said Ruediger Stroh, executive vice
president and general manager, Identification business, NXP
Semiconductors. "NFC enables the smart mobile life with applications such
as ticketing, proximity marketing, access, identity or payments across a
variety of devices. What NXP drives from an applications perspective is
complemented by companies such as Microsoft integrating NFC into their
software, contributing significantly to bringing trusted smart life
solutions into the lives of the end consumers."

    Visitors to CARTES 2012 (Paris, Nov. 6 - 8) can see NXP's NFC technology
in multiple applications developed to authenticate identities and secure
transactions (booth 4J 027, Hall 4).

    NFC is a market-proven, standardized technology co-invented by NXP and
Sony in 2002. NXP is at the center of this ecosystem, fuelling its
development by partnering with almost all major handset manufacturers,
mobile OS providers and applications developers. NXP is the No. 1
supplier to the Identification market globally, and leverages its
leadership in contactless and security technologies to provide complete
Mobile Transactions solutions: NFC controllers, Secure Elements in all
form factors, NFC tags and infrastructure reader ICs. Currently OEMs have
selected NXP's NFC technology for more than 200 mobile devices.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft Dynamics&#174; CRM users, solution sellers and developers can now 
      customize Microsoft Dynamics CRM without code. InRule Technology, 
      creator of InRule&#174;, the premier .NET Business Rule Management System for 
      the Microsoft platform, today announced InRule&#174; for Microsoft 
      Dynamics&#174; CRM, which enables custom decision logic through the use 
      of business rules within Dynamics CRM.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			InRule 
      for Microsoft Dynamics CRM
			fully leverages InRule&#8217;s 
      rule authoring component, irAuthor&#174;, and its high performance execution 
      engine irServer&#174;. It also includes irX for CRM, a patent-pending 
      extension to irAuthor that provides the ability to author, update, and 
      test rules for use within Dynamics CRM &#8211; without code. The offering also 
      includes InRule Technology&#8217;s implementation guide for prescriptive 
      guidance using rules with CRM.

			Rule Customization with No Coding
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      InRule for Microsoft Dynamics CRM enables business analysts and 
      other subject matter experts to author and maintain complex decision 
      logic that otherwise requires Java script or hard code. Users can easily 
      import entities, fields and relationships from Dynamics CRM using a 
      wizard, and rule authoring is simplified with an intuitive, configurable 
      interface. Rule authoring and management are tightly integrated with 
      Dynamics CRM, making the user experience familiar and easy to learn.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Test Changes Without Modifying Data
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Users can easily validate the performance and results of rules without 
      manually entering test data. InRule for Microsoft Dynamics CRM provides 
      simple selection of records for single-record testing and for 
      multi-record regression testing to ensure that rule changes don&#8217;t 
      adversely affect existing functionality.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Example Use Cases
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Customized decision logic within Dynamics CRM is useful for applications 
      in a wide variety of industries. Typical uses include:

        Geography-specific rules (such as tax calculations) and time-specific 
        rules

        Routing or assigning records

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, Oct 29 (Marketwire) -- 
The drug manufacturers - major industry, which includes players such as
Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Pfizer Inc., has been facing challenging times of
late. Patent expirations continue to put dents in revenue and earnings
and with more expiration upcoming, it is essential for companies to bring
new products to the market.

    Pfizer has been performing well over the last little while, and recently
announced that the European Commission has granted it conditional
marketing authorization in the EU for XALKORI(R) for the treatment of
adults with previously treated anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive
advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This is positive news for the
company as well as patients. See what our analysts have to say on Pfizer
Inc. Follow the Link below

    While Eli Lilly has been developing a strong pipeline of potential
products, its recent quarterly results have been impacted by patent
expirations. In its 3rd quarter that company posted an 11% decline in
worldwide revenue, in part due to Zyprexa patent expirations. Revenue
from its Cymbalta offering improved significantly. However, adjusted
earnings per share contracted when compared to the same period last year.

&lt;p&gt;  SCHAUMBURG, IL, Oct 29 (Marketwire) -- 
Flexera Software, the leading provider of Application Usage Management
solutions for application producers and enterprises, today announced
broad support for Windows 8, enabling application producers and
enterprises to leverage Microsoft's newest operating system throughout
all stages of the software lifecycle.

    Flexera Software supports the entire software lifecycle with solutions
for application licensing, entitlement management, delivery and
installation for application producers. To help enterprises, governments
and educational institutions maximize and protect their investments in
applications, Flexera Software offers Application Readiness and Software
License Optimization solutions that prepare applications for
enterprise-wide deployment, manage license compliance and optimize
software spend.

    "A new operating system like Windows 8 could not gain traction if
application producers were unable to monetize and protect their software
licenses on it, and if enterprises could not efficiently and cost
effectively migrate to the new operating system and optimize their
Windows 8 software assets," said Randy Littleson, Senior Vice President
of Marketing at Flexera Software. "Through our support for Windows 8, we
are providing a fast and efficient migration path for application
producers and enterprises that are seeking to leverage Microsoft's latest
operating system."

    The following Flexera Software solutions support application producers'
Windows 8 migration efforts:


--  FlexNet Producer Suite: Application producers seeking to port their
    existing applications to Windows 8 can now leverage FlexNet Producer
    Suite to monetize and protect their intellectual property. With
    unified entitlement lifecycle management and electronic software,
    producers now can offer a wide variety of licensing models and rapid
    package configuration to match specific market needs for their Windows
    8 applications. It also enables them to maximize the value of every
    feature delivered on the new operating system, to gain insight into
    customer usage for targeted up-sell opportunities, and to streamline
    operations through a single view across all licensing software in use.
--  InstallShield and InstallAnywhere: The global de facto standard on
    more than 500 million PCs, InstallShield and InstallAnywhere are
    strategic installation development solutions supporting traditional
    and agile development teams that need to deliver a professional and
    consistent installation experience for physical, virtual and cloud
    environments. Both InstallShield and InstallAnywhere enable
    development teams to quickly develop installation programs for
    applications that support Windows 8. InstallShield also enables
    application producers to create installs that can sideload Windows
    Store app packages (.appx) for their enterprise customers.
    InstallShield can also bundle sideloaded Windows Store apps and
    desktop apps into a suite installation. Sideloading is the process of
    installing a Windows Store app onto Enterprise editions of Windows 8
    without obtaining it through the Windows Store.

    

The following Flexera Software solutions help enterprise IT
organizations maximize their investments in Windows 8 software:


--  AdminStudio Suite: AdminStudio Suite powers an enterprise's
    Application Readiness process for migrations to new Windows operating
    systems, application and desktop virtualization, and day to day
    application packaging operations. AdminStudio Suite Application
    Compatibility Pack 11.5 has added new Windows 8 and Windows Server
    2012 rules to the existing Windows 7 rule set. The solution now checks
    all operating systems and validates that there are no issues, and that
    apps will work in Windows 8 and in Windows Server 2012. If
    compatibility issues are found AdminStudio streamlines the remediation
    process through automated fixes. Moreover, AdminStudio Suite
    Application Compatibility Pack includes updated Internet Explorer
    rules for Internet Explorer 10. AdminStudio Suite also supports
    sideloading of Windows 8 apps.
--  FlexNet Manager Suite for Enterprises: FlexNet Manager Suite is the
    industry's leading Software License Optimization solution enabling
    enterprises to maximize their return on high-value software
    investments while maintaining continuous compliance. It provides
    unprecedented insight into software usage trends that align with
    unique contract terms and can accurately assess current and future
    needs across the widest range of applications. FlexNet Manager Suite
    for Enterprises is now capable of inventorying Windows 8 applications,
    tracking Windows 8 application usage, reconciling installations
    against purchases, and optimizing software license allocations to
    ensure organizations buy only what they need and remain in compliance
    with vendor's licensing terms.

    

"Constant change in the software market -- such as the release of
new operating systems like Windows 8, provides tremendous value, but also
tremendous cost, disruption and risk," said Littleson. "Our Application
Usage Management solutions provide a safe harbor. We make it easy for
application producers to bring their products to market profitably; and
for enterprises to profit from the use of those products -- and for both
to future-proof their investment in software by reducing risk and cost
associated with change."

&lt;p&gt;(Repeats to additional media subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* New "Star Wars" movies coming, first in 2015&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Deal to buy LucasFilm is half cash, half stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Will lower Disney EPS in fiscal 2013, 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Richwine and Ronald Grover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co 
agreed to buy filmmaker George Lucas's Lucasfilm Ltd and its
"Star Wars" franchise for $4.05 billion in cash and stock, a 
b lockbuster deal that includes the surprise promise of a new
film in the series in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal unites a boutique Northern California film studio
that brought special effects into the digital era with a
venerable Hollywood powerhouse that has shown a knack for
getting the most out of big-name entertainment brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney plans to release at least three more films in the
Star Wars sci-fi saga that ranks among the biggest movie
franchises of all time, Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts
on Tuesday. The last "Star Wars" picture was "Revenge of the
Sith" in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Lucas has in the past denied plans for any new
"Star Wars" movies, he said in a video interview released
Tuesday on Starwars.com that he had already created story
treatments outlining three more films as well as many other Star
Wars story lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas, an icon in the industry known for exercising control
over the most minute details of the fictional universe he
created, will remain a creative consultant on the new films,
although in the video interview he cast the sale as part of a
long-held personal desire to exit the mainstream film industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Tuesday, Lucas said: "It's now time for me
to pass 'Star Wars' on to a new generation of filmmakers." He
will become the second-largest individual holder of Disney
shares, with a 2.2 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney will pay about half the purchase price in cash and
issue about 40 million shares at closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the greatest entertainment properties of all
time," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BELOVED BRANDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement marks the third time in less than seven years
that Disney has signed a massive deal to take over a beloved
studio or character portfolio, part of its strategy to acquire
brands that can be stretched across TV, movies, theme parks and
the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2006, Disney struck a deal to acquire "Toy Story"
creator Pixar, and in the summer of 2009 it bought the comic
book powerhouse Marvel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar was founded by Lucas but sold for scrap to Apple
co-founder Steve Jobs, who turned it into a much-celebrated
hit-maker. Lucas had more success with Industrial Light and
Magic, the pioneering digital technology company behind the
special effects of many major Hollywood movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial Light and Magic and Lucasfilms' Skywalker Sound
unit do much of their work for other studios and it was not
clear how they might be melded with Disney operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said no decision had been made on whether Lucasfilm
would remain headquartered in San Francisco and neighboring
Marin County, where Lucas lives, although the company said it
would retain operations in Northern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Marin ranches that Lucas owns, two of which host
Lucasfilm operations, are not part of the deal, a Lucasfilm
spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news that the Star Wars tale will be revived thrilled
some fans, although others said they had little appetite for new
installments after the first six movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas, in the video interview, said he felt Disney was the
right home for his franchise. "I really wanted to put the
company somewhere in a larger entity which could protect it," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAR WARS REDUX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next "Star Wars" movie installment will be Episode 7 in
the series, followed by Episodes 8 and 9, Iger said. Disney's
long-term plan is to release a new movie in the series every two
to three years thereafter, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said the Lucasfilm
purchase would lower Disney's earnings per share by a low
single-digit percentage in fiscal 2013 and 2014. H e also said
Disney would repurchase all of the issued shares on the open
market within the next two years, on top of planned buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney already has a great portfolio and this adds one
more," said Morningstar analyst Michael Corty. "They don't have
any holes, but their past deals have been additive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said he and Lucas first discussed a possible sale about
18 months ago. Lucas was pondering his retirement, and Iger was
looking to add another well-known brand to the Disney empire.
The two signed the deal at Disney's Burbank, California,
headquarters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everywhere I went, 'Star Wars' was already there, and
sometimes they got there ahead of us," Iger said in an
interview. "I kept seeing that brand and decided maybe we should
buy it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told analysts he believed there was substantial pent-up
demand for new "Star Wars" movies. Each of the last three films
in the series would have grossed $1.5 billion in today's dollars
at the box office, CFO Rasulo estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film's iconic characters also will boost Disney's sales
of toys and other consumer products, particularly overseas,
executives said. Sales of "Star Wars" items such as Darth Vader
and Yoda action figures total roughly $215 million a year,
Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the year the last "Star Wars" film was released,
LucasFilm generated $550 million in operating income, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas will not sit on the Disney board despite his 2.2
percent stake in the company, Iger said. Jobs, who held a large
stake in Disney after it bought Pixar, had a seat on Disney's
board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Lucas had told the fan magazine Empire:
"I'm moving away from the company, I'm moving away from all my
businesses, I'm finishing all my obligations and I'm going to
retire to my garage with my saw and hammer and build hobby
movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've always wanted to make movies that were more
experimental in nature, and not have to worry about them showing
in movie theaters."

&lt;p&gt;* New "Star Wars" movies coming, first in 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Deal to buy LucasFilm is half cash, half stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Will lower Disney EPS in fiscal 2013, 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Richwine and Ronald Grover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co 
agreed to buy filmmaker George Lucas's Lucasfilm Ltd and its
"Star Wars" franchise for $4.05 billion in cash and stock, a 
b lockbuster deal that includes the surprise promise of a new
film in the series in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal unites a boutique Northern California film studio
that brought special effects into the digital era with a
venerable Hollywood powerhouse that has shown a knack for
getting the most out of big-name entertainment brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney plans to release at least three more films in the
Star Wars sci-fi saga that ranks among the biggest movie
franchises of all time, Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts
on Tuesday. The last "Star Wars" picture was "Revenge of the
Sith" in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Lucas has in the past denied plans for any new
"Star Wars" movies, he said in a video interview released
Tuesday on Starwars.com that he had already created story
treatments outlining three more films as well as many other Star
Wars story lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas, an icon in the industry known for exercising control
over the most minute details of the fictional universe he
created, will remain a creative consultant on the new films,
although in the video interview he cast the sale as part of a
long-held personal desire to exit the mainstream film industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Tuesday, Lucas said: "It's now time for me
to pass 'Star Wars' on to a new generation of filmmakers." He
will become the second-largest individual holder of Disney
shares, with a 2.2 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney will pay about half the purchase price in cash and
issue about 40 million shares at closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the greatest entertainment properties of all
time," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BELOVED BRANDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement marks the third time in less than seven years
that Disney has signed a massive deal to take over a beloved
studio or character portfolio, part of its strategy to acquire
brands that can be stretched across TV, movies, theme parks and
the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2006, Disney struck a deal to acquire "Toy Story"
creator Pixar, and in the summer of 2009 it bought the comic
book powerhouse Marvel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar was founded by Lucas but sold for scrap to Apple
co-founder Steve Jobs, who turned it into a much-celebrated
hit-maker. Lucas had more success with Industrial Light and
Magic, the pioneering digital technology company behind the
special effects of many major Hollywood movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial Light and Magic and Lucasfilms' Skywalker Sound
unit do much of their work for other studios and it was not
clear how they might be melded with Disney operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said no decision had been made on whether Lucasfilm
would remain headquartered in San Francisco and neighboring
Marin County, where Lucas lives, although the company said it
would retain operations in Northern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Marin ranches that Lucas owns, two of which host
Lucasfilm operations, are not part of the deal, a Lucasfilm
spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news that the Star Wars tale will be revived thrilled
some fans, although others said they had little appetite for new
installments after the first six movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas, in the video interview, said he felt Disney was the
right home for his franchise. "I really wanted to put the
company somewhere in a larger entity which could protect it," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAR WARS REDUX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next "Star Wars" movie installment will be Episode 7 in
the series, followed by Episodes 8 and 9, Iger said. Disney's
long-term plan is to release a new movie in the series every two
to three years thereafter, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said the Lucasfilm

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Oct 30 (Marketwire) -- 
Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS), a leader in global
electronic design innovation, announced today the tapeout of a
14-nanometer test-chip featuring an ARM Cortex(R)-M0 processor
implemented using IBM's FinFET process technology. The successful tapeout
is the result of close collaboration between the three technology leaders
as they teamed to build an ecosystem to address the new challenges from
design through manufacturing inherent in a 14-nanometer FinFET-based
design flow.

    The 14-nanometer ecosystem and chip are significant milestones of a
multi-year agreement between ARM, Cadence and IBM to develop
systems-on-chip (SoCs) at the advanced process nodes of 14 nanometers and
beyond. SoCs designed at 14 nanometers with FinFET technology offer the
promise of a significant reduction in power consumption.

    "This chip represents a major milestone for advanced node process
technology, achieved through tight collaboration among experts at the
three companies," said Chi-Ping Hsu, senior vice president, Silicon
Realization Group at Cadence. "FinFET designs offer significant
advantages to the design community, but also require advanced foundry
support, IP and EDA technology to meet the considerable challenges.
Cadence, IBM and ARM are collaborating to address these challenges and
develop an ecosystem that can support 14-nanometer FinFET development for
a broad range of production designs."

    The chip was developed to validate the building blocks of foundation IP
for 14-nanometer design. In addition to the ARM processor, SRAM memory
blocks and other blocks were included that provide the characterization
data necessary for foundation IP development for FinFET-based ARM
Artisan(R) physical IP.

    "Each move to smaller geometry brings new challenges that require deep
collaboration among ecosystem leaders in the SoC design chain," said
Dipesh Patel, vice president and general manager, Physical IP Division at
ARM. "With 14-nanometer design, many of these challenges center on
FinFETs, and our work with Cadence and IBM has focused on answering the
key questions about how to make 14-nanometer FinFET design viable and
economically feasible."

    ARM design engineers incorporated an ARM Cortex-M0 processor using
14-nanometer FinFET technology built on IBM's silicon-on-insulator (SOI)
technology, which offers an optimal performance/power profile. A
comprehensive 14-nanometer double patterning and FinFET support
methodology was employed, with engineers using Cadence technology to
design the FinFET 3D transistor chip. 

    "The tapeout of this 14-nanometer test chip is the culmination of the
significant progress we have made with FinFET on SOI utilizing it's built
in dielectric isolation," said Gary Patton, vice president of IBM
Semiconductor Research and Development Center. "In fact, Cadence and ARM
have collaborated on a design solution to tape out this test chip based
on IBM's FinFET technology. We continue to collaborate to deliver on the
promise of superior power, performance, and variability control of fully
depleted SOI FinFET devices at 14 nanometers and beyond."

    To succeed, engineers required support for 14-nanometer and FinFET rule
decks, as well as enhanced timing analysis. The chip was implemented
using the Cadence(R) Encounter(R) Digital Implementation (EDI) System
with ARM 8-track 14-nanometer FinFET standard cell libraries designed
with Cadence Virtuoso(R) tools. EDI System provides advanced digital
capability required for implementing designs based on 14-nanometer
FinFET-based DRC rules, and incorporates new GigaOpt optimization
technology to realize power and performance benefits offered by FinFET
technology. In addition, the solution also uses production-proven double
patterning-correct implementation capabilities. Encounter Power System,
Encounter Timing System and Cadence QRC Extraction provide 14nm timing
and power signoff capabilities supporting 14-nanometer FinFET structures.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Taiwanese computer maker Acer is putting off the launch of tablets using Microsoft's new Windows RT operating system to give itself time to see how Microsoft's own Surface tablet fares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's No. 4 PC vendor by shipments initially planned to roll out Windows RT tablets based on ARM chips early next year. However, the launch of Microsoft's tablet last week and the mixed reviews it has drawn has prompted Acer to wait and see until at least the second quarter of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Originally we had a very aggressive plan to come out very early next year but because of Surface, our R development doesn't stop, but we are much more cautious," Acer President Jim Wong told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Originally our plan was Q1, but now I don't think it will be earlier than Q2," Wong said on the sidelines of a presentation of Acer's new line of Windows 8 touchscreen notebooks and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acer was one of the first companies to criticize Microsoft for moving into the computer hardware business and competing with its partners' devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wong said research and development for the Windows RT tablets was still moving forward but that the company had many questions to address with regards to manufacturing and pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that rivals Lenovo and Asustek had unveiled plans for Windows RT tablets starting at $599 before Microsoft surprised the market with its $499 home-built Surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know what's next, what Microsoft will do," Wong said.

			Cross-Platform Games  Apps SDK Marmalade Announces Support for 
      Microsoft Windows Phone 8 in Q4 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Marmalade (www.madewithmarmalade.com), 
      the cross-platform tool that allows developers to create without 
      compromise - today announced that it will support Windows Phone 8 before 
      the end of 2012. Support for Windows 8 will follow in early 2013, 
      completing Marmalade&#8217;s support for the entire Windows family.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Marmalade demonstrated today for the first time during Microsoft&#8217;s Build 
      conference in Seattle support for Windows Phone 8, including how new and 
      existing mobile apps and games can quickly and easily be brought to 
      Windows Phone Store and the Windows Store using the Marmalade SDK.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Marmalade has worked closely with Microsoft over the past months to make 
      Windows Phone 8 support available to developers within the Marmalade 6.2 
      release, coming later this year. With this latest release, developers 
      will be able to take existing apps and games built using Marmalade over 
      to the Windows Phone 8 platform, increasing the reach of their apps.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many indie game developers and top game studios already take advantage 
      of Marmalade's &#8220;build once, deploy all&#8221; approach to achieve accelerated 
      time to market across platforms; including iOS, Android, BlackBerry and 
      Windows desktop. With upcoming support for Windows Phone 8, developers 
      will be able to create high performance games and apps leveraging their 
      C++/OpenGL ES skills, opening up new opportunities with minimum 
      investment and rework thanks to Marmalade&#8217;s powerful cross-platform 
      tools.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JC Cimetiere, Director, Windows Phone Partner  Developer programs, 
      Microsoft Corp., said of the release, &#8220;Games are a huge part of the 
      Windows Phone 8 user experience and Microsoft aims to provide its 
      developers with diverse tooling options. Cross-platform development 
      tools, like the Marmalade SDK, help developers broaden their consumer 
      reach more quickly. With Marmalade, developers will have a new option to 
      reuse their code to quickly bring games to Windows Phone 8.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bryan Biniak, Vice President  General Manager, Global Partner  
      Application Development, Nokia said: &#8220;We are excited to have Marmalade 
      join the Windows Phone 8 ecosystem. The Marmalade SDK accelerates 
      developer time to market and improves the business case for those who 
      want to bring games from other platforms to Windows Phone 8. Nokia&#8217;s 
      Lumia devices offer developers the power of Windows Phone 8 and the 
      opportunity to leverage imaginative new capabilities. Together with 
      Marmalade, developers can create amazing experiences that will become 
      part of everyday life for consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Harvey Elliott, Managing Director and COO, Marmalade said: &#8220;A recent 
      Vision Mobile report stated that 57% of mobile developers intend to 
      target Windows Phone 8 within the next year. Being a developer-led 
      organization, this innovative new platform is a top priority for us. 
      Naturally, we&#8217;re very excited to work with Microsoft to add Windows 
      Phone 8 to our comprehensive cross-platform offering before the end of 
      this year.&#8221;

			IBM BOARD APPROVES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND; AUTHORIZES $5 BILLION FOR 
      STOCK REPURCHASE
		&lt;/p&gt;

      The IBM (NYSE: IBM) board of directors today declared a regular 
      quarterly cash dividend of $0.85 per common share, payable December 10, 
      2012 to stockholders of record November 9, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The board today also authorized $5 billion in additional funds for use 
      in the company&#8217;s stock repurchase program. IBM said it will repurchase 
      shares on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, 
      depending on market conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This amount is in addition to approximately $6.7 billion remaining at 
      the end of September 2012 from a prior authorization. With this new 
      authorization, IBM will have approximately $11.7 billion for its stock 
      repurchase program. IBM expects to request additional share repurchase 
      authorization at the April 2013 board meeting.

        The Share Charm allows users to quickly share links or files either 
        via Mail, with the People app, or through social networks such as 
        Facebook and Twitter. This is especially helpful in the learning 
        environment by facilitating collaboration between teachers and 
        students as well as student to student sharing.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Big Bang LLC Announces Full Universal Imaging Utility (UIU) Support 
      for Microsoft Windows 8 Operating System
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The UIU line of products automates driver management for any Windows 
      OS imaging and deployment Solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, Big Bang LLC announced full support for Microsoft Windows 8 
      Operating System. Big Bang LLC is the developer of the Universal Imaging 
      Utility (UIU). The UIU works in conjunction with any Windows OS 
      deployment solution such as Ghost, Acronis, Altiris, SCCM, ImageX, etc., 
      to deliver a hardware independent image to any PC regardless of 
      manufacturer or model.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The UIU contains a continuously updated and vetted driver database of 
      over 40,000 Plug-n-Play Ids from chipset manufacturers and OEMs, 
      including the newest Windows 8 drivers as soon as they are available. 
      The driver database is incorporated through the UIU program to allow 
      users to create a hardware-independent Windows 8 OS image ready for 
      deployment in approximately 10 minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "With any new OS from Microsoft, we want to continue to provide the same 
      level of quality and support so that our customers are ready to go with 
      their OS migrations and any new hardware that comes pre-packed with the 
      latest OS,&#8221; said Big Bang president, Adam Murphy. &#8220;Driver management 
      continues to be the most time-consuming aspect of Windows deployment to 
      multiple platforms, and it remains so with Windows 8.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Big Bang's Universal Imaging Utility has enabled IT departments to save 
      considerable time and money by working in conjunction with any existing 
      Windows OS cloning and deployment solution (Ghost, Acronis, Altiris, 
      Zenworks, SCCM, ImageX, etc.) to deliver a hardware independent image to 
      any PC regardless of manufacturer or model.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The UIU has been effectively deployed to over 3 million PCs worldwide 
      for companies, government and healthcare agencies, and educational 
      institutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Increased consumer spending and card use worldwide drove quarterly profits higher for Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), according to new financial reports from the two payments companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, which operates the biggest network for credit and debit cards, said that payments, adjusted for changes in currency exchange rates, grew 6 percent in the three months through September from a year earlier and maintained the pace from the prior three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, which has the second-biggest network, said its purchase volume grew 12 percent in the latest three months from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies said growth in their businesses outside of the United States led the increases in payment volumes. Visa's gains were led by growth in its Asia and Pacific operations and MasterCard, too, showed big gains in its Asia, Pacific, Middle East and Africa segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies are trying to capture new business from increasing consumer preferences for cards and digital payments instead of cash. At the same time, they are also experimenting with mobile payments systems partly out of fear of losing business to upstart technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said profit, in what was its fiscal fourth quarter, rose to $1.7 billion from $880 million a year earlier. But that increase included an unusual boost of $627 million from reversing previously recorded reserves against having to pay additional taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding the one-time gain, Visa earned $1.0 billion, or $1.54 per share, in the quarter. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $1.50 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa also announced on Wednesday that its directors have authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, bringing to $2.3 billion the amount executives may spend to buy back stock for the company. Buybacks have been an important source of growth in earnings per share for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said it expects annual net revenue growth in the low double digits and adjusted earnings per share growth in the high teens in percentage terms for its new fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visa delivered strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year, a result of our focus on growing our core business, accelerating expansion of our business outside the U.S.," outgoing Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said last week that Charles Scharf, a former head of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) retail financial services division, will succeed Saunders, effective November 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MASTERCARD GROWS IN EUROPE, INDIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Visa, MasterCard benefited from strong growth overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard's third-quarter net income rose 8 percent to $772 million, or $6.17 per share, from $717 million, or $5.63 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $5.92 per share, excluding one-time items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard revenue rose 5 percent to $1.92 billion, but fell short of the $1.94 billion analysts had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard continues to expect second-half revenue growth to be lower than the levels it saw in the second quarter due to the timing of deals and global economic uncertainty, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard has been boosting its presence outside the United States, cashing in on higher-growth markets in Asia and the Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think we can double our market share in the Nordic and Baltic regions for the next three years, further extending our presence in these markets that are actually doing relatively well," Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on the conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, MasterCard signed deals with travel company Thomas Cook (THOM.NS) to provide foreign exchange prepaid cards, and with ICICI Bank (ICBK.NS) and Western Union Co (WU.N), for a reloadable prepaid card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers of the two companies are chiefly banks that issue cards to consumers and make deals with merchants to accept cards for payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of MasterCard, which is based in Purchase, New York, and has a market value of $56 billion, were up 1.8 percent at $460.93 at the close of New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Visa, which is based in Foster City, California, and has a market value of $112 billion, rose as much as 1.6 percent to $141 in trading following the company's report after normal market hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year-to-date, Visa shares were up 37 percent and MasterCard shares 24 percent late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jochelle Mendonca in Bangalore and David Henry in San Francisco; Editing by Sreejiraj Eluvangal, Supriya Kurane and Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard revenue rose 5 percent to $1.92 billion, but fell
short of the $1.94 billion analysts had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard continues to expect second-half revenue growth to
be lower than the levels it saw in the second quarter due to the
timing of deals and global economic uncertainty, Chief Financial
Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on a conference call with
analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard has been boosting its presence outside the United
States, cashing in on higher-growth markets in Asia and the
Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think we can double our market share in the Nordic and
Baltic regions for the next three years, further extending our
presence in these markets that are actually doing relatively
well," Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on the conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, MasterCard signed deals with travel company Thomas
Cook to provide foreign exchange prepaid cards, and
with ICICI Bank and Western Union Co, for a
reloadable prepaid card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers of the two companies are chiefly banks that issue
cards to consumers and make deals with merchants to accept cards
for payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of MasterCard, which is based in Purchase, New York,
and has a market value of $56 billion, were up 1.8 percent at
$460.93 at the close of New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Visa, which is based in Foster City, California,
and has a market value of $112 billion, rose as much as 1.6
percent to $141 in trading following the company's report after
normal market hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year-to-date, Visa shares were up 37 percent and MasterCard
shares 24 percent late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Plaintiffs filed lawsuits in Canada and Brazil this year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Chevron spokesman accuses plaintiffs' lawyers of "fraud"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Legal saga spans nearly two decades&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Eduardo Garcia and Guido Nejamkis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUITO/BUENOS AIRES, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean plaintiffs
plan to sue Chevron in Argentina and Colombia to collect a $19
billion award for pollution in the Amazon that has become one of
the world's most high-profile environmental cases against an oil
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2011 decision by an Ecuadorean court ordered Chevron to
pay the sum for contamination of watersheds and inappropriate
disposing of oil industry waste during crude oil production i n a
remote jungle region during nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Chevron has few assets in Ecuador that can be taken
as compensation, the plaintiffs are trying to get the ruling
enforced in other countries. Chevron calls the ruling
unenforceable and illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year Chevron made $26 billion, with these kinds of
profits the sentence could be paid in a question of months,"
Enrique Bruchou, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, told
reporters in Buenos Aires on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has valuable assets in both Argentina and Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruchou said Chevron's assets in Argentina were valued at
around $2 billion, and noted that the company is a key producer
of natural gas in Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is the fourth-largest producer of oil in Argentina.
In September, it signed an accord with state-controlled YPF
, Argentina's No. 1 energy company, to consider a joint
exploration project in the South American country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruchou said the plaintiffs plan to start legal proceedings
against Chevron in Argentina this week and in Colombia at a
later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, which include Indians from the Amazon, filed
similar lawsuits in May in Canada and in June in Brazil, where
Chevron and Transocean Ltd, its drilling contractor,
also face civil lawsuits seeking nearly $20 billion in damages
over an oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said the efforts to find new jurisdictions to
enforce the Ecuador ruling showed the weakness of the case,
which it calls the product of "bribery and fraud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the plaintiffs' lawyers believed they had a legitimate
judgment they would seek to enforce it in the United States. 
It's precisely because of the plaintiffs' lawyers' fraud that
they are now in Argentina instead of the United States," Chevron
spokesman Kent Robertson told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BITTER DISPUTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs from villages in the oil-rich Amazon won an
$18.2 billion case against the oil giant over claims that
Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, contaminated the area from
1964 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling was issued by a court in the town of Lago Agrio,
in the Ecuadorean Amazon, and ratified by an appeals court in
January 2012. Damages were increased to $19 billion in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accused Texaco of causing illnesses among the
local population by dumping drilling waste in unlined pits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies the accusations and says Texaco properly
cleaned up all the pits for which it was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with intrigue, accusations of corruption, bribery and
dirty tricks, the complicated case has been fought for nearly
two decades, mainly in courts in Ecuador and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipating such a global legal battle, Chevron filed for
arbitration in September 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arbitration panel has to rule whether Ecuador violated a
treaty with the United States requiring it to guarantee Chevron
a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also accused the plaintiffs, their legal
team and their advisers of fraud in a U.S. court and the trial
is scheduled to begin on Oct. 15, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs' legal team argues that Texaco's remediation
efforts were insufficient. Their long-term legal adviser, Steven
Donziger, has also filed counter claims in a U.S. court accusing
Chevron of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co agreed to buy filmmaker George Lucas's Lucasfilm Ltd and its "Star Wars" franchise for $4.05 billion in cash and stock, a blockbuster deal that includes the surprise promise of a new film in the series in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal unites a boutique Northern California film studio that brought special effects into the digital era with a venerable Hollywood powerhouse that has shown a knack for getting the most out of big-name entertainment brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney plans to release at least three more films in the Star Wars sci-fi saga that ranks among the biggest movie franchises of all time, Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts on Tuesday. The last "Star Wars" picture was "Revenge of the Sith" in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Lucas has in the past denied plans for any new "Star Wars" movies, he said in a video interview released Tuesday on Starwars.com that he had already created story treatments outlining three more films as well as many other Star Wars story lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas, an icon in the industry known for exercising control over the most minute details of the fictional universe he created, will remain a creative consultant on the new films, although in the video interview he cast the sale as part of a long-held personal desire to exit the mainstream film industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Tuesday, Lucas said: "It's now time for me to pass 'Star Wars' on to a new generation of filmmakers." He will become the second-largest individual holder of Disney shares, with a 2.2 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney will pay about half the purchase price in cash and issue about 40 million shares at closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the greatest entertainment properties of all time," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BELOVED BRANDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement marks the third time in less than seven years that Disney has signed a massive deal to take over a beloved studio or character portfolio, part of its strategy to acquire brands that can be stretched across TV, movies, theme parks and the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2006, Disney struck a deal to acquire "Toy Story" creator Pixar, and in the summer of 2009 it bought the comic book powerhouse Marvel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar was founded by Lucas but sold for scrap to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who turned it into a much-celebrated hit-maker. Lucas had more success with Industrial Light and Magic, the pioneering digital technology company behind the special effects of many major Hollywood movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial Light and Magic and Lucasfilms' Skywalker Sound unit do much of their work for other studios and it was not clear how they might be melded with Disney operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said no decision had been made on whether Lucasfilm would remain headquartered in San Francisco and neighboring Marin County, where Lucas lives, although the company said it would retain operations in Northern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Marin ranches that Lucas owns, two of which host Lucasfilm operations, are not part of the deal, a Lucasfilm spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news that the Star Wars tale will be revived thrilled some fans, although others said they had little appetite for new installments after the first six movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas, in the video interview, said he felt Disney was the right home for his franchise. "I really wanted to put the company somewhere in a larger entity which could protect it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAR WARS REDUX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next "Star Wars" movie installment will be Episode 7 in the series, followed by Episodes 8 and 9, Iger said. Disney's long-term plan is to release a new movie in the series every two to three years thereafter, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said the Lucasfilm purchase would lower Disney's earnings per share by a low single-digit percentage in fiscal 2013 and 2014. He also said Disney would repurchase all of the issued shares on the open market within the next two years, on top of planned buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney already has a great portfolio and this adds one more," said Morningstar analyst Michael Corty. "They don't have any holes, but their past deals have been additive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said he and Lucas first discussed a possible sale about 18 months ago. Lucas was pondering his retirement, and Iger was looking to add another well-known brand to the Disney empire. The two signed the deal at Disney's Burbank, California, headquarters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everywhere I went, 'Star Wars' was already there, and sometimes they got there ahead of us," Iger said in an interview. "I kept seeing that brand and decided maybe we should buy it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told analysts he believed there was substantial pent-up demand for new "Star Wars" movies. Each of the last three films in the series would have grossed $1.5 billion in today's dollars at the box office, CFO Rasulo estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film's iconic characters also will boost Disney's sales of toys and other consumer products, particularly overseas, executives said. Sales of "Star Wars" items such as Darth Vader and Yoda action figures total roughly $215 million a year, Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the year the last "Star Wars" film was released, LucasFilm generated $550 million in operating income, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas will not sit on the Disney board despite his 2.2 percent stake in the company, Iger said.

&lt;p&gt;QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadorean plaintiffs plan to file a lawsuit against Chevron in Argentina, their third legal attempt outside the Andean country to enforce a $19 billion ruling against the U.S. oil company for pollution in the Amazon, a source with direct knowledge of the case said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2011 judgment against Chevron is one of the biggest rulings for environmental damage and is being tracked closely by the global oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source told Reuters that the plaintiffs' legal team would file a lawsuit against Chevron in an Argentine court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other sources said the legal team is due to hold a news conference in Buenos Aires on Wednesday afternoon to announce the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Chevron has barely any assets in Ecuador, the claimants are trying to get the ruling enforced outside the OPEC-member country. The plaintiffs' lawyers filed a similar lawsuit in Brazil in June and another one in Canada in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says the original ruling is unenforceable and illegitimate and that it is the product of "bribery and fraud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the plaintiffs' lawyers believed they had a legitimate judgment they would seek to enforce it in the United States. It's precisely because of the plaintiffs' lawyers' fraud that they are now in Argentina instead of the United States," Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early October, Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, lost a bid to have the U.S. Supreme Court block enforcement of the ruling. [ID:nL1E8LGMYO] The plaintiffs won an order from an Ecuadorean court two weeks ago that they said lets them seize some $200 million worth of assets in Ecuador belonging to Chevron. [ID:nnL1E8LGMYO]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs from villages in the oil-rich Amazon won an $18.2 billion case against the oil giant over claims that Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, contaminated the area from 1964 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling was issued by a court in the town of Lago Agrio, in the Ecuadorean Amazon, and ratified by an appeals court in January 2012. Damages were increased to $19 billion in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accused Texaco of causing illnesses among the local population by dumping drilling waste in unlined pits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies the accusations and says Texaco properly cleaned up all the pits for which it was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with intrigue, accusations of corruption, bribery and dirty tricks, the complicated case has been fought for nearly two decades, mainly in courts in Ecuador and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipating such a global legal battle, Chevron filed for arbitration in September 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arbitration panel has to rule whether Ecuador violated a treaty with the United States requiring it to guarantee Chevron a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also accused the plaintiffs, their legal team and their advisers of fraud in a U.S. court and the trial is scheduled to begin on October 15, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs' legal team argues that Texaco's remediation efforts were insufficient. Their long-term legal adviser Steven Donziger has also filed counter claims in a U.S. court accusing Chevron of fraud. (Editing by Mohammad Zargham)&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Statement on Ecuador Judgment Enforcement Action
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In response to media reports that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers 
      have initiated recognition and enforcement actions of their fraudulent 
      judgment in Argentina, Chevron Corporation [NYSE: CVX] issued the 
      following statement:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Ecuador judgment is a product of bribery, fraud, and it is 
      illegitimate. The company does not believe that the Ecuador judgment is 
      enforceable in any court that observes the rule of law.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;If the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers believed in the integrity of their judgment, 
      they would be seeking enforcement in the United States &#8211; where Chevron 
      Corporation resides. In the U.S., however, the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers would 
      be confronted by the fact that seven 
      federal courts have made fraud findings related to the plaintiffs&#8217; 
      lawyers&#8217; scheme.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Note to Editors:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is defending itself against false allegations that it is 
      responsible for alleged environmental and social harms in the Oriente 
      region of Ecuador. Chevron never conducted oil production operations in 
      Ecuador, and its subsidiary Texaco Petroleum Co. (&#8220;TexPet&#8221;) fully 
      remediated its share of environmental impacts arising from oil 
      production operations, before leaving Ecuador in 1992. After the 
      remediation was certified by all agencies of the Ecuadorian government 
      responsible for oversight, TexPet received a complete release from 
      Ecuador&#8216;s national, provincial, and municipal governments that 
      extinguished all claims before Chevron acquired TexPet in 2001. All 
      legitimate scientific evidence exonerates Chevron and proves that the 
      remediated sites pose no significant risks to human health or the 
      environment.

proprietary transactional email solution and the cost of assigning
developer resources to manage it. 

    "Windows Azure gives developers an open cloud platform for building,
deploying, and managing applications," said Scott Guthrie, Corporate Vice
President, Windows Azure, Microsoft. "We are pleased to welcome SendGrid
to the Windows Azure Store and look forward to giving developers access
to SendGrid's transactional email delivery service for their
applications."

    "Our integration with leading cloud platforms like Windows Azure aligns
with our core mission to make email easy for developers and to make
SendGrid accessible everywhere," said Jim Franklin, CEO, SendGrid. "We've
worked closely with Microsoft since our introduction into the Windows
Azure marketplace earlier this year. Our inclusion as part of the Windows
Azure Store empowers developers to use SendGrid directly from their
Windows Azure environment with unified billing and custom documentation
libraries, making transactional email management simple and easy for
Windows Azure developers."

      based on the FNMA and GNMA guarantees of full and timely payment of 
      principal and interest on their respective securities. The guarantees 
      are backed by the rating of the U.S. treasury, which carries the rating 
      of the United States of America (the U.S. government; rated 'AAA/F1+' 
      with a Negative Outlook). Although the FNMA guarantee is not explicitly 
      backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, FNMA 
      continues to benefit from financial support by the U.S. treasury.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Payments on the certificates will be made monthly and will consist of 
      all interest and principal payments received from the underlying MRB. 
      The certificates will receive interest equal to 3.5% per annum less 
      extraordinary expenses. The underlying MRB pays a coupon of 3.527% and 
      the transaction is structured to pass-through all interest and principal 
      proceeds after paying a 0.027% (p.a.) trustee fee and any extraordinary 
      expenses that are incurred. Extraordinary expenses incurred by the 
      trustee are capped at $150,000 per year, and any excess extraordinary 
      expense amount incurred by the trustee is to be paid the following year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction relies, to a lesser extent, on a series of 
      counterparties to perform particular roles, including the trustee (U.S. 
      Bank, N.A.; rated 'AA-/F1+'; Outlook Stable) and the bank at which the 
      certificate account is established (also U.S. Bank). All distributions 
      from the underlying MRB are deposited into the certificate account where 
      they are held uninvested and are subsequently withdrawn by the trustee 
      prior to each payment date. The certificate account is a segregated 
      trust account, separated from the assets of the bank in the event of its 
      insolvency. In its role as both issuer account bank and trustee, U.S. 
      Bank satisfies the eligibility criteria described in Fitch's 
      'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance Transactions'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction is established as a grantor trust for federal income tax 
      purposes. Each beneficial owner of the certificates will be treated for 
      federal income tax purposes as owning an undivided interest in each 
      asset held in the trust. To the extent interest on the underlying MRBs 
      is exempt from federal income taxation, the portion thereof received by 
      each beneficial owner of a certificate will also be exempt from federal 
      income taxation. Fitch has received and reviewed legal opinions 
      addressing the true sale of the underlying MRBs to the trust, the 
      classification of the trust as a grantor trust for federal income tax 
      purposes, and the enforceability of the transaction documents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Antony Currie and Rob Cox
The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions epxressed are their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Iger and George Lucas are either flaunting their&#160;California&#160;roots, or they&#8217;ve got something to hide. The Walt Disney boss unveiled a $4 billion purchase of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones creator&#8217;s homegrown studio, Lucasfilm, on a day when Wall Street and&#160;stock markets were shut down by Hurricane Sandy. It&#8217;s just as well: Iger is asking his shareholders to put lots of faith in the power of the Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor is it the first time Iger has used Disney&#8217;s treasure to acquire the creative forces the company can&#8217;t seem to muster on its own. Iger paid 45 times earnings for Pixar in 2006 and almost as much again for Marvel three years later. While both have proved useful in filling the studio&#8217;s pipelines, the benefits for shareholders are still unclear. While Marvel produced some hits like the Avengers, other studios retained many of the rights to these. Another Marvel superhero film, John Carter,&#160;barely broke even, according to Box Office Mojo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of Lucasfilm are even harder to analyze. As a private company, its numbers remain on the dark side &#8211; and Disney has done very little to bring them to light. Iger does point out that the consumer products unit should rake in a similar amount of revenue this year as Marvel&#8217;s did in 2009  some $215 million. Assuming generously&#160;that the unit&#8217;s&#160;margins&#160;are in line with Disney&#8217;s own, those earnings&#160;could be worth around $600 million at Disney&#8217;s multiple of 11 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real attraction lies in the potential to draw further life from the Star Wars franchise. Fans have been waiting for three sequels since the Return of the Jedi in 1983. Instead Lucas produced three prequels between 1999 and 2005. Iger is planning to release a seventh episode in 2015 and reckons each sequel could generate $1.5 billion at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming production costs run to a fifth of that &#8211; more than was spent making 2005&#8217;s Revenge of the Sith &#8211; the $4 billion spent on Lucasfilm&#160;might look downright Ewokian in comparison to the potential profits from reviving the series.&#160;Fans, of course, may worry that Disney will inject even more child-pleasing Jar Jar Binks-like characters than Lucas did. But if history is any guide, they&#8217;ll go see the movies anyway and complain later. That, more than anything, may be the guiding force of Iger&#8217;s latest deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      Switch Networks, the leading platform-independent Software-Defined 
      Networking (SDN) company has closed a $25M Series B funding led by 
      Redpoint Ventures and joined by Goldman Sachs, and existing investors 
      Index Ventures, Khosla Ventures, and others. The funding will be used to 
      continue the expansion of the engineering, sales and marketing teams

      open ecosystem approach and its brilliant team have created a 
      breakthrough disruption at the right moment - and we're very proud to 
      participate in supporting their vision.&#8221;

      programmability, flexibility and new levels of network service delivery. 
      We started this revolutionary trend away from closed and proprietary 
      systems, and are gratified that every major physical and virtual 
      infrastructure vendor is now participating,&#8221; said Guido Appenzeller, CEO 
      and co-founder of Big Switch Networks. &#8220;Working with our ecosystem of 
      partners, the Big Switch platform will disrupt networking applications 
      as we know them today. Investors have recognized the potential of this 
      opportunity, and we are pleased to have the support of a strong investor 
      syndicate including Redpoint and Goldman Sachs, who join Index, Khosla 
      and others on this exciting journey to deliver truly programmable

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group analyst Lucio Aldworth raised on Wednesday
his 12-month price target for shares in TIM Participa&#231;&#245;es SA
, the local unit of Telecom Italia SpA, to 8.60 reais
from 8.50 reais previously. Earnings per share estimates at the
company, which posted a slight miss in third-quarter earnings
according to a Reuters poll, were lowered by 5 percent in
average through 2014 "due to lower growth assumptions in the
voice business," Aldworth said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"TIM still faces strong competition, macro and possibly
regulatory headwinds in Brazil that we think could prevent
re-rating in the near-term," the analyst wrote in a client note.
Goldman Sachs kept a "neutral" recommendation on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS Oct 31 (Reuters) - Nigeria's Zenith Bank 
has appointed JP Morgan to facilitate a secondary listing of its
shares on the London Stock Exchange, the lender said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The listing is planned to be through a Global Depository
Receipt (GDR), a tool used to facilitate investments and trading
in the shares of companies from emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top-tier lender said it will seek shareholders' approval
for the listing on Nov. 21 and that one GDR will represent 50
ordinary shares in the local bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zenith already has a primary listing in Nigeria 
and has a market capitalisation of $3.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is subject to regulatory approval, the bank said,
adding that it wanted to improve liquidity for its shares with
the transaction and not to raise capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Listing on the LSE creates new opportunities for increasing
... liquidity in our securities ... and diversification of our
investor base," Godwin Emefiele, Zenith's chief executive said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zenith Bank joins the league of four other Nigerian lenders
-- Guaranty Trust Bank, Diamond Bank,
UBA and First Bank -- with GDRs trading in
London or New York.

&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group led by Carlos Macedo raised
their 12-month price target for shares of insurance plan broker
Qualicorp SA, which the analysts said does not face
policy underwriting risk yet benefits from the secular growth
trends related to healthcare in Brazil. In a report on
Wednesday, Macedo and his team upped the target for Qualicorp to
22.90 reais from 22.30 reais previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Porto Seguro SA, Brazil's largest
independent insurer, the 12-month target price was raised by 2.4
percent to 21 reais, while that for SulAm&#233;rica SA 
was cut by 1.3 percent to 14.50 reais. The valuations of both
insurers is "rich" at this point, the analysts said. SulAm&#233;rica
shares could also be affected by a potential mergers and
acquisition transaction - for a few years, majority shareholder
ING Bank NV has sought to sell its stake in the
insurer, the report added.&lt;/p&gt;
