&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* West Africa a major transit point for cocaine into Europe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Cocaine traffickers returning to Guinea under Conde's
government&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Guinea lacks resources to tackle trafficking networks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Lewis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONAKRY, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A surge in cocaine trafficking
has transformed Guinea into West Africa's latest drug hot spot,
jeopardizing President Alpha Conde's efforts to rebuild state
institutions after a military coup and attract billion of
dollars in mining investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locals and Latin Americans long-accused of smuggling are
operating freely in the country, some with high-level protection
from within Conde's administration, according to Guinean and
international law enforcement officials and internal police
reports seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth of trafficking was overlooked as diplomats
focused on securing a fragile transition back to civilian rule
after the 2008 putsch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counter-narcotics agents from the United States and other
countries, meanwhile, concentrated on smugglers in neighbouring
Guinea-Bissau, a tiny former Portuguese colony dubbed by crime
experts Africa's first "narco-state".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the U.S. State Department's 2013 International
Narcotics Control Strategy Report said seizures in Guinea and
cases abroad traced back there show a spike in trafficking since
Conde won power at a 2010 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of government figures makes estimating volumes
tricky, but a foreign security source said one or two planes
landed each month last year, ferrying in cocaine from Latin
America mostly for smuggling to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever the attitude of the head of state, it's clear that
traffickers can operate in Guinea. They have deep roots there,"
said Stephen Ellis, researcher at the African Studies Centre,
Leiden, in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis said drug money was having a corrosive effect on
attempts by Conde's government to improve governance: "It's
worrying because of the effects not just on the politics of
Guinea, but the whole region."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A July report by Guinea's top anti-drugs agency, seen by
Reuters, said traffickers were operating with protection of
senior civilian, military and police officials. It said proceeds
from the trade are laundered through various channels, including
real estate, fishing companies and local mining operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGHWAY 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea and Guinea-Bissau are at the eastern end of "Highway
10", the nickname given by law enforcement officers for the 10th
parallel north of the equator, the shortest route across the
Atlantic, used by traffickers over the past decade to smuggle
Latin American cocaine destined mainly for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Nations experts estimated last year that some 20
tonnes of cocaine, mostly from Colombia and Venezuela, pass each
year through West Africa, which became an attractive transit
point as U.S. and European authorities cracked down on more
direct routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea's role has surged since last year, when an April U.S.
sting operation targeted Guinea-Bissau's military chief,
prompting traffickers to seek sanctuary in Conakry, law
enforcement officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift of the trade to Guinea raises the stakes. While
Guinea-Bissau is an unstable backwater of just 1.6 million
people that rarely attracts notice outside a small community of
West Africa watchers, Guinea has nearly 8 times as many people
and a much larger regional role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With vast reserves of iron ore, it has also secured billions
of dollars in pledges for investment from mining firms including
Rio Tinto  and Brazil's Vale. A
breakdown of law and order associated with the drugs trade could
have an impact on that investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mouldy, potholed seaside capital, expensive
restaurants, gleaming hotels and new apartment blocks highlight
pockets of wealth. But they soon give way to teeming,
rubbish-strewn neighbourhoods away from the centre of town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are frightened to take the lid off Guinea," said one
foreign official, who, like others interviewed for the story,
declined to be identified. "Authorities know traffickers are
there but are powerless to do anything. They need international
help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that Col. Moussa Tiegboro Camara,
Guinea's top anti-narcotics officer, has been accused of
involvement in a massacre of protesters under the military junta
in 2009, making it impossible for Western nations to cooperate
with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not respond to a request for comment, nor did
officials in Conde's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government spokesman Damantang Camara denied that
trafficking was rising or that the state was complicit: "There
will be no compromise with drug traffickers." (Camara is a
common surname in Guinea and several people in this report who
share the name are not related.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those meant to keep order lack the resources to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Guinean anti-narcotics officer said his men are unarmed,
need money for fuel and are forced to buy second-hand laptops.
The 230 anti-drug agents are too few to police the air strips,
coastal landing points or chaotic main port, making the country
a smuggler's paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local and international officials with access to
intelligence reports say cocaine is increasingly landing by sea
at unmonitored ports or flown in by small planes using remote
air strips. Shipments then often receive military escort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Guinean anti-drugs agents were tipped off about a
boat landing carrying cocaine and tried to scramble officers to
the scene near Boffa, 80 km (50 miles) north of Conakry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn't get very far. Before they left the capital, they
were ordered off the case by other security forces. Their men
later found a boat stained with dried blood and stripped of
identification and communications equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were shut out by the Navy and the Gendarmerie ... They
were hostile to our presence on the ground," said a Guinean
anti-narcotics officer with detailed knowledge of the case.
"There has been a total blackout on the incident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"THE UNTOUCHABLES"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug trafficking in Guinea flourished in the years leading
up to veteran president Lansana Conte's death in 2008. Political
and military elites, including the late president's eldest son
Ousmane Conte, secured the trade, according to Guinean legal
documents and foreign law enforcement officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dadis Camara, the army captain who seized power in the chaos
after the end of Conte's 24-year rule, hauled senior civilian
and military figures before him to confess their roles in drug
trafficking. The inquisitions - known as the Dadis Show - became
popular TV viewing and were used to neutralise rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a signed police transcript, Ousmane Conte admitted in
February 2009 to taking $300,000 from an alleged drug trafficker
who used the late president's son's name to secure clearance for
planes ladened with cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Washington nominated Ousmane Conte a drug kingpin.
But, like others accused of trafficking, the son of the late
president was soon free again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has said on national television: "I confess that I have
participated in the trafficking of drugs, but I am not a
godfather." Reuters was not able to reach him for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is now sidelined. But the Guinean anti-drugs officer said
the network, dubbed "The Untouchables", is back in action: "We
fear they've taken the president hostage. If we don't get
international support, we'll never be able to tackle them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dadis Camara, the junta leader who took over after Lansana
Conte's death, fled Guinea after an assassination attempt in
December 2009. Elections were held the following year, bringing
to power Conde, a longstanding figure in the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conde took office after years in exile abroad. This has left
him vulnerable and reliant on figures who know the system,
according to a diplomat who follows Guinean politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He doesn't know who to trust ... Once they realised that he
barked but did not bite, the networks reformed," the diplomat
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea's drug operations initially shifted to smaller
Guinea-Bissau during a crackdown after Conte's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the July memo by Guinea's top anti-drugs unit, which
reports directly to the president, said traffickers had
"tactically withdrawn" back to Guinea after last year's U.S.
sting operation in the smaller country, which missed its target,
Guinea-Bissau army chief General Antonio Injai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had never gone very far. For a number of years, they
have been in touch with Guinea's cocaine networks," the memo
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN PLAIN VIEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, according to Guinean Supreme Court documents
reviewed by Reuters, the court seized two dozen buildings owned
by suspected traffickers. But legal cases subsequently fell
through and the buildings were returned. They now swell the
property portfolios of people accused by police of trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One, a half-finished, sky-blue building with a dry-cleaner
downstairs, has risen up just down the road from the drug unit's
headquarters, according to the local anti-narcotics officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government spokesman Camara said cases against traffickers
during military rule had not been properly put together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their lawyers had no problem in taking them apart," he
said. "Not all those traffickers were neutralised. That doesn't
mean they are operating again. I don't believe that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a second international law enforcement officer,
several known foreign traffickers, many of them targeted in the
2008-9 crackdown, live in Conakry. They come from countries
including Colombia, Nigeria, Greece, Brazil and Suriname.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a conference in Abu Dhabi in November, Conde touted the
country as "open for business" in a bid to woo Gulf investors.
He won billions of dollars in mining investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Conde faces a tough battle for re-election in 2015. He
must also accomplish the delicate task of keeping in check the
armed forces, implicated in trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are dealing with a government that lacks the most basic
forms of governance ... If you are a narco, the conditions you
would want are all here," said a second Western diplomat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department report said officials tackling
trafficking had been threatened due to their work. A State
Department spokesman, however, said there appeared to be no
significant threats to Guinea's stability from trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the July 2013 memo from Guinea's anti-drug unit
challenged this, calling on Guinea's highest authorities to
"neutralise" traffickers operating in complicity with officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stability of the country depends on it," it warned.&lt;/p&gt;

			Microsoft&#8217;s Story of Hope  Inspiration Captures #1 Spot in the 
      XLVIII Super Bowl, According to Ace Metrix
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Advertisers air smarter creative in the least funny Super Bowl to date
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ace Metrix&#174;, the new standard in television and video advertising 
      analytics, revealed the top 
      performing ads of Super Bowl XLVIII, a game whose best advertising 
      featured heroes, inspiration and patriotism while at the same time was 
      statistically the least funny Super Bowl in years. Microsoft took the 
      top honors with its ad, &#8220;Empowering&#8221; a captivating story of inspiration 
      and tenacity, earning the second highest Ace Score in history at 710. 
      Budweiser and Hyundai tied for 2nd place with two very 
      different creative approaches. Budweiser&#8217;s &#8220;Puppy Love&#8221; continues its 
      winning Clydesdale streak, while Hyundai&#8217;s &#8220;Dad&#8217;s Sixth Sense&#8221; produced 
      one of the only ads of the game to be both effective and humorous. The 
      least effective brands this year included Carmax, GoldieBlox, and, for 
      the second-year running, GoDaddy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Super Bowl advertisers seized the opportunity to inspire rather than 
      divide this year. Many of the advertisers were smarter about their 
      creative approach and rewarded the enormous, demographically balanced 
      audience that is the Super Bowl. The best ads employed a range of 
      creative strategies delivering ads that inspired, applauded and 
      celebrated America,&#8221; said Peter Daboll, CEO of Ace Metrix.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Statistically, Super Bowl XLVIII delivered the most effective 
      advertising since Ace Metrix began tracking the game in 2010. Scores for 
      this year&#8217;s game averaged 574 versus 552 for each of the past two years. 
      Super Bowl advertisers also upped their use of celebrity, not just in 
      the number of spots (+10% over 2013), but also in the sheer number that 
      appeared in the ads. Radio Shack triumphed with its 80s-era, celebrity 
      filled ad, capturing fourth place for the game while Subway and Bud 
      Light also delivered multiple celebrities &#8211; but with less success.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Big Day for Seattle, Between the Lines and Between Breaks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft earned the title of most effective ad of the game with an Ace 
      Score of 710, the second ad ever to break 700. Microsoft eloquently 
      demonstrated the expansiveness of their technology portfolio as 
      evidenced by the ad&#8217;s broad demographic appeal, scoring high on a number 
      of dimensions including Emotion, Attention and Likeability as well as 
      Change and Information &#8211; a difficult feat. The ad incorporated former 
      NFL player Steve Gleason, who is currently fighting ALS, among a montage 
      of inspiring people leveraging technology to overcome a variety of 
      challenges while deftly weaving in Skype, Kinect, Surface and Windows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Stories and Tributes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Super Bowl XLVIII marked a noticeable shift towards longer format 
      storytelling. Forty three percent of ads were :60 or longer &#8211; up from 30 
      percent last year and less in years&#8217; prior. Almost 25 percent of the ads 
      in the 2014 game chose to feature stories of patriotism and heroes, 
      including Budweiser&#8217;s &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Welcome&#8221; (Ace Score 675) which ranked 
      fifth, as well as Coca-Cola&#8217;s, Chevrolet&#8217;s and Chrysler&#8217;s deeply 
      Americana influenced pieces.

      Although as many as ever attempted humor, the game was 12% less funny 
      than last year, with the lowest average Funny Index of the past five 
      years. Approximately 67% of ads each year attempt humor including 6 of 
      the top 10 ads, but advertisers used a safer, smarter approach to humor 
      this year, vying for the relatable chuckle rather than the polarizing 
      risks of years past.

            *Definition: Ace Score is the measure of ad creative 
            effectiveness based on viewer reaction to national TV ads. 
            Respondents are randomly selected and representative of the U.S. 
            TV viewing audience. The results are presented on a scale of 
            1-950, which represents scoring on creative attributes such as 
            Persuasion, Relevance, Information, Attention, Change, Desire and 
            Watchability.

      Automotive continues to dominate the air-time with 23 percent of all ads 
      and 31 percent of the ad time dedicated to Auto brands. Hyundai tied for 
      second
			overall with an effective product demonstration 
      wrapped in a comical story of &#8220;Dad&#8217;s Sixth Sense&#8221; &#8211; the only auto ad to 
      earn one of the top two overall Super Bowl 
      spots in Ace Score history. Hyundai&#8217;s second ad &#8220;Nice&#8221;, featured 
      celebrity Johnny Galecki and used humor while effectively calling 
      attention to the car&#8217;s features, rounds out the ten most effective 
      automotive ads.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Newcomer to the Auto Bowl, Jaguar rounds out the top 10 with a celebrity 
      rich piece that appealed to the mass affluent viewing audience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chrysler&#8217;s highly anticipated ad featuring Bob Dylan earned the highest 
      Ace Score of the advertiser&#8217;s three spots at 609 and was also the 
      longest spot of the night, clocking in at a full two minutes.

			MAP Launches Program to Succeed Soon-to-End Visa Extras
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Issuers wanting to have a card rewards program must begin the process 
      by March 10, 2014
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, Member Access Pacific (MAP), the Seattle-based Credit Union 
      Service Organization and only aggregator of Visa DPS processing platform 
      for credit unions, announced a turnkey program for the Visa Debit and 
      Credit issuers to convert to a new loyalty program from the soon-to-end 
      Visa Extras.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For issuers wanting to continue a loyalty program for their members, 
      this is a timely opportunity to make the switch to a new program,&#8221; 
      states Cyndie Martini, MAP&#8217;s President and CEO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa announced in late 2013 that its loyalty program, Visa Extras, would 
      end by early 2015. For issuers wanting to continue providing a loyalty 
      program for their cardholders, Visa requires the issuer to find a new, 
      third-party provider and notify Visa that they are migrating their 
      program by March 10.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Member Access Pacific is partnering with credit unions to help them 
      migrate existing points from their rewards programs to Augeo Marketing, 
      which provides turnkey credit and debit card loyalty solutions. Augeo&#8217;s 
      enterprise solutions allow credit unions to reward members for making 
      everyday purchases. Points can be redeemed for merchandise, gift cards, 
      travel, charitable donations, cash back and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa will begin migrating debit and credit card issuers in April 2014. 
      While Visa Extras is ending, Visa will continue to provide customer 
      support for 90 days after the cardholders&#8217; last redeem date, expected to 
      be in late 2014. Customer support for travel rewards redeemed will 
      continue for 180 days after the last redeem date, through mid-2015.

		&lt;/p&gt;

			Silicon 
      Turnkey Solutions&#8482; (STS), a leading provider of 
      design-to-product-enablement and single-source engineering solutions, 
      announced it has acquired a technology license, patent license, and tool 
      purchase agreement for manufacturing and rework rights to the&#160;IBM Column 
      Grid Array (CGA) column attach process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The column attach (CA) is a specialized final assembly process vital to 
      the High Reliability component needs of our customers in the Aerospace  
      Defense market place,&#8221; commented Marti McCurdy, VP of Silicon 360; a 
      division of STS. "STS is committed to provide the column attach services 
      following identical processes, materials, and workmanship standards as 
      customers have been accustomed to historically from IBM." She stated 
      that the CA line will extend the availability of this process and 
      technology well into the future providing a solution to the "critical" 
      process pioneered by IBM, and removing any DMS concern for our National 
      Defense Sector.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Amazon Continues to Dominate IaaS/PaaS Despite Strong Push From Microsoft  IBM&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;RENO, NV--(Marketwired - Feb 3, 2014) - &#160;New Q4 data from Synergy Research Group shows that Amazon (AWS) maintains its dominant leadership of the IaaS/PaaS market, despite Microsoft, Google and IBM all exceeding its growth rate in the quarter. The three global IT giants are all making a major push in cloud infrastructure services, with Microsoft and IBM almost doubling their IaaS/PaaS revenues over the fourth quarter of 2012. But in a total market that grew by 52%, Amazon grew by 65% and increased its worldwide market share to over 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With most of the major operators having now released their earnings data for Q4, Synergy estimates that IaaS/PaaS quarterly revenue reached the $3 billion milestone, with full-year 2013 revenues falling just short of $10 billion. Total AWS revenues exceeded $1 billion in the final quarter and were well over $3 billion for the full year, with the great majority of that resulting from its IaaS and PaaS offerings. IBM and Microsoft can also point to impressively large cloud revenues, but much of those revenues come from software, private cloud services, cloud-related hardware products and associated professional and technical services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big three global IT vendors are putting the pedal to the metal on cloud infrastructure services and are rapidly expanding their service footprints and revenues," said John Dinsdale, a Chief Analyst and Research Director at Synergy Research Group. "However, while they are gaining market share it is not at the expense of Amazon. It is doing a very impressive job of maintaining its leadership in this strategically important high-growth market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Synergy Research Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synergy provides quarterly market sizing and segmentation data on cloud infrastructure services and related markets, including operator revenues by segment and by region.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's experimental breast cancer drug significantly delayed progression of symptoms in a mid-stage trial, meeting the study's primary goal and keeping Pfizer in the forefront of a race for a new standard of care for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up nearly 4 percent on positive findings for the oral treatment, called palbociclib, one of the company's most important experimental drugs that some analysts believe could eventually claim annual sales of more than $5 billion, if approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial tested the pill in post-menopausal patients with locally advanced or newly diagnosed breast cancer that had spread to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are delighted with the final data," Pfizer said in a release, adding the company will discuss the successful data on progression-free survival with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration "to determine next steps" for palbociclib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secondary goal of the study is to determine whether palbociclib can prolong overall survival. But Pfizer spokeswoman Sally Beatty said the company does not yet have such data, because it takes longer periods to follow patients and gauge survival trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Pfizer is conducting two larger late-stage trials of palbociclib, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted the company has previously said it might discuss with the FDA the potential to seek approval of the medicine based upon mid-stage trial data, if the data warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palbociclib, which blocks enzymes known as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6, was taken in combination with a standard treatment called letrozole among women who were estrogen receptor positive - meaning tumors grow in response to estrogen - and HER2-negative, meaning that the HER2 protein is not causing the cancer. Such patients make up about 60 percent of advanced breast cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letrozole is the chemical name of Femara, a Novartis AG drug that belongs to a class of treatments called aromatase inhibitors that block production of estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on Monday did not present detailed data from the trial results, saying they would be presented at a scientific meeting in San Diego in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGHLY IMPRESSIVE EARLIER DATA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of the trial, called Paloma-1, follows highly favorable interim data that Pfizer unveiled in December 2012. At that point in the study, those taking both palbociclib and letrozole went an average of 26.1 months before tumors worsened. That compared with 7.5 months for those taking letrozole, but not palbociclib. The 18.6-month difference was considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects from palbociclib were similar to those previously reported, Pfizer said on Monday. The earlier interim results had shown that patients taking the drug combination experienced anemia, fatigue and neutropenia - a decline in white blood cells called neutrophils that can put patients at higher risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palbociclib was designated a "breakthrough" drug by the FDA last April based on initial data from the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA grants "breakthrough" status to drugs that may offer substantial improvement over existing treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases. The status helps to speed up the approval process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has started two late-stage trials of the drug - Paloma-2 and Paloma-3 - in patients with advanced breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paloma-2 will test the same drug combination, palbociclib and letrozole, as an initial treatment for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paloma-3 will evaluate palbociclib in combination with another hormone therapy, fulvestrant, in women whose cancer has progressed after hormonal therapy. The drug, sold under the brand name Faslodex by AstraZeneca Plc, is called an estrogen receptor antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies trying to develop treatments similar to palbociclib include Novartis and Eli Lilly &amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer killed more than 508,000 women worldwide in 2011, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 3.7 percent at $31.53 on Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York; additional reporting by Esha Dey in Bangalore; editing by Ted Kerr and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

			Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced enhancements to its 
      U.S. oil and natural gas portfolio managed by subsidiary, XTO Energy 
      Inc., through separate agreements in the Permian Basin in Texas and 
      Utica shale in Ohio.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These transactions underscore our commitment to developing high-margin 
      liquids growth in areas such as the Permian, while also efficiently 
      funding development of our extensive domestic natural gas resource in 
      emerging plays such as the Utica,&#8221; said Randy Cleveland, president of 
      XTO Energy Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through an agreement with Endeavor Energy Resources, L.P., XTO will fund 
      development to gain substantial operating equity in approximately 34,000 
      gross acres in the prolific liquids-rich Wolfcamp formation in Midland 
      and Upton counties. Endeavor will continue to operate shallow production 
      while XTO will drill and operate horizontal wells in the deeper 
      intervals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The agreement increases XTO&#8217;s holdings in the Permian Basin to just over 
      1.5 million net acres, enhancing the company&#8217;s significant presence in 
      one of the major U.S. growth areas for onshore oil production.

      &#8220;The Wolfcamp shale is a vast, tight oil resource with tremendous 
      potential,&#8221; said Cleveland. &#8220;The presence of multiple, stacked pay zones 
      creates the potential for capital-efficient horizontal development, and 
      the proximity to XTO&#8217;s ongoing Wolfcamp operations will offer operating 
      cost efficiencies.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a separate transaction involving its holdings in the Utica shale, XTO 
      signed an agreement with American Energy &#8211; Utica, LLC (AEU) following a 
      competitive bid process. The agreement will enable AEU to earn 
      approximately 30,000 net acres of XTO&#8217;s Ohio leasehold in Harrison, 
      Jefferson and Belmont counties. XTO will continue to operate in a core 
      area of approximately 55,000 net acres, optimizing development by using 
      proceeds from the transaction to fund 100 percent of near-term 
      development costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We just initiated development in the Utica and are encouraged by 
      results from our initial well that is producing at a peak 30-day rate of 
      about 15 million cubic feet of dry gas per day,&#8221; Cleveland said. &#8220;The 
      agreement funds near-term development of a substantial operating 
      position in this emerging play.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XTO grew its production in the Appalachia region by almost 30 percent in 
      2013, and maintains a strong presence with about 645,000 acres in the 
      Marcellus and Utica shale plays.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XTO manages a portfolio that has tripled in size since 2009 when the 
      merger with ExxonMobil was announced.

			SYNNEX Corporation Completes Initial Close of IBM CRM Acquisition
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Christopher Caldwell promoted to Executive Vice-President and 
      President of Concentrix Corporation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SYNNEX Corporation (NYSE: SNX), a leading business process services 
      company, today announced the completion of the initial close of the 
      acquisition of IBM&#8217;s customer relationship management (CRM) business on 
      January 31, 2014. IBM&#8217;s CRM business will be combined with Concentrix, a 
      wholly-owned subsidiary of SYNNEX, to become one of the world&#8217;s foremost 
      customer engagement services companies in the $55 billion+ CRM BPO 
      market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company also announced that Christopher Caldwell has been promoted 
      to Executive Vice-President and President of Concentrix Corporation, and 
      will lead the combined organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This transformational acquisition makes Concentrix a global Top 10 
      player in a growing market,&#8221; stated Kevin Murai, President and CEO of 
      SYNNEX Corporation. &#8220;Our collective strengths in the CRM BPO market 
      including a strong team of executives and recurring revenues from IBM&#8217;s 
      blue-chip client base have created a truly compelling value proposition 
      for our shareholders.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concentrix is now a global leader in customer engagement, technology and 
      process innovation, due to the combined scale, tools and industry 
      expertise of IBM and the agility, flexibility, velocity and client focus 
      of Concentrix. Through this acquisition, as well as the ongoing, 
      long-term strategic partnership with IBM as preferred provider for CRM 
      solutions for their clients, Concentrix will provide organizations with 
      the innovative solutions and customer engagement capabilities to 
      differentiate their brand and services from those of their competitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Enabling our clients&#8217; customer strategy and supporting transactions 
      with operational excellence has always been the foundation of our 
      success. This acquisition continues to extend our portfolio, delivery 
      capabilities and geographic reach to help organizations around the world 
      deliver innovative, high-value interactions at every stage of the 
      customer engagement lifecycle&#8221; said Chris Caldwell, President, 
      Concentrix Corporation. &#8220;Upon final closing, Concentrix will provide 
      customer engagement and industry process services for clients in 10 
      industry verticals with an expanded global footprint of more than 43,000 
      staff in over 36 countries.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Estimated Financial Impact of Acquisition to Consolidated SYNNEX 
      Corporation Financials:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Approximately $120 million of EBITDA weighted towards the latter part 
        of the first 12 months following the initial close due to a higher 
        cost structure in the near term as the business moves from IBM to 
        Concentrix. The amount excludes one-time acquisition related expenses 
        and restructuring charges.
      
			
        One-time acquisition-related expenses - primarily professional fees 
        and transaction-related expenses -are estimated at $35-45 million for 
        the fiscal year end November 30, 2014.
      
			
        Amortization expense is estimated to be $40 million for fiscal 2014.
      
			
        Depreciation expense is estimated to be $15 million for fiscal 2014.
      
			
        As part of the $505 million purchase price, SYNNEX has delivered 
        approximately 1.27 million shares of SYNNEX common stock valued at $75 
        million to IBM.
      
			
        Interest expense related to the financing of the initial $355 million 
        cash purchase price and working capital needs will approximate $8-10 
        million for the balance of fiscal year 2014. $75 million of the 
        purchase price payment is deferred until subsequent closings are 
        completed.
      
			
        Total revenues from the IBM CRM business will be dependent on the 
        timing of successive closings, the timing of novation of customer 
        contracts, and the fact that some contracts will be conducted under 
        sub-contract from IBM. We expect, however, that successive closings 
        and novation will occur within the next 12 months. Updated U.S. GAAP 
        revenue projections from this transaction will be provided during the 
        Company&#8217;s first quarter 2014 earnings release and in subsequent 
        quarters.
      
			
        Excluding one-time acquisition related charges, the one month impact 
        of the IBM CRM business will not be material to SYNNEX&#8217; fiscal first 
        quarter results for the period ended February 28, 2014.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited about the client base coming over from IBM. After the 
      initial integration and planned expiration of certain lower margin 
      contracts, we expect to grow revenue and earnings for the combined 
      business,&#8221; stated Kevin Murai, President and CEO of SYNNEX Corporation. 
      &#8220;We have long been committed to delivering high quality, innovative 
      services and this acquisition will significantly extend our portfolio 
      and our delivery capabilities.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 3 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said its experimental
breast cancer drug, in a mid-stage trial, showed a statistically
significant improvement in patients' survival rates without
their disease worsening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug palbociclib was tested in post-menopausal patients
in combination with the hormonal therapy letrozole, and results
were compared with patients receiving only letrozole.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Announces Positive Top-Line Results From PALOMA-1 Evaluating 
      Palbociclib Plus Letrozole in Women with Advanced Breast Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Clinical Benefit Demonstrated For Potential First-in-Class CDK 4 
      and 6 Inhibitor
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the randomized Phase 2 trial 
      [PALOMA-1] of palbociclib achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating 
      a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 
      progression-free survival (PFS) for the combination of palbociclib and 
      letrozole compared with letrozole alone in post-menopausal women with 
      estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 
      2 negative (HER2-) locally advanced or newly diagnosed metastatic breast 
      cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted with the final data, which suggest the potential for 
      palbociclib to transform the standard of care for post-menopausal women 
      with ER+ and HER2- advanced breast cancer. This is encouraging 
      information for these women, who represent approximately 60 percent of 
      the advanced breast cancer population,&#8221; said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior 
      vice president of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs and chief 
      medical officer for Pfizer Oncology. &#8220;We will discuss these results with 
      the FDA and other regulatory authorities to determine next steps, with 
      the goal of bringing a much-needed new medicine to patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Adverse events observed for the palbociclib arm were consistent with the 
      known adverse event profile for this combination. Detailed efficacy and 
      safety data from PALOMA-1 will be submitted for presentation at the 
      American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2014 
      scheduled for April 5-9th in San Diego.

      Palbociclib received Breakthrough Therapy designation by the United 
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2013, for the initial 
      treatment of women with advanced or metastatic ER+, HER2- breast cancer. 
      This designation was based on interim data from the PALOMA-1 trial. A 
      randomized, global Phase 3 trial (PALOMA-2) in this patient population 
      is currently enrolling patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About PALOMA-1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PALOMA-1 (also known as Study 1003) is a Phase 2 trial designed to 
      assess the PFS of palbociclib (125 mg once daily for three out of four 
      weeks in repeated cycles) in combination with letrozole versus letrozole 
      alone (2.5 mg once daily on a continuous regimen) in post-menopausal 
      women with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. PFS is comprised of time 
      from randomization to time of disease progression or death from any 
      cause. PALOMA-1 was conducted in collaboration with the Jonsson Cancer 
      Center&#8217;s Revlon/UCLA Women&#8217;s Cancer Research Program. PALOMA-1 is a 
      multi-center trial with 101 global sites participating.

			Palbociclib Development Program in ER+, HER2- Breast Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has worked closely with investigators and international breast 
      cancer experts to establish a robust development program for palbociclib 
      in ER+, HER2- breast cancer across stages and treatment settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has initiated two Phase 3 studies of palbociclib in 
      advanced/metastatic breast cancer. PALOMA-2 (also known as Study 1008) 
      is a randomized (2:1), multi-center, double blind Phase 3 study that 
      evaluates palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole 
      plus placebo as first-line treatment for post-menopausal patients with 
      ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer.1 PALOMA-3 (also known as 
      Study 1023) is a randomized (2:1), multi-center, double blind Phase 3 
      study that evaluates palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant versus 
      fulvestrant plus placebo in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), 
      HER2- metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior 
      endocrine therapy.2
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional, investigator-led studies of palbociclib in 
      advanced/metastatic breast cancer and in early breast cancer are open 
      and enrolling patients, including PENELOPE-B, a randomized (1:1), double 
      blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study comparing palbociclib plus 
      standard endocrine therapy to placebo plus standard endocrine therapy in 
      patients with HR+, HER2-normal (also known as HER2-) early-stage breast 
      cancer with certain features that suggest an increased risk for 
      recurrence after completing pre-operative chemotherapy followed by 
      surgery.3 This international study is sponsored by the German 
      Breast Group (GBG).

			About Palbociclib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palbociclib is an investigational oral targeted agent that selectively 
      inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 to regain cell cycle 
      control and block tumor cell proliferation.4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Loss of cell cycle control is a hallmark of cancer and CDK 4/6 are 
      overactivated in numerous cancers, leading to loss of proliferative 
      control.5,6 CDK 4/6 are key regulators of the cell cycle that 
      trigger cellular progression from growth phase (G1) into phases 
      associated with DNA replication (S).7,8 CDK 4/6, whose 
      increased activity is frequent in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) 
      breast cancer (BC), are key downstream targets of ER signaling in ER+ BC.9,10 
      Preclinical data suggest that dual inhibition of CDK 4/6 and ER 
      signaling is synergistic and has been shown to stop growth of ER+ BC 
      cell lines in the G1 phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palbociclib is not approved for any indication in any markets.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is increasing its investment in an upscale chain of fitness clubs founded by a Russian former fencer, betting lifestyle spending will grow despite an economic slowdown and slide in the rouble currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman's Special Situations Group (SSG) has been clinching bite-sized deals in Russia, backing entrepreneurs looking to capitalize on the country's rising middle class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSG already owned 12.5 percent of the chain, called World Class. Under the latest deal, SSG and Russian bank VTB (VTBR.MM) will buy out a stake owned by Alfa Capital Partners, an investment unit of billionaire Mikhail Fridman's Alfa Group, and will jointly own 50 percent of the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We like the business, it is an established platform - one of the most well-known brands in Russia and it operates in the premium segment," said Maxim Klimov, head of Goldman's European SSG in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klimov said World Class has a loyal customer base which would give the business resilience as the economy slows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumer demand may be (slowing down), but this doesn't ... change the investment thesis - it just makes the bar a little higher and we're still bullish on the long-term picture across the cycle," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World Class was founded by former fencer Olga Slutsker, who was inspired to open her first fitness center in 1993 by visiting a modern club in Spain which contrasted with her experience of unheated and overcrowded Russian gyms. Membership costs around $2,500 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMALLER DEALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman first invested in World Class in 2006 and its five-strong team has since struck a string of mainly private equity-type deals in Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, favoring investments that benefit from consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSG invests the bank's own money rather than using more traditional private equity structures which raise funds from third parties. That allows it to pursue sub-$50 million deals that would fall outside the purview of larger buyout firms, said Klimov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many (international private equity players) haven't made inroads here because they have large funds and need to invest large tickets," said Klimov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While U.S. buyout group TPG TPG.UL has made successful investments in Russia, rivals such as Blackstone (BX.N) and KKR (KKR.N) have stayed on the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small deals can be highly profitable, said Klimov, noting its investment in entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov's consumer credit firm TCS (TCSq.L), which went public in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman initially invested in TCS at the end of 2007 in a deal which valued the business at $100 million. TCS currently has a stock market value of nearly $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also recently closed on a follow-on investment in RosEuroDevelopment, a real estate company it first invested in during 2008, he said.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Energy Technology Company (NYSE:CVX) and GE Oil  Gas (NYSE:GE) 
      announced today the creation of the Chevron GE Technology Alliance, 
      which will develop and commercialize valuable technologies to solve 
      critical issues for the oil and gas industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Alliance builds upon a current collaboration on flow analysis 
      technology for oil and gas wells and will leverage research and 
      development from GE&#8217;s newest Global Research Center, the first dedicated 
      to oil and gas technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;GE brings its leading manufacturing capabilities, worldwide marketing, 
      distribution, and extensive RD capabilities not only for oil and gas, 
      but also other business sectors to this alliance,&#8221; said Paul Siegele, 
      president of Chevron Energy Technology Company and chief technology 
      officer. &#8220;Together, we hope to bring impactful new technologies to the 
      industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s deep understanding of the oil and gas industry, combined with 
      GE&#8217;s long tradition of technology development and close collaboration 
      with strategic partners, will uniquely position this new alliance to 
      address the industry&#8217;s technology needs,&#8221; said Lorenzo Simonelli, 
      president and CEO, GE Oil  Gas. &#8220;The solutions developed by this 
      alliance will take on even more industry significance given Chevron&#8217;s 
      proven leadership in being first to field-test and deploy new technology 
      breakthroughs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This partnership builds upon an ongoing collaboration between Chevron 
      and GE developing the GE Safire&#8482; flow meter, now being tested and 
      deployed on Chevron land-based well production lines in the western 
      United States. In addition to the flow metering collaboration, which is 
      being conducted with the Measurement  Control business within GE Oil  
      Gas, the Alliance also is managing a coatings project and will be taking 
      on additional high-value projects in the near future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Alliance provides a mechanism for commercializing early stage 
      technologies from Chevron, GE or other technology partnerships. For 
      example, GE flow meter products will be developed incorporating the 
      Swept Frequency Acoustic Interferometry (SFAI) metering technology 
      incubated in an alliance between Chevron and Los Alamos National 
      Laboratory (LANL). SFAI technology was originally developed by LANL for 
      defense applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Los Alamos develops unique technologies for our national security 
      missions and these can have powerful applications for U.S. industry," 
      said Duncan McBranch, chief technology officer for Los Alamos National 
      Laboratory. "Strategic partnerships with industry allow us to accelerate 
      breakthrough innovation in these areas. As the Chevron GE technology 
      alliance demonstrates, national laboratories can serve an important role 
      in connecting different industry partners to strengthen the U.S. 
      innovation landscape.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s deep understanding of the oil and gas industry, combined with 
      GE&#8217;s long tradition of technology development and close collaboration 
      with strategic partners, will uniquely position this new alliance to 
      address the industry&#8217;s technology needs,&#8221; said Lorenzo Simonelli, 
      president and CEO, GE Oil  Gas. &#8220;The solutions developed by this 
      alliance will take on even more industry significance given Chevron&#8217;s 
      proven leadership in being first to field-test and deploy new technology 
      breakthroughs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This partnership builds upon an ongoing collaboration between Chevron 
      and GE developing the GE Safire&#8482; flow meter, now being tested and 
      deployed on Chevron land-based well production lines in the western U.S. 
      In addition to the flow metering collaboration, which is being conducted 
      with the Measurement  Control business within GE Oil  Gas, the 
      Alliance is also managing a coatings project and will be taking on 
      additional high-value projects in the near future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Alliance provides a mechanism for commercializing early stage 
      technologies from Chevron, GE or other technology partnerships. For 
      example, GE flow meter products will be developed incorporating the 
      Swept Frequency Acoustic Interferometry (SFAI) metering technology 
      incubated in an alliance between Chevron and Los Alamos National 
      Laboratory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Los Alamos develops unique technologies and these can have powerful 
      applications for U.S. industry,&#8221;&#160;said Duncan McBranch,&#160;chief technology 
      officer for Los Alamos National Laboratory.&#160;&#8220;Strategic partnerships with 
      industry allow us to accelerate breakthrough innovation in these areas. 
      As the alliance demonstrates, national laboratories can serve an 
      important role in connecting different industry partners to strengthen 
      the U.S. innovation landscape.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) settled the latest in a string of legal claims on Tuesday when it agreed to pay $614 million to the U.S. government and admitted that it defrauded federal agencies by underwriting sub-standard mortgage loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said as part of the settlement that for more than a decade it approved thousands of insured loans that were not eligible for insurance by the Federal Housing Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs, according to court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, "both the FHA and the VA incurred substantial losses when unqualified loans failed and caused the FHA and VA to cover the associated losses," the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is one of several banks that has faced similar allegations. Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) have also reached settlements, while the Justice Department is seeking $2.1 billion in penalties from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) after a jury found the bank liable for fraud over mortgages sold by its Countrywide unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan agreed to about $20 billion in settlements in its drive to clear up legal claims. The deals covered claims over other mortgage issues, as well as derivatives and power trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest settlement was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and was approved by Judge J. Paul Oetken, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said in a statement that the "settlement represents another significant step in the firm's efforts to put historical mortgage-related issues behind it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that it has already recorded reserves for the settlement and does not expect the deal to have any significant additional financial impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement with the Justice Department began with a whistleblower, Keith Edwards, who sued JPMorgan in January 2013 under an anti-fraud law known as the False Claims Act. The law allows individuals to sue government contractors and suppliers for defrauding taxpayers. Whisteblowers can keep a slice of the penalty if successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has not been determined what Edwards' share will be, according to court papers. The existence of his suit was sealed until Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The office of Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan whose staff worked with Edwards on the suit, said the case was one of eight civil fraud suits that it had brought since May 2011 alleging fraudulent lending practices by residential mortgage lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2012, Citigroup agreed to pay $158.3 million and Flagstar Bancorp Inc (FBC.N) agreed to pay $132.8 million. In May 2012, Deutsche Bank settled for $202.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other recent legal claims, JPMorgan on Monday agreed to pay $1.45 million to settle four-year-old allegations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the bank had maintained a sexually hostile environment for women in a mortgage loan center on Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday a federal bankruptcy judge approved the bank's $543 million deal to end two private lawsuits stemming from its relationship with convicted Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernard Madoff. Last month, the bank separately agreed to pay more than $2 billion to settle criminal charges related to the Madoff fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Bernard Orr and Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is betting a mix of old and young blood will revive the aging technology pioneer, but new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella may find it tough to push change with co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer breathing down his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 46-year-old India native and former enterprise business chief takes on the monumental task of exploring new directions - but with Gates as his consigliere, and on a strategy that Ballmer orchestrated with the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That uphill endeavor helped sour other candidates on the job, including proven change agent Alan Mulally at Ford Motor Co, sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates is giving up the board chairmanship to fellow director John Thompson. That, plus Nadella's promotion, marks a changing of the guard at a 39-year-old company that fueled the PC revolution, but is struggling with its longer-term identity after missing the boat on the mobile computing revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've got a triumvirate running the company: Satya as the new CEO, Bill as the product adviser and John Thompson running the board. A lot depends on how the three of them get along," said Bill George, Harvard Business School professor and former Medtronic Inc CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big question I have is, is Satya really going to be allowed to make the transformative changes that Microsoft needs to make, both at the product level and at the people level?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares closed 0.4 percent lower at $36.35 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Microsoft focuses on "devices and services" rather than licensing software, and seeks to emulate Apple's success in marrying popular online services with attractive gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set by the retiring Ballmer last year, that vision has proven unpopular with investors hoping either that Microsoft will stop plowing billions into mobile devices - as it is doing with its Nokia acquisition - or come up with new products to take on mobile leaders Apple Inc and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a bigger-picture perspective, I don't think much is going to change," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. "The strategy that was put in place in 2013 is where the company is headed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Gates - who may again become a regular sight around Microsoft's Redmond, Washington, campus after pledging to spend a third of his time as the new CEO's adviser - stressed that Nadella's cloud computing expertise qualified him to lead Microsoft into the new arena of mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Satya's got the right background to lead the company during this era," he said. "There's a challenge in mobile computing. There's an opportunity in the cloud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella got a rich pay rise on his promotion, with a salary of $1.2 million, a maximum annual cash bonus of three times that and a stock award of $13.2 million for next fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is much more than the moderately paid Ballmer, who took home less than $1.3 million last year, chiefly because of his refusal to take stock awards, which he deemed unnecessary given his ownership of $12 billion worth of Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's pay is modest in comparison to tech superstar Marissa Mayer, who got a compensation package that could total more than $70 million when she took the helm at Yahoo Inc two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROS, CONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online element may play to the strengths of Nadella, who led the creation of Microsoft's Internet, or cloud, services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella has pushed the company in the direction of an Internet-based future, using its network of vast data centers to host products such as Office 365, a subscription-based online version of its ubiquitous business software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He "bashed heads together on the product teams to get them to support cloud deployment in a consistent way," said Ted Schadler, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. "Every software company has to engineer this shift to software as a service, because 10 years from now there'll be no such thing as a licensed piece of software."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella is only its third CEO in 39 years, taking over from Ballmer, who inherited the job from Gates in 2000. His appointment ends a five-month search process triggered by the August announcement of Ballmer's decision to retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was longer than many investors had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a relief this process is over," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "Many investors view it as the 'safe pick' as Mr. Nadella is a born-and-bred Redmond insider. But the uphill battle continues for Microsoft on its path to growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is also a significant shift for Gates, who along with Apple's Steve Jobs was one of the key forces who shaped the personal computer revolution of the late 20th century, making him an icon of the new information economy and the world's richest person in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates, 58, left day-to-day work at Microsoft in 2008 to focus on philanthropy at his Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which he says is still his main job. He owns 4.3 percent of Microsoft's outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Satya's asked me to step up, substantially increasing the time that I spend at the company," Gates said in a video statement. "I'll have over a third of my time available to meet with product groups. It'll be fun to define this next round of products, working together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who describes himself as a cricket and poetry lover, called the appointment "humbling" in an email to employees. In a videotaped statement, he said he would focus on "ruthlessly" removing any obstacles to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from Ford Motor's Mulally, Nadella also beat out other candidates for the job. Several were close to the company, like Stephen Elop, set to rejoin Microsoft when its acquisition of Nokia's handset business closes, and Tony Bates, the former Skype boss now in charge of business development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most agree that Nadella's background makes him a safe pair of hands to take the company forward, but there remains a question over his ability to make Microsoft a hit with consumers or with impatient shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Microsoft faces a slow erosion of its PC-centric Windows and Office franchises, some investors are campaigning for retrenchment and a bigger cut of the company's cash pile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ValueAct Capital, which led a shareholder revolt last year that culminated in Ballmer's retirement, has pushed for the company to abandon ambitions to be a hardware maker, focus on its strengths with business software and return more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means refocusing on Office and Windows and distributing more of Microsoft's $84 billion in cash and short-term investments, though most of that is held overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's immediate task may be to balance the demands of long- and short-term investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a balance that John Thompson is going to provide," said Parakh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan; Writing by Christian Plumb; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Lisa Von Ahn, Matthew Lewis and Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal bankruptcy judge on Tuesday approved JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) $543 million deal to end two private lawsuits stemming from its relationship with convicted Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernard Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC confirmed that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein approved the agreement, which was made public on January 7, the same day federal authorities announced the bank had agreed to pay more than $2 billion to settle criminal charges related to the Madoff fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay $218 million to resolve class-action litigation and $325 million to resolve claims brought by the trustee, Irving Picard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff was a longtime client of the bank, which was accused of turning a blind eye to suspicious activity within his accounts that suggested fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard has estimated that the Ponzi scheme, the largest in history, cost investors more than $17 billion of principal. To date, he has recovered more than $10 billion for victims, including the JPMorgan settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence. Five of his former aides are currently on trial in New York federal court on charges that they helped Madoff perpetuate his scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, JPMorgan recorded approximately $20 billion of legal settlements in 2013, including $13 billion to resolve claims related to mortgages it packaged leading up to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The settlement represents another significant step in the Firm&#8217;s efforts

&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC confirmed that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein approved the agreement, which was made public on January 7, the same day federal authorities announced the bank had agreed to pay more than $2 billion to settle criminal charges related to the Madoff fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay $218 million to resolve class-action litigation and $325 million to resolve claims brought by the trustee, Irving Picard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff was a longtime client of the bank, which was accused of turning a blind eye to suspicious activity within his accounts that suggested fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard has estimated that the Ponzi scheme, the largest in history, cost investors more than $17 billion of principal. To date, he has recovered more than $10 billion for victims, including the JPMorgan settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence. Five of his former aides are currently on trial in New York federal court on charges that they helped Madoff perpetuate his scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, JPMorgan recorded approximately $20 billion of legal settlements in 2013, including $13 billion to resolve claims related to mortgages it packaged leading up to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 08-1789.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Additional reporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is betting a mix of old and young blood will revive the aging technology pioneer, but new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella may find it tough to push change with co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer breathing down his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 46-year-old India native and former enterprise business chief takes on the monumental task of exploring new directions - but with Gates as his consigliere, and on a strategy that Ballmer orchestrated with the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That uphill endeavor helped sour other candidates on the job, including proven change agent Alan Mulally at Ford Motor Co, sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates is giving up the board chairmanship to fellow director John Thompson. That, plus Nadella's promotion, marks a changing of the guard at a 39-year-old company that fueled the PC revolution, but is struggling with its longer-term identity after missing the boat on the mobile computing revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've got a triumvirate running the company: Satya as the new CEO, Bill as the product adviser and John Thompson running the board. A lot depends on how the three of them get along," said Bill George, Harvard Business School professor and former Medtronic Inc CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big question I have is, is Satya really going to be allowed to make the transformative changes that Microsoft needs to make, both at the product level and at the people level?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares closed 0.4 percent lower at $36.35 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Microsoft focuses on "devices and services" rather than licensing software, and seeks to emulate Apple's success in marrying popular online services with attractive gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set by the retiring Ballmer last year, that vision has proven unpopular with investors hoping either that Microsoft will stop plowing billions into mobile devices - as it is doing with its Nokia acquisition - or come up with new products to take on mobile leaders Apple Inc and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a bigger-picture perspective, I don't think much is going to change," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. "The strategy that was put in place in 2013 is where the company is headed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Gates - who may again become a regular sight around Microsoft's Redmond, Washington, campus after pledging to spend a third of his time as the new CEO's adviser - stressed that Nadella's cloud computing expertise qualified him to lead Microsoft into the new arena of mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Satya's got the right background to lead the company during this era," he said. "There's a challenge in mobile computing. There's an opportunity in the cloud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella got a rich pay rise on his promotion, with a salary of $1.2 million, a maximum annual cash bonus of three times that and a stock award of $13.2 million for next fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is much more than the moderately paid Ballmer, who took home less than $1.3 million last year, chiefly because of his refusal to take stock awards, which he deemed unnecessary given his ownership of $12 billion worth of Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's pay is modest in comparison to tech superstar Marissa Mayer, who got a compensation package that could total more than $70 million when she took the helm at Yahoo Inc two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROS, CONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online element may play to the strengths of Nadella, who led the creation of Microsoft's Internet, or cloud, services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella has pushed the company in the direction of an Internet-based future, using its network of vast data centers to host products such as Office 365, a subscription-based online version of its ubiquitous business software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He "bashed heads together on the product teams to get them to support cloud deployment in a consistent way," said Ted Schadler, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. "Every software company has to engineer this shift to software as a service, because 10 years from now there'll be no such thing as a licensed piece of software."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella is only its third CEO in 39 years, taking over from Ballmer, who inherited the job from Gates in 2000. His appointment ends a five-month search process triggered by the August announcement of Ballmer's decision to retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was longer than many investors had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a relief this process is over," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "Many investors view it as the 'safe pick' as Mr. Nadella is a born-and-bred Redmond insider. But the uphill battle continues for Microsoft on its path to growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is also a significant shift for Gates, who along with Apple's Steve Jobs was one of the key forces who shaped the personal computer revolution of the late 20th century, making him an icon of the new information economy and the world's richest person in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates, 58, left day-to-day work at Microsoft in 2008 to focus on philanthropy at his Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which he says is still his main job. He owns 4.3 percent of Microsoft's outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Satya's asked me to step up, substantially increasing the time that I spend at the company," Gates said in a video statement.

It'll be fun to define this next round of products, working together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who describes himself as a cricket and poetry lover, called the appointment "humbling" in an email to employees. In a videotaped statement, he said he would focus on "ruthlessly" removing any obstacles to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from Ford Motor's Mulally, Nadella also beat out other candidates for the job.

than licensing software, and seeks to emulate Apple's success in
marrying popular online services with attractive gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set by the retiring Ballmer last year, that vision has
proven unpopular with investors hoping either that Microsoft

that culminated in Ballmer's retirement, has pushed for the
company to abandon ambitions to be a hardware maker, focus on
its strengths with business software and return more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means refocusing on Office and Windows and distributing
more of Microsoft's $84 billion in cash and short-term
investments, though most of that is held overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's immediate task may be to balance the demands of
long- and short-term investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a balance that John Thompson is going to provide,"

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Wall Street expects two new princesses and a muscular Marvel superhero to help lift Walt Disney Co's quarterly results, as the company reaps the benefits of strong performances from film sequel "Thor: The Dark World" and animated musical mega-hit "Frozen."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the media and theme park operator is forecast to report $1.6 billion in net income for the December quarter, a 14 percent gain from a year earlier, according to the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. They expect earnings of 91 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's movie studio helped boost the results, analysts said, with big box office grosses for "Frozen" and "Thor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of royal sisters in an icy kingdom, "Frozen" is the fourth-highest grossing animated film released by Disney, so far collecting $868 million worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is just blowing everyone away with how successful it is, how popular it is and how profitable we think it will be," said FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co analyst Barton Crockett, who rates Disney "outperform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crockett on January 29 increased his Disney earnings estimate for the December quarter by 6 cents to 91 cents per share, partly due to the unexpected strength of "Frozen." Before it opened in November, he expected the film would gross about $200 million. He now expects it will approach $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cowen &amp; Co analyst Doug Creutz raised his quarterly revenue estimates for Disney last week by $180 million to $12.54 billion, primarily on higher estimates for the movie division. He forecasts the studio will generate $362 million in operating income this quarter, up 55 percent from $234 million a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thor: The Dark World," a Marvel sequel about the god of thunder, has sold $635 million worth of tickets worldwide. With "Frozen," the two have surpassed a combined $1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSEQUENCES OF NEW STRATEGY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's latest crop of films followed an overhaul that Chief Executive Bob Iger ordered in 2010. The studio began focusing on a smaller number of films from the Disney, Pixar and Marvel brands that had the potential to become franchises that bring in box office receipts, spawn movie sequels, drive toy sales and inspire theme-park rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Disney's movies collected $1.7 billion worth of tickets at U.S. and Canadian theaters, just behind the $1.9 billion for industry leader Warner Bros., according to Box Office Mojo. Disney's returns came from 17 films, half as many as the 34 for Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney released three of last year's top six films. "Iron Man 3" was the year's second-bestselling film, with $409 million. Number four, "Frozen" has sold nearly $359 million in the United States. "Monsters University" was sixth with $268 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Frozen" also marked the reemergence of Walt Disney Animation Studios, the company's traditional animation arm that had fallen behind the films produced by the company's Pixar unit, which Iger acquired in 2006 for $7.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's studio also aggressively used characters from Marvel, the comic book and toy company it acquired in 2009 for $4 billion. It bought back the rights to "Iron Man" and "Thor" from Viacom's Paramount studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marvel helped the company make good on Iger's pledge to make films from which Disney could produce TV shows, sell toys and create rides. It created the TV show "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." for ABC based on its 2012 blockbuster "Marvel's The Avengers," the industry's third-largest film with $1.5 billion in worldwide ticket sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But focusing on a smaller number of larger-budget flicks has a clear downside. The company produced a dud in big-budget Western "The Lone Ranger" starring Johnny Depp as sidekick Tonto. Disney said in August it would lose up to $190 million on the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With fewer films, "if they all hit, you are going to have great results," analyst Creutz said. "The problem is, if one of them misses, you don't have a lot of other places to make them up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Satya Nadella's elevation to CEO and co-founder Bill Gates' decision to relinquish his chairmanship at Microsoft Corp marks a changing of the guard at a 39-year-old company that fueled the PC revolution but is now struggling to establish its long-term identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights in the four-decade journey of the world's largest software maker:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1975 - A 19-year-old Gates drops out of Harvard University and goes on to found Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen. They make their first product - a BASIC programming code interpreter for the Altair 8800 microcomputer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1979 - With sales topping $1 million at the end of 1978, the company moves to Bellevue, Washington, from Albuquerque, New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1980 - In June, Gates recruits former Harvard classmate Steve Ballmer to become the company's first business manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1981 - In August, Microsoft releases its new operating software Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS).

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Feb 4 (Reuters) - Satya Nadella's elevation
to CEO and co-founder Bill Gates' decision to relinquish his
chairmanship at Microsoft Corp marks a changing of the
guard at a 39-year-old company that fueled the PC revolution but
is now struggling to establish its long-term identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights in the four-decade journey of the
world's largest software maker:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1975 - A 19-year-old Gates drops out of Harvard University and
goes on to found Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen.
They make their first product - a BASIC programming code
interpreter for the Altair 8800 microcomputer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1979 -    With sales topping $1 million at the end of 1978, the
company moves to Bellevue, Washington, from Albuquerque, New
Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1980 - In June, Gates recruits former Harvard classmate Steve
Ballmer to become the company's first business manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1981 - In August, Microsoft releases its new operating software
Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS). It begins running on
IBM personal computers - a seminal moment for the company's
future domination of personal computing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1983 - Microsoft announces its new software "Windows," which
aims to enhance the MS-DOS interface with visual features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1985 - After spending two years in development, "Windows 1.0"
begins to ship. Moving on from MS-DOS commands, which some users
found challenging to master, the system used simple clicks of a
mouse to work through tasks on screens or "windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1986 - Microsoft moves its corporate headquarters to Redmond,
Washington. It goes public at $21 per share and raises about $60
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1988 - With the arrival of Windows 2.0 in 1987, computers start
becoming more commonplace in the office. Microsoft becomes the
largest PC software company based on global sales.
 
1990 to 1995 - Windows 3.0 is launched in 1990 and five years
later, Windows 95 is released and sales surpass 1 million copies
in four days. PC sales begin to explode as computers make their
way into homes, schools and business, kicking off the "Windows
era."
  
1995 - With the advent of the Internet, Microsoft introduces its
Web browser "Internet Explorer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1998 - Windows 98, the first consumer-focused version of
Windows, is released. That same year, the U.S. Department of
Justice files antitrust charges against Microsoft relating to
bundling of its programs into its operating systems. U.S.
regulators accuse the company of using its dominance in software
and monopolistic practices to drive competitors out of business.

2000 - Ballmer succeeds Gates as CEO in January. The two met as
students at Harvard, when Gates lived down the hall from
Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2001 - Microsoft reaches a settlement with the Department of
Justice in the 1998 antitrust case. In November, Microsoft
enters the gaming market with the North American release of its
Xbox gaming console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2005 - The next-generation Xbox 360 goes on sale in November.

2006 - Microsoft launches the Zune portable music player in
November, the first Microsoft-designed device to compete in a
market dominated by Apple Inc's iPod. The music player
fails to take off and Microsoft discontinues it by mid-2012.

2007 - In January, Microsoft unveils the widely panned Windows
Vista, the company's least-popular operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2009 - Microsoft revamps its search engine to counter Google's
dominance in Web search and advertising. In May, Ballmer reveals
the new engine, dubbed "Bing." It remains a distant runner-up to
Google today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2010 - Microsoft releases its Windows Phone operating system for
mobiles, trying to woo consumers away from Apple's iPhone and
Google Inc's Android devices. The Windows ecosystem
remains a distant third to Apple's iOS and Google's Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2012 - Microsoft, hoping for a hit, launches Surface tablets and
a Windows 8 operating system that uses touch commands. The
devices have not gained much share in a tablet market dominated
by Apple's iPad, Amazon Inc's Kindle and Samsung
 devices.

2013 - On Aug. 23, Ballmer announces he will step down within 12
months, surprising industry-watchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb. 4, 2014 - Microsoft's board unanimously picks Nadella, 46,
an Indian-born executive who led the creation of Microsoft's
Internet-based or "cloud" computing services. He is only the
company's third CEO in 39 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Fifteen years ago, when Anu Aiyengar went for an interview to become a mergers and acquisitions banker at a major Wall Street firm, she got a stark, disappointing message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You have three strikes against you," Aiyengar, who was born in India, recalled the interviewer telling her. "How can I hire you? You are the wrong gender, wrong color and wrong country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiyengar, now a managing director at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, is seen as one of the rising stars within the largest U.S. bank's M group, advising clients in sectors ranging from retail to industrials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 15 years at JPMorgan, she has worked on around $200 billion worth of transactions. Last year, she advised on such deals as auto parts retailer Advance Auto Parts Inc's $2 billion purchase of General Parts International Inc, and office supply company Office Depot Inc's $1 billion acquisition of rival OfficeMax Inc. JPMorgan was ranked No. 2 in M deals by value globally last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a woman, she said, has proven to be an advantage in connecting with clients, so much so that many become friends or mentors. "Maybe it's stereotypical, but I do feel that listening skills are pretty important," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former OfficeMax CEO Ravi Saligram said Aiyengar gained his trust with her analytical skills and because she spoke her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She's not afraid to push back," Saligram said. "She was not a &#8216;yes' person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Aiyengar said she rarely comes across other women in her business, a reflection of how corporate America and Wall Street remain male-dominated, even if the kind of overt prejudice that she experienced fifteen years ago has receded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women made up 15.6 percent of top executives and managers at U.S. investment banks in 2012, compared with 17.7 percent in 2007, according to annual studies published by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Nesvold, a managing director at the women-owned M advisory firm Silver Lane Advisors, has a similar story to tell. Nesvold, who has been a banker for more than two decades, said it took 16 years until she sat across from another female senior banker during deal negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesvold said she also thinks being a woman helps at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes clients have told me things that I am 100 percent sure they would have not told a man," Nesvold said. "The work-life balance is challenging, while we see a lot of young women come into the profession, we do not see that many senior women stay the course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiyengar said she makes an effort to find that balance. Married for 18 years with no children, Aiyengar, who remains an Indian citizen, said she finds relaxation through Indian classical dance and tries to stay in touch with friends and family outside of banking. She also tries to mentor younger women bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am very passionate about having more women in broader financial services, and especially banking, not just M," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiyengar herself benefited from mentors such as Eric Stein, JPMorgan's head of investment banking coverage for North America, who helped her with everything from learning how to building deal models to the intricacies of American football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He spent six hours on a white board teaching me how to set up a model," she said. "My basic checking models are still set up the way he originally taught me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stein said it is rare to find a banker who can handle a wide range of deals, from financial services to retail. Teaching her American football, however, was another matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no doubt teaching her football was more difficult, but part of the reason was I tried to convince her to join me in being a Buffalo Bills fan," Stein said. "I am proud to say she is getting there after close to 20 years, and much more quickly than I have picked up on cricket."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Feb. 4, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC) applauds Goldman Sachs for naming Dina H. Powell as head of the firm's Urban Investment Group (UIG). Powell's new responsibilities entail leading Goldman Sachs' social impact effort, a $3 billion initiative that has facilitated loans and equity investments to revitalize neighborhoods and provided resources to underserved communities across the nation for the past 13 years.
			
	"The USHCC commends Goldman Sachs' appointment of Dina H. Powell as head of UIG. Ms. Powell's record at the Goldman Sachs Foundation highlights her business acumen and philanthropic spirit - two components that are critical to better serve communities in need," said USHCC President  CEO Javier Palomarez.&#160;"Ms. Powell's visionary leadership at the Office of Corporate Engagement was key to the birth of Goldman Sachs' groundbreaking 10,000 Small Businesses initiative. The USHCC has been a vocal advocate of this program, and we look forward to our continued relationship with Goldman Sachs on this commendable effort which empowers America's small business communities, and elevates our nation's entrepreneurs."
	&#160;
	As part of her portfolio at the Office of Corporate Engagement, Ms. Powell led the $500 million 10,000 Small Businesses initiative, which has&#160;provided valuable resources and trainings in management, access to capital and innovative solutions to emerging entrepreneurs across the nation. Since its launch, the program has assisted hundreds of businesses in seventeen major cities, including Houston, Salt Lake City, New York, Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles. Over 70 percent of the initiative's graduates have reported increased revenues in their businesses within six months of completing the training.
	&#160;
	"Dina Powell's admirable track record stems back to her time as a public servant during the Bush administration. Both her work at the State Department and the White House demonstrated her dedication to underserved communities across the nation and abroad," said USHCC Chairman Emeritus Nina Vaca. "Needless to say, Ms. Powell's impact at the Goldman Sachs Foundation will be felt for years to come, and we look forward to working with her on her latest endeavor as head of the UIG."
	&#160;
			About the USHCC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Founded in 1979, the USHCC actively promotes the economic growth and development of our nation's entrepreneurs. The USHCC advocates on behalf of nearly 3.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses, that together contribute in excess of $468 billion to the&#160;American economy, each year.&#160;As the leading organization of its kind, the USHCC serves as an umbrella to more than 200 local chambers and business associations across the nation, and partners with more than 220 major corporations.

U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, underpinned by a slew of sturdy
corporate results, as the market regained its footing following
its largest selloff in months a day earlier. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 0.51 percent at 15,451.86, the
S 500 was up 0.81 percent at 1,756.03 and the Nasdaq
Composite was up 0.88 percent at 4,032.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MICROSOFT CORP, $36.47, -0.03 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker named 22-year company
veteran Satya Nadella as its next chief executive officer on
Tuesday, ending a protracted search for a new leader after Steve
Ballmer announced his intention to retire in August. Nadella,
who led the creation of Microsoft's Internet-based, or "cloud,"
computing services, is only the third CEO in Microsoft's 39-year
history, following co-founder Bill Gates and
Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** FURIEX PHARMACEUTICALS INC, $104.8, +127.97 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Furiex more than doubled in value after the
company said its experimental drug significantly alleviated
diarrhea and abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel
syndrome in two large late-stage trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MICHAEL KORS HOLDINGS LTD, $90.31, +17.79 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retailer raised its profit forecast for the year after
its trendy handbags and watches proved a hit during the holiday
shopping season. Michael Kors, named after its fashion-designer
founder, shunned the discounts offered by many of its
competitors to record a better-than-expected 77 percent jump in
net income for the quarter just ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CISCO SYSTEMS INC, $21.77, +1.02 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GOOGLE INC, $1,141.25, +0.69 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies entered into a patent cross-licensing
agreement, Google's second such deal in as many months. The
cross-licensing agreement is an effective way to help prevent
unnecessary patent lawsuits, the companies said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PLUG POWER INC, $3.1699, +11.62 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fuel cell maker could turn profitable by the end of the
year driven by expansion into Asia, analysts at Cowen and Co
said. They also expect Plug Power to cut costs through dual
sourcing and bulk purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** LIFE PARTNERS HOLDINGS INC, $2.97, +16.02&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal jury found that the company did not commit fraud
and its Chief Executive Brian Pardo and other officers did not
engage in insider trading as claimed by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC had claimed that Life Partners intentionally
underestimated the life expectancies of the insureds in life
settlements it facilitated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** YUM BRANDS INC, $72.1, +8.98 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KFC parent reaffirmed on Monday its 2014 profit forecast
amid worries about a resurgent bird flu in China, its top market
for sales. Yum forecast earnings per share growth of at least 20
percent for 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** J.C. PENNEY CO INC, $5.08, -10.56 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported a modest rise in quarterly comparable
sales but gave no details on its gross profit margin, leading
Wall Street analysts to conclude the department store operator
had to resort to bigger discounts during the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GAP INC, $37.89, +1.72 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS raised its rating on the teen apparel retailer's stock
to "buy" from "neutral," citing increased square footage growth
at its stores, strong e-commerce sales and good exposure to
athletic apparel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look for GPS to deliver 15 percent plus earnings per
share growth over the next 3 years and potentially over $5 of
EPS in 2017," analyst Roxanne Meyer wrote in a note, raising her
price target on the stock to $50 from $41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** XYLEM INC, $36.29, +10.64 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The provider of water and wastewater applications equipment
reported fourth-quarter results that beat analysts' average
estimate and forecast FY2014 earnings to be $1.85 to $2.00 per
share on revenue of $4 billion. Analysts on average were
expecting earnings of $1.91 per share on revenue of $3.94
billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also
increased its quarterly dividend by 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** UBS AG, $20.36, +5.93 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss bank raised its dividend and increased
bonuses for bankers by nearly a third after it returned to a
fourth-quarter profit, reaping the benefits of a revamp of its
investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, $17.07, -9.68 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video game publisher raised its full-year outlook again
after smash hits "Grand Theft Auto V" and "NBA 2K14" helped it
post a better-than-expected third-quarter revenue. However, the
company gave a weaker-than-expected March quarter forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedbush and Credit Suisse cut their ratings on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** AOL INC, $49.62, +5.87 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asset management company Iridian Asset Management disclosed
a 9.3 percent stake in the media company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PFIZER INC, $31.39, +2.58 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferies analysts raised their rating on the company's
stock to "buy" from "hold," a day after the company said its
breast cancer drug succeeded in a mid-stage study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts said the data from the study could be
sufficient for Pfizer to file for approval and launch the drug,
palbociclib, by the end of the year. They said that corporate
reorganization would be the ultimate driver of Pfizer's share
price in the near- to mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** DICE HOLDINGS INC, $7.15, +6.88 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operator of career websites reported
better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter, mainly due
to growth in its finance segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dice operates eFinancialCareers.com, aimed at recruiting
workers in the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PEREGRINE SEMICONDUCTOR CORP, $5.55, -16.54 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least four brokerages cut their price targets on the
radio frequency chipmaker's stock after the company forecast
first-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations and reported
lower-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BROWN &amp; BROWN INC, $28.34, -7.63 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurance broker reported weaker-than-expected results
for the fourth quarter as its investment income fell and
expenses rose due to higher employee compensation and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** RGS ENERGY, $3.855, +7.38 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solar power company said it had formed a joint venture
with Altus Power America Management, a company that invests in
solar power projects, to develop and finance up to $150 million
of commercial solar projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** WADDELL &amp; REED FINANCIAL INC, $64.97, +5.56 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The asset manager reported better-than-expected results for
the fourth quarter, helped by a 27 percent rise in investment
management fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ADVENT SOFTWARE INC, $29.54, -3.50 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brokerage Sandler O'Neill cut its price target on the
accounting software maker's stock after the company forecast on
Monday first-quarter revenue largely below the average analyst
estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ENZO BIOCHEM, $3.24, +17.82 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig-Hallum has initiated coverage on the diagnostics
company's stock with a "buy" rating and a price target of $5.50,
according to Streetinsider.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ITAU UNIBANCO HOLDING SA, $12.98, +7.81 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BANCO BRADESCO SA, $10.73, +4.98 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BANCO SANTANDER BRASIL SA, $4.7, +4.68 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising borrowing costs, declining defaults and an unexpected
jump in loan disbursements drove record profit for Itau Unibanco
in the fourth quarter, even after expenses at Brazil's largest
private-sector bank exceeded expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in smaller rivals, including Banco Bradesco and Banco
Santander, also got a lift from Itau's results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** REDHILL BIOPHARMA LTD, $12.87, -3.96 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected a migraine
drug made by Israel's RedHill Biopharma and Canada's
IntelGenx Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** W.R. GRACE &amp; CO, $95.98, +4.01 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialty chemicals maker said on Monday that it emerged
from bankruptcy after more than 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2001, making it one
of the longest bankruptcies in U.S. history, after an asbestos
leak at one of its mines led to a slew of lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the company's board authorized on Tuesday a share
buyback program of up to $500 million, expected to be completed
over the next 12-24 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BLACKROCK INC, $289.18, +0.97 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's iShares, the largest U.S. provider of
exchange-traded funds, is launching a new set of currency-hedged
ETFs on Tuesday as it looks to target investors interested in
international equity exposure but concerned about potential
losses from a rising U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** INTEGRATED DEVICE TECHNOLOGY INC, $10.435,
+13.18 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chip-component maker reported a better-than-expected
profit on Monday and said it was pursuing a sale of its high
speed data converter business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedbush raised its price target on the company's stock to
$10 from $9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ENTEGRIS INC, $11.475, +11.62 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ATMI INC, $33.78, +25.44 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entegris said it would buy ATMI for $1.15 billion, bringing
together two key suppliers of high-purity materials and
packaging systems used in the manufacture of semiconductors.
Entegris's offer of $34 per share represents a premium of 26
percent to ATMI's closing price of $26.93 on the Nasdaq on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** LIONBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES INC, $6.86, +29.43 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The translation software maker reported better-than-expected
quarterly results and said it secured multi-year contracts with
recurring revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ZYNGA INC, $4.58, +2.00 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS raised its rating on the game maker's stock to "buy"
from "neutral," saying Zynga's core operations had begun to
stabilize under the new management team and that its $527
million acquisition of mobile game developer NaturalMotion would
result in more scale and innovation at Zynga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ASBURY AUTOMOTIVE GROUP INC, $49.01, +7.90 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. auto dealer posted a better-than-expected quarterly
profit as an improving economy and easier availability of loans
encouraged more Americans to buy cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ARM HOLDINGS, $43.8, -4.39 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British chip designer said a slowdown in demand
for Apple and Samsung smartphones was
behind a smaller-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter royalty
revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, $50.93,
+4.22 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banking and payments technology provider said its board
had authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $2
billion, effective through Dec. 31, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new program replaces the previous $1 billion program
under which about $174 million is outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also reported a 13 percent rise in its
fourth-quarter profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** DISH NETWORK CORP, $56.58, +3.63 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investment vehicle owned by the company's Chairman
Charles Ergen is joining an existing lender group to extend $33
million in financing to bankrupt wireless company LightSquared,
court filings show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CEPHEID, $49.28, -1.20 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical device maker said it planned to offer $250
million of convertible senior notes due 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interest rate, conversion rate, offering price and other
terms will be determined through talks between Cepheid and the
initial purchasers, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** WESTELL TECHNOLOGIES INC, $3.83, +4.93 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which provides equipment for telecom service
providers, reported a better-than-expected profit for the third
quarter on Monday, helped by strong demand for its wireless
products.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 4 (Reuters) - A federal bankruptcy judge on
Tuesday approved JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's $543 million deal
to end two private lawsuits stemming from its relationship with
convicted Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernard Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC confirmed that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Stuart Bernstein approved the agreement, which was made public
on Jan. 7, the same day federal authorities announced the bank
had agreed to pay more than $2 billion to settle criminal
charges related to the Madoff fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay $218 million to resolve class-action
litigation and $325 million to resolve claims brought by the
trustee, Irving Picard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff was a longtime client of the bank, which was accused
of turning a blind eye to suspicious activity within his
accounts that suggested fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard has estimated that the Ponzi scheme, the largest in
history, cost investors more than $17 billion of principal. To
date, he has recovered more than $10 billion for victims,
including the JPMorgan settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty in 2009 and is serving a 150-year
sentence. Five of his former aides are currently on trial in New
York federal court on charges that they helped Madoff perpetuate
his scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, JPMorgan recorded approximately $20 billion of legal
settlements in 2013, including $13 billion to resolve claims
related to mortgages it packaged leading up to the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 08-1789.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka has refused a visa request for a U.S. State Department official, the U.S. Embassy said on Tuesday after Washington signaled it would propose a U.N. resolution against the South Asian state over alleged war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions rose after U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Nisha Biswal voiced frustration on Saturday over Sri Lanka's failure to punish military personnel responsible linked to reported atrocities in a civil war that the Colombo government won in 2009 against separatist Tamil rebels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biswal, speaking after a two-day visit to Colombo, said Washington would table a third U.N. human rights resolution against Sri Lanka in March to address the allegations because its human rights climate has been worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Embassy in Colombo said the Sri Lankan government had turned down a visa application for Catherine Russell, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for global women's issues, and it called the decision "regrettable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russell had been scheduled to visit Sri Lanka in line with her mandate to promote stability, peace, and development by empowering women politically, socially and economically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The United States will continue to raise important issues related to gender-based violence, the impact that the conflict had on families (particularly female-headed households), the need for greater economic empowerment by women, and for greater political participation by women across Sri Lanka," the embassy said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biswal said that during her visit people in Sri Lanka's former northern war zone referred to a range of human rights abuses including the disappearance of civilians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government, which finally crushed the rebellion of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 26 years after it erupted, has rejected calls for an international inquiry, saying this would be aimed only at pleasing a large Tamil diaspora living in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior U.S. officials declined to say what would be in the planned resolution, but embassy officials said it might repeat the call for an international investigation in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sri Lankan officials were not immediately available for comment on the reported visa refusal. But Rajapaksa, speaking at Independence Day celebrations on Tuesday, said unidentified foreigners were trying to use "northern people", a reference to ethnic Tamils, as "human shields".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The invaders always came to our country shedding oceans of crocodile tears. They interfered..., putting forward claims to protect human rights, establish democracy and the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see the attempts to level charges of war crimes against us in Geneva today as the triumph of those who are not in favor of peace ... These are not founded on peace, fair play or justice," Rajapaksa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka has rejected U.S. criticism of its human rights record as "grossly disproportionate".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A United Nations panel has assessed that around 40,000 mainly Tamil civilians died in the final few months of the war. Both sides committed atrocities, but army shelling killed most victims, it concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Mark Heinrich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Feb 4 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apax's
acquisition of a 50.1 percent stake in classified advertising
publisher Trader Media is backed with a 358 million pound
($584.69 million) subordinated loan from a Goldman Sachs fund,
banking sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition takes Apax's ownership of Trader Media,
the owner of the Auto Trader car sales website, to 100 percent.
It paid Guardian Media Group around 600 million pounds, valuing
the whole company at 1.75 billion pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 358 million pound payment-in-kind (PIK) toggle, that will
sit at a holding company level, funded the acquisition. It was
underwritten by Goldman Sachs and privately placed with a
Goldman Sachs mezzanine fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PIK toggle note is one of the largest of its kind
following a 350 million pound PIK toggle for British motoring
services firm the AA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIK toggles are risky instruments because of their deep
subordination and low recovery rates in the event of a borrower
default.  They have seen a comeback in Europe as cash rich
investors look for higher yielding debt following a dearth of
new deals in 2013. A PIK toggle typically requires borrowers to
pay interest in cash only if their business is performing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, lenders to Trader Media have been asked to
approve amendments to the company's existing debt. JP Morgan is
running the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apax bought a 49.9 percent stake of Trader Media from GMG in
2007, backed with an 835 million pound leveraged loan. In 2011
the owners raised an extra 150 million pound loan to take a
dividend from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMENDMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing lenders are being asked to allow for an increase in
Trader Media's leverage. The holdco PIK toggle takes leverage in
the company to 7 times, higher than the 6 times currently
allowed on a guaranteed basis under existing documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amendment will also put in place an extra interest
margin ratchet which means lenders will be paid an extra 25
basis points, so its term loan B2 will now pay 425 bps and its
term loan B3 will now pay 525 bps, if leverage exceeds 5.5
times. Lenders have until February 5 to agree to the amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing lenders have also been offered a chance to extend
their debt to 2017 from 2015, if they didn't already do so
during a previous extension request in 2011 at the time the
dividend was taken. Lenders have until February 18 to extend.

U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, underpinned by a slew of sturdy
corporate results, as the market regained its footing following
its largest selloff in months a day earlier. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 0.67 percent at 15,476.2, the
S 500 was up 0.95 percent at 1,758.4 and the Nasdaq
Composite was up 1.15 percent at 4,042.846.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MICROSOFT CORP, $36.57, +0.25 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker named 22-year company
veteran Satya Nadella as its next chief executive officer on
Tuesday, ending a protracted search for a new leader after Steve
Ballmer announced his intention to retire in August. Nadella,
who led the creation of Microsoft's Internet-based, or "cloud,"
computing services, is only the third CEO in Microsoft's 39-year
history, following co-founder Bill Gates and
Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MICHAEL KORS HOLDINGS LTD, $90.54, +18.09 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retailer raised its profit forecast for the year after
its trendy handbags and watches proved a hit during the holiday
shopping season. Michael Kors, named after its fashion-designer
founder, shunned the discounts offered by many of its
competitors to record a better-than-expected 77 percent jump in
net income for the quarter just ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CISCO SYSTEMS INC, $21.685, +0.63 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GOOGLE INC, $1,152.73, +1.70 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies into a patent cross-licensing agreement
with, Google's second such deal in as many months. The
cross-licensing agreement is an effective way to help prevent
unnecessary patent lawsuits, the companies said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** YUM BRANDS INC, $71.86, +8.62 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KFC parent reaffirmed on Monday its 2014 profit forecast
amid worries about a resurgent bird flu in China, its top market
for sales. Yum forecast earnings per share growth of at least 20
percent for 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** J.C. PENNEY CO INC, $5.01, -11.80 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported a modest rise in quarterly comparable
sales but gave no details on its gross profit margin, leading
Wall Street analysts to conclude the department store operator
had to resort to bigger discounts during the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GAP INC, $38.13, +2.36 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS raised its rating on the teen apparel retailer's stock
to "buy" from "neutral," citing increased square footage growth
at its stores, strong e-commerce sales and good exposure to
athletic apparel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look for GPS to deliver 15 percent plus earnings per
share growth over the next 3 years and potentially over $5 of
EPS in 2017," analyst Roxanne Meyer wrote in a note, raising her
price target on the stock to $50 from $41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** UBS AG, $20.35, +5.88 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss bank raised its dividend and increased
bonuses for bankers by nearly a third after it returned to a
fourth-quarter profit, reaping the benefits of a revamp of its
investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, $17.416, -7.85
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video game publisher raised its full-year outlook again
after smash hits "Grand Theft Auto V" and "NBA 2K14" helped it
post a better-than-expected third-quarter revenue. However, the
company gave a weaker-than-expected March quarter forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedbush and Credit Suisse cut their ratings on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** AOL INC, $49.24, +5.06 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asset management company Iridian Asset Management disclosed
a 9.3 percent stake in the media company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PFIZER INC, $31.4, +2.61 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferies analysts raised their rating on the company's
stock to "buy" from "hold," a day after the company said its
breast cancer drug succeeded in a mid-stage study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts said the data from the study could be
sufficient for Pfizer to file for approval and launch the drug,
palbociclib, by the end of the year. They said that corporate
reorganization would be the ultimate driver of Pfizer's share
price in the near- to mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** DICE HOLDINGS INC, $7.16, +7.03 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operator of career websites reported
better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter, mainly due
to growth in its finance segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dice operates eFinancialCareers.com, aimed at recruiting
workers in the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PEREGRINE SEMICONDUCTOR CORP, $5.515, -17.07 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least four brokerages cut their price targets on the
radio frequency chipmaker's stock after the company forecast
first-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations and reported
lower-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BROWN &amp; BROWN INC, $28.63, -6.68 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurance broker reported weaker-than-expected results
for the fourth quarter as its investment income fell and
expenses rose due to higher employee compensation and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** RGS ENERGY, $3.9745, +10.71 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solar power company said it had formed a joint venture
with Altus Power America Management, a company that invests in
solar power projects, to develop and finance up to $150 million
of commercial solar projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** WADDELL &amp; REED FINANCIAL INC, $64.42, +4.66 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The asset manager reported better-than-expected results for
the fourth quarter, helped by a 27 percent rise in investment
management fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ADVENT SOFTWARE INC, $29.57, -3.40 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brokerage Sandler O'Neill cut its price target on the
accounting software maker's stock after the company forecast on
Monday first-quarter revenue largely below the average analyst
estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ENZO BIOCHEM, $3.1, +12.73 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig-Hallum has initiated coverage on the diagnostics
company's stock with a "buy" rating and a price target of $5.50,
according to Streetinsider.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ITAU UNIBANCO HOLDING SA, $13, +7.97 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BANCO BRADESCO SA, $10.75, +5.17 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BANCO SANTANDER BRASIL SA, $4.69, +4.45 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising borrowing costs, declining defaults and an unexpected
jump in loan disbursements drove record profit for Itau Unibanco
in the fourth quarter, even after expenses at Brazil's largest
private-sector bank exceeded expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in smaller rivals, including Banco Bradesco and Banco
Santander, also got a lift from Itau's results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** REDHILL BIOPHARMA LTD, $12.902, -3.72 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected a migraine
drug made by Israel's RedHill Biopharma and Canada's
IntelGenx Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** W.R. GRACE &amp; CO, $95.59, +3.59 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialty chemicals maker said on Monday that it emerged
from bankruptcy after more than 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2001, making it one
of the longest bankruptcies in U.S. history, after an asbestos
leak at one of its mines led to a slew of lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the company's board authorized on Tuesday a share
buyback program of up to $500 million, expected to be completed
over the next 12-24 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BLACKROCK INC, $291.82, +1.90 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's iShares, the largest U.S. provider of
exchange-traded funds, is launching a new set of currency-hedged
ETFs on Tuesday as it looks to target investors interested in
international equity exposure but concerned about potential
losses from a rising U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** FURIEX PHARMACEUTICALS INC, $109.55, +138.31 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Furiex more than doubled in value after the
company said its experimental drug significantly alleviated
diarrhea and abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel
syndrome in two large late-stage trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** POWER INTEGRATIONS INC, $57.93, +0.99 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silicon diode maker reported better-than-expected
results, helped by strong demand for LED lighting, renewable
energy and rapid charging for mobile devices, where its products
are used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least three brokerages raised their price targets on the
company's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** INTEGRATED DEVICE TECHNOLOGY INC, $10.51, +13.99
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chip-component maker reported a better-than-expected
profit on Monday and said it was pursuing a sale of its high
speed data converter business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedbush raised its price target on the company's stock to
$10 from $9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ENTEGRIS INC, $11.3, +9.92 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ATMI INC, $33.8, +25.51 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entegris said it would buy ATMI for $1.15 billion, bringing
together two key suppliers of high-purity materials and
packaging systems used in the manufacture of semiconductors.
Entegris's offer of $34 per share represents a premium of 26
percent to ATMI's closing price of $26.93 on the Nasdaq on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** LIONBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES INC, $7.0005, +32.08 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The translation software maker reported better-than-expected
quarterly results and said it secured multi-year contracts with
recurring revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ARRAY BIOPHARMA INC, $4.62, +2.21 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss,
helped by lower research and development expenses and an
increase in revenue from collaborations with Loxo Oncology and
Oncothyreon Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ZYNGA INC, $4.7075, +4.84 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS raised its rating on the game maker's stock to "buy"
from "neutral," saying Zynga's core operations had begun to
stabilize under the new management team and that its $527
million acquisition of mobile game developer NaturalMotion would
result in more scale and innovation at Zynga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ASBURY AUTOMOTIVE GROUP INC, $49, +7.88 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. auto dealer posted a better-than-expected quarterly
profit as an improving economy and easier availability of loans
encouraged more Americans to buy cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ARM HOLDINGS, $42.99, -6.16 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British chip designer said a slowdown in demand
for Apple and Samsung smartphones was
behind a smaller-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter royalty
revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, $33.03, +2.64
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurer's quarterly profit exceeded average analyst
estimate as the company benefited from lower disaster losses.
Hartford also announced a new $2 billion share buyback plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES, $7.395, -3.84 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GOLDCORP INC, $24.9, +0.61 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BARRICK GOLD, $19.17, -0.67 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silver Standard Resources said it would buy the
Marigold mine in Nevada for $275 million in cash from joint
owners Goldcorp and Barrick Gold in a deal that
would provide the Canadian miner more exposure to gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** DEXCOM INC, $39.89, +2.33 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical device maker said the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration had approved its glucose-monitoring system for
use in diabetic children aged between two and 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already approved for adults, the device, Dexcom G4 PLATINUM
(Pediatric), is now the only such system approved for children
as young as two years old, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, $50.96,
+4.28 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banking and payments technology provider said its board
had authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $2
billion, effective through Dec. 31, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new program replaces the previous $1 billion program
under which about $174 million is outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also reported a 13 percent rise in its
fourth-quarter profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** DISH NETWORK CORP, $56.34, +3.19 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investment vehicle owned by the company's Chairman
Charles Ergen is joining an existing lender group to extend $33
million in financing to bankrupt wireless company LightSquared,
court filings show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CEPHEID, $49.29, -1.18 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical device maker said it planned to offer $250
million of convertible senior notes due 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interest rate, conversion rate, offering price and other
terms will be determined through talks between Cepheid and the
initial purchasers, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** SUPERIOR ENERGY SERVICES INC, $23.44, +1.21 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vice president of the oilfield services company sold more

closing price, Superior Energy said in a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** WESTELL TECHNOLOGIES INC, $3.86, +5.75 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which provides equipment for telecom service

&lt;p&gt;By Robert Cyran
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.
Microsoft&#8217;s&#160;founding fathers are finally receding into the middle distance. Satya Nadella&#8217;s experience makes him a solid choice to succeed longtime Chief Executive Steven Ballmer. Better still, he will have greater room to maneuver as Bill Gates steps down as chairman. Nadella will need to grapple with his predecessors&#8217; bad decisions, like the Nokia&#160;deal, and he&#8217;s unlikely to pursue a breakup. But he can focus on what the company does best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many candidates entered the frame, it was always going to be a difficult post to fill. Microsoft spans everything from its omnipresent operating system to enterprise software to consumer hardware. It&#8217;s also threatened by upstarts and a shift in technology away from PCs. Finding a manager that understands technology, all these markets and has skills in revitalizing a mature behemoth was close to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse, the decision to buy Nokia&#8217;s handsets arm for $7.2 billion in the midst of the search showed that Microsoft&#8217;s board was wedded to the sprawl built by Gates and Ballmer. Few credible outsiders wanted to step into a position where they had little say over the company&#8217;s direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this light, Nadella&#8217;s choice is probably as good as the company could make. He has worked for Microsoft since 1992, so he knows the place. His most recent task was to run Microsoft&#8217;s cloud and enterprise group. This is one of the fastest growing divisions at Microsoft and represents the company&#8217;s future &#8211; selling software on demand to companies. He doesn&#8217;t have sales experience or much interaction with investors, which is important for a $303 billion market cap company. But Microsoft&#8217;s bench has enough depth to make up for these shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger question is where Nadella will take Microsoft. He didn&#8217;t give many hints in his opening memo to employees. The right course would be to focus on enterprise software, which is what Microsoft does best. A breakup or spinoff of the consumer and hardware operations would be welcome. But with Ballmer still on the board and holding some 4 percent of the company, and Gates remaining as the board&#8217;s technology adviser to &#8220;devote more time to the company,&#8221; such radical redrawing will be hard to accomplish any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the message is unmistakable. The old guard is slipping into the background. That gives Nadella room to slowly turn Microsoft toward a more focused, and potentially valuable, future.&lt;/p&gt;

U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, underpinned by a slew of sturdy
corporate results, as the market regained its footing following
its largest selloff in months a day earlier. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 0.32 percent at 15,422.57, the
S 500 was up 0.50 percent at 1,750.54 and the Nasdaq
Composite was up 0.68 percent at 4,024.035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MICROSOFT CORP, $36.5262, +0.13 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker named 22-year company
veteran Satya Nadella as its next chief executive officer on
Tuesday, ending a protracted search for a new leader after Steve
Ballmer announced his intention to retire in August. Nadella,
who led the creation of Microsoft's Internet-based, or "cloud,"
computing services, is only the third CEO in Microsoft's 39-year
history, following co-founder Bill Gates and
Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MICHAEL KORS HOLDINGS LTD, $90.35, +17.84 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retailer raised its profit forecast for the year after
its trendy handbags and watches proved a hit during the holiday
shopping season. Michael Kors, named after its fashion-designer
founder, shunned the discounts offered by many of its
competitors to record a better-than-expected 77 percent jump in
net income for the quarter just ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CISCO SYSTEMS INC, $21.53, -0.09 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GOOGLE INC, $1,146.96, +1.19 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies into a patent cross-licensing agreement
with, Google's second such deal in as many months. The
cross-licensing agreement is an effective way to help prevent
unnecessary patent lawsuits, the companies said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** YUM BRANDS INC, $71.3, +7.77 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KFC parent reaffirmed on Monday its 2014 profit forecast
amid worries about a resurgent bird flu in China, its top market
for sales. Yum forecast earnings per share growth of at least 20
percent for 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** J.C. PENNEY CO INC, $5.5, -3.17 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported a modest rise in quarterly comparable
sales but gave no details on its gross profit margin, leading
Wall Street analysts to conclude the department store operator
had to resort to bigger discounts during the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GAP INC, $37.94, +1.85 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS raised its rating on the teen apparel retailer's stock
to "buy" from "neutral," citing increased square footage growth
at its stores, strong e-commerce sales and good exposure to
athletic apparel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look for GPS to deliver 15 percent plus earnings per
share growth over the next 3 years and potentially over $5 of
EPS in 2017," analyst Roxanne Meyer wrote in a note, raising her
price target on the stock to $50 from $41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** UBS AG, $20.31, +5.67 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss bank raised its dividend and increased
bonuses for bankers by nearly a third after it returned to a
fourth-quarter profit, reaping the benefits of a revamp of its
investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, $17.08, -9.63 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video game publisher raised its full-year outlook again
after smash hits "Grand Theft Auto V" and "NBA 2K14" helped it
post a better-than-expected third-quarter revenue. However, the
company gave a weaker-than-expected March quarter forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedbush and Credit Suisse cut their ratings on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GANNETT CO, $27.04, +2.00 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which owns the largest newspaper chain in the
United States, reported lower quarterly revenue and profit but
said its television revenues were expected to jump 100 percent
this quarter following its acquisition of Belo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BROWN &amp; BROWN INC, $28.61, -6.75 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurance broker reported weaker-than-expected results
for the fourth quarter as its investment income fell and
expenses rose due to higher employee compensation and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ITAU UNIBANCO HOLDING SA, $12.93, +7.39 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BANCO BRADESCO SA, $10.68, +4.49 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BANCO SANTANDER BRASIL SA, $4.66, +3.79 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising borrowing costs, declining defaults and an unexpected
jump in loan disbursements drove record profit for Itau Unibanco
in the fourth quarter, even after expenses at Brazil's largest
private-sector bank exceeded expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in smaller rivals, including Banco Bradesco and Banco
Santander, also got a boost from Itau's results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** OCULUS INNOVATIVE SCIENCES INC, $2.97, -6.90 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker said it had received approvals to market two
of its acne products in some European Union countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The topical drugs, Microcyn-based GramaDerm Solution and
GramaDerm Hydrogel, are intended for use along with other acne
treatments to treat mild to moderate acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** REDHILL BIOPHARMA LTD, $13.04, -2.69 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected a migraine
drug made by Israel's RedHill Biopharma and Canada's
IntelGenx Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** W.R. GRACE &amp; CO, $94.76, +2.69 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialty chemicals maker said on Monday that it emerged
from bankruptcy after more than 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2001, making it one
of the longest bankruptcies in U.S. history, after an asbestos
leak at one of its mines led to a slew of lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the company's board authorized on Tuesday a share
buyback program of up to $500 million, expected to be completed
over the next 12-24 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BLACKROCK INC, $291.45, +1.77 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's iShares, the largest U.S. provider of
exchange-traded funds, is launching a new set of currency-hedged
ETFs on Tuesday as it looks to target investors interested in
international equity exposure but concerned about potential
losses from a rising U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** FURIEX PHARMACEUTICALS INC, $106.9901, +132.74
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Furiex more than doubled in value after the
company said its experimental drug significantly alleviated
diarrhea and abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel
syndrome in two large late-stage trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** POWER INTEGRATIONS INC, $59.57, +3.85 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silicon diode maker reported better-than-expected
results, helped by strong demand for LED lighting, renewable
energy and rapid charging for mobile devices, where its products
are used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least three brokerages raised their price targets on the
company's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** INTEGRATED DEVICE TECHNOLOGY INC, $10.47, +13.56
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chip-component maker reported a better-than-expected
profit on Monday and said it was pursuing a sale of its high
speed data converter business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedbush raised its price target on the company's stock to
$10 from $9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ENTEGRIS INC, $11.415, +11.04 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ATMI INC, $33.81, +25.55 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entegris said it would buy ATMI for $1.15 billion, bringing
together two key suppliers of high-purity materials and
packaging systems used in the manufacture of semiconductors.
Entegris's offer of $34 per share represents a premium of 26
percent to ATMI's closing price of $26.93 on the Nasdaq on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** LIONBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES INC, $6.31, +19.06 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The translation software maker reported better-than-expected
quarterly results and said it secured multi-year contracts with
recurring revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ARRAY BIOPHARMA INC, $4.73, +4.65 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss,
helped by lower research and development expenses and an
increase in revenue from collaborations with Loxo Oncology and
Oncothyreon Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ZYNGA INC, $4.805, +7.02 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS raised its rating on the game maker's stock to "buy"
from "neutral," saying Zynga's core operations had begun to
stabilize under the new management team and that its $527
million acquisition of mobile game developer NaturalMotion would
result in more scale and innovation at Zynga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** INTERNATIONAL PAPER CO, $45.48, -1.26 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest North American producer of corrugated shipping
boxes posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit due in part
to write-downs and pension costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ASBURY AUTOMOTIVE GROUP INC, $49.26, +8.45 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. auto dealer posted a better-than-expected quarterly
profit as an improving economy and easier availability of loans
encouraged more Americans to buy cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ARM HOLDINGS, $42.92, -6.31 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British chip designer said a slowdown in demand
for Apple and Samsung smartphones was
behind a smaller-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter royalty
revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, $32.75, +1.77
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurer's quarterly profit exceeded average analyst
estimate as the company benefited from lower disaster losses.
Hartford also announced a new $2 billion share buyback plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** SILVER STANDARD RESOURCES, $7.3549, -4.36 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GOLDCORP INC, $24.88, +0.53 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BARRICK GOLD, $19.14, -0.83 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silver Standard Resources said it would buy the
Marigold mine in Nevada for $275 million in cash from joint
owners Goldcorp and Barrick Gold in a deal that
would provide the Canadian miner more exposure to gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** INTEL CORP, $23.77, -0.75 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, wrestling with shrinking personal computer
sales and struggling to expand into mobile devices, said on

senior executives more accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** DEXCOM INC, $39.45, +1.21 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical device maker said the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration had approved its glucose-monitoring system for
use in diabetic children aged between two and 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already approved for adults, the device, Dexcom G4 PLATINUM
(Pediatric), is now the only such system approved for children
as young as two years old, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, $49.69,
+1.68 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banking and payments technology provider said its board
had authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $2
billion, effective through Dec. 31, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new program replaces the previous $1 billion program

fourth-quarter profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** DISH NETWORK CORP, $55.69, +2.00 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investment vehicle owned by the company's Chairman

court filings show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORP, $80.11, +2.48 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported on Monday a wide quarterly loss on

			Leading Multicultural Marketing Agency Gravity Media Invites the 
      Coca-Cola Ad Haters to Their Office
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Agency offers to pay for travel to the biggest offenders &#8211; inviting 
      them to Family Dinner&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following letter was released by Gravity Media in response to the 
      outpouring of hate after Coca-Cola&#8217;s airing of the &#8216;America the 
      Beautiful&#8217; multicultural ad.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Few things in life shock me. I am a lifelong New Yorker and am use to 
      navigating the opinions of others. Sometimes we are on the same page, 
      sometimes we are not, but we are always ready for a debate. However, 
      when listening to fellow Americans respond with hate and intolerance to 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s &#8220;America the Beautiful&#8221; commercial, I am floored. Truly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Maybe it is because I am a New Yorker living in such a multicultural, 
      urban environment, that I am shielded from the latest hatred spewed from 
      some of my fellow Americans. Maybe because I am a partner in a 
      multicultural advertising agency, which opens up conversations and 
      meetings with, &#8220;we have 45 team members that speak over 20 languages,&#8221; 
      which is our most cherished asset. Maybe because on a daily basis we 
      work with Fortune 500 companies that understand the value of 
      multicultural consumers and cherish their relationship with this key 
      audience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Whatever the &#8216;maybe&#8217; is, it doesn&#8217;t matter, because I am wrong. I live 
      in a multicultural bubble.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      I don&#8217;t want to dissect the details of the backlash. I don&#8217;t want to 
      give it any value. What I want to do is address this with action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is clear from the loud response that there is a complete sense of 
      fear of multiculturalism by a certain population in America. Fear of the 
      foreigner. Fear of diversity. Fear of losing what is &#8220;true America.&#8221; 
      However, I also know that fear is a symptom of misunderstanding. It is 
      only by exposing ourselves and putting a face on our fears that we are 
      able to overcome and move toward understanding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here is my humble effort to combat the current and existing fear: These 
      individuals are fearful because they have not been exposed and we have 
      the resources to expose them. We 
      have over 20 ethnicities and languages spoken in our offices at Gravity 
      Media &#8211; everyone from Russians to Asians, and Hispanics, to Afghans. All 
      of whom work very hard and are great contributors to our American 
      society. As a group we take great offense to the racial and ethnic 
      comments that were made, none of which are worth repeating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In an effort to combat such lack of understanding of the multicultural 
      nation we live in, we open our doors to you for dialogue and greater 
      understanding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We will personally invite some of the people who expressed themselves so 
      vehemently along with any public official that found the ad offensive, 
      to visit our office for what we call a &#8220;Family Dinner.&#8221; A platform 
      during which we will do our best to introduce you to our Multicultural 
      America, made up of individuals that would sing America is beautiful in 
      any language, for that is what they truly feel. America represents all 
      that is beautiful. We will eat, drink, and laugh. We will debate, for 
      certain, but we will come out better for it. It is our way of doing the 
      little we can to expose others to the wonderful resources we have in our 
      office &#8211; Our Multicultural Team.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Air and hotel will be paid for by Gravity Media. All you have to do is 
      come with an open mind and a willingness to build relationships.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Let&#8217;s try this, it may change us both.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4433 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4433 'A+/F1'; Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --DRIVERs, Series 4433A-D 'A+'; Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Long-term 'A+'; Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4433 
      PUTTERs and series 4433A-D DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch 
      has assigned to the New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority Revenue 
      Bonds, Higher Education Equipment Leasing Fund Program Issue, Series 
      2014 (rated 'A+'; Stable Outlook) that have been deposited in the series 
      4433 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4433 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      'A+/F1'; Stable Outlook by Fitch). The 'F1' rating assigned to the 
      PUTTERs will expire on March 15, 2015, the expiration date of the 
      liquidity facility, unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

			LiveWorld and Pfizer to Present a Series of Panels on Social Media 
      Within Regulated Industries at Social Media Week
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coming off the success of last year&#8217;s event, LiveWorld and Pfizer Inc., 
      in participation with Social 
      Media Week 2014, will co-sponsor three keynote panels on February 
      18, 2014, at the Highline Stages in New York City. The theme for Social 
      Media Week is &#8220;Always On. Always Connected. The Future of Now.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LiveWorld and Pfizer will host an afternoon to educate regulated and 
      consumer-sensitive industries such as pharma, finance, and consumer 
      packaged goods on strategies for helping a regulated business connect personally 
      with customers, turn engagement into business results, and experience 
      the benefits of social at scale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are excited to work with Pfizer to bring these dynamic discussions 
      to Social Media Week, address and discuss how regulated-industry brands 
      can thrive and engage in the dynamic free-for-all of social media," said 
      LiveWorld Chairman  CEO, Peter Friedman. &#8220;Regulated and 
      consumer-sensitive brands can succeed in social media. This series of 
      events will show them how.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Panels 
      with representatives from Citibank, Bloomberg, Pfizer, American 
      Express, MasterCard, Social Media Today and W2O will further explore the 
      following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Humanizing a Brand Through Social Media. Marketers will learn 
        how to balance the potential of social media with the inherent risks 
        associated with regulated limitations, strategies for helping a 
        regulated business connect personally with customers, and keys to 
        managing the internal partnerships critical to the effective use of 
        social media in a regulated environment.
      
			
				Making Social More Social Within Regulated Industries: Moving from 
        Outreach to True Engagement. This session will cover understanding 
        and effectively measuring social engagement, developing engagement 
        strategies for regulated businesses, and turning engagement into 
        business results.
      
			
				Scaling Social Media Across Multiple Brands and Countries. Panelists 
        will share how they have experienced the benefits of social at scale; 
        developed strategies that scale from local to global execution, across 
        brands and markets; and leveraged technology, content, and people to 
        deliver social at scale efficiently and effectively.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The discussion begins at 3:00PM Eastern Time on February 18 and is 
      followed by a networking and cocktail reception.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Feb 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp named
Satya Nadella as its next chief executive officer on Tuesday,
ending a longer-than-expected search for a new leader after
Steve Ballmer announced his intention to retire in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella is only the third CEO in Microsoft's 39-year
history, following co-founder Bill Gates and Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also announced that John Thompson, lead
independent director, will succeed Gates as chairman. Gates will
assume a new role as "technology advisor," the company said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the world's largest software maker edged higher in
premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;

			Parallels Enables Over One Million Microsoft Cloud Services 
      Subscribers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parallels partners offering Microsoft Hosted Exchange and Office 
      365 break the million seat milestone
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parallels, 
      a leading hosting and cloud services enablement provider, announced its 
      partners have exceeded one million installed seats across Microsoft 
      Exchange and Office 365. The growth of business class e-mail seats 
      powered by Parallels software, increasing at a rate of 72 percent 
      year-over-year from December 2012, shows the growing demand among small 
      to medium businesses (SMBs) for a comprehensive portfolio of cloud 
      solutions to help increase IT efficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Anticipating this growth, Parallels, a Microsoft Gold Certified partner, 
      has been collaborating with Microsoft since 2007 to help telecom 
      companies, domain hosting providers, distributors, managed service 
      providers and VARs to deliver best-in-class, Microsoft-based cloud 
      services for SMBs that constitute a significant portion of this growing 
      market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With Parallels, service providers are able to increase IT support for 
      SMBs using Exchange and Office 365, as well as Microsoft SharePoint, 
      Microsoft Lync, Microsoft SQL and Microsoft CRM. By surpassing 1 million 
      installed seats across the Microsoft Exchange and Office 365 platforms, 
      Parallels solidifies its position as one of Microsoft&#8217;s top cloud 
      management partners, and an industry leader that empowers hosters and 
      service providers with the ability to quickly and efficiently offer 
      scalable enterprise-grade services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Solutions for a Growing Market
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parallels has seen increased adoption of enterprise-class cloud 
      solutions as companies accelerate the shift of IT resources supporting 
      critical operations to the cloud. According 
      to IDC*, the analyst firm expects worldwide spend on 
      public IT cloud services to reach nearly $108 billion, more than double 
      than the $47.4 billion spent in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We pride ourselves in providing a service delivery platform that makes 
      it easy to sell, provision and manage syndicated or locally hosted cloud 
      services,&#8221; said Birger Steen, chief executive officer, Parallels. &#8220;The 
      above-market growth numbers reflect our deep experience in working with 
      Microsoft. We continue to innovate to ensure service providers have on 
      time access to the latest and greatest from Microsoft and all subsequent 
      updates are transparent to the service provider.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to work with Parallels to expand our business with a 
      broad and diverse cloud distribution channel and increase speed to 
      market for our valued partners,&#8221; said Eddie O&#8217;Brien, vice president, 
      Operator Channels, Microsoft. &#8220;Parallels clearly understands the hosting 
      and cloud needs of SMBs as demonstrated by the continued momentum of 
      Microsoft partners using the Parallels platform with Office 365 and 
      Hosted Exchange.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Making the Cloud Work for SMBs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While Microsoft Office 365 and Exchange are popular services among SMBs, 
      Parallels understands that its partners need to be able to provide a 
      wide variety of solutions so they can create custom-made packages that 
      address the drastically different needs of SMBs. To help address this 
      demand in variety, Parallels is constantly updating its platform to 
      support solutions that are being requested from SMBs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to Office 365 and Exchange, Parallels recently announced 
      support for Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Azure Pack, bringing the power of 
      Microsoft&#8217;s Azure technologies into a service provider&#8217;s datacenter. 
      Additionally, Parallels supports Microsoft&#8217;s Lync Hosting Pack that 
      gives SMBs instant, collaborative and unified communications as well as 
      Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft CRM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With these solutions, Parallels partners such as AppRiver, Apptix, 
      Cobweb and Outsourcery have seen substantial success from delivering 
      Microsoft-based services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;AppRiver chose Parallels Automation to help streamline new customer 
      activations of our Microsoft Office 365 offerings,&#8221; said Scott Paul, 
      senior director, AppRiver. &#8220;Working with Parallels we were able to 
      quickly implement a solution that delivers provisioning and management 
      of the Office 365 platform, allowing us to focus on creating the 
      high-quality experience our customers demand.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Apptix has leveraged our extensive experience in the hosted services 
      market to build a robust channel program,&#8221; said David Ehrhardt, 
      president and chief executive officer, Apptix. &#8220;Parallels Automation 
      enables us to provide our channel partners flexible and diversified 
      offerings featuring our core Microsoft-based communication and 
      collaboration solutions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With Parallels Automation, everything is possible,&#8221; said Julian Dyer, 
      chief technology officer and cofounder, Cobweb. &#8220;Without it, we wouldn&#8217;t 
      be where we are today&#8212;and we wouldn&#8217;t be able to offer our resellers the 
      Microsoft-based Unified Communications services they need to be 
      successful.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe that all businesses and public sector organizations, 
      regardless of their scale and location, should enjoy the benefits of 
      cloud-based solutions,&#8221; said Piers Linney, co-chief executive officer, 
      Outsourcery. &#8220;By working with Parallels, Outsourcery has enhanced its 
      relationship with its partners who can now expedite their route to 
      market by easily integrating and upselling additional cloud services to 
      their end customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This February, Parallels is hosting their annual Summit 
      in New Orleans where attendees can learn more about the partnerships, 
      market opportunities and future products from Parallels.

			IBM and Actifio Add Powerful New Data Virtualization Solutions To IBM 
      Cloud Portfolio
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM (NYSE:&#160;IBM) 
      today announced a new data virtualization service for its portfolio of 
      cloud-based enterprise offerings. The new service &#8211; IBM 
      SmartCloud Data
				Virtualization (SCDV) &#8211; will enable 
      customers to decouple their application data from their physical 
      infrastructure, improving business resiliency, agility, and
			the 
      ability to move more seamlessly into the cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As organizations move toward cloud-based systems, many struggle with the 
      complexity and cost associated with application data bound to physical 
      infrastructure. Independent silos of hardware and software built to 
      support backup, business continuity, development and test, analytics, 
      and compliance make it difficult to move data where it needs to be, to 
      both safely protect and quickly develop the applications on which a 
      business often depends.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By virtualizing data management, IBM SmartCloud Data Virtualization 
      breaks down the walls of these silos. A single, physical copy &#8211; stored 
      wherever it makes the most sense for a given customer &#8211; can be used to 
      create multiple virtual copies, in support of any business application. 
      Infrastructure is collapsed as data protection and availability SLA&#8217;s 
      are improved, resulting in compelling economic and strategic value 
      created for the customer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM SmartCloud&#174; Data Virtualization leverages Actifio&#8217;s 
      Virtual Data Pipeline&#8482; technology to provide a unique model for 
      managing critical data, without the expense of managing excess copies. 
      Clients can reclaim production storage capacity, improve data center 
      utilization, and quickly recover critical servers, resulting in a 
      dramatically lower total cost of ownership than can be achieved through 
      traditional means.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud-based recovery services are expected to provide higher degrees of 
      resiliency, faster response, and ease of use through self-service, 
      automation, and economies of scale greater than traditional disaster 
      recovery services. This new offering delivers on these objectives with 
      application recovery in minutes versus hours, point-in-time data 
      snapshots to help eliminate traditional back-up windows, and drastically 
      improves production storage.&#160;The recoverability of an application can be 
      tested &#8211; in real-time &#8211; without any disruption to the production system. 
      Test failovers can be performed more frequently and, in the event of an 
      actual failover, changes are logged and are automatically re-synched 
      with the primary production system when failback is initiated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IBM&#8217;s SmartCloud Data Virtualization combines the power of Actifio&#8217;s 
      data virtualization platform with IBM&#8217;s Resiliency technology and 
      operational reliability,&#8221; said Laurence Guihard-Joly, General Manager 
      for IBM&#8217;s
			Business Continuity and Resiliency Services. &#8220;As part 
      of our growing portfolio of cloud software, services and expertise that 
      help clients tackle any IT or business challenge with confidence, 
      security and trust, SCDV will not only offer many customers faster 
      recovery times at better price points, it will enable them to leverage 
      their protected data as a business asset rather than simply an insurance 
      policy."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re excited IBM has chosen our platform for this strategic cloud 
      initiative, and to be working closely with them to bring more customers 
      the power of our combined offering as they move to take advantage of the 
      transformative economics of the cloud,&#8221; said Actifio Founder and CEO Ash 
      Ashutosh. &#8220;The bottom line here is thousands of IBM customers are now 
      able to achieve better SLA&#8217;s for more mission critical applications, 
      accelerating their business and their path into the cloud.&#8221;

			Jacobs and Pfizer Provide Sterile Drug Product Manufacturing 
      Technology to Emerging Markets
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Jacobs 
      Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today a collaboration 
      with Pfizer 
      Inc. on a modular process system to address the rapidly changing 
      requirements of localized pharmaceutical manufacturing in emerging 
      market countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collaboration brings together Pfizer&#8217;s aseptic drug product process 
      expertise and Jacobs&#8217; capabilities in modular engineering, fabrication, 
      and testing to create a Rapid Deployment Module (RDM) that integrates 
      modular equipment, fully-automated control systems and single-use 
      technology for bags, mixers, sterile connectors, manifolds and filters. 
      The portable system is scalable for different batch sizes, adaptable for 
      various products and can be rapidly deployed, and offers significant 
      cost and schedule advantages compared to large manufacturing facilities 
      with fixed equipment and limited flexibility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In making the announcement, Jacobs Group Vice President Chris Nagel 
      stated, &#8220;We are very pleased to be collaborating with Pfizer on this 
      initiative to help meet the diverse medical needs of patients in 
      emerging markets around the world. Our system uses off-the-shelf 
      technology that requires minimal space and utilities. It is a process 
      that can be replicated globally and offers a number of potential 
      benefits such as reduced equipment, validation and operating costs; and 
      compressed production cycles and training requirements.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kevin Nepveux, Vice President of Pfizer&#8217;s Global Technical Services, 
      remarked, &#8220;The Rapid Deployment Module we developed with Jacobs has 
      improved the quality and speed of our technology transfers by making our 
      process more robust through specific engineering solutions. This system 
      embodies the innovation culture that we strive for.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The production systems are currently in their final stages of validation 
      at a number of local pharmaceutical manufacturing sites around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jacobs is one of the world's largest and most diverse providers of 
      technical professional and construction services.

&lt;p&gt;* Chinese bank seeks to expand commodities business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Initial focus on investor products, physical metals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Melanie Burton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Bank of China International (BOCI)
has recruited former Goldman Sachs metals trading chief
as an adviser to help it expand its commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese banks are stepping away from mainly consumer-led
business to take advantage of a tough climate for Western
brokers - grappling with strict European and U.S. regulations - 
to expand their presence in natural resources, and trading in
particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOCI's appointment of Stephen Branton-Speak as an adviser 
is one of the highest profile metals industry hires by a Chinese
bank since Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd bought
the London Metal Exchange (LME) for $2.2 billion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branton-Speak was also on the LME board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial focus of the expansion will be on investor
products and physical metals, Arthur Fan, London-based chief
executive of BOCI Global Commodities, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOCI is the investment banking arm of state-backed Bank of
China , the country's No.4 lender by market
value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, South Africa's Standard Bank said it
would sell a 60 percent stake in its London-based global markets
unit to China's ICBC for $765 million. The sale
includes the metals unit of Standard Bank, a member of the LME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, a unit of China's Shenzhen-listed GF Securities
 applied to trade in the LME ring. Its local unit, GF
Financial Markets Ltd, bought the commodities brokerage unit of
Natixis, including its LME ring dealing business, as
the French bank wound up its commodities broking unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOCI became the first Chinese member of the LME to much
fanfare in 2012, but markets participants have said it has
failed to build on momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branton-Speak built up Goldman Sachs' physical trading desk
in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to become one of
the giants on Wall Street, as banks made a bid to offset the
loss of income from the forced closure of proprietary trading
desks due to stricter regulatory reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the LME executive committee members, he also
played a leading part in steering the LME's $2.2 billion sale
before retiring in December of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branton-Speak joined Goldman Sachs in 1997 as a metals
trader, before became a managing director in 2006 and a partner
in 2008. He was also on the management committee of the London
Bullion Market Association (LBMA). He is also principal
consultant with Calnic Commodity Consultancy, according to his
LinkedIn page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - As Microsoft Corp prepares to unveil insider Satya Nadella as its new chief executive, investors and analysts are weighing how effective the 22-year veteran will be in re-igniting the company's mobile ambitions and satisfying Wall Street's hunger for cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest software firm faces a slow erosion of its PC-centric Windows and Office franchises and needs to somehow challenge Apple Inc and Google Inc in the new realm of mobile computing. At the same time, some investors are campaigning for retrenchment and a bigger cut of the company's massive cash pile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most agree that Nadella's background in creating Microsoft's Internet-based - or 'cloud' - computing services makes him a safe pair of hands to take the company forward, but there remains a question over his ability to make Microsoft a hit with consumers, or with impatient shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is the right person to drive safe, right down the middle of the fairway, and continue Microsoft's strengths," said Rajeev Chand, managing director and head of research at tech investment bank Rutberg &amp; Co. "What we don't know is will Nadella help with the consumer revival, or with the mobile revival. Mobile is an open hole in his background."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's problem is stark. More than 90 percent of PCs run Windows, but only 4 percent of smartphones do and an even smaller slice of tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is still the undisputed king of workplace computing, but it is finding it hard to kindle the affections of consumers at home and on the move. Its Surface devices had some success over the holiday shopping season, but its phones are showing signs of losing momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would advise him (Nadella) to take a fresh look at mobile, or bring in some talent who really understands the space," said David Smith, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last July, CEO Steve Ballmer outlined Microsoft's new devices and services business model that is intended to marry cloud services with nifty gadgets that can challenge Android phones and Apple's iPad. He backed that up with the $7.2 billion purchase of handset maker Nokia, set to close this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that move did not play well on Wall Street and now Microsoft finds itself under pressure from critical investors to give up the hardware business and concentrate instead on getting its software onto as many devices as possible, including the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has to be present on every device. They can't be captive to Windows or Windows Phone," said Ted Schadler, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. "When you look at the applications that are on the rise to support mobile, it is not Microsoft with Word, it's Dropbox or Evernote. It's really about being everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst calculated that Microsoft is losing $2.5 billion a year by keeping a full, native version of its Office suite unavailable for iPad users in the hope that its Surface tablets will become a hit with businesses, but there's no sign of that happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have to port Office to iPad, they have to do it," said Schadler. "That's an important, immediate decision that Satya's going to have to drive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHOW US THE MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from strategy quandaries, Nadella has to wrestle with the challenges of managing an enormous corporation and dealing directly with big investors, something he has had no real experience of as a unit head at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ValueAct Capital, which led a shareholder revolt last year that culminated in the retirement of Ballmer, has been pushing for the company to abandon its ambitions to be a consumer hardware maker, refocus on its strengths with business applications and return more of the rewards from those steady, high-margin businesses to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact is that with mature companies, shareholder value is more driven by capital allocation than by new products," said one Top 30 investor in Microsoft, who asked not be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly. "A repurchase would be great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That effectively means refocusing on Office and Windows and distributing more of Microsoft's $84 billion in cash and short-term investments, although most of that is held overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Microsoft raised its dividend 22 percent and renewed its $40 billion share buyback program, but Wall Street is still hungry for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Satya's never run a P (profit and loss statement) as big as Microsoft, so this is a bit of an unproven step up," said Schadler. "Dealing in the public markets is a big new challenge for him, so he's got a lot learning to do and will require coaching and this is where the board of directors intersects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is expected that co-founder Bill Gates will relinquish the chairman position, to advise Nadella on technology and allow another board member to take on the task of dealing with investor relations, an idea that has broadly been welcomed by investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More of Bill Gates is a good thing for Microsoft," said Chand at Rutberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nadia Damouni in New York; Editing by Matt Driskill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Feb 3 (Reuters) - As Microsoft Corp 
prepares to unveil insider Satya Nadella as its new chief

the company's massive cash pile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most agree that Nadella's background in creating Microsoft's

&lt;p&gt;* Regulator is probing if Televisa is dominant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Televisa says Dish Mexico move "just media pressure"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Feb 5 (Reuters) - Mexico's new telecoms
regulator should declare broadcaster Grupo Televisa a dominant
company as part of its effort to increase competition in the
sector, rival satellite company Dish Mexico said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish Mexico has written to the Federal Telecommunications
Institute (IFT) saying that Televisa is dominant in
terms of audience figures for its broadcast television and
subscribers for its pay-television services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish Mexico, which is co-owned by Mexican media company MVS
and satellite company EchoStar, competes with
Televisa's satellite company Sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Televisa spokesperson said in an emailed statement that
the move by Dish was just "media pressure".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IFT in December notified Televisa and Carlos Slim's
phone company America Movil that it was investigating
whether they are dominant in their markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico last year approved a telecom reform that will allow
the regulator to use so-called asymmetric rules as part of an
effort to trim the market power of companies it declares
dominant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish Mexico has also come under fire from competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America Movil's Mexican fixed-line unit Telmex has a deal
with Dish to issue a single bill for shared services. Telmex is
currently barred from directly offering TV services and other
companies have complained the Telmex-Dish tie-up should be
sanctioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV Azteca, the country's second biggest broadcaster, said on
Wednesday that it has asked IFT to include Dish in its ruling on
whether Telmex is dominant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dish and Telmex are the same company," Eduardo Ruiz, head
of regulation issues at Grupo Salinas which controls TV Azteca,
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc, maker of the popular Keurig one-cup coffee brewer, said on Wednesday the Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) had bought a 10 percent stake in it for $1.25 billion and would help launch Green Mountain's new cold drink machine planned for release as soon as October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Green Mountain (GMCR.O) soared 42 percent to $114.85 in extended trading, while those of its likely new rival, SodaStream International Ltd (SODA.O), retreated 3.9 percent to $34.39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under their 10-year agreement, the companies will collaborate on the development and introduction of Coca-Cola products on Green Mountain's upcoming machine that will serve both carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, including soft drinks, tea and juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain's Keurig machine popularized the use of pods - small packets containing everything from coffee, tea or hot chocolate powder - for easy, in-home, one-cup brewing of hot drinks. The company has sold more than 30 million Keurig machines around the world for use in homes, offices and other locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal will make Green Mountain the global exclusive partner for the production and sale of Coke's branded single-serve, pod-based cold beverages, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Green Mountain also retains the option to sign deals with other cold drink makers, President and Chief Executive Brian Kelley told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes Coke rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), which last year shot down rumors it planned to buy SodaStream. A spokesman for Pepsi declined comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll do deals with brands consumers love," said Kelley, who added that Green Mountain has coffee deals with most major chains, including Starbucks (SBUX.O) and Dunkin' Donuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(DNKN.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are really excited to start with Coca-Cola," said Kelley, who came to Green Mountain from the world's largest soda maker, where he was viewed as a product-savvy executive with expertise in product and supply chain management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain's cold drink machine is scheduled to debut in fiscal 2015, which begins in October this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent said on the call that the deal would give his company access to new business opportunities. He added that it would enhance Coca-Cola's bottling system and that its bottlers would have a complimentary role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gives Green Mountain a beverage partner with some hugely powerful global brands. For Coke, it gives them access to some really cool, new cutting-edge pod cold-beverage technology," said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sicher said soda sales in the United States have been in decline since 2005, while growth in pod-based coffee brewing has boomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, Coca-Cola will acquire roughly 16.7 million newly issued shares of Green Mountain. The new shares have been priced at $74.98, which represents the trailing 50-trading-day volume weighted average price as of market close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has the option to increase its minority stake up to 16 percent through open market purchases of Green Mountain common stock during the first 36 months, a spokesman for the Coca-Cola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The significant after-hours move in Green Mountain's stock appeared to be a classic short squeeze as traders who bet against the stock scrambled to cover their positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc., was among investors with short positions in Green Mountain as of October 15. Greenlight's spokesman declined to comment to Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent data from Nasdaq, which dates to January 15, had short interest in Green Mountain at about 25 percent of shares outstanding - about 37.6 million shares. That's lower than peak short interest in November 2012, when more than 51 million shares were being shorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average consumer staples company has just 1.6 percent of shares held short, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain separately reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Waterbury, Vermont-based company said net income rose 28 percent to $138.2 million, or 91 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended December 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an adjusted basis, the company earned 96 cents per share - 6 cents better than analysts on average had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net sales rose almost percent to $1.39 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain also plans to launch a new hot drink brewing system this fall. Called Keurig 2.0, it will use both single-serve K-Cups and larger-sized K-Carafe packs that brew 28 ounces of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London and David Gaffen and Jennifer Ablan in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

Kelley, who came to Green Mountain from the world's largest soda
maker, where he was viewed as a product-savvy executive with
expertise in product and supply chain management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain's cold drink machine is scheduled to debut in

to 16 percent through open market purchases of Green Mountain

Coca-Cola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The significant after-hours move in Green Mountain's stock
appeared to be a classic short squeeze as traders who bet
against the stock scrambled to cover their positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc.,

&lt;p&gt;A "nervous" Jose Molla Martinez aroused the suspicion of anti-drugs officers upon arrival at Bogota's international airport for a flight to Barcelona, and an x-ray found 400 grams of capsules containing cocaine, the police's anti-narcotics unit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez is now in a Bogota prison facing trafficking charges after having the capsules removed in hospital due to the risk of intoxication from leakage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jose Molla Martinez becomes the oldest foreign citizen caught in Colombia serving as a human courier," a statement from the unit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An 82-year-old Colombian was caught a decade ago, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocaine trafficking is a major source of funding for Colombia's leftist FARC guerrillas but Peru is now the biggest producer in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Peter Murphy; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc, maker of the popular Keurig single-cup coffee brewer, said on Wednesday that the Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) bought a 10 percent stake in it for $1.25 billion and would help launch Green Mountain's new cold drink machine planned for next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.04, according to a statement released on Wednesday, exceeding the 92 cents average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

      The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, 
      Inc. (GMCR) (NASDAQ: GMCR) announced today that the companies have 
      signed a 10-year agreement to collaborate on the development and 
      introduction of The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s global brand portfolio for use 
      in GMCR&#8217;s forthcoming Keurig Cold&#8482; at-home beverage system. Under the 
      global strategic agreement, GMCR and The Coca-Cola Company will 
      cooperate to bring the Keurig Cold&#8482; beverage system to consumers around 
      the world. In an effort to align long-term interests, the companies also 
      entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement whereby The Coca-Cola 
      Company will purchase a 10% minority equity position in GMCR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the equity agreement, The Coca-Cola Company will 
      acquire 16,684,139 newly issued shares in GMCR for approximately $1.25 
      billion, which represents an approximate 10% ownership in GMCR (after 
      giving effect to the issuance). The newly issued shares have been priced 
      at $74.98, which represents the trailing 50-trading-day volume weighted 
      average price (&#8220;VWAP&#8221;) as of market close today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the strategic collaboration, GMCR will be The Coca-Cola 
      Company&#8217;s exclusive partner for the production and sale of The Coca-Cola 
      Company-branded single-serve, pod-based cold beverages. The two 
      companies also will explore other future opportunities to collaborate on 
      the Keurig&#174; platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With The Coca-Cola Company as a global strategic partner in our 
      multi-brand at-home Keurig Cold beverage system, we believe there is 
      significant opportunity to premiumize and accelerate growth in the cold 
      beverage category by empowering consumers with an innovative, convenient 
      way to freshly prepare their favorite cold beverages at the push of a

			GMCR Forward Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Certain information in this filing constitutes "forward-looking 
      statements." Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact 
      that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They 
      often include words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," 
      "estimates," "intends," "plans," "seeks" or words of similar meaning, or 
      future or conditional verbs, such as "will," "should," "could," "may," 
      "aims," "intends," or "projects." However, the absence of these words or 
      similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not 
      forward-looking. These statements may relate to: the expected impact of 
      raw material costs and our pricing actions on our results of operations 
      and gross margins, expected trends in net sales and earnings performance 
      and other financial measures, the expected productivity and working 
      capital improvements, the success of introducing and producing new 
      product offerings, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, the 
      adequacy of internally generated funds and existing sources of 
      liquidity, such as the availability of bank financing, the expected 
      results of operations of businesses acquired by us, our ability to issue 
      debt or additional equity securities, our expectations regarding 
      purchasing shares of our common stock under the existing authorizations, 
      projections of payment of dividends, and the impact of the inquiry 
      initiated by the SEC and any related litigation or additional 
      governmental inquiry or enforcement proceedings. A forward-looking 
      statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or 
      circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. 
      Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable 
      as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue 
      reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements 
      speak only as of the date when made. We expressly disclaim any 
      obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether 
      as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, 
      forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
      our Company's historical experience and our present expectations or 
      projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited 
      to, those described in Part&#160;I, "Item&#160;1A. Risk Factors," and Part&#160;II 
      "Item&#160;7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
      Results of Operations" in our fiscal 2013 Annual Report filed on Form 
      10-K, as amended, and elsewhere in this report and those described from 
      time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission.

			Cable Networks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Cable Networks increased $325 million to $1.3 
      billion for the quarter due to growth at ESPN, higher equity income from 
      AE Television Networks (AETN) and, to a lesser extent, an improvement 
      at the domestic Disney Channels. Higher operating income at ESPN was due 
      to increased affiliate and advertising revenues and the absence of 
      equity losses as a result of the prior-year sale of our interest in the 
      ESPN STAR Sports joint venture. The increase in affiliate revenue was 
      driven by contractual rate increases, partially offset by a decrease as 
      a result of the sale of ESPN UK in the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
      Growth in ESPN advertising revenues was due to an increase in rates and 
      units delivered, partially offset by lower ratings. Programming and 
      production costs were comparable to the prior year as an increase due to 
      higher contractual rates for NFL and college football was largely offset 
      by a decrease due to the sale of ESPN UK. Higher equity income from AETN 
      reflected lower programming and marketing costs and higher advertising 
      revenues. Growth at the domestic Disney Channels was primarily due to 
      higher affiliate revenues from contractual rate increases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Broadcasting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Broadcasting decreased $84 million to $178 million 
      for the quarter due to higher programming costs, lower program sales and 
      decreased advertising revenue, partially offset by higher affiliate 
      revenues and lower general and administrative expenses. Higher 
      programming costs were due to higher program write-offs and a 
      contractual rate increase for Modern Family. The decline in 
      program sales reflected higher sales of Revenge and Army Wives 
      in the prior-year quarter. Lower advertising revenue was driven by a 
      decrease at the owned television stations, partially offset by an 
      increase at the ABC Television Network. The increase at the ABC 
      Television Network was due to higher rates and more units delivered, 
      partially offset by lower ratings. Affiliate revenue growth reflected 
      higher contractual rates. Lower general and administrative expenses were 
      driven by lower labor costs primarily as a result of decreased pension 
      and postretirement medical costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parks and Resorts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $3.6 billion 
      and segment operating income increased 16% to $671 million. Operating 
      income growth for the quarter was primarily due to increased guest 
      spending at our domestic parks and resorts, which reflected higher 
      average ticket prices and food, beverage and merchandise spending. The 
      increase in guest spending was partially offset by higher costs for the 
      continued roll out of MyMagic+ and labor and other cost 
      inflation, partially offset by lower pension and postretirement medical 
      costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at our international parks and resorts was comparable 
      to the prior-year quarter as increased guest spending at Disneyland 
      Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and higher attendance at Hong Kong 
      Disneyland Resort were largely offset by lower attendance and occupied 
      room nights at Disneyland Paris.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Studio Entertainment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Studio Entertainment revenues increased 23% to $1.9 billion and segment 
      operating income increased 75% to $409 million. Higher operating income 
      was due to an increase in worldwide theatrical distribution results and, 
      to a lesser extent, increases in domestic home entertainment and 
      television/subscription video on demand (TV/SVOD) distribution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher theatrical results reflected the strength of Frozen and 
      Marvel's Thor: The Dark World in the current quarter, compared to Wreck-It 
      Ralph and no Marvel film in wide release in the prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in domestic home entertainment was driven by lower per unit 
      cost of sales and decreased marketing costs, partially offset by lower 
      unit sales. The decrease in marketing costs was due to fewer significant 
      releases in the current quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The operating income increase in TV/SVOD distribution was due to higher 
      international sales in the current quarter, partially offset by a 
      decrease in SVOD revenues due to a domestic sale of library titles in 
      the prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumer Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer Products revenues increased 11% to $1.1 billion and segment 
      operating income increased 24% to $430 million. Higher operating income 
      was due to increases at our Merchandise Licensing and Retail businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in operating income at Merchandise Licensing was due to the 
      inclusion of Lucasfilm and higher revenues from the performance of Planes, 
      Disney Junior and Monsters University merchandise, 
      partially offset by lower revenue from sales of Cars and Spider-Man 
      merchandise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At our Retail business, higher operating income for the quarter was 
      driven by an increase in North America due to comparable store sales 
      growth and higher online sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Interactive
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive revenues for the quarter increased 38% to $403 million and 
      segment operating income increased $46 million to $55 million. Higher 
      operating income was due to an increase at our console games business 
      driven by the success of Disney Infinity in the current quarter 
      compared to Epic Mickey 2 in the prior-year quarter and growth 
      from our Japan mobile business.

      primarily due to tax benefits recognized in the prior-year quarter. 
      These benefits included an increase in prior-year earnings from foreign 
      operations indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and subject 
      to tax rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate and the 
      favorable resolution of certain tax matters.

      This earnings release presents EPS excluding the impact of certain 
      items, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income, all of 
      which are important financial measures for the Company but are not 
      financial measures defined by GAAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP 
      financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of EPS, 
      cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. EPS 
      excluding certain items, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating 
      income as we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly 
      titled measures reported by other companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EPS excluding certain items &#8211; The Company 
      uses EPS excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the 
      Company&#8217;s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the 
      comparability of results from period to period. The Company believes 
      that information about EPS exclusive of these impacts is useful to 
      investors, particularly where the impact of the excluded items is 
      significant in relation to reported earnings, because the measure allows 
      for comparability between periods of the operating performance of the 
      Company&#8217;s business and allows investors to evaluate the impact of these 
      items separately from the impact of the operations of the business.

			Free cash flow &#8211; The Company uses free cash 
      flow (cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and 
      other property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its 
      operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than 
      capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free 
      cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash 
      available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments 
      and pay dividends or repurchase shares.

			Aggregate segment operating income &#8211; The 
      Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on 
      segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment 
      operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses 
      separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that 
      information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors 
      by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the 
      Company&#8217;s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors 
      that affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both 
      operations and the other factors that affect reported results.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Fast-growing trading house Mercuria, led by two former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) executives, has become the front-runner to buy the physical commodities unit of JPMorgan (JPM.N), one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall Street, two sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan decided to sell its multi-billion dollar physical commodities division last year under rising regulatory and political pressure to retreat to the bank's core business of lending instead of speculating in raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This week, JPM entered into exclusive talks with Mercuria," one of the sources familiar with the process told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final deal could take a few months to conclude, one of the sources said. If agreed, it would catapult Mercuria into the top tier of trading houses with Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L), Vitol and Trafigura TRAFGF.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, Mercuria was competing with Australian bank Macquarie Group (MQG.AX) and private equity manager Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) to buy JPMorgan's unit, sources had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private and lightly regulated trading houses have benefited most from a major retreat by banks from commodities trading over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like Glencore and Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) hired whole teams of traders from banks such as Morgan Stanley. (MS.N) But Mercuria could become the first trading house to absorb an entire physical division from a bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Mercuria both declined to comment. A spokesman for Blackstone in London declined to comment. A spokesman for Macquarie in London did not immediately respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria was founded by Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, who both worked as executives at Goldman Sachs and then trading house Sempra, which was later bought by JPMorgan from the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In less than a decade, Dunand and Jaeggi have built Mercuria into one of the world's largest oil traders, with annual turnover of around $100 billion and 700 traders spread across the globe. But it is still much smaller than the world's largest trader, Vitol, which has turnover of $300 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal value has yet to be agreed and will depend to a large extent on the valuation of large stockpiles of oil and metals the bank holds, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In documents circulated to potential buyers, JPMorgan valued its physical commodity business at $3.3 billion, with an annual income of $750 million. JPMorgan paid nearly $2 billion to buy the largest part of the business from RBS in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale will allow JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon to close the book on a public set-back in a business once hailed as an engine for growth following a dire mix of waning margins, allegations of market manipulation and unprecedented political pressure over its role in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale will also raise questions about the future for JPMorgan's commodities chief Blythe Masters, who over the past five years spent billions of dollars building the biggest physical commodity trading operation on Wall Street, surpassing in size long-time giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO STRANGERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has access to a vast global metals trading and warehousing network, a big U.S. power and gas desk and Canadian oil storage leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to come with a contract supplying crude oil to the biggest U.S. East Coast refinery, the Henry Bath &amp; Sons Ltd metals warehousing business with about 80 storage sheds stretching from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to Johor in Malaysia, and a sizeable U.S. natural gas and power trading book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria has said it is looking to expand in the United States like many other traders as a shale oil boom is opening up new ways to make profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mercuria have expanded aggressively into new areas of commodity trading in the last two years, and part of that strategy has been hiring some of the best traders from the banking world," said Jake White, head of front-office commodities recruitment at Selby Jennings in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But taking on a business of the size and prestige of JPMorgan's physical business is definitely their biggest move yet, and will undoubtedly propel Mercuria into the top tier of commodity trading houses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising global capital requirements for banks under the Basel III regulatory framework and new restrictions on proprietary trading introduced to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis have made commodity markets less attractive for many banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodity income at the world's top 10 investment banks has fallen from a peak of more than $14 billion in 2008 to just $5.5 billion in 2012, according to London-based consultants Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many U.S. banks, it was their prime regulator - the Federal Reserve - that delivered the heaviest blow, making clear in recent years that it was increasingly uneasy with Wall Street's expansion into physical trading of raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid negotiations to resolve a host of other regulatory investigations, including the "London Whale" credit losses from derivatives trading in 2012, JPMorgan's Dimon was also stung by a probe into allegations of U.S. power market manipulation ending in a record $410 million settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is expected to retain its basic commodity derivatives trading desk that hedges prices for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of the industry's oldest hands such as Goldman Sachs aim to retain much of their commodities businesses, others are getting out or adopting different strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank announced late last year that it was largely exiting commodities trading, while Morgan Stanley is selling the majority of its global physical oil trading operation to Russia's Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, Additional reporting by David Sheppard, Oleg Vukmanovic, Henning Gloystein and Veronica Brown; Editing by Peter Graff)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Swiss trader Mercuria has become the front-runner to buy the physical commodities unit of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall Street, two sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms are yet to be agreed and the details of what assets would be included are not known, but a deal would catapult Mercuria into the top tier of trading houses with Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L), Vitol and Trafigura TRAFGF.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's multi-billion dollar push to become Wall Street's biggest commodities trader began in 2008 with the purchase of Bear Stearns and peaked with the $1.6 billion deal to buy RBS Sempra's global oil and metals business in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are a selection of JPMorgan's physical trading assets and operations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSET: POWER PLANTS, ELECTRICITY TOLLING AND MARKETING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGREEMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DATE OF PURCHASE: March 2008 (JPMorgan buys Bear Stearns, including power subsidiary Bear Energy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION: The bank's commodity division, known as JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation, has electricity trading deals with U.S. power plants and wind farms totaling almost 3,000 megawatts of capacity - enough to light up each one of Indiana's 2.8 million homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2013 the bank largely exited the Californian power market, where it has been embroiled in a market manipulation scandal, selling power interests totaling over 3,000 MW of capacity to Edison International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's commodity division also has an equity interest in three entities that own power plants in the United States, including the 545 MW Kinder Jackson facility in Michigan, the 230 MW Brandywine plant in Maryland, and a 75 MW biomass plant in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also owns interests in power plants and wind farms through its private equity arm, JPMorgan Capital Partners, and JPMorgan Infrastructure Investments Group, its asset management division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2007, Bear Stearns' commodity arm, Houston-based Bear Energy, acquired the rights to more than 9,000 MW of electric power output after purchasing Williams Power Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSET: Henry Bath, metals warehousing business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DATE OF PURCHASE: July 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SELLER: RBS Sempra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRICE: Part of $1.6 billion RBS Sempra deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION: When RBS Sempra was bought by JPMorgan for $1.6 billion in 2010, it was the second-largest warehousing company in the LME's vast network with almost 100 warehouses. Since then it has been eclipsed by Goldman Sachs's warehouse business Metro International and Glencore Xstrata's Pacorini, and with around 80 facilities in nine countries, it is now the fourth-largest based on the number of sheds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company was a founder member of the LME in 1877 and issued the first LME warrant on December 20 1883.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company motto is "habere et dispertire" - to have and to share. Tracing its roots back to 18th century England, the Liverpool, UK-based company was eventually bought by Metallgesellschaft in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, the company had largely been a trading house and ship operator. Hollywood actress Catherine Zeta Jones is reportedly named after the Henry Bath ship "Zeta" that was captained by her great grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STATUS: In mid-January, an official from the U.S. Federal Reserve said the regulator had given JPMorgan an "ultimate time limit" for selling its Henry Bath warehousing unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed had been pressing JPMorgan to distance itself from its metals warehousing business for over a year. Since June 2012, the bank had tried unsuccessfully to turn the trading asset into an arm's length "merchant banking" investment in order to hold onto it, documents seen by Reuters showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS Sempra was earlier told by the Fed it had to divest Henry Bath within two years of the launch of its 2008 joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSET: (UBS) Commodities Canada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DATE OF PURCHASE: Feb 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION: Bought from UBS in 2009, the Calgary-based trading division helped JPMorgan gain a foothold in the heart of the Canadian oil sands industry. It trades, transports and stores natural gas, crude and power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We provide extensive physical capabilities, specifically transport and warehousing, and specialize in trading and structuring across energy products, including oil, natural gas and power," the company says on its website detailing its Canadian operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said in 2010 that it was growing its Natural Resources Group, hiring senior oil and gas traders in Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STATUS: The bank's long-term leases on over 6 million barrels of oil storage capacity in Hardisty, Alberta have been mentioned as one of its most valuable but lesser-known assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tanks are owned by Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO), and most of the leases are re-let to other companies operating in Alberta's oil patch, according to market sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG-TERM TRADING DEALS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* NORTHERN TIER REFINERY: In December 2010, JPMorgan agreed to provide crude oil to Northern Tier Energy's 82,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in St. Paul, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It now supplies more than 90 percent of the refinery's crude, according to Northern Tier's SEC filings, including about 10,000 bpd imported from Canada in 2012, EIA data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* PHILADELPHIA ENERGY SOLUTIONS REFINERY: In the summer of 2012, JPMorgan agreed to provide financing and crude supply to the 335,000 bpd refinery in Philadelphia as part of a buy-out by the Carlyle Group (CG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since September 2012 it had been importing some 250,000 bpd of crude from Nigeria, Chad and Azerbaijan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal helped the bank treble its crude imports in 2012 to nearly 130,000 bpd, the data show, overtaking Morgan Stanley's crude and fuel imports for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Louie Sussman, Jonathan Leff and Josephine Mason; Editing by Rosalind Russell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 5 (Reuters) - The physical commodity trading business
that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is in exclusive talks to sell
to Swiss-based trader Mercuria is a vast global enterprise,
parts of which have been bought and sold many times over several
decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While parts of the business have passed through the hands of
some of the most famous and infamous names in the raw materials
markets, its core is comprised of two enterprises considered
among the most successful of their time: Sempra Commodities and
Bear Stearns' power and gas desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But major parts of the JPMorgan business were extracted from
the ashes of failure, including a base metals operation that
endured through the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft and the
Enron meltdown, and a trading platform that dates back to the
days of failed investment bank Drexel Burnham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, much of the business had already been bought
and sold twice in the past five years, once when Royal Bank of
Scotland bought a 51 percent stake in Sempra Commodities
and then again when RBS was forced to sell it to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A partial history of the business is below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE EARLY YEARS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1980s - Drexel Burnham Lambert expands into physical energy
trading, hiring a team that includes future Sempra chiefs David
Messer and Frank Gallipoli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1986 - UK-based warehousing group Henry Bath &amp; Sons is taken
over by Metallgesellschaft (MG), a huge German conglomerate and
one of the world's largest physical and futures metal traders,
according to a history on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 1990 - AIG acquires the commodity trading business of
Drexel Burnham, which had filed for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1997 - Pacific Enterprises and Enova Corp acquire the energy
unit of AIG Trading for $225 million. (The utilities merge one
year later to form Sempra Energy )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2000 - Enron buys UK-listed MG Plc, including Henry Bath
warehouses, for $448 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENRON OUT, OTHERS JUMP IN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2002 - Sempra Energy Trading buys Enron Metals Ltd, the
former-MG metals division of the failed U.S. Enron for $145 mln.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2002 - UBS buys Enron's energy trading business in exchange
for royalties to Enron creditors. The deal includes leases to
several million barrels of oil storage in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2004 - Sempra Energy Trading is renamed Sempra Commodities.
By 2005, the unit contributes more than half of parent company
Sempra's net income; makes over half a billion dollars in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept. 2005 - Bear Stearns moves into energy trading through
joint-venture with Calpine. Deal ends six months later, but Bear
Stearns continues to expand in the power and gas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov. 2006 - Bear Stearns buys Delta Power Co., a private
power-plant developer with 1,380 megawatts of capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 2007 - Bear Stearns' commodity arm buys the electricity
trading book and gas and power contracts of Williams Cos for
$512 million, giving it about 7,700 MW of gas-fired tolling
capacity and 1,800 MW of full-requirements power supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMORGAN'S ACQUISITION SPREE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 2008 - JPMorgan buys Bear Stearns, including its
now-large energy trading business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 2008 - JPMorgan buys carbon offsetting company
ClimateCare. (The firm's management takes it private in 2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 2008 - Royal Bank of Scotland acquires controlling
stake in Sempra Commodities for $1.7 billion to form RBS Sempra
Commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb. 2009 - JPMorgan buys UBS's global
agricultural business and Canadian energy unit in 2009,
including two million barrels of long-term oil storage leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sept. 2009 - JPMorgan buys UK-based EcoSecurities, which
developed clean energy programs and carbon offsets as part of
the Kyoto protocol, for $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov. 2009 - RBS says it will sell its 51 percent interest in
RBS Sempra Commodities in exchange for government aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 2010 - JPMorgan closes deal to buy RBS Sempra's global
oil and metals business, plus its European gas and power desk,
for $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct. 2010 - JPMorgan buys the North American wholesale gas
and power trading book of RBS Sempra for $220 million. The value
of the gross assets was put at $6 billion as of June, and the
business had recorded pre-tax profits of $22 mln in the first
six months of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 2012 - Freepoint Commodities acquires metals
concentrates business from JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 2013 - JPMorgan announces plan to explore "strategic
alternatives" for its physical commodity trading division amid
slimming margins and regulatory pressure to quit risky
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb. 2014 - Mercuria enters exclusive negotiations to buy
JPMorgan's physical commodities business, sources say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka has refused a visa request for a U.S. State Department official, the U.S. Embassy said on Tuesday, after Washington signaled it would propose a U.N. resolution against the South Asian state over alleged war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sri Lanka's External Affairs Ministry said the embassy's statement "was not a correct representation of the facts", adding the dates for the proposed trip had not been convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions rose after U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Nisha Biswal voiced frustration on Saturday over Sri Lanka's failure to punish military personnel responsible linked to reported atrocities in a civil war that the Colombo government won in 2009 against separatist Tamil rebels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biswal, speaking after a two-day visit to Colombo, said Washington would put forward a third U.N. human rights resolution against Sri Lanka in March to address the allegations because its rights climate has been worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Embassy said the Sri Lankan government had turned down a visa application for Catherine Russell, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for global women's issues, and it called the decision "regrettable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russell had been scheduled to visit Sri Lanka in line with her mandate to promote stability, peace, and development by empowering women politically, socially and economically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The United States will continue to raise important issues related to gender-based violence, the impact that the conflict had on families (particularly female-headed households), the need for greater economic empowerment by women, and for greater political participation by women across Sri Lanka," the embassy said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HUMAN SHIELDS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biswal said that during her visit people in Sri Lanka's former northern war zone referred to a range of human rights abuses including the disappearance of civilians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government, which finally crushed the rebellion of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 26 years after it erupted, has rejected calls for an international inquiry, saying this would be aimed only at pleasing a large Tamil diaspora living in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior U.S. officials declined to say what would be in the planned resolution, but embassy officials said it might repeat the call for an international investigation in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The External Affairs Ministry on Wednesday said the relevant U.S. authorities were advised by the ministry that the dates proposed for the visit were not convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rescheduling of a visit does not amount to refusal of a visa. The position was fully and clearly explained to the U.S. Embassy," the ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka has rejected U.S. criticism of its human rights record as "grossly disproportionate".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.N. panel has assessed that around 40,000 mainly Tamil civilians died in the final few months of the war. Both sides committed atrocities, but army shelling killed most victims, it concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajapaksa, speaking at Independence Day celebrations on Tuesday, said unidentified foreigners were trying to use "northern people", a reference to ethnic Tamils, as "human shields".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The invaders always came to our country shedding oceans of crocodile tears. They interfered ... putting forward claims to protect human rights, establish democracy and the rule of law," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Alison Williams)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Exact Media Disrupts Traditional Product Sampling With First Smart Sampling Network; Initial Participants Include Unilever, Procter  Gamble and Gilt&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Service Puts an End to Unmeasurable Product Sampling by Precisely Targeting Product Samples Leveraging Retailers' Existing Shipments&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Feb 5, 2014) - 
				Exact Media emerged from stealth mode today with the first smart sampling network that allows brands to finely target samples and then accurately measure their impact. Quietly launched in beta in mid-2013 to just a few brands and e-commerce partners, Exact Media currently counts among its brand and retail partners companies such as Unilever, Procter  Gamble, Gilt and Coastal.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since inception, Exact Media's service has doubled in volume each month, and the company is on track to deliver more than 15 million targeted samples in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other sampling methods which involve essentially giving samples to every person walking by (or blindly including them in every box being shipped by a retailer), Exact Media can target samples based on a broad range of selects including products being purchased, shopping basket size, gender and even clothing size. No other sampling service or network can target and measure as precisely as Exact Media. And because all consumers open their package from the retailers, brands enjoy a 100 percent open rate on their samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact Media's three-step process:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Using a rate-card model and selects based on depth of targeting (e.g., geography, age, shopping habits and more), Exact Media helps brands reach the right consumers using the right retail partners.
            
				Then it arranges for brand samples to be shipped to the retail partners' warehouses. Exact Media trains a retailer's logistics team to ensure the samples are distributed precisely as directed.
            
				After the samples are distributed, Exact Media administers surveys to recipients and provides real-time, anonymous customer insights back to brands on trial rates and intent to purchase.
			&lt;p&gt;Fees for the brand vary based on the size of the campaign, size of the sample, and the level of targeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unilever is one brand partner already using Exact Media. "At Unilever, targeting and measurement, as well as eliminating waste, are extremely important to us when it comes to our sample campaigns," said Pinky Tang, Assistant Brand Manager at Unilever. "With Exact Media and its customized targeting approach, we are able to reach our consumers at the right time, with the perfect product for them, and we can easily measure the ROI on campaigns. This innovative model for sample distribution is a win for the consumer, the brand and the retailers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coastal.com, the leading online direct-to-consumer retailer of replacement contact lenses, eyeglasses and optical products, is one of Exact Media's retail partners. Braden Hoeppner, Vice President of Marketing at Coastal.com, said, "Participating in the Exact Media network has been great for Coastal.com and for our customers. We get to delight our customers with timely, relevant product gifts from brands, and can monetize our shipments by doing it. Feedback from our customers has been entirely positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact Media cofounders Ray Cao and Daniel Rodic said they were inspired to create the sampling network model after observing that sampling was an area of marketing that remained unmeasurable. "We're seeing marketers in every discipline move away from generic campaigns more toward targeted, measurable activities such as adwords," said Cao, "and no one was doing that for sampling." Cao had experience with targeted sampling from another of his companies, Luxe Box, and believed his team could make the model broader and more scalable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When brands blindly give samples away to anyone and everyone, most of them end up in the trash," added Cao. "Our smart sampling network reduces all that waste, and provides better targeting and measurable results for brands. It's the nail in the coffin for traditional product sample distribution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brands and retail partners interested in learning more can visit www.exactmedia.io or contact getsmart@exactmedia.io. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Exact Media Network

      SANsymphony-V storage virtualization in place the company has added a 
      new level of business continuity and high-availability at its main IT 
      site and has put in place the infrastructure to support disaster 
      recovery through additional replication capabilities to an outsourced 
      data center. DataCore&#8217;s SANsymphony-V has proven itself to be 
      cost-effective and reliable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Our IT operations and critical business applications are exposed to 
      constant change and growth demands, with the DataCore solution in place 
      we not only have met our acute needs, but we have made a long-term 
      investment that we believe is a strategic advantage,&#8221; said Christian 
      Arragain, head of the computer science department at Osterwalder Zurich 
      AG. &#8220;Without hesitation, we can say that everything promised with 
      SANsymphony-V has been delivered."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AVIA Osterwalder Zurich AG is a member of AVIA International, operating 
      more than 3,000 AVIA petrol stations in 14 European countries. 
      Osterwalder Zurich AG operates over 120 petrol stations in Switzerland 
      and needs to ensure the supply and flow of fuels be completed while 
      maintaining the highest level of safety. Besides petroleum products for 
      service stations Osterwalder Zurich AG supplies wholesale and retail 
      customers with diesel fuel, lubricants, fuel oils and pellets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ERP system is the core application to run the business
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At Osterwalder Zurich AG, all IT Services provided are centrally 
      located. The heart of the IT operations is the ERP system, which manages 
      orders, processing and delivery to gas stations and business clients. 
      Microsoft Dynamics NAV is the basis of the ERP system implemented. While 
      no downtime is tolerable, a failure in the winter months for business is 
      almost unthinkable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company needed to increase its reliability and provide better 
      protection for its central storage systems and the best way to do so was 
      to establish a second data center remote from the site in Niederhasli 
      (about twenty kilometers away from the main site). With two data 
      centers, the company would have access to more capacity, higher 
      performance and increased availability with a solution that could 
      provide fast synchronous mirroring and a cost-effective solution for 
      disaster recovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SANsymphony-V better protects AVIA&#8217;s business and investments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the central data center, SANsymphony-V runs on two standard IBM 
      servers, in effect, transforming them into intelligent storage servers. 
      These DataCore servers provision and supply both the internal and 
      external storage capacity from arrays to application servers. DataCore 
      caching optimizes all workloads across all their storage to greatly 
      improve performance and application response times. Between the two 
      redundant DataCore systems the data is synchronously mirrored at 
      high-speeds. Continuous availability of operations is ensured through 
      the auto failover and auto failback features of SANsymphony-V. In 
      effect, the systems stay up and if one side fails it provides an 
      automatic restart making the process non-disruptive to the critical 
      business applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For their disaster recovery site AVIA Osterwalder Zurich AG has 
      implemented automatic, asynchronous site replication using DataCore&#8217;s 
      integrated Advanced Site Recovery feature over a WAN link. This link 
      connects to an emergency data center for disaster recovery purposes. At 
      this remote location, a VMware server and a DataCore storage server with 
      internal storage capacity is operating on IBM hardware. The systems use 
      asynchronous mirroring to replicate vital information between the sites. 
      In case of a major emergency or site disaster, the data center, which is 
      equipped with emergency generators, can be begin operating in a very 
      short time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The concept and our evaluation process with existing references 
      convinced us that DataCore was the right solution. In addition to the 
      high availability and disaster recovery requirements, DataCore&#8217;s storage 
      virtualization software provided a new level of flexibility and ease of 
      management. Even more, the evaluation we conducted showed clearly that 
      DataCore offered the best value for money, so we decided in favor of 
      SANsymphony-V,&#8221; continued Arragain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			OTI Receives Visa&#174; Certification for its 'WAVE' 
      NFC Device
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			WAVE Helps to NFC-Enable any Smartphone in a Secured Way
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			On Track Innovations Ltd. (OTI) (NASDAQ: OTIV), a global leader 
      in highly secure cashless payment solutions based on contactless 
      transactions and near-field communication (NFC), announced today its OTI WAVE 
      technology has been certified for inclusion in Visa&#174;&#8217;s 
      Compliant Products List. The OTI WAVE is an NFC add-on for 
      smartphones, tablets and PCs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The OTI WAVE is the industry&#8217;s first audio jack plug-in NFC 
      payment solution and the only one to receive certification from major 
      payment companies including Visa&#174; and MasterCard&#174;. 
      Based on OTI&#8217;s patented NFC technology, the compact OTI WAVE is 
      device agnostic, easily plugging into any smartphone, tablet or PC. 
      Users pay with their device while enjoying real-time benefits from 
      loyalty programs and other incentives as delivered by the corresponding 
      application. It opens up a whole new world of mobile device 
      applications, while alleviating the burden of a wallet full of credit 
      cards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The compliance recognition from Visa&#174; indicates the OTI WAVE 
      is approved for issuance anywhere in the world, and that the OTI WAVE 
      met certain operational characteristics, including the Visa Mobile 
      Contactless Payment Specification and EMVCo&#8217;s Contactless Communication 
      Protocol Specification.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the certification from two of the world&#8217;s largest payment networks 
      -- Visa&#174; and MasterCard&#174; -- our WAVE 
      technology platform is poised for large-scale implementations with 
      banks, payment card providers, public transportation projects, loyalty 
      and rewards programs and more,&#8221; said Ofer Tziperman, OTI's CEO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "OTI joins a small, elite group of vendors that have passed the long and 
      rigorous certification process with Visa&#174;. This certification 
      will help solidify the market&#8217;s endorsement of the WAVE 
      solution,&#8221; added Tziperman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With NFC-enabled applications expected to grow at a 35% CAGR to $34.5 
      billion by 2016, it&#8217;s clear the payment industry is rapidly adopting NFC 
      technology. NFC is becoming increasingly recognized as the fastest, most 
      efficient, most versatile and secured method for payment transactions, 
      and this certification by Visa&#174; positions us to capitalize on 
      the major industry shift.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OTI&#8217;s WAVE has three key features that make it a perfect solution 
      to be offered by enterprises to their clients:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): The OTI WAVE provides 
        PKI authentication via the add-on audio jack device. The 
        authentication capability allows certificate authorities and banks to 
        ensure customer' secure access to accounts across all devices and 
        channels. This is ideal for secured M-commerce applications.
      
			
				NFC: The OTI WAVE turns any smartphone, tablet or laptop 
        into an NFC-secured payment device. The on-board secure element of the WAVE 
        connects to the smartphone&#8217;s operating system (OS) via the audio jack, 
        allowing for PIN code authentication and over the air (OTA) 
        capabilities such as reloading electronic cash, remote 
        personalization, firmware updates, and new applications.
      
			
				Java OS Platform: The OTI WAVE runs on a Java OS over a 
        secure element and is open for third-party development.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The OTI WAVE is suitable for many applications and markets 
      including: mobile payments (debit, credit, e-purse), e-ticketing for 
      transportation and events, PKI support, loyalty and e-coupon programs, 
      healthcare applications and access control.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OTI&#8217;s WAVE can be used for electronic payment transactions even 
      when disconnected from a customer&#8217;s device (e.g. for mass transit gates, 
      vending machines, etc.). When the pre-paid balance is running low, the 
      OTI WAVE can simply plug into a smartphone to add additional 
      money into its ePurse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Throughout 2013, we continued to make important progress on delivering 
      long-term, profitable growth as we worked through challenging 
      marketplace and macroeconomic conditions,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman 
      and chief executive officer. &#8220;We achieved solid earnings per share 
      growth, modest growth in both currency neutral net sales and operating 
      income, and strong free cash flow, demonstrating our ability to manage 
      successfully each of the levers of our business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Over time, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow by 
      creating and capturing the opportunities in the expanding nonalcoholic 
      ready-to-drink beverage category, ultimately reaching our most important 
      goal &#8211; creating value for our shareowners.&#8221;

			OPERATING REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the full year, sparkling drinks grew approximately &#189; percent, with 
      growth of &#189; percent for Coca-Cola trademark brands, including growth of 
      15 percent for Coca-Cola Zero. Sparkling flavors grew 1 percent, 
      including growth of 12 percent for our energy portfolio. Still beverages 
      declined 3 percent, balanced between declines in water and juices. Total 
      volume in Great Britain grew 1 percent and volume in continental Europe 
      (including Norway and Sweden) declined &#189; percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full-year net sales totaled $8.2 billion, up 2 percent on a reported 
      basis, or up &#189; percent on a currency neutral basis. Free cash flow for 
      2013 totaled $524 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net pricing per case for the full year was up slightly and cost of sales 
      per case increased 2 percent. Operating expenses declined approximately 
      4&#189; percent. These figures are comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the fourth quarter, volume grew 2&#189; percent, driven primarily by 
      growth in Coca-Cola trademark brands, including 20 percent growth for 
      Coca-Cola Zero, and growth in energy. Fourth quarter volume in Great 
      Britain grew 2&#189; percent, and continental European volume grew 2 percent. 
      Fourth-quarter net pricing per case declined &#189; percent, with growth in 
      cost of sales per case of 1 percent, both on a comparable and currency 
      neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fourth-quarter net sales totaled $2 billion, up 6 percent on a reported 
      basis, or up 3&#189; percent on a currency neutral basis. Reported operating 
      income totaled $217 million, an increase of 45 percent. On a comparable 
      basis, operating income totaled $232 million, an increase of 12 percent, 
      or 9 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Throughout the year, our people faced a series of rapidly evolving 
      challenges, but their efforts, coupled with the success of our marketing 
      programs, drove a return to growth,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, executive 
      vice president and president, European Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In 2014, our people will execute a sound business plan that is 
      well-balanced between marketplace initiatives and investment in our 
      future,&#8221; Mr. Patricot said. &#8220;We will build on the success of our core 
      brands, enhance our focus on Coca-Cola Zero and energy, and introduce 
      new packaging that we believe will have a positive impact in the market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			SHARE REPURCHASE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE began a $1.5 billion share repurchase program in January 2013 and 
      repurchased approximately $1 billion of its shares last year. In 
      December 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion share 
      repurchase program &#8211; the fourth program since the creation of new CCE. 
      The company plans approximately $800 million in repurchases in 2014. 
      These plans may be adjusted depending on economic, operating, or other 
      factors, including acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FULL-YEAR 2014 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2014, CCE continues to expect earnings per diluted share to grow 
      approximately 10 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis. 
      Although too early to predict the impact, based on recent rates, 
      currency translation would benefit full-year 2014 earnings per share in 
      a range of 3 percent to 4 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales are expected to grow in a low single-digit range and operating 
      income is expected to grow in a mid-single-digit range. This outlook is 
      comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company also expects 2014 free cash flow in a range of $600 million 
      to $650 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 
      $350 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be 
      approximately 3 percent and the comparable effective tax rate for 2014 
      is expected to be in a range of 26 percent to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

          Net Pricing Per Case" and "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Cost of 
          Sales per Case" are used to more clearly evaluate bottle and can 
          pricing and cost trends in the marketplace. These measures exclude 
          items not directly related to bottle and can pricing or cost and 
          currency exchange rate changes.
        
			
			
				
          (b) The non-GAAP measure "Comparable Bottle and Can Volume" is used 
          to analyze the performance of our business on a constant period 
          basis. There was one additional selling day in the fourth-quarter of 
          2013 versus the fourth-quarter of 2012. There were the same number 
          of selling days in the full year 2013 versus the full year 2012.
        
			
			
				
          (c) The non-GAAP measure "Free Cash Flow" is provided to focus

          opportunities.

				Full-year reported operating income was $914 million, down 1&#189; 
        percent; full-year comparable operating income was $1.05 billion, up 3 
        percent, or up 1&#189; percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE/Euronext Paris: CCE)
			today 
      reported full-year 2013 earnings per diluted share of $2.44, or $2.51 on 
      a comparable basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported operating income for the year totaled $914 million; comparable 
      operating income totaled $1.05 billion, up 3 percent, or up 1&#189; percent 
      on a comparable and currency neutral basis versus a year ago. Currency 
      translation had a positive impact of approximately 4 cents on full-year 
      comparable earnings per diluted share. Items affecting comparability are 
      detailed on pages 10 through 13 of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Throughout 2013, we continued to make important progress on delivering 
      long-term, profitable growth as we worked through challenging 
      marketplace and macroeconomic conditions,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman 
      and chief executive officer. &#8220;We achieved solid earnings per share 
      growth, modest growth in both currency neutral net sales and operating 
      income, and strong free cash flow, demonstrating our ability to manage 
      successfully each of the levers of our business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Over time, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow by 
      creating and capturing the opportunities in the expanding nonalcoholic 
      ready-to-drink beverage category, ultimately reaching our most important 
      goal &#8211; creating value for our shareowners.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			OPERATING REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the full year, sparkling drinks grew approximately &#189; percent, with 
      growth of &#189; percent for Coca-Cola trademark brands, including growth of 
      15 percent for Coca-Cola Zero. Sparkling flavors grew 1 percent, 
      including growth of 12 percent for our energy portfolio. Still beverages 
      declined 3 percent, balanced between declines in water and juices. Total 
      volume in Great Britain grew 1 percent and volume in continental Europe 
      (including Norway and Sweden) declined &#189; percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full-year net sales totaled $8.2 billion, up 2 percent on a reported 
      basis, or up &#189; percent on a currency neutral basis. Free cash flow for 
      2013 totaled $524 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net pricing per case for the full year was up slightly and cost of sales 
      per case increased 2 percent. Operating expenses declined approximately 
      4&#189; percent. These figures are comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the fourth quarter, volume grew 2&#189; percent, driven primarily by 
      growth in Coca-Cola trademark brands, including 20 percent growth for 
      Coca-Cola Zero, and growth in energy. Fourth quarter volume in Great 
      Britain grew 2&#189; percent, and continental European volume grew 2 percent. 
      Fourth-quarter net pricing per case declined &#189; percent, with growth in 
      cost of sales per case of 1 percent, both on a comparable and currency 
      neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fourth-quarter net sales totaled $2 billion, up 6 percent on a reported 
      basis, or up 3&#189; percent on a currency neutral basis. Reported operating 
      income totaled $217 million, an increase of 45 percent. On a comparable 
      basis, operating income totaled $232 million, an increase of 12 percent, 
      or 9 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Throughout the year, our people faced a series of rapidly evolving 
      challenges, but their efforts, coupled with the success of our marketing 
      programs, drove a return to growth,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, executive 
      vice president and president, European Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In 2014, our people will execute a sound business plan that is 
      well-balanced between marketplace initiatives and investment in our 
      future,&#8221; Mr. Patricot said. &#8220;We will build on the success of our core 
      brands, enhance our focus on Coca-Cola Zero and energy, and introduce 
      new packaging that we believe will have a positive impact in the market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SHARE REPURCHASE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE began a $1.5 billion share repurchase program in January 2013 and 
      repurchased approximately $1 billion of its shares last year. In 
      December 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion share 
      repurchase program &#8211; the fourth program since the creation of new CCE. 
      The company plans approximately $800 million in repurchases in 2014. 
      These plans may be adjusted depending on economic, operating, or other 
      factors, including acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FULL-YEAR 2014 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2014, CCE continues to expect earnings per diluted share to grow 
      approximately 10 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis. 
      Although too early to predict the impact, based on recent rates, 
      currency translation would benefit full-year 2014 earnings per share in 
      a range of 3 percent to 4 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales are expected to grow in a low single-digit range and operating 
      income is expected to grow in a mid-single-digit range. This outlook is 
      comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company also expects 2014 free cash flow in a range of $600 million 
      to $650 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 
      $350 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be 
      approximately 3 percent and the comparable effective tax rate for 2014 
      is expected to be in a range of 26 percent to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

          Net Pricing Per Case" and "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Cost of 
          Sales per Case" are used to more clearly evaluate bottle and can 
          pricing and cost trends in the marketplace. These measures exclude 
          items not directly related to bottle and can pricing or cost and 
          currency exchange rate changes.
        
			
			
				
          (b) The non-GAAP measure "Comparable Bottle and Can Volume" is used

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to be collaborating with Ichor in the application of its 
      technology for Pfizer&#8217;s investigational therapeutic cancer vaccine-based 
      immunotherapy programs,&#8221; said James Merson, Senior Vice President and 
      CSO of Pfizer&#8217;s Vaccine Immunotherapeutics Research Unit. &#8220;Therapeutic 
      vaccine-based immunotherapies hold considerable promise to potentially 
      extend or improve the lives of patients with many different types of 
      cancer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer And Merck To Collaborate On Innovative Anti-Cancer Combination 
      Studies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Agreement to Combine Merck&#8217;s Investigational Anti-PD-1 and Key 
      Pfizer Oncology Assets
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that it has agreed with Merck  
      Co., Inc., known as MSD outside the United States and Canada (&#8220;Merck&#8221;), 
      through two Merck subsidiaries, to explore the therapeutic potential of 
      Merck&#8217;s investigational anti-PD-1 therapy, MK-3475, in combination with 
      two Pfizer oncology assets. A Phase I/II clinical study will evaluate 
      the safety and anti-cancer efficacy of MK-3475 combined with Pfizer&#8217;s 
      axitinib (INLYTA&#174;) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A separate 
      Phase I study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the 
      combination of MK-3475 and PF-05082566 (PF-2566), Pfizer&#8217;s 
      investigational, fully humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that 
      stimulates signaling through 4-1BB (CD-137), a protein involved in 
      regulation of immune cell proliferation and survival.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There has been notable progress in the cancer immunotherapy field over 
      the last year, with new clinical data showing promising efficacy and 
      tolerability for emerging therapies &#8211; particularly those that target the 
      PD-1 pathway,&#8221; said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of 
      Clinical Development and Medical Affairs and chief medical officer for 
      Pfizer Oncology. &#8220;These investigational therapies, which harness the 
      body&#8217;s immune system to treat disease, may hold the greatest potential 
      for patients with cancer when used in combination with other 
      immuno-oncology agents, like PF-2566, to amplify anti-tumor immune 
      responses, or with targeted agents, like axitinib, to optimize their 
      effectiveness. We are pleased to collaborate with Merck to study a 
      diverse group of our anti-cancer agents in combination with MK-3475, 
      with the goal of identifying more efficacious treatment options for 
      patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to be collaborating with&#160;Pfizer&#160;to study&#160;MK-3475 as part 
      of these novel combination regimens,&#8221; said Dr. Eric Rubin, vice 
      president, clinical development for&#160;oncology,&#160;Merck Research 
      Laboratories. &#8220;Early evaluation of&#160;immunotherapeutic combinations is 
      important toward potentially accelerating the development of new options 
      for patients with cancer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer will conduct the clinical studies of MK-3475 plus axitinib and 
      MK-3475 plus PF-2566. This agreement does not provide for any 
      collaboration between Pfizer and Merck following the completion of the 
      specified studies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Financial terms were not disclosed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under a separate agreement Pfizer and Merck are currently exploring the 
      pre-clinical combination of MK-3475 with Pfizer&#8217;s investigational 
      therapy palbociclib (PD-0332991). Merck is conducting these pre-clinical 
      studies. Further studies would depend on the outcome of the ongoing 
      pre-clinical studies as well as subsequent agreement by Merck and Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About MK-3475Many tumors are able to evade the immune 
      system through a mechanism that exploits the PD-1 inhibitory checkpoint 
      protein. MK-3475 is an investigational, highly selective anti-PD-1 
      immunotherapy designed to restore the natural ability of the immune 
      system to recognize and target cancer cells by selectively achieving 
      dual ligand blockade (PD-L1 and PD-L2) of the PD-1 protein. By blocking 
      PD-1, MK-3475 enables activation of the immune system&#8217;s T-cells that 
      target cancer by essentially releasing a brake on the immune system. For

			About INLYTA&#174; (axitinib) tabletsINLYTA, 
      a kinase inhibitor, is an oral therapy that is designed to inhibit 
      tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
      receptors 1, 2 and 3; these receptors can influence tumor growth, 
      vascular angiogenesis and progression of cancer (the spread of tumors). 
      In the United States (U.S.), INLYTA is approved for the treatment of 
      advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of one prior systemic 
      therapy. INLYTA is also approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
      for use in the European Union (EU) in adult patients with advanced RCC 
      after failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information for INLYTA (axitinib) tabletsHypertension 
      including hypertensive crisis has been observed. Blood pressure should 
      be well controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor for hypertension 
      and treat as needed. For persistent hypertension, despite use of 
      antihypertensive medications, reduce the dose. Discontinue INLYTA if 
      hypertension is severe and persistent despite use of antihypertensive 
      therapy and dose reduction of INLYTA, and discontinuation should be 
      considered if there is evidence of hypertensive crisis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arterial and venous thrombotic events have been observed and can be 
      fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk or who 
      have a history of these events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have been reported. INLYTA 
      has not been studied in patients with evidence of untreated brain 
      metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be 
      used in those patients. If any bleeding requires medical intervention, 
      temporarily interrupt the INLYTA dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, including death, have 
      occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal 
      perforation or fistula. Monitor for symptoms of gastrointestinal 
      perforation or fistula periodically throughout treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement has been reported. 
      Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically 
      throughout, treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stop INLYTA at least 24 hours prior to scheduled surgery. Reversible 
      Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been observed. If 
      signs or symptoms occur, permanently discontinue treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Monitor for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically 
      throughout, treatment. For moderate to severe proteinuria, reduce the 
      dose or temporarily interrupt treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liver enzyme elevation has been observed during treatment with INLYTA. 
      Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin before initiation of, and periodically 
      throughout, treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the starting dose should 
      be decreased. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe 
      hepatic impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to 
      the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving INLYTA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors. If unavoidable, reduce the dose. 
      Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase INLYTA plasma 
      concentrations and should be avoided.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inducers and, if possible, avoid moderate CYP3A4/5 
      inducers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common (&#8805;20%) adverse events (AEs) occurring in patients 
      receiving INLYTA (all grades, vs sorafenib) were diarrhea (55% vs 53%), 
      hypertension (40% vs 29%), fatigue (39% vs 32%), decreased appetite (34% 
      vs 29%), nausea (32% vs 22%), dysphonia (31% vs 14%), hand-foot syndrome 
      (27% vs 51%), weight decreased (25% vs 21%), vomiting (24% vs 17%), 
      asthenia (21% vs 14%), and constipation (20% vs 20%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common (&#8805;10%) grade 3/4 AEs occurring in patients receiving 
      INLYTA (vs sorafenib) were hypertension (16% vs 11%), diarrhea (11% vs 
      7%), and fatigue (11% vs 5%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common (&#8805;20%) lab abnormalities occurring in patients receiving 
      INLYTA (all grades, vs sorafenib) included increased creatinine (55% vs 
      41%), decreased bicarbonate (44% vs 43%), hypocalcemia (39% vs 59%), 
      decreased hemoglobin (35% vs 52%), decreased lymphocytes (absolute) (33% 
      vs 36%), increased ALP (30% vs 34%), hyperglycemia (28% vs 23%), 
      increased lipase (27% vs 46%), increased amylase (25% vs 33%), increased

			About MK-3475
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many tumors are able to evade the immune system through a mechanism that 
      exploits the PD-1 inhibitory checkpoint protein. MK-3475 is an 
      investigational, highly selective anti-PD-1 immunotherapy designed to 
      restore the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target 
      cancer cells by selectively achieving dual ligand blockade (PD-L1 and 
      PD-L2) of the PD-1 protein. By blocking PD-1, MK-3475 enables activation 
      of the immune system&#8217;s T-cells that target cancer, essentially by 
      releasing a brake on the immune system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MK-3475 is being studied in 13 clinical trials estimated to enroll more 
      than 4,000 patients across more than 30 types of cancer including:

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to J.P. Morgan 
      Mortgage Trust 2014-1 Certificates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigns preliminary ratings to forty 
      classes of mortgage pass-through certificates from J.P. Morgan Mortgage 
      Trust 2014-1, a jumbo prime RMBS transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mortgage pool backing J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2014-1 is comprised 
      of 412 first-lien mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of 
      $356,388,663 as of the cut-off date. The loans in the pool are all 
      fixed-rate mortgages with 30-year maturities. Ten of the loans are 
      interest-only for ten years. The pool is characterized by substantial 
      borrower equity in each mortgaged property, as evidenced by the weighted 
      average LTV (71%) and CLTV (72%). The weighted average credit score of 
      the mortgage pool is 761, which is within the &#8220;prime&#8221; mortgage range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction included a loan-level analysis of the 
      mortgage pools using our Residential Mortgage Default and Loss Model, 
      together with a review of the key transaction parties, results of loan 
      file reviews performed by independent third party firms and review of 
      the legal structure and key documentation. This analysis is further 
      described in our U.S. RMBS Rating Methodology.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Feb 6 (Reuters) - Blythe Masters, who heads
JPMorgan's commodity business, has joined a committee
advising the U.S. derivatives regulator, the agency said on
Thursday, a move that comes as Masters' bank is shedding part of
its physical commodity operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Thursday
voted on the new composition of its Global Markets Advisory
Committee, a group of market participants that meets regularly
to discuss a broad range of issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past five years, Masters built the biggest physical
commodity trading operation on Wall Street at JPMorgan,
surpassing in size long-time giants Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank decided to sell its multi-billion dollar
physical commodities division last year under rising political
pressure over banks' role in the market, raising questions as to
the future of Masters at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory committee consists of a large group of senior
officials at large investment banks, asset managers, firms
running trading platforms and industry bodies and is sponsored
by Mark Wetjen, the CFTC's acting chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee will meet next week to discuss the CFTC's
controversial cross-border rules, which lay out how foreign
companies need to comply with U.S. rules when dealing with U.S.
clients, or doing business from U.S. offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules have riled regulators abroad, who want greater
reliance on their own rules, and Wall Street banks last month
sued the agency in the hope to beat back the CFTC's expanded
scope of power to regulate markets overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the CFTC has given the public time to comment on
a Nov. 14 memo that was at the heart of a lawsuit, and which
will also come up at the meeting next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan paid $410 million to settle allegations
of power market manipulation in California to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the CFTC is probing metals trading - which is
dominated by large banks including JPMorgan - and has subpoenaed
a metals warehousing firm as part of that probe, Reuters
reported last year..

		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Assigns Final Rating to JPMCC Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-FBLU
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and rating Outlooks to 
      the J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-FBLU 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2014-FBLU:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$205,000,000 class A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$340,000,000* class X-CP 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$340,000,000* class X-EXT 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$77,000,000 class B, 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$58,000,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$76,000,000 class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$119,000,000 class E 'NR'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      * Interest-only classes X-CP X-EXT are equal to the notional balance of 
      classes A, B and C.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, the 
      primary asset of which is one loan having an aggregate principal balance 
      of approximately $535 million as of the cutoff date and secured by the 
      Fontainebleau Miami Beach, a 1,594 room luxury resort hotel located 
      along the beach in Miami Beach, FL. The loan was originated by JP Morgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Single-Asset Concentration: The transaction is secured by a single hotel 
      property and therefore more susceptible to single event risk related to 
      the market. Hotel performance is considered to be more volatile due to 
      their operating nature.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moderate Trust Leverage: Fitch Ratings' stressed DSCR and LTV for the 
      trust component of the debt are 1.30x and 81.0%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Asset Quality and Market Positioning: The Fontainebleau Resort is a 
      class A luxury resort located in Miami Beach, FL with an irreplaceable 
      location directly along the Atlantic Ocean and first-class amenities 
      including over 200,000 sf of meeting and event space, a 40,000-sf spa, 
      12 swimming pools and multiple dining and entertainment options. The 
      property consistently ranks among the top conference hotels in the 
      region and is a dominant property in its primary competitive set.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upward Trending Performance: Revenue per available room (RevPAR) as of 
      the trailing twelve months (TTM) ended November 2013 reflected an 
      increase of 9.0% over year-end (YE) 2012 and a 16.2% increase over YE 
      2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Volatility of Food and Beverage Revenue: Approximately 45.5% of revenue 
      at the property is derived from food and beverage (FB) revenue, which 
      is considered more volatile than room revenue. Although the overall 
      level of FB is high, it is spread among multiple venues and sources 
      such as restaurants, banquet functions and lounges. The property's 
      signature restaurants and LIV nightclub serve as draws for non-hotel 
      guests as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 84.0% decline in value and 
      an approximately 73.1% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to the 'AAAsf' rated class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings for class A and a 30.0% 
      decline in Fitch NCF would result in a one category downgrade, while a 
      51.0% decline would result in a downgrade to below investment grade. The 
      Rating Sensitivity section in the presale report includes a detailed 
      explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report. The presale report is available to all 
      investors on Fitch's web site 'www.fitchratings.com'.

      With research 
      confirming that three-quarters (78%) of buy-side attendees said they 
      found new opportunities at last year&#8217;s Digital Content NewFronts event, 
      the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), 
      today unveiled a &#8220;super-sized&#8221; schedule for the third annual&#160;NewFronts 
      marketplace, which expands the traditional weeklong event to nine days 
      of presentations between April 28 and May 8. Held in New York City, this 
      series of action-packed programming upfronts from digital video content 
      leaders promises to attract marketers and media buyers to learn about a 
      range of compelling digital video opportunities. For the second year in 
      a row, IAB is serving as managing partner for the NewFronts, supervising 
      logistics and communications for this dynamic industry event.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The NewFronts&#8217; six founding partners &#8211; AOL, DigitasLBi, Google/YouTube, 
      Hulu, Microsoft and Yahoo &#8211; will host presentations that spotlight 
      original digital video content, alongside 14 other prominent online 
      companies, with more to come. Top companies that produce and distribute 
      original digital video programming were invited to participate in the 
      2014 NewFronts based a multilayered screening process which included 
      rankings from comScore and Nielsen and a survey conducted by the IAB 
      among leading ad agency media buyers. Once a short list was determined, 
      the NewFronts Advisory Board provided high-level buy-side 
      recommendations on the potential line-up. Notables on the board include:

			Procter  Gamble Brands Open Global Family Home to Serve Moms and

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Procter  Gamble (NYSE:PG), a Worldwide Olympic Partner, officially

      program for Sochi 2014, in which PG brands honour the role moms play in

      Humphries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our brands are in the business of serving all moms on their journey 
      through life with their kids,&#8221; said Phil Duncan, PG Global Design 
      Officer, who helped welcome moms and families of Olympians at the 
      opening of the Family Home. &#8220;So when a PG brand sponsors an athlete, we 
      celebrate the mom who helped get them here.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG brands are providing moms and families of Olympians in Sochi with 
      more than 1,200 hours of everyday services that make an extraordinary 
      difference when families are far from home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For instance, PG&#8217;s beauty brands are offering the opportunity for

        products for athletes and coaches in Sochi.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s so great that PG is taking the time to recognize moms and all the 
      great things they do &#8211; I know I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today without my 
      mom,&#8221; said Kaillie Humphries, Canadian bobsledder and defending gold 
      medallist for two-women bobsleigh. &#8220;Knowing my mom is being taken care 
      of and pampered at the PG Family Home is a huge relief for me and gives 
      me a little extra peace of mind so I can concentrate on what I came here 
      to do.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I&#8217;m so thrilled with everything the PG Family Home has to offer to 
      athletes and their families,&#8221; said Kaillie&#8217;s mom, Cheryl Simundson. &#8220;I 
      feel so spoiled! I was able to get my hair styled with Pantene and I&#8217;m 
      excited to show off my Canadian COVERGIRL &#8216;fanicure&#8217; when I&#8217;m cheering 
      for Kaillie.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Serving moms and families is just what PG brands do,&#8221; continued 
      Duncan. &#8220;That&#8217;s why the PG Family Home is our single activation at the 
      Games. On the eve of Opening Ceremony, we&#8217;re honoured to serve all moms 
      and families of Olympians in Sochi tonight and throughout the Games.&#8221;

			Shegerian  Associates Founder Describes JPMorgan Sex Discrimination 
      Settlement as a &#8220;Warning to All US Employers&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Carney R. Shegerian, founder of Shegerian 
       Associates, a Santa Monica-based law firm specializing in 
      employee rights, has issued a statement aimed at all American employees 
      and employers in light of JPMorgan Chase  Co. agreeing to pay $1.45 
      million to settle charges by the US Equal Employment Opportunity 
      Commission over sexual 
      harassment claims by some of its female mortgage bankers in one of 
      the firm&#8217;s Ohio offices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shegerian stated that the case serves as a good reminder to employers 
      and employees alike that sexual harassment and discrimination is 
      unlawful in any state.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the claim, female mortgage bankers alleged that the ongoing and 
      repeated scenarios included sexually charged behavior and comments from 
      supervisors in the Ohio office. Also, according to the EEOC, women 
      bankers who did not embrace and participate in the behavior were 
      ostracized and, among other things, deprived of lucrative sales calls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s may seem hard to believe in this day and age, but sexual 
      harassment and discrimination in the workplace is still a common problem 
      nationwide,&#8221; said Shegerian. &#8220;Any discrimination of a person in his or 
      her place of work due to gender, race, sexual orientation, age, or 
      disability is, of course, illegal. When employers turn a blind eye to 
      discrimination laws, we are here to protect the employee&#8217;s rights. We 
      applaud the EEOC&#8217;s investigation of this matter. Hopefully this news 
      will put employers in the US on notice that they may never tolerate 
      harassment or discrimination against their employees for any reason.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An experienced trial attorney and Trial Lawyer of the Year Award winner 
      for 2013, Shegerian has tried many jury trials to verdict in both state 
      and federal court, representing individuals that have suffered financial 
      or emotional losses and have been wronged by employers, including major 
      corporations. Shegerian has built a remarkable career on helping those 
      who have been wronged in the workplace. His remarkable success 
      rate is highlighted by over 67 jury trial wins, including 27 seven 
      figure verdicts representing employees.

      Research and Markets: Global Data Center Integrated Infrastructure 
      Systems Market to 2018 with Dell, Hitachi, HP, IBM, Oracle  VCE 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/n68ghw/global_data) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Data Center Integrated Infrastructure Systems Market to 2018 with Dell, 
      Hitachi, HP, IBM, Oracle  VCE Dominating" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among the numerous growth drivers for the Global Data Center Integrated 
      Infrastructure Systems market, increased deployment of data centers is 
      the major growth driver. Enterprises are increasingly deploying data 
      centers to reduce the cost of infrastructure, technology, and human 
      resources. Moreover, data centers are helpful in disaster recovery and 
      they improve the network infrastructure security. Hence, enterprises are 
      consolidating their applications and services into a single point of 
      operation by centralizing their IT systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An SDN is a network architecture wherein the software interacts directly 
      and dynamically with the network infrastructure. The software includes 
      applications, content, services, etc. that are stored or executed in 
      data centers. An SDN is unique because applications and services do not 
      normally interact directly with the network infrastructure and they are 
      not visible to the network. Enterprises can partition their networks for 
      private use through the adoption of SDN technologies. This can help 
      organizations such as banks share confidential data more securely among 
      themselves. Moreover, security firewalls can be added as application 
      software in the network, making the network economical and manageable. 
      Through SDN deployment, IT can become agile by organizing the network 
      services and monitoring the network through high-level policies instead 
      of low-level network device configurations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges is that the 
      investment required for data center integrated infrastructure systems is 
      huge, and thus it takes time for enterprises to generate a substantial 
      return on investment. Implementing a complete data center integrated 
      infrastructure system solution usually takes a considerable amount of 
      time. This increases the criticality of the process because, once the 
      deployment has started, it becomes very costly to make any changes. It 
      also requires expensive additional infrastructure, complex programming, 
      and extra time and money to ensure data integration and quality.

      Amend: Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4432 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (This amends a press release published earlier today,. Corrected text is 
      attached below)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4432 'AA+/F1', Stable Outlook; DRIVERs, Series 4432A-C 
      'AA+', Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA+', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4432 
      PUTTERs and series 4432A-C DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch 
      has assigned to the state of Washington various purpose general 
      obligation bonds, series 2014D (rated 'AA+', Stable Outlook) that have 
      been deposited in the series 4432 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4432 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      'A+/F1', Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on March 15, 2015, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Feb 6 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, the
world's largest drugmaker, has beaten back generic competition
for the pain medicine Lyrica, its biggest product, with a U.S.
appeals court ruling that competing generic products would
infringe on the company's patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
handles all patent appeals, ruled on Thursday that Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc, Lupin Ltd, Actavis
Inc and other generic competitors had infringed on
Pfizer's patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision upholds a ruling by the U.S. District Court for
the District of Delaware that said that the generic versions may
not be sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyrica, which is approved to treat neuropathic pain caused
by diabetes, shingles and other conditions, is Pfizer's biggest
product, with global sales in 2013 of $4.6 billion. It had U.S.
sales in 2013 of $1.96 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 0.5 percent at $30.81 in midday
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Procter  Gamble (NYSE:PG), a Worldwide Olympic Partner, officially 
      welcomed U.S. moms and families of Olympians to the PG Family Home to 
      kick off the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games. In the PG Family Home, 
      brands including Pantene&#174;, Gillette&#174;, Bounty&#174;, Puffs&#174;, Tide&#174;, Pampers 
      &#174;, COVERGIRL&#174; and Olay&#174; will serve families of Olympians from all 
      over the world, every day of the Games.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The PG Family Home is the heart of the company&#8217;s Thank You, Mom 
      program for Sochi 2014, in which PG brands honor the role moms play in 
      helping their kids achieve their dreams. Tide athlete, Nick 
      Goepper (USA), and Pampers athlete, Oksana Domnina (Russia), 
      attended the opening of the Family Home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Looking at our family of athletes, we are awed and humbled by their 
      talent and perseverance. We also know that no athlete gets to The 
      Olympic Winter Games alone,&#8221; said Jodi Allen, PG VP of North American 
      Marketing and Brand Operations. &#8220;So when a PG brand sponsors an 
      athlete, we celebrate the mom and family who helped them get here. 
      That&#8217;s why the PG Family Home is our single activation at the Games. 
      We&#8217;re honored to serve all Team USA moms and families of Olympians in 
      Sochi throughout the Games.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG brands are providing moms and families of Olympians in Sochi with 
      more than 1,200 hours of everyday services that make an extraordinary 
      difference when families are far from home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For instance, PG&#8217;s beauty brands are offering the opportunity for 
      pampering in the PG Salon through:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Hair washing and styling services at the Pantene Studio, 
        including patriotic braiding with colored ribbon to cheer on team USA
      
			
        Treating moms to makeovers and polished manicure services at the 
        COVERGIRL Studio
      
			
        Providing skin care recommendations for moisturizing body and hands at 
        the Olay Studio
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG male grooming brands are serving men in the Salon with the following 
      treatments:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Hot towel shaves and face massages at the Gillette Studio
      
			
        Relaxing hair washes and styling services at the Head  Shoulders&#174; Studio
      
			
        Male grooming treatments, including the Perfect Trim by Braun&#174;
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional PG brands supporting moms and families of Olympians in Sochi 
      include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Bounty, Charmin&#174; and Puffs&#174; are providing homecare 
        products within the Family Home
      
			
				Pampers is offering a changing station to help families with 
        small children
      
			
				Duracell&#174; Powermats are enabling guests to charge their mobile 
        devices while relaxing and watching the Games
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Team USA athlete, Nick Goepper, was among the first to experience the 
      services provided at the PG Family Home. &#8220;I&#8217;m proud to be part of the 
      PG family of athletes. Not just because my mom and I use PG brands 
      such as Tide, but also because of how they have supported my mom 
      and me throughout my journey to the Olympic Games. Knowing my mom will 
      be taken care of here at the PG Family Home gives me a little extra 
      peace of mind so I can concentrate on what I came here to do.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to providing hours of everyday services, the PG Family Home 
      will host a variety of events featuring appearances by PG&#8217;s U.S. family 
      of athletes throughout the duration of the Olympic Winter Games.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;During the Vancouver Games, the PG Family Home was an oasis away from 
      home and a place for families of Olympians to come together. I&#8217;m really 
      looking forward to experiencing the home again during our stay in 
      Sochi,&#8221; said U.S. Olympian J.R. Celski&#8217;s mom Sue Celski. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say 
      enough how much I appreciate what Braun and the other PG brands 
      are doing for the families.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moms and families of U.S. Olympians will also be invited to attend a 
      viewing party of the Opening Ceremony in the Family Home, where they 
      will be able to cheer team USA and experience the services offered in 
      the Family Home throughout their stay in Sochi.

after a better-than-expected report on weekly initial jobless
claims boosted confidence in the economy and Disney rose after
its quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment
benefits fell more than expected last week, in a boost to the
labor market outlook and the broader economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co shares climbed 5.4 percent to $75.61
to lead both the Dow and S 500 higher after the media
company's quarterly profit topped Wall Street expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney is up strong on good earnings. You've got a number
of names bouncing back here," said Tim Ghriskey, chief
investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to wind down its
stimulus, investors have turned their focus to fundamentals such
as corporate earnings and economic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many participants have reservations whether the
recent soft data truly reflects the economy or is the result of
a harsh winter. Friday's payrolls report may not provide a
clearer indication of the economy's health after last month's
disappointing number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All eyes are on tomorrow's employment report number,
although whatever it is, it's going to be quickly dismissed
because of weather. People will say it's either overstated or
understated," said Ghriskey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter Inc shares tumbled 19.6 percent to $53.01 
after the social media reported slow user growth, dimming hopes
the company could sustain its torrid expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc surged 27.1
percent to $102.80 as the top boost to the Nasdaq 100 
index. Coca-Cola Co bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25
billion and said it would help launch Green Mountain's new cold
drink machine. Coke shares gained 1.3 percent to $38.11 while
home beverage device maker SodaStream International 
rose 5.7 percent to $37.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 162.59 points

 added 50.147 points or 1.25 percent, to 4,061.699.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other economic data showed the U.S. trade deficit widened
more than expected in December as exports fell, which could see
the advance fourth-quarter growth estimate trimmed. Nonfarm
productivity rose more than expected in the fourth quarter, but
weak unit labor costs pointed to subdued wage inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 330 companies in
the S 500 that have reported earnings through Thursday
morning, 68.8 percent have topped Wall Street expectations,
above the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 67 percent
rate for the past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq also received a boost from Akamai Technologies
, which soared 18.3 percent to $56.09 after forecasting
better-than-expected results for the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Motors shed 0.3 percent to $34.98. The
automaker posted weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on
Thursday as results in North America, Asia and South America
disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunkin' Brands Group Inc reported a 23 percent rise
in quarterly profit, driven by higher sales at its Dunkin'
Donuts coffee and sandwich outlets. The company also boosted its
quarterly dividend and announced a new $125 million share
buyback plan. Its shares advanced 5.1 percent to $49.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Long-term 'A+'; Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4433 
      PUTTERs and series 4433A-D DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch 
      has assigned to the New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority Revenue 
      Bonds, Higher Education Equipment Leasing Fund Program Issue, Series 
      2014 (rated 'A+'; Stable Outlook by Fitch) that have been deposited in 
      the series 4433 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4433 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      'A+/F1'; Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on March 15, 2015, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.

		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

		&lt;h1&gt;Plandai Biotechnology Learning Branding and Marketing From Former Microsoft Executive Turned Marijuana Entrepreneur&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Feb 6, 2014) -  Planda&#237; Biotechnology (OTCQB: PLPL) is in good hands when it comes to the future of branding and marketing its Phytofare&#8482; cannabis extracts for use in both medical and pharmaceutical marijuana applications.&#160;While Planda&#237; continues to develop a full range of botanical extracts using its proprietary hydrodynamic sheering process, the company can follow the lead of its new branding partner, Diego Pellicer, Inc. and its co-founder Jamen Shively, to perfect a process as important as developing the extracts themselves -- marketing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news for Planda&#237; executives is they have a head start on the competition as businesses within the marijuana industry wait for regulations and nationwide legalization to play itself out in order to remove any legality concerns faced in using the drug for medicinal purposes.&#160;But, with the Cannabis debate still unfolding, former Microsoft executive turned marijuana entrepreneur, Jamen Shively, says there are advantages to building the brand now while others are idly waiting for the issue to be resolved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an avid student and practitioner of the principles of marketing and branding, I can state with authority that 'first to mind' in getting our powerful brands out into the marketplace early on, are proving decisive in capturing long-term market share."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shively has stated that he hopes to build the first retail brand of marijuana in the U.S., and eventually capture 40 percent of the market worldwide.&#160;It will be in those retail markets that Planda&#237; hopes to sell its cannabis extracts under the Diego Pellicer brand.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how big the chain of stores can get in this country, Shively said, "It's difficult to predict, especially considering that the industry will evolve, eventually away from cannabis-only retail stores to packaged cannabis products sold in a variety of retailers, much as the alcohol industry evolved during the 1930s and 40s." He added, "Having said that, the next five years, at least, will see several hundred marijuana specialty retail stores opening throughout the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of helping steer Microsoft product releases, Planda&#237; picked a partner to learn from in Jamen Shively, who truly understands the importance of branding and knowing his audience, and in the end, it is Planda&#237; investors who should benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Stock Market Media Group

		&lt;h1&gt;Great East Energy Producing Gas Alongside Energy Giants Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron in Ukraine&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Feb 6, 2014) -  Great East Energy, Inc.'s (OTCQB: GASE) latest Reserve Report only proves what the company already knew. This report estimates that Great East Energy is sitting on a significant amount natural gas. The report estimates there are gross total reserves of 47 billion cubic feet of natural gas in the company's licensed area in the Ukraine. This newly released opinion by petroleum geologist Barry Whelan, falls right in line with a report done by Marathon Oil back in 2007, so the company's investment in 160 square miles of producing clean energy land is looking pretty competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These holdings have Great East Energy in good company alongside industry giants Shell, Chevron, and Exxon Mobil who also own significant holdings in the country. Shell has almost 3000 square miles of licensed land immediately to the west of Great East Energy's property. Chevron owns significant assets in west Ukraine, and Exxon Mobil is also at work with property to the southwest of the company's projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great East Energy is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused on bringing North American capital, industry knowledge and technology to Ukraine and other parts of central and Eastern Europe. The company's focus currently is on that producing land in Ukraine, and for good reason. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that report, the 47 billion cubic feet of Reserves are comprised of 25 billion cubic feet of Proved Reserves, and 22 billion cubic feet of Probable Reserves. For investors, the significance of all of that natural gas is that it's sold at prices three times higher ($12-15) than here in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the exploration and production work being done in the region by each of these energy companies has the attention of the Ukrainian government as the country seeks energy independence from Russia. Oil and gas production is such a priority in Ukraine, that Royal Dutch Shell's expansive Yuzivske gas field which surrounds Great East Energy's property, was the featured asset in a $10 billion contract signed by Ukraine at Davos, Switzerland, in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an article in the Christian Science Monitor, Ukraine and its Eastern European neighbors may host some of the more promising shale basins in the region, and with the European Union now outlining recommendations for shale exploration, the region looks ripe for a breakthrough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preliminary resources estimate of the Yuzivske gas field is up to 300 trillion cubic feet, so given the prices companies are fetching for gas in the region it's clear to see why the industry's big boys are gobbling up assets. And, right in the thick of those energy giants is the smaller Great East Energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Stock Market Media Group

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) began rolling out its Watson supercomputer system across Africa on Thursday, saying it would help to address continental development obstacles as diverse as medical diagnoses, economic data collection and e-commerce research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest technology service provider said "Project Lucy" would take 10 years and cost $100 million. The undertaking was named after the earliest known human ancestor fossil, which was found in east Africa,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe it will spur a whole era of innovation for entrepreneurs here," IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty told delegates at a conference on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Data ... needs to be refined. It will determine undisputed winners and losers across every industry," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, Rometty cited how Morocco had used sophisticated data mining for "smart agriculture" to improve how crops are grown by predicting weather, demand and disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Watson system uses artificial intelligence that can quickly analyze huge amounts of data and understand human language well enough to hold sophisticated conversations. It beat humans on the TV quiz show "Jeopardy" in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp has so far failed to convert that genius into substantial revenue growth, with the system contributing just $100 million over the past three years as overall revenues declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said last month it would invest $1 billion in creating a business unit for Watson, named after former IBM President Thomas Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology would enable poorer parts of Africa to "leapfrog" stages of development they have failed to reach because they were too expensive, in much the same way mobile phones took off across the continent in places where there had been virtually no landlines, said Michel B&#233;zy, a Rwanda-based technology professor who helped develop the Watson system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could help with education in schools that have few computer resources by using smartphone apps that get access to Watson's analytical tools through cloud computing, IBM's chief Africa research scientist Uyi Stewart told Reuters in Lagos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a continent with a tremendous infrastructural deficit, but leveraging data can help you get around it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roads in countries like Nigeria are often so poorly maintained, traffic-clogged or flooded that it is impossible to predict how long a journey will take, which is problematic for logistics companies. Stewart said the system would help such companies by telling them where potholes are, which junctions are choke points and whether it is raining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Nigerian start ups, a logistics and a traffic control company, have already adopted the Watson system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tim Cocks; Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Last month IBM pledged $1 bln for global Watson business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Supercomputer can talk to humans and analyze massive data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tim Cocks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - IBM began rolling out its
Watson supercomputer system across Africa on Thursday, saying it
would help to address continental development obstacles as
diverse as medical diagnoses, economic data collection and
e-commerce research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest technology service provider said
"Project Lucy" would take 10 years and cost $100 million. The
undertaking was named after the earliest known human ancestor
fossil, which was found in east Africa,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe it will spur a whole era of innovation for
entrepreneurs here," IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty told
delegates at a conference on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Data ... needs to be refined. It will determine undisputed
winners and losers across every industry," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, Rometty cited how Morocco had used
sophisticated data mining for "smart agriculture" to improve how
crops are grown by predicting weather, demand and disease
outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Watson system uses artificial intelligence that can
quickly analyze huge amounts of data and understand human
language well enough to hold sophisticated conversations. It 
beat humans on the TV quiz show "Jeopardy" in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp has so far failed to
convert that genius into substantial revenue growth, with the
system contributing just $100 million over the past three years
as overall revenues declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said last month it would invest $1 billion in
creating a business unit for Watson, named after former IBM
President Thomas Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology would enable poorer parts of Africa to
"leapfrog" stages of development they have failed to reach
because they were too expensive, in much the same way mobile
phones took off across the continent in places where there had
been virtually no landlines, said Michel B&#233;zy, a Rwanda-based
technology professor who helped develop the Watson system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could help with education in schools that have few
computer resources by using smartphone apps that get access to
Watson's analytical tools through cloud computing, IBM's chief
Africa research scientist Uyi Stewart told Reuters in Lagos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a continent with a tremendous infrastructural
deficit, but leveraging data can help you get around it," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roads in countries like Nigeria are often so poorly
maintained, traffic-clogged or flooded that it is impossible to
predict how long a journey will take, which is problematic for
logistics companies. Stewart said the system would help such
companies by telling them where potholes are, which junctions
are choke points and whether it is raining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Nigerian start ups, a logistics and a traffic control
company, have already adopted the Watson system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Jack Shafer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 7 (Reuters) - About 20 years ago, Nathan Myhrvold, then
Microsoft's chief technology officer, composed a 20,000-word
piece of prophesy titled "Road Kill on the Information Highway"
that reads as fresh today as it did then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of many memos the polymath was churning out for
Microsoft bossman Bill Gates at the time, "Road Kill" deserves
our renewed attention for at least three reasons: 1) many of the
market, media and tech dislocations Myhrvold predicted have come
true, so he's owed credit for his sharpness; 2) the tech forces
Myhrvold identified have continued their romp, making some of
his come-true predictions even truer as time has passed; and 3)
though Microsoft embraced much of his futurology at the time, it
still missed the market in many places where companies like
Google, Apple and Amazon hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rereading the memo, you feel a pang of sympathy for outgoing
Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer, who has been
criticized for not overtaking Google, for not inventing the
iPhone, not creating Facebook, and other transgressions. You
also feel 10 tons of trepidation for incoming CEO Satya Nadella,
who faces the same tech market realities that blunted Ballmer.
Myhrvold's memo, dated Sept. 8, 1993, repeatedly warns that
computer speed and computer storage were to grow exponentially
for decades, making the computers of the near future a million
times fast and then a trillion times faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every tech know-it-all was harping on the mayhem Moore's law
would unleash, but Myhrvold's essay made the coming revolution
palpable. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is extraordinarily difficult for people to really grasp
the power of exponential growth. No experience in our everyday
life prepares us for it. The numbers become so astronomically
large so quickly...that it is easy to either dismiss them
outright, or mentally glaze over and become numb to their
meaning. It is incredibly easy to fool oneself into thinking
that you do understand it, but usually this just means that
you've mentally done a linear extrapolation from the recent
past. This works for a little while, but then rapidly becomes
out of date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exponential growth had allowed minicomputers to edge by
makers of mainframes who didn't make the "exponential
extrapolation" and act on it fast enough. Exponential growth
similarly allowed microcomputers - personal computers - to blow
by minis, enriching Microsoft, which soon become the dominant
maker of PC software. "The growth curve of Microsoft is
unprecidented in the annals of business, and seems quite
miraculous until you realize that what we have done is ride the
exponential growth curve of computer price/performance,"
Myhrvold wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Myhrvold memo recites a Microsoft catechism that the
hardware business must be avoided because its profit margins
were too thin and the speed at which technology moved put
hardware makers at perpetual risk of becoming obsolete. Better
to concentrate on software and its higher margins, which
Microsoft largely did until 18 months ago when the company
produced its Surface computers, and then last fall when it
purchased the Nokia handset business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in his own way, Myhrvold, who left the company in 1999
for other business and personal enthusiasms, anticipated the day
that Microsoft might have to become Microhard, too. "The only
hardware companies that have ever made significant money are
those that managed to create an asset - the hardware
architecture - which was above the fray of individual
implementations and thus could enjoy a longer life span," he
wrote, presaging the success of Apple's iPod, iPhone, and iPad
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bulk of the worlds' computing cycles come near
the low end, high volume part of the market," he continued,
paving with words the road Apple would later take with its
handheld computers. "Any software company that wants to maintain
its relative share of total CPU cycles must have products that
are relevant to the high volume segment of the market. If you
don't, then you are vulnerable to a software company that does
establishes a position there and then rides the technology
curve up to the mainstream. This is what the PC industry did to
mainframes and minicomputers, and if we in the PC industry are
not careful this fate will befall us as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Myhrvold were writing this memo today, he'd acknowledge
that smartphones are close to seizing the bulk of the world's
computing cycles, and the smartphone is doing to the PC what it
did to the mini and what the mini did to the mainframe. He'd add
that Apple (and Google, with its Android operating system) and
not Microsoft were riding the technology curve in the smartphone
mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not that Microsoft never competed in the itsy-bitsy
computer space. It obeyed Myhrvold's dictim that "Anything which
isn't exponential in growth, or which is exponential but with a
slower growth rate, will quickly and inexorably be overwhelmed."
It built operating systems for PDAs and cell phones, produced
software for the SPOT smartwatch, manufactured Zune music
players, and went large to produce the Xbox for gamers.
(Anticipating the PDA, the smartphone, and an "always connected"
 device, Myhrvold pitched his company a tiny "digital wallet" in
1991.) But Microsoft mostly missed the waves or fell off them,
and those failures help explain why Apple and Google have higher
market caps than Microsoft. Today, we're probably just a couple
of product cycles away from your smartphone (connected to a
full-sized keyboard and monitor) being a solid substitute for
your laptop and desktop computers. Unless Microsoft or its
hardware allies produce a comparable product, the company could
lose its already slipping primacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Myhrvold never mentions the Internet by name, he
correctly predicted that an "information highway" selling goods
and services would wreck the Blockbuster video chain business as
movie rentals go online, with similar transitions in banking,
newspaper classifieds ("Newspapers are in probably the worst
situation of any form of print media"), retail shopping,
Siri-like speech recognition software, crime-fighting (he makes
an early call for ubiquitous video surveillance), media
time-shifting, outsourcing, the retail stock market, and the
rise of realistic video games - "you won't be able to tell the
difference between the game and a movie." Granted, he didn't
predict cloud computing in his memo (although you could say that
he implies it), sense the eventual rise of social media, or
anticipate the "piracy" of music and movies. He also missed the
mass migration of advertising to Google, which ordinarily
collects about 90 percent of its revenues from ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also knock Myhrvold for wrongly predicting the
collapse of conventional broadcast and cable TV, although
charitable readers will say his burial of the industry was just
a tad premature. In one laugh-out-loud passage, he states with
supreme confidence that the Microsoft At Work campaign would
"unify PCs with the telephone, FAX and copier." Yeah, right. My
phone, fax and copier still don't get along. Maybe the new
Microsoft CEO will pay for group counseling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Myhrvold's hits dwarf his misses. Other Myhrvold
memos, analyzed by Ken Auletta in a May 12, 1997, New Yorker
profile, reiterated the death-of-the-middleman themes etched in
"Road Kill." He correctly predicted the demise of Egghead
Software and Tower Records in the face of online competition,
but in an uncharacteristic miscue, he pooh-poohed the Internet
"hype."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myhrvold cheerfully conceded his fallibility to Auletta:
"When you predict the technological future, as I do, you
basically are like an insurance salesman, futures trader or
gambler."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a historic document, "Road Kill on the Information
Highway" deserves your attention. But its underlying message
about exponential effects of modern technology remains so
timeless that new CEO Nadella should keep a copy on his
smartphone for inspiration, highlighting this memento mori
codicil: "Our own industry is also doomed, and will be one of
the more significant carcasses by the side of the information
highway."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 2 Distressed Classes of JPMCC 2005-LDP1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded two distressed classes and affirmed 18 
      classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. series 
      2005-LDP1 (JPMCC 2005-LDP1) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 7.7% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 6.2%, including $59 million (2.1% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 
      41 loans (25.8%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 10 specially 
      serviced assets (5.6%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the January 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 45.9% to $1.56 billion from $2.88 billion at 
      issuance. Per the servicer reporting, 19 loans (18.9% of the pool) are 
      defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes H through 
      NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced 
      Independence Plaza loan (1.2% of the pool), which is secured by a 
      252,000 square foot (sf) retail shopping center located in Hamilton 
      Township, NJ. The loan was transferred to special servicing in March 
      2010. Subsequently, the property lost its grocery anchor to bankruptcy 
      in 2011; and another large tenant, T.J. Maxx, vacated its space at 
      maturity in January 2013. As of the Oct. 31, 2013 rent roll, the 
      property was only 25% occupied. Additionally, an environmental study is 
      under review. A settlement agreement that provides for a consensual 
      foreclosure action was executed in July 2013; foreclosure is expected to 
      be completed by mid-2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the Preston Center 
      Pavilion  Square loan (2.6%), which is secured by a 233,000 sf retail 
      center located in Dallas, TX. In 2013, occupancy dropped to 73% from 95% 
      as the largest tenant downsized its space by approximately 19,000 sf as 
      part of a 10-year renewal and the third largest tenant vacated its space 
      at lease expiration in January 2013. While no recent leasing activity 
      has been reported as the property, the loan was recently assumed by 
      experienced sponsorship. Further, less than 5% of the NRA rolls through 
      2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes A-1A through C remain Stable due to 
      increasing credit enhancement and continued paydown. Rating Outlooks on 
      classes D through F are Negative due to the potential for further 
      negative credit migration of the underlying collateral including 
      continued transfers to special servicing or performance declines of 
      current loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Distressed classes (those rated below 'B') may be subject to further 
      downgrades as additional losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following classes and assigns or revises Recovery 
      Estimates (REs) as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Blythe Masters, who heads JPMorgan's (JPM.N) commodities business, has left a group advising the U.S. derivatives regulator only a day after she joined it, the agency said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment on the about-face by Masters, one of the most prominent women on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workload associated with JPMorgan's sale of its physical commodities division in the first half of this year would make it tough for Masters to participate in the group, a person familiar with the matter said. The bank has offered to make another executive available, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday voted on the new composition of its Global Markets Advisory Committee, a group of market participants that meets regularly to discuss a broad range of issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee consists of a large group of senior officials at large investment banks, asset managers, firms running trading platforms and industry bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masters was a striking choice for the normally low-profile advisory group, having beaten rivals by building up the biggest physical commodities trading operation on Wall Street at JPMorgan over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has been plagued by a long series of legal issues, paying $410 million to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) last year to settle allegations of power market manipulation in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masters, a key lieutenant to JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, was not cited for any wrongdoing, though her name is referenced in the regulator's order a number of times. The bank neither admitted nor denied any violations in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan decided to sell its multi-billion dollar physical commodities division last year as regulators and politicians clamped down on banks active in the markets after complaints of inflated prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading house Mercuria is the front-runner to buy JPMorgan's physical commodities unit, Reuters reported this week, though a final deal could still take a few months to conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to pay $20 billion in settlements to regulators last year in its drive to clear up legal claims, which included mortgage and derivative issues alongside the settlement with the FERC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Douwe Miedema; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

      Computer Guidance Corporation, the leading developer of financial and 
      project management software solutions for architecture, engineering and 
      construction companies, today announced that Alberici Corporation has 
      implemented an enterprise capture strategy using eCMS construction 
      enterprise resource planning and IBM&#8217;s Datacap to better handle 
      enterprise capture of big data, the massive volume of invoices and other 
      documents the organization receives daily.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IBM Datacap is the perfect complement to Computer Guidance&#8217;s Enterprise 
      Content Management applications for the capture of large volume 
      documents,&#8221; stated Greg Hesser, President and Chief Financial Officer, 
      Alberici Group. &#8220;With the ability to capture data from both hand-written 
      and printed sources, we are better able to handle the invoices and other 
      documents we receive on a daily basis, and automate the entry of this 
      information into eCMS without the need to manually key data.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM Datacap enables the extraction of unstructured and physical data 
      from captured documents enabling automated categorization, indexing and 
      data entry. With the integration to Computer Guidance&#8217;s eCMS Enterprise 
      Content Management applications, the solution automatically assigns 
      category and sub-category based on document contents, updates user 
      indexes and coding tables with recognized values, and automates data 
      entry from invoices and other business documents helping to reduce cost 
      and accelerate accounts payable processes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The integration with IBM Datacap creates new opportunities for our 
      customers to eliminate manual processes and increase efficiency in their 
      back office procedures,&#8221; stated Steven Gross, Director of Client

&lt;p&gt;PRISTINA (Reuters) - Italy's embassy in Kosovo faced a growing scandal on Friday over sales of Schengen visas for thousands of euros, with prosecutors and defense lawyers saying at least two embassy employees were implicated in a scam allegedly led by the son of Kosovo's late independence leader, Ibrahim Rugova.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uke Rugova, a member of parliament from the ruling coalition, was among 10 people arrested by European Union police on Wednesday on suspicion of organized crime in the sale of much-coveted visas to Europe's borderless Schengen zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three suspects were remanded in custody late on Thursday for 30 days. Six others were placed under house arrest and another was freed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the defendants said those arrested included a local staff member of the Italian embassy in the capital, Pristina. Another staffer was implicated in prosecution documents seen by Reuters, but defense lawyers said he had diplomatic immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only one embassy worker is here, the other suspect has diplomatic immunity and is not here among the other suspects," defense lawyer Tome Gashi told reporters during the court session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Italian embassy said it was cooperating on the case with the EU police and justice mission in Kosovo, known as EULEX. EULEX was set up in 2008 to handle cases of war crimes, organized crime and high-level corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to be in close contact with the EULEX mission in full transparent collaboration," Italian ambassador Andreas Ferrarese told Reuters on Friday. He declined to comment on the details of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the prosecution, police found hundreds of passport photocopies, visa applications, copies of IDs, photos and other documents at Uke Rugova's home, formerly the residence of his father, who led the Kosovo Albanian struggle to break away from Serbia through the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The group was producing fake documents to support the applications for Schengen visas to apply at the Italian embassy for their clients," prosecutors alleged. "They were using their influence inside the Italian embassy to make sure that fraudulent applications were approved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weapons were also found at Rugova's home, and police confiscated a letter from January this year addressed to an official at the embassy asking to accept 300 visa applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In writing this letter, Uke Rugova shows he considers himself above the law," the prosecution said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the group's "clients" were charged 2,700 to 3,500 euros for a visa that should otherwise have cost 60 euros. Rugova's lawyer said his client was innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirements to obtain a Schengen visa are often beyond the means of many in Kosovo, an impoverished, landlocked country of 1.7 million people that declared independence from Serbia in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some, a Schengen visa is a foot in the door to a longer-term stay in western Europe and the chance to work and send money home. More than 30,000 young people enter the job market in Kosovo every year, but few find work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Matt Robinson/Larry King)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO Feb 10 (Reuters) - New York-based investment bank
Greenhill &amp; Co Inc has hired former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc dealmaker Rodrigo Mello as it expands its mergers and
acquisitions operation in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mello will join Greenhill's S&#227;o Paulo-based office as a
managing director, the company said in a statement late on
Monday. The Brazil-born banker worked for 13 years at Goldman,
where he was responsible for the investment banking coverage of
clients in the financial, consumer and retail industries, and
worked in a series of M transactions in those sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very excited about our prospects in Brazil and are
pleased to be able to quickly strengthen the team with a key
hire at a time when we see the potential for significantly
increased M activity in Brazil," Scott L. Bok, chief executive
officer of Greenhill, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, Mello will report to Daniel Wainstein,
Greenhill's country head, with whom he worked for almost fifteen
years at Goldman. Mello began his career at Goldman Sachs in
1999 and left in 2005 to work at Cristalina, the investment
holding company that controls Hypermarcas SA, the
largest Brazilian producer of generic drugs and personal care
products, the statement said. He returned to Goldman in 2007 and
left again in November last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wainstein, who left Goldman last year, is building a team to
advise global and local clients on mergers and acquisitions in
Latin America's largest economy. In 2013, companies announced
$74.43 billion worth of deals in Brazil, up about 5.7 percent
from $70.40 billion a year earlier, according to a quarterly
Thomson Reuters report on M activity released on Jan. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, when measured in terms of the number of deals, 2013
was not that favorable for M bankers. About 611 deals were
announced last year, down from 823 in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rodrigo is widely recognized as one of the most important
senior bankers in Brazil ... and we look forward to leveraging
his success and breadth of experience as we focus on building a
leading M franchise for Greenhill in Brazil," Wainstein said
in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several top bankers have left Goldman's Brazilian unit in
the wake of waning advisory activity and what some bankers see
as steps by the banking firm recently to cut exposure to the
country. Some of these bankers are Wainstein, Fabio Bicudo, the
unit's co-chief of investment banking until last month, and
wealth management executive Adriano Koelle, a source told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The non-profit group Better Markets filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department on Monday to block what it called an "unlawful" $13 billion settlement with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co over bad mortgage loans sold to investors before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record settlement, which was reached in November, does not release JPMorgan from potential criminal liability over the mortgages it packaged into bonds. But Better Markets said it was still appalled that the settlement gave the bank "blanket civil immunity" for its conduct without sufficient judicial review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Wall Street bailouts were bad enough, but now taxpayers are being forced to accept a secretive backroom deal that may well have been another sweetheart deal," said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Justice Department cannot act as prosecutor, jury and judge and extract $13 billion in exchange for blanket civil immunity to the largest, richest, most politically connected bank on Wall Street," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better Markets was founded in 2010 to advocate for tough Wall Street reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, which names the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder, was filed in federal court in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better Markets is seeking to have the court prevent the Justice Department from enforcing the settlement until a judge reviews it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Department spokeswoman Ellen Canale said the agency was confident the settlement complied with the law. JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli declined to comment on the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and others have criticized the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama for failing to hold Wall Street banks, executives, and other parties accountable for the excesses that resulted in the housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department in November negotiated a wide-ranging deal with the largest U.S. bank that included a $2 billion civil penalty to resolve Justice Department claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also included a $4 billion consumer relief package, and a separately negotiated $4 billion settlement with the regulator of mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another $1.4 billion of the $13 billion package resolved a lawsuit from the National Credit Union Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement was released to the public, but not filed in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Justice Department enters into non-prosecution agreements on the criminal side without filing them in court, it rarely enters into similar out-of-court settlements over civil violations. The agency also did not release a complaint that it had prepared to file against JPMorgan before it negotiated the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, Better Markets claimed the settlement with the bank lacked critical facts that could help justify the deal, such as failing to name any individuals responsible for the wrongdoing, how much damage investors had suffered or even "which specific laws were violated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one has any ability to determine if the $13 billion agreement is fair, adequate, reasonable, and in the public interest or if this is a sweetheart deal entered into behind closed doors," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelleher, a former attorney at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, has become well-known for his critique of both Wall Street banks and regulators who he has often accused of failing to hold the banks accountable for wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelleher announced the lawsuit during a press conference at the National Press Club on Monday, armed with large posters including one with photos of Holder and JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sarah N.

chief executive of Better Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Justice Department cannot act as prosecutor, jury and
judge and extract $13 billion in exchange for blanket civil
immunity to the largest, richest, most politically connected
bank on Wall Street," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better Markets was founded in 2010 to advocate for tough
Wall Street reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, which names the Justice Department and Attorney
General Eric Holder, was filed in federal court in Washington,
D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better Markets is seeking to have the court prevent the
Justice Department from enforcing the settlement until a judge
reviews it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Department spokeswoman Ellen Canale said the agency
was confident the settlement complied with the law. JPMorgan
spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli declined to comment on the
lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and others have criticized the administration of
U.S. President Barack Obama for failing to hold Wall Street
banks, executives, and other parties accountable for the
excesses that resulted in the housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department in November negotiated a wide-ranging
deal with the largest U.S. bank that included a $2 billion civil
penalty to resolve Justice Department claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also included a $4 billion consumer relief package, and a
separately negotiated $4 billion settlement with the regulator
of mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another $1.4 billion of the $13 billion package resolved a
lawsuit from the National Credit Union Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement was released to the public, but not filed in
federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Justice Department enters into non-prosecution
agreements on the criminal side without filing them in court, it
rarely enters into similar out-of-court settlements over civil
violations. The agency also did not release a complaint that it
had prepared to file against JPMorgan before it negotiated the
deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, Better Markets claimed the settlement with
the bank lacked critical facts that could help justify the deal,
such as failing to name any individuals responsible for the
wrongdoing, how much damage investors had suffered or even
"which specific laws were violated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one has any ability to determine if the $13 billion
agreement is fair, adequate, reasonable, and in the public
interest or if this is a sweetheart deal entered into behind
closed doors," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelleher, a former attorney at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
&amp; Flom, has become well-known for his critique of both Wall
Street banks and regulators who he has often accused of failing
to hold the banks accountable for wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelleher announced the lawsuit during a press conference at
the National Press Club on Monday, armed with large posters
including one with photos of Holder and JPMorgan Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - Feb 10, 2014) - 
				A10 Networks, a technology leader in Application Networking, today announced that The University of Kansas Hospital, a leading academic hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, selected A10's Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) to deploy Microsoft Exchange across its network. KU Hospital's network infrastructure includes two data centers that support approximately 5,500 employees in 50 locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maintain its growing infrastructure and prepare for its new large-scale Microsoft Exchange deployment, The University of Kansas Hospital decided to replace its incumbent vendor's ADCs with A10 to increase performance and scalability with new hardware and software, and to add flexibility with virtualization for multi-tenancy with Application Delivery Partitions (ADPs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We chose A10 Networks for our Microsoft Exchange deployment because of their performance and scalability, but more importantly because their ADCs were more flexible and energy efficient than any competing solution we evaluated. With A10, we are saving 30 percent of our rack space and reducing energy costs in our data center," said Robert Rowland, systems engineer for The University of Kansas Hospital. "We also discovered that in approximately five years, we will save over one million dollars on what a competitor quoted us for equivalent hardware, functionality and performance. That savings alone is equivalent to ten man years saved over the next five years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KU Hospital selected A10's AX 3200-12s, which are mid-range ADCs that include 10 Gb ports, Flexible Traffic Acceleration technology for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation, additional security functionality and high-performance SSL offload. The AX 3200-12s have increased efficiency with system virtualization to create up to 128 ADPs for multi-tenancy, so that the hospital can support more users and applications on existing equipment. A10 is a clear green networking choice, saving the hospital 30 percent of rack space and reducing energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are proud to deliver advanced, flexible and green ADC solutions to leading medical institutions such as The University of Kansas Hospital," said Jason Matlof, vice president of worldwide marketing for A10 Networks. "Our new A10 Thunder and AX Series ADCs help customers ensure reliability, scalability and security of their applications with energy-efficient designs that reduce the power, cooling and space demands in their data centers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Resource&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Kansas Hospital Case Study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About A10 Thunder and AX Series ADCs

With A10, customers benefit from application availability, scalability and performance, and increased infrastructure efficiency for a faster end-user experience. A10 ADC's have comprehensive Layer 4-7 feature sets and support for a broad range of IT delivery models, including physical and virtual appliances with multi-tenancy that can be used across public, private and hybrid cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built on A10's scalable and flexible Advanced Core Operating System (ACOS) architecture, A10's ADCs consolidate a range of functions including server load balancing (SLB), application acceleration, DNS Application Firewall, Web Application Firewall (WAF), SSL Intercept, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection, Application Access Management (AAM), and more, without upgrade license fees.

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to JPMBB 2014-C18

      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of 
      preliminary ratings to 16 classes of the JPMBB 2014-C18 transaction (see 
      ratings listed below). JPMBB 2014-C18 is a $957.6 million CMBS conduit 
      transaction collateralized by 51 fixed-rate commercial mortgage loans 
      that are secured by 83 properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loans have principal balances ranging from $3.3 million to $100.0 
      million for the largest loan in the pool, which is secured by 308,169 sf 
      of the Miami International Mall (10.4%), a 1.1 million sf, one-story, 
      enclosed, regional mall located in Miami, Florida. The five largest 
      loans, which also include Jordan Creek Town Center (10.4%), Marriott

      Of these, 15 (31.9%) are partial term IO loans and four (19.1%) are 
      full-term IO. The balance of the pool is comprised of amortizing balloon 
      loans (32 loans, 49.0%) that require principal payments throughout their 
      respective terms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower 
      rating process that begins with our analysts&#8217; evaluation of underlying 
      collateral properties&#8217; financial and operating performance, which 
      determine KBRA&#8217;s estimate of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA 
      value using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines. On an aggregate 
      basis, KNCF was 4.9% less than the issuer cash flow. KBRA capitalization 
      rates were applied to each asset&#8217;s KNCF to derive values that were, on 
      an aggregate basis, 35.3% less than third party appraisal values. The 
      pool has an in-trust KLTV of 96.8% and an all-in KLTV of 101.5%. The 
      model deploys rent and occupancy stresses, probability of default 
      regressions, and loss given default calculations to determine losses for 
      each loan, which are then used to assign the credit ratings.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - China's top insurance regulator directly asked JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co CEO Jamie Dimon to hire a family friend as a "favor," The New York Times reported, citing a confidential email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest media report comes even as Wall Street's practice of hiring family and friends of China's ruling elite continues to attract the attention of regulators. U.S. authorities have been looking into the hiring practices of several banks and hedge funds, focusing on those related to well-connected foreign officials with the intent of securing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon met the applicant, described by The New York Times as "a young woman," in June 2012. At that meeting in New York, the applicant acted as an interpreter for the Chinese insurance regulator Xiang Junbo, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of that meeting, JPMorgan was seeking lucrative work from Chinese insurance companies, the newspaper said. It said the timing of the applicant's internship at the bank may have had no connection to JPMorgan's business with the Chinese insurance industry, some of which the bank secured before the meeting. The applicant played no role in those deals, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan told The New York Times that Dimon had nothing to do with the decision to hire the young woman, who was described within the bank as well qualified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our CEO played no role in the hiring decision, did not weigh in, and did not follow up," JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti said in a statement to the newspaper.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Feb 10 (Reuters) - The non-profit group Better
Markets filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department on Monday
to block what it called an "unlawful" $13 billion settlement
with JP Morgan over bad mortgage loans sold to investors
before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record settlement with the bank, which was reached in
November, does not release JP Morgan from potential criminal
liability over the mortgages it packaged into bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Better Markets said it was still appalled that the
settlement gave the bank "blanket civil immunity" for its
conduct without sufficient judicial review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Wall Street bailouts were bad enough, but now taxpayers
are being forced to accept a secretive backroom deal that may
well have been another sweetheart deal," said Dennis Kelleher,
the chief executive of Better Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Justice Department cannot act as prosecutor, jury and
judge and extract $13 billion in exchange for blanket civil
immunity to the largest, richest, most politically connected
bank on Wall Street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department in November negotiated a
wide-ranging deal with the largest U.S. bank that included a $2
billion civil penalty to resolve Department of Justice claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also included a $4 billion consumer relief package, and a
separately negotiated $4 billion settlement with the regulator
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another $1.4 billion of the $13 billion package also
resolved a lawsuit from the National Credit Union
Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ settlement was released to the public but not filed
in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency also did not release a complaint that it had
prepared to file against JPMorgan before it negotiated the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      RISKS: Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of 
      principal, International investing involves greater and different risks 
      than investing in U.S. companies and funds investing in a single country 
      or in a limited geographic region generally are more volatile than more 
      diversified funds. Emerging markets tend to be more volatile than the 
      markets of more mature economies, and generally have less diverse and 
      less mature economic structures and less stable political systems than 
      those of developed countries. Special risks associated with 
      international investing include: currency fluctuations, less liquidity, 
      less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive 
      company information, political instability and differing auditing and 
      legal standards. The fund may use derivatives which entail risks 
      relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and 
      increase volatility. An investment in this fund should be considered

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - China's top insurance regulator directly asked JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon to hire a family friend as a "favor", The New York Times reported, citing a confidential email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest media report comes even as Wall Street's practice of hiring family and friends of China's ruling elite continues to attract the attention of regulators. U.S. authorities have been looking into the hiring practices of several banks and hedge funds, focusing on those related to well-connected foreign officials with the intent of securing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon met the applicant, described by The New York Times as "a young woman", in June 2012. At that meeting in New York, the applicant acted as an interpreter for the Chinese insurance regulator Xiang Junbo, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of that meeting, JPMorgan was seeking lucrative work from Chinese insurance companies, the newspaper said. However, it said the timing of the applicant's internship at the bank may have had no connection to JPMorgan's business with the Chinese insurance industry, some of which the bank secured before the meeting. The applicant played no role in those deals, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan told The New York Times that Dimon had nothing to do with the decision to hire the young woman, who was described within the bank as well qualified. "Our CEO played no role in the hiring decision, did not weigh in, and did not follow up," JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti said in a statement to the newspaper. "It is his normal practice to pass on referrals without advice to those involved in hiring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times did not identify the applicant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Dimon nor the applicant are suspected of any wrongdoing, the newspaper said, citing a person briefed on the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has been conducting an internal investigation examining the employment of around 200 people for instances of possible illegal nepotism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Two former top traders at Goldman Sachs and Noble Group are planning to form a hedge fund in Asia, a source with knowledge of the matter said, in another high profile launch in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund's creation comes as global regulatory changes restrict banks from trading with their own money, forcing so-called proprietary desk traders to strike out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also comes as investor interest in hedge funds in Asia makes its strongest comeback since 2007 and on the back of the industry's strong performance in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leland Lim, who was the co-head of macro trading for Asia Pacific ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, is teaming up with Allan Bedwick, the former head of macro trading in Asia for Noble Group, to launch a macro hedge fund in the second or third quarter of 2014, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lim, who joined Goldman in New York in 1997 on the foreign exchange options desk, retired last month from the Wall Street bank, while Bedwick quit the Singaporean commodities firm in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lim moved to Asia in 1999. Prior to becoming the co-head, he managed Asia Pacific ex-Japan foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives trading, according to an internal memo sent to Goldman staff announcing his retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source could not estimate the start-up capital as the plan was at an early stage and the duo has yet to register the firm in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian hedge funds returned an average 16 percent last year, outperforming a less than 10 percent gain by global peers and attracted net inflows of $11 billion in 2013, the highest since 2007, according to data from industry tracker Eurekahedge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of proprietary traders globally have spun off from banks to start their own hedge fund since the financial crisis in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the well-known names in Asia include former Goldman trader Morgan Sze, who started Azentus Capital, and former Credit Suisse trader Charlie Chan who runs Splendid Asia macro fund. Both launched their funds in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lim and Bedwick will compete with Asia-based macro hedge funds such as the $1.8 billion Fortress Asia Macro Fund run by Adam Levinson and the $2.6 billion Dymon Asia Macro Fund managed by former Citadel LLC trader Danny Yong in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At his new firm, Lim will lead investments. Bedwick will run the business, a change in role for the former Lehman Brothers trader who outperformed rivals when he managed his own macro hedge fund between 2009 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedwick had launched his Sequence Fundamental Macro Fund, earlier known as OGI Global Macro Fund, in October 2009 in Japan with $15 million. It earned a 9 percent annual return, nearly twice what his peers were making, and grew to manage as much as $150 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bedwick, an American who has worked in Asia for more than half his life, shut down his hedge fund in 2012 after the fund failed to grow as investor shifted to larger hedge funds globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macro hedge funds focus on major economic trends and events and bet anywhere they see value, including stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Christopher Cushing, Michael Flaherty and Matt Driskill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Feb 10 (IFR) - JP Morgan has cut its
correspondent banking relationship with Emirates NBD,
Dubai's largest bank, as part of a global review of its
business, sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a memo to staff last year, the U.S. bank said it would
scale back its relationships with foreign banks in order to
comply with regulatory pressure to tighten risk controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this process, the bank has severed relationships
in its cash management business in the Middle East, and has not
spared Dubai's largest bank by market capitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JP Morgan is undertaking a global review of its banking
relationships both on profitability and on compliance. In the
Middle East they have cut many relationships, including with
Emirates NBD," a person with knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Dubai-based banker said he had received similar
information. "It is not very surprising given the pressure
they've been under from regulators. They are cutting any
relationship that holds even a slight bit of risk," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan does not comment on individual relationships, but
a source said: "It is well known we are tightening our controls,
especially in the corresponding banking business...and we
mentioned it in our Q3 earnings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Emirates NBD spokesman said the lender did not comment on
the relationship between the bank and clearing banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correspondent banking, which involves activities such as
processing transactions and clearing U.S. dollar payments for
foreign banks, has historically been a core part of JP Morgan's
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emerged in August last year that this business would be
scaled back at JP Morgan and the bank would not take on any new
clients, particularly in the light of increased regulatory
scrutiny in the aftermath of the "London Whale" derivatives
trade losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following media reports, JP Morgan said in a statement that
it was "important for us to pause and assess our business,
particularly in select markets, to ensure we are well-positioned
to meet our responsibilities for the long term".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers working for international banks in the Middle East
said they would be surprised if JP Morgan was the only
international firm to cut relationships in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it is a little unfair to single out JP Morgan on
this issue - many of us will need to look at our relationships
again and there could be more developments of this nature," said
one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One problem facing international banks in the region is some
Gulf lenders' relationships with clients in Iran, though there
are no suggestions that the relationship with Emirates NBD was
terminated for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2012, Dubai-based Noor Islamic Bank (now called
Noor Bank) stopped channelling billions of dollars from Iranian
oil sales through its accounts after pressure from the United
States, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May last year, the United States blacklisted two
Dubai-based trading companies - Al Hilal Exchange and Al Fida

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Two former top traders at Goldman Sachs and Noble Group are planning to form a hedge fund in Asia, a source with knowledge of the matter said, in another high profile launch in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund's creation comes as global regulatory changes restrict banks from trading with their own money, forcing so-called proprietary desk traders to strike out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also comes as investor interest in hedge funds in Asia makes its strongest comeback since 2007 and on the back of the industry's strong performance in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leland Lim, who was the co-head of macro trading for Asia Pacific ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, is teaming up with Allan Bedwick, the former head of macro trading in Asia for Noble Group, to launch a macro hedge fund in the second or third quarter of 2014, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lim, who joined Goldman in New York in 1997 on the foreign exchange options desk, retired last month from the Wall Street bank, while Bedwick quit the Singaporean commodities firm in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lim moved to Asia in 1999. Prior to becoming the co-head, he managed Asia Pacific ex-Japan foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives trading, according to an internal memo sent to Goldman staff announcing his retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source could not estimate the start-up capital as the plan was at an early stage and the duo has yet to register the firm in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian hedge funds returned an average 16 percent last year, outperforming a less than 10 percent gain by global peers and attracted net inflows of $11 billion in 2013, the highest since 2007, according to data from industry tracker Eurekahedge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of proprietary traders globally have spun off from banks to start their own hedge fund since the financial crisis in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the well-known names in Asia include former Goldman trader Morgan Sze, who started Azentus Capital, and former Credit Suisse trader Charlie Chan who runs Splendid Asia macro fund. Both launched their funds in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lim and Bedwick will compete with Asia-based macro hedge funds such as the $1.8 billion Fortress Asia Macro Fund run by Adam Levinson and the $2.6 billion Dymon Asia Macro Fund managed by former Citadel LLC trader Danny Yong in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At his new firm, Lim will lead investments. Bedwick will run the business, a change in role for the former Lehman Brothers trader who outperformed rivals when he managed his own macro hedge fund between 2009 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedwick had launched his Sequence Fundamental Macro Fund, earlier known as OGI Global Macro Fund, in October 2009 in Japan with $15 million. It earned a 9 percent annual return, nearly twice what his peers were making, and grew to manage as much as $150 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bedwick, an American who has worked in Asia for more than half his life, shut down his hedge fund in 2012 after the fund failed to grow as investor shifted to larger hedge funds globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macro hedge funds focus on major economic trends and events and bet anywhere they see value, including stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Christopher Cushing, Michael Flaherty and Matt Driskill)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      (c) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Feb. 10, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $38,303,883 
      non-rated class or the $69,425,883 interest-only class X-C.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 51 loans secured by 83 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $957.6 million as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; Redwood Commercial 
      Mortgage Corporation; Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC; and RAIT 
      Funding, LLC.

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 72.7% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis on 71.9%, and asset summary reviews on 71.9% of the pool.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.16x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 100.4%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 9.1%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 6.8% to issuer cash flows.

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: This transaction has slightly lower leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate deals. The pool's Fitch LTV of 100.4% is 
      below the 2013 average of 101.6%. However, excluding the credit opinion 
      loan, the pool's Fitch LTV is 103.5%. The pool's Fitch DSCR of 1.16x is 
      below the 2013 average of 1.29x. The conduit DSCR is 1.15x, excluding 
      the credit opinion loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated by loan size and 
      sponsor than average transactions from 2013, as evidenced by a loan 
      concentration index (LCI) of 479 and sponsor concentration index (SCI) 
      of 479. Also the 10 largest loans represent 58.6% of the total pool 
      balance, which is higher than the average 2013 top 10 concentration of 
      54.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High Retail Concentration: The pool has an above- average concentration 
      of retail properties at 52.4%. Six of the 10 largest assets are retail 
      properties. The average retail concentration in 2013 was 33.2%. The 
      largest property type is retail (52.4%), followed by multifamily (13.9%) 
      and hotel (11.9%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, Miami International 
      Mall (10.4%), has a Fitch credit opinion 'BBB-sf' on a stand-alone 
      basis. The loan is collateralized by a super-regional mall in Miami, FL.

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMBB 2014-C18 pool could withstand a 
      62.0% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 19.6% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing a $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 69.4% decline in value and 
      an approximately 35.3% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said in staff memos on Tuesday that it has added five executives to its management committee, the latest in a series of promotions and departures near the top of the Wall Street bank over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new management-committee members are Paul Russo, Michael Daffey, Justin Gmelich, Craig Broderick and Sarah Smith, according to the memos, which were signed by Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn. They were confirmed by a spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointments increase the size of Goldman's management committee to 34 members. The powerful group represents senior executives across trading, investment banking, asset management, finance and other operations who are responsible for developing and implementing the bank's broad strategy and business principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russo and Daffey are co-chief operating officers of Goldman's equities trading business, while Gmelich is global head of credit trading. Broderick is chief risk officer, and Smith is controller and chief accounting officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the executives have been employed by Goldman Sachs for roughly 15 years or more. Among them, Broderick has been employed by the bank for the longest time, having joined in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promotions come a day after Goldman named Ashok Varadhan as a third co-head of securities, and are reflective of sweeping changes across the senior ranks of the bank as Blankfein approaches his eighth year as chief executive officer in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, at the start of 2012, the securities business was run by three different executives, two of whom have since left Goldman and one of whom, Harvey Schwartz, replaced longtime chief financial officer David Viniar last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans, who was seen as a potential successor to Blankfein, retired at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of highly paid Goldman partners have left since 2011, making way for younger talent to move up the ranks, but also allowing the bank cut costs. Compared with 2010, Goldman's staff levels have dropped 8 percent, but its compensation costs are down 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though there is no sign that Blankfein plans to step down in the immediate future, executives have described the senior-level changes as part of a gradual succession plan that will leave the bank on solid ground when he eventually retires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Amanda Kwan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Statement on Today&#8217;s Joint Meeting of FDA Advisory Committees
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer agrees with the recommendation of the joint meeting of the FDA 
      Arthritis Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management 
      Advisory Committee that the available data do not support a conclusion 
      that naproxen has a lower risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events as 
      compared to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on Pfizer&#8217;s review of the data discussed, we believe there is 
      insufficient evidence to make this type of distinction. Differentiation 
      between NSAIDs on cardiovascular safety should be based on substantial 
      scientific evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer is sponsoring a study that may provide substantial evidence. 
      PRECISION is a large, ongoing, well-controlled, randomized clinical 
      trial designed in agreement with FDA to assess the relative long-term 
      cardiovascular safety of CELEBREX compared to prescription doses of two 
      commonly prescribed NSAIDs, ibuprofen and naproxen, in the treatment of 
      arthritis pain. It is an important study that will provide meaningful 
      information on the cardiovascular safety of these medicines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although advisory committees provide recommendations to the FDA, FDA 
      makes final regulatory decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patient safety and appropriate use of our medicines are top priorities 
      at Pfizer. For more than 30 years, Pfizer NSAID medicines have helped 
      people relieve their headaches, arthritis symptoms and other causes of 
      pain or inflammation. We are committed to ongoing safety monitoring of 
      our medicines.

over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new management-committee members are Paul Russo, Michael
Daffey, Justin Gmelich, Craig Broderick and Sarah Smith,
according to the memos, which were signed by Chief Executive
Lloyd Blankfein and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn. They were
confirmed by a spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointments increase the size of Goldman's management
committee to 34 members. The powerful group represents senior
executives across trading, investment banking, asset management,
finance and other operations who are responsible for developing
and implementing the bank's broad strategy and business
principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russo and Daffey are co-chief operating officers of
Goldman's equities trading business, while Gmelich is global
head of credit trading. Broderick is chief risk officer, and
Smith is controller and chief accounting officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the executives have been employed by Goldman Sachs
for roughly 15 years or more. Among them, Broderick has been
employed by the bank for the longest time, having joined in
1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promotions come a day after Goldman named Ashok Varadhan
as a third co-head of securities, and are reflective of sweeping
changes across the senior ranks of the bank as Blankfein
approaches his eighth year as chief executive officer in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, at the start of 2012, the securities business
was run by three different executives, two of whom have since
left Goldman and one of whom, Harvey Schwartz, replaced longtime
chief financial officer David Viniar last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans, who was seen as a potential
successor to Blankfein, retired at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of highly paid Goldman partners have left since 2011,
making way for younger talent to move up the ranks, but also
allowing the bank cut costs. Compared with 2010, Goldman's staff
levels have dropped 8 percent, but its compensation costs are
down 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though there is no sign that Blankfein plans to step down in
the immediate future, executives have described the senior-level
changes as part of a gradual succession plan that will leave the
bank on solid ground when he eventually retires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* In 2009, Goldman bought firm that once sold Iran uranium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Goldman sitting on $200 million stockpile of yellowcake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Deutsche Bank holds similar inventories of the fuel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Historian reveals details of Iranian yellowcake purchase&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Both banks putting uranium desks up for sale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Deutsche
Bank are quietly trying to get out of a business few
people know they are even in: trading supplies of raw uranium
known as yellowcake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last four years, the banks have amassed low-grade
stockpiles of the nuclear fuel ingredient larger than those held
by Iran, and enough to run China's nuclear plants for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's uranium business can trace its roots back to an
apartheid-era South African trading conglomerate that sold Iran
its only known source of foreign yellowcake 35 years ago. To
this day, that uranium delivery underpins Iran's disputed
enrichment programme, which western powers fear is aimed at
developing atomic weapons, although Iran denies that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, under mounting political scrutiny of Wall Street's role
in physical commodities trading, and following a collapse in
demand after the Fukushima disaster, both firms have put
their uranium trading desks up for sale. But other banks are
already lining up to take their place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of Wall Street in uranium markets illustrates
just how far banks moved into physical commodities trading
during the natural resources boom of the last ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through its nuclear trading desk, known as NUFCOR
International Limited, Goldman has a deal to market the vast
majority of South Africa's uranium production from one of the
country's largest miners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While people familiar with the business say Goldman has only
sold uranium to nuclear power plants and other traders since
buying NUFCOR four years ago, some have questioned whether banks
should be dealing in such a politically sensitive commodity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the global trade in uranium is monitored by
governments, intelligence agencies, and the International Atomic
Energy Agency, no single authority can trace every deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of how Iran received yellowcake from NUFCOR were
uncovered for the first time by Professor Gabrielle Hecht of the
University of Michigan, while she did archival research at the
company's old headquarters near Johannesburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yellowcake can be bought and sold without any significant
international controls," Hecht told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The nuclear industry has been campaigning for decades to
banalise uranium and make it appear like just any other
commodity, but it should be subject to much stronger oversight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filings with UK authorities and nuclear industry sources say
the two banks' combined stockpiles of uranium are valued at more
than $400 million, or around 5,000 tonnes of yellowcake. That
would be enough to fuel 20 standard nuclear power plants for a
year, or, uranium experts say, to build 200 nuclear bombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank declined to comment on
questions about their uranium trading businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian bank Macquarie, which industry sources
say has been talking to Goldman about buying NUFCOR, denied last
month that a deal for the business has already been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WALL STREET GOES NUCLEAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Deutsche entered the uranium market in 2009,
when tightening supplies threatened to send prices soaring. They
would grow to handle almost a third of all uranium trades in the
spot market, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were not the first financial traders to be attracted to
uranium. A number of specialist hedge funds started to buy and
hold yellowcake in the middle of the last decade, in belief the
world was on the cusp of a so-called 'nuclear renaissance'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They thought demand for nuclear power would soar as
countries tried to curb greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the price of uranium surged to nearly $140 a pound
from under $20 a pound just five years earlier. Prices spiked
again in 2010 from just over $40 a pound to near $65 a pound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some uranium consumers blamed funds and banks for hoarding
the fuel and helping to push up the price, said Jonathan Hinze,
Senior Vice President at The Ux Consulting Company, which
provides pricing and advisory services to the nuclear industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it's clear that while they definitely added fuel to the
fire, the fundamental reasons of growing demand and limited
supply growth was the big catalyst behind the move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading firms like Deutsche and Goldman buy and hold uranium
in secure warehouses licensed and designed to hold the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raw uranium is processed into a gas called uranium
hexafluoride before being enriched into fuel rods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market participants say yellowcake trading is not to be
feared. They say traders take no risk in transporting the
radioactive material, because they only take title to the
yellowcake once it is in secure storage facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks including JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have announced
plans to sell all or part of their physical trading operations
in the last six months, while the Federal Reserve has faced
pressure in Washington to speed up efforts to restrict Wall
Street's role in commodities trading. Deutsche said in December
it was largely exiting commodities trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, however, has said it remains committed to its
J.Aron &amp; Company commodity business, where many of its top
executives started their careers, including CEO Lloyd Blankfein.
It is not clear exactly why Goldman has decided to get out of
trading uranium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some regulatory experts say that while third-party traders
generally only help facilitate the flow of uranium between
miners and utilities, there are concerns the material could end
up with less scrupulous buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRAN'S ONE-TIME URANIUM SUPPLIER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's largest role in the global trade in uranium comes
through a deal with AngloGold Ashanti, which produces
almost all of the yellowcake in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009 Goldman acquired its uranium trading arm, called
NUFCOR International Ltd, as part of a wider deal to buy the
London-based trading desk of Constellation Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NUFCOR International's roots stretch back to 1968, when a
group of private South African gold companies established the
Nuclear Fuels Corporation of South Africa (NUFCOR SA) to
market most of the country's uranium, which was produced as a
byproduct of their gold mining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, the Shah of Iran arranged a deal with NUFCOR
to supply his country with low-grade uranium for his planned
nuclear energy programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Hecht found in NUFCOR's archives the exact details
of the sale for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, NUFCOR signed an agreement to supply Iran with
2,400 tonnes of yellowcake, Hecht says. Over the following
years, NUFCOR shipped 775 tonnes of the fuel to Iran, before the
Islamic Revolution in 1979 put the deal on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NUFCOR discussed a second deal with Iran in 1984 to supply
1,485 tonnes of yellowcake, but the deal was eventually blocked
by the apartheid-era South African government in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine years later - because the South African government
wanted to settle the affair - the uranium that had not been
delivered to Iran was sold to a New York trading company and a
German electricity firm and the money was returned to Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran revealed its purchase of yellowcake to the
International Atomic Energy Agency in the 1990s. While the IAEA
has said Iran's yellowcake stockpile came from South Africa, it
has never publicly revealed the company behind the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the main, or possibly the only, material being used
in Iran's enrichment plants," the World Nuclear Association says
of the yellowcake delivered from South Africa to Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olli Heinonen, a former U.N. nuclear inspector who is now a
Senior Fellow at Harvard University, said in an email Iran may
have obtained additional yellowcake from other, unknown sources.
It has also mined a small amount of raw uranium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation didn't
comment on specific questions about the NUFCOR sales, but said
it is "closely cooperating" with the IAEA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a deal with Tehran signed in November, the IAEA is
stepping up an investigation into whether Iran has sought
nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear programme is aimed only
at developing peaceful power supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NUFCOR became wholly-owned by AngloGold Ashanti and
FirstRand Bank in 1998, before being sold ten years later to
Constellation Energy in the United States. A year later, it was
bought by Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2010 and 2012, AngloGold Ashanti supplied Goldman's
NUFCOR business with an average of almost 600 tonnes a year of
the raw fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to filings with the UK's Companies House, at the
end of 2012 NUFCOR held more than $232 million of low-grade
uranium, up from $160 million at the end of 2011. Based on
prices at the time NUFCOR held almost 2,500 tonnes of the raw
fuel. The level has since risen, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AngloGold Ashanti spokesman declined to comment on what
the sale of the desk might mean for the supply agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GERMANY'S URANIUM BANK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche's business was established by a former Lehman
Brothers trader, Roy Adams, who had run the uranium trading
business at the ill-fated U.S. bank. While Adams left Deutsche
Bank around 2011, the firm continued to market uranium from
offices in London and New York. Reuters was not able to reach
Adams for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Deutsche Bank started holding preliminary
discussions with potential buyers of its uranium business after
announcing it was largely exiting commodities trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale will include the bank's trading book, including
long-term deals with nuclear power plants, and a stockpile of
low-grade uranium worth about $200 million. At current prices
that amounts to about 2,600 tonnes of yellowcake.&lt;/p&gt;

It is not clear exactly why Goldman has decided to get out of trading uranium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some regulatory experts say that while third-party traders generally only help facilitate the flow of uranium between miners and utilities, there are concerns the material could end up with less scrupulous buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRAN'S ONE-TIME URANIUM SUPPLIER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's largest role in the global trade in uranium comes through a deal with AngloGold Ashanti, which produces almost all of the yellowcake in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009 Goldman acquired its uranium trading arm, called NUFCOR International Ltd, as part of a wider deal to buy the London-based trading desk of Constellation Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NUFCOR International's roots stretch back to 1968, when a group of private South African gold companies established the Nuclear Fuels Corporation of South Africa (NUFCOR SA) to market most of the country's uranium, which was produced as a byproduct of their gold mining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, the Shah of Iran arranged a deal with NUFCOR to supply his country with low-grade uranium for his planned nuclear energy program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Hecht found in NUFCOR's archives the exact details of the sale for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, NUFCOR signed an agreement to supply Iran with 2,400 metric tonnes of yellowcake, Hecht says. Over the following years, NUFCOR shipped 775 metric tonnes of the fuel to Iran, before the Islamic Revolution in 1979 put the deal on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NUFCOR discussed a second deal with Iran in 1984 to supply 1,485 metric tonnes of yellowcake, but the deal was eventually blocked by the apartheid-era South African government in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine years later - because the South African government wanted to settle the affair - the uranium that had not been delivered to Iran was sold to a New York trading company and a German electricity firm and the money was returned to Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran revealed its purchase of yellowcake to the International Atomic Energy Agency in the 1990s. While the IAEA has said Iran's yellowcake stockpile came from South Africa, it has never publicly revealed the company behind the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the main, or possibly the only, material being used in Iran's enrichment plants," the World Nuclear Association says of the yellowcake delivered from South Africa to Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olli Heinonen, a former U.N. nuclear inspector who is now a Senior Fellow at Harvard University, said in an email Iran may have obtained additional yellowcake from other, unknown sources. It has also mined a small amount of raw uranium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation didn't comment on specific questions about the NUFCOR sales, but said it is "closely cooperating" with the IAEA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a deal with Tehran signed in November, the IAEA is stepping up an investigation into whether Iran has sought nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is aimed only at developing peaceful power supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NUFCOR became wholly-owned by AngloGold Ashanti and FirstRand Bank in 1998, before being sold ten years later to Constellation Energy in the United States. A year later, it was bought by Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2010 and 2012, AngloGold Ashanti supplied Goldman's NUFCOR business with an average of almost 600 metric tonnes a year of the raw fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to filings with the UK's Companies House, at the end of 2012 NUFCOR held more than $232 million of low-grade uranium, up from $160 million at the end of 2011. Based on prices at the time NUFCOR held almost 2,500 metric tonnes of the raw fuel. The level has since risen, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AngloGold Ashanti spokesman declined to comment on what the sale of the desk might mean for the supply agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GERMANY'S URANIUM BANK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche's business was established by a former Lehman Brothers trader, Roy Adams, who had run the uranium trading business at the ill-fated U.S. bank. While Adams left Deutsche Bank around 2011, the firm continued to market uranium from offices in London and New York. Reuters was not able to reach Adams for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Deutsche Bank started holding preliminary discussions with potential buyers of its uranium business after announcing it was largely exiting commodities trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale will include the bank's trading book, including long-term deals with nuclear power plants, and a stockpile of low-grade uranium worth about $200 million. At current prices that amounts to about 2,600 metric tonnes of yellowcake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Fredrik Dahl in Vienna and Parisa Hafezi in Ankara; Editing by Giles Elgood)&lt;/p&gt;

			World&#8217;s First Stand-Alone NFC microSD Card Certified for Visa and 
      MasterCard Mobile Payments Uses AS3922 from ams
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DeviceFidelity CredenSE NFC microSD with integrated NFC antenna
			leverages 
      ams Active Boost technology to achieve global certification
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ams AG (SIX: AMS), a leading provider of high performance analog ICs and 
      sensors, today announced that US-based DeviceFidelity, Inc. is using 
      unique ams RF technology in its latest CredenSE 2.10 Near Field 
      Communication (NFC) microSD card to enable secure, certified NFC 
      transmissions between any mobile phone and contactless payment terminals 
      from Visa and MasterCard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DeviceFidelity CredenSE 2.10 is the world&#8217;s first NFC microSD card to 
      successfully achieve global payment certifications from both Visa and 
      MasterCard without requiring external booster antenna or device specific 
      attachments. Using the AS3922 from ams, an integrated NFC front end with 
      Active Boost technology, CredenSE achieves a typical read range of 4cm 
      in a mobile phone&#8217;s microSD slot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mobile phone is a notoriously difficult environment for RF and 
      variations between phone models make it difficult to consistently 
      achieve good performance. The stringent requirements for read range 
      compatibility with payment terminals for payment applications cannot be 
      met in small form factors such as SIM or microSD cards with a 
      traditional passive NFC card emulation front end and simple planar 
      antenna.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier SIM and microSD designs therefore used an additional component 
      such as an external booster antenna or external attachment to amplify RF 
      communication between tag and reader. The use of such external antennas 
      makes mass deployment impractical since it raises bill-of-materials 
      while also increasing the complexity of handling distribution and 
      support for a variety of different handset models.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The DeviceFidelity CredenSE 2.10 is the first commercially produced NFC 
      microSD card that meets EMV standards using only an ultra-small antenna 
      embedded in the card, making distribution and compatibility with 
      hundreds of phone models possible with one easy-to-deploy microSD card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This means that it can be used to transform any mobile device with a 
      microSD card slot into a contactless payment device without any need for 
      device specific external antenna or attachments. DeviceFidelity has been 
      granted global patents for the design and functionality of such an NFC 
      microSD with built-in antenna and active front end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certified solution has been achieved primarily through the use of 
      the Active Boost capability in the AS3922, working in conjunction with a 
      DeviceFidelity-designed 3D miniature antenna, which actively transmits 
      in response to a point-of-sale reader, in contrast to the passive load 
      modulation normally supported by NFC tags.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Active Boost allows for robust tag-to-reader communication at a coupling 
      factor 100 times higher than is possible with conventional passive tag 
      designs. The AS3922 also offers unique Antenna Auto Tuning and Q factor 
      adjustment, which are critical to microSD, SIM and &#181;SIM applications. 
      The IC includes an ACLB interface for communication with the contactless 
      interface of any Dual Interface Secure Element, and DCLB and NFC-WI 
      interfaces for digital communication.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Use of the AS3922 with a 3D antenna also provides for smooth operation 
      with any payment terminal by eliminating the need for the user to hold 
      the phone in any orientation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to successful performance with Visa and MasterCard payment 
      terminals, DeviceFidelity&#8217;s CredenSE microSD also provides an option for 
      service providers to deploy mass transit and physical access 
      applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The CredenSE 2.10 NFC microSD packs DeviceFidelity intellectual 
      property, years of innovation and expertise, to offer a high performance 
      plug-and-play NFC card emulation solution that is easy to distribute by 
      any service providers in a device- and network-agnostic fashion. This 
      technology breakthrough is made possible by the AS3922&#8217;s ability to 
      realize reliable NFC transmissions on most phones while meeting the size 
      constraints of a tiny antenna,&#8221; said Tuan Dao, EVP of Technology at 
      DeviceFidelity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;DeviceFidelity is leading the way in the enablement of NFC microSD 
      payments on mobile phones globally, so ams is delighted that it selected 
      the AS3922, which offers superior RF performance in the 
      space-constrained microSD form factor,&#8221; said Mark Dickson, Senior 
      Product Marketing Manager of ams.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      (NYSE: FIS), the world&#8217;s largest provider of banking and payments 
      technology, announces its selection by Microsoft as a partner in the 
      fight against cybercrime. The global companies signed a partnership 
      agreement today at Microsoft&#8217;s Cybercrime Enforcement Summit in Redmond, 
      Wash.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the agreement, FIS representatives will work hand-in-hand with 
      forensic analysts, software developers and researchers at the Microsoft 
      Cybercrime Center, which opened in November 2013. The partnership goal 
      is to increase cooperative action between international law enforcement 
      and private industry in order to help continuously improve the security 
      of payments and financial transactions worldwide and make the Internet a 
      safer place to do business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;FIS has a leading role in setting and maintaining security standards 
      for the financial services industry worldwide,&#8221; said Greg Montana, EVP 
      and chief risk officer, FIS. &#8220;Cybersecurity has no end state and we 
      embrace the opportunity to work collaboratively with industry leaders 
      such as Microsoft to continually advance and further strengthen the 
      banking and payments industry for financial institutions and their 
      customers across the globe.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to tap into FIS&#8217; cybersecurity expertise in our joint 
      efforts to fight cybercrime,&#8221; said David Finn, executive director and 
      associate general counsel, Microsoft Cybercrime Center. &#8220;We think their 
      experience and knowledge will be invaluable as we work together to 
      detect, pursue, and dismantle criminal organizations around the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the latest in a series of industry-leading cybersecurity 
      partnerships for FIS. The company recently reached an agreement with the 
      Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a cybersecurity 
      research partner. FIS representatives will work with DHS&#8217;s National 
      Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), a 24x7 
      cyber monitoring, incident response, and management center, through 
      which DHS actively collaborates and shares information with federal 
      partners and the private sector every day in the face of constantly 
      evolving threats to the nation&#8217;s critical infrastructure and 
      communications networks. FIS also is a member of the Financial Services 
      Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC).

&lt;p&gt;PITTSBURGH Feb 12 (Reuters) - A fire at a Chevron Corp
 natural gas well in western Pennsylvania was being left
to burn on Wednesday after an explosion early Tuesday left one
worker injured and another missing, state officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flames shot from the head of the Lanco 7H well, which is 50
miles south of Pittsburgh in the Marcellus shale region and
emergency workers were unable to get near on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire could continue indefinitely as gas flows up the
well from underground, said John Poister, spokesman for the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a large amount of gas in the well, and it could
burn, if we just sat there and watched it, for months or years,"
Poister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it did not know how long the fire would
continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting the flames out will probably involve some sort of
smothering, possibly with foam or chemicals, Poister said. Wild
Well Control, an organization specialized in fighting well
fires, remains at the scene to devise a method of extinguishing
the blaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No homes or structures were threatened by the blaze, and the
DEP will perform air quality tests to check for pollution. The
fire is extremely hot, but isolated to the well pad, a space
Poister said was half the size of a football field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen workers were on the well pad at the time of the
explosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workers were preparing to run tubing down the well at
the time of the incident, Chevron said, and no drilling or
hydraulic fracturing taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operational data for Brazilian securities clearinghouse Cetip SA
Mercados Organizados in January showed mixed trends for
registration volumes and a sharp drop in custody transactions,
indicating that the strong performance seen at the end of last
year may fail to extend into 2014, analysts at Goldman Sachs
Group led by Carlos Macedo said on Wednesday. Cetip, which
released January data late on Tuesday, saw registration volumes
for fixed-income securities down 24.5 percent from the prior
month. Custody volumes fell sequentially for the first time
since June 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The typically weaker month of January unsurprisingly
produced weaker volumes throughout, with only limited hints that
2013's strong finish bled over to 2014 - though the drop in
custody volumes raises some concern," Macedo said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trends at Cetip's liens unit showed weak performance,
according to Macedo. Car sales declined seasonally in a
month-on-month basis, which, combined with a lower percentage of
cars financed, led liens registered to decline 11 percent in the
month.&lt;/p&gt;

      Card-linked offers stand at the unique intersection of the payments, 
      social media, advertising, and retail industries. As the &#8220;offers&#8221; space 
      has become more popular, consumers have often found it cumbersome to 
      take advantage of the variety and amount of offers available. 
      Card-linked offers help solve that problem by giving merchants and 
      advertisers the ability to deliver an offer or deal to consumers via 
      their credit, debit or other payment cards without having to use a paper 
      coupon, voucher or promotion code.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 12 (Reuters) - Barclays and UBS prompted angry reactions from
politicians after increasing their 2013 bonus pots and saying they needed to stay competitive
with rivals after cutting pay in 2012.  
    It has been a mixed year for banking staff overall. Average pay and benefits, including
bonuses, at Goldman Sachs fell 4 percent in 2013 from the year before, though it still
paid more than major rivals.
    More European banks will release results and details of remuneration through to early March.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia said on Wednesday it plans to challenge a Delhi High Court ruling that is blocking the transfer to Microsoft of assets related to its mobile phone business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such asset - a plant in the southern Indian city of Chennai - is among Nokia's biggest phone-making factories. Local authorities seized it last year in a tax dispute, blocking its transfer to Microsoft which bought Nokia's mobile phone business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia agreed in December to place 22.50 billion rupees ($367 million) into an escrow account and pay for any additional tax claims once all legal avenues had been exhausted, but the Delhi High Court ruled on February 5 that it must pay deposits on local authority tax claims as these claims are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company spokesman said Nokia made its latest appeal to India's Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia could continue running the plant as a contract manufacturer for Microsoft if an asset transfer is blocked, but the company wants to quit the mobile phone business to concentrate on selling network equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned 5.4 billion euro ($7.4 billion) sale to Microsoft had been expected to close before the end of the first quarter but the tax dispute looks set to drag on for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's board chairman and interim CEO Risto Siilasmaa is meeting Indian ministers in New Delhi on Wednesday and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is also in a $2 billion tax dispute, which began in 2007, with Britain's Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Jason Neely/Ruth PItchford)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI Feb 12 (Reuters) - Nokia said on Wednesday it
plans to challenge a Delhi High Court ruling that is blocking
the transfer to Microsoft of assets related to its mobile phone
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such asset - a plant in the southern Indian city of
Chennai - is among Nokia's biggest phone-making
factories. Local authorities seized it last year in a tax
dispute, blocking its transfer to Microsoft which bought Nokia's
mobile phone business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia agreed in December to place 22.50 billion rupees ($367
million) into an escrow account and pay for any additional tax
claims once all legal avenues had been exhausted, but the Delhi
High Court ruled on Feb. 5 that it must pay deposits on local
authority tax claims as these claims are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company spokesman said Nokia made its latest appeal to
India's Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia could continue running the plant as a contract
manufacturer for Microsoft if an asset transfer is blocked, but
the company wants to quit the mobile phone business to
concentrate on selling network equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned 5.4 billion euro ($7.4 billion) sale to
Microsoft had been expected to close before the end of the first
quarter but the tax dispute looks set to drag on for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's board chairman and interim CEO Risto Siilasmaa is
meeting Indian ministers in New Delhi on Wednesday and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is also in a $2 billion tax dispute, which began in
2007, with Britain's Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L.&lt;/p&gt;

			Woodcraft Supply Partners With enVista for Microsoft Dynamics&#174; AX ERP 
      Implementation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			enVista ERP consulting practice selected based on extensive Microsoft 
      Dynamics AX experience and deep retail supply chain expertise
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      enVista, a leading supply chain consulting and IT services firm, 
      announced today that it was selected to design and implement a Microsoft 
      Dynamics AX ERP solution for Woodcraft Supply, one of the nation's 
      oldest and largest suppliers of quality woodworking tools and supplies. 
      The retailer/distributor partnered with enVista based on enVista&#8217;s 
      significant retail and supply chain expertise and experience 
      implementing Microsoft Dynamics AX.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The robust functionality offered by Microsoft Dynamics AX will enable 
      Woodcraft Supply to optimize its order processing capabilities and 
      business processes. Specifically, enVista will focus on functionality 
      that addresses financial management and reporting, procurement, customer 
      service, inventory management and CRM applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Ryan Knost, Director of Business Applications and 
      Technology at Woodcraft, &#8220;We had outgrown our 20 year old system that no 
      longer provided the necessary support and flexibility needed to be 
      competitive in today&#8217;s market. In our search to replace our existing 
      systems, Microsoft Dynamics AX was a consistent recommendation. We then 
      interviewed several implementation teams and unanimously agreed to go 
      with the enVista team. They bring deep expertise with both Dynamics AX 
      and Manhattan Associates&#8217; Warehouse Management Systems.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bruce Eicher, Managing Partner at enVista, said, &#8220;We are honored to be 
      selected by Woodcraft Supply as its Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP 
      implementation partner. Woodcraft requires a solution that will enable 
      the company to expand its business with an eye toward the future. We 
      look forward to helping Woodcraft move from its existing legacy business 
      applications to a robust ERP platform that will address all of 
      Woodcraft&#8217;s long-term operational and business requirements.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Woodcraft has over 21,000 items available for sale, 14,000 of which it 
      keeps in stock. The company is able to ship to all 50 states in the 
      U.S., as well as to 117 foreign countries. Woodcraft also has a 
      franchise relationship with 76 retail stores. In order to improve 
      visibility and technology integration across Woodcraft&#8217;s enterprise and 
      with the company&#8217;s more than 500 vendors, enVista will work closely with 
      Woodcraft to implement eCommerce technology.

			A Major Update of Sync2 for Microsoft Outlook, Released by 4Team 
      Corporation, Delivers New Instant Sync and Folder Backup Features
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      4Team Corporation, a major
			player on the market for 
      synchronization and backup software, has just released Sync2 2.41 - a 
      new version of the leading synchronization software, designed for 
      synchronization of Microsoft Outlook folders (email, calendar, contacts, 
      tasks, notes and journal) with Google 
      services and across multiple devices without a need of a server.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The latest Sync2 release greatly boosted software capabilities. Sync2 
      now offers: Instant Sync - for immediate data synchronization, 
      once any changes occur in Microsoft Outlook; an increased data 
      preservation with automatic 
      backup of Outlook folders (Calendar and Contacts only) before 
      each synchronization, the intelligent restore option and many 
      more advanced features, supplied by the 4Team Corporation&#8217;s product.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The latest version is available at: http://sync2.com/.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Folder 
      Backup for Outlook integrated into Sync2 brings highly 
      improved Microsoft Outlook data backup performance. The tool has 
      shortened the backup time to almost instant, by creating a backup of 
      solely Outlook folders participating in the sync process, before each 
      synchronization starts.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;All backed up PST files are kept separately and can be restored in a 
      few clicks to the previous state, straight from the Outlook toolbar, by 
      using the integrated restore option. All restored data will be kept in a 
      separate folder, to avoid overwriting Microsoft Outlook information,&#8221; 
      says Denis Popov, General Manager of 4Team Corporation.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI Feb 12 (Reuters) - Nokia said on
Wednesday it was appealing a ruling last week by the Delhi High
Court which said the company must pay deposits on tax claims by
local authorities in order to transfer assets related to its
mobile phone business to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such asset - a plant in the southern Indian city of
Chennai - is one of Nokia's biggest phone-making factories.
Local authorities seized it last year in a tax dispute, blocking
its transfer to Microsoft which bought Nokia's mobile phone
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia said it had agreed in December to put money into an
escrow account and pay for any additional tax claims once all
legal avenues had been exhausted, but a Delhi High Court on Feb
5 clarified that it must pay deposits as claims are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia said it made its latest appeal to India's Supreme
Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Thomas Stolper is leaving the firm in early March after

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEL AVIV, Israel and COLOGNE, Germany, Feb. 12, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Top Image Systems Ltd. (Nasdaq:TISA) a leading ECM (Enterprise Content Management) and BPM (Business Process Management) solution and MIP (Mobile Imaging Platform) provider announced today that a leading European pharmaceutical company selected the eFLOW&#174; platform for automation of its Purchase to Pay processes. Invoices, orders, contracts and proof of delivery notes from thousands of suppliers will be processed in eFLOW at two locations in Italy, while maintaining full integration with the company's existing SAP and Microsoft SharePoint systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The company selected Top Image Systems largely because of the flexibility of the eFLOW platform to process various kinds of semi and unstructured documents and for its integration to multiple business systems.&#160;Previously, any invoice that was received by the company via email had to be printed out before processing.&#160;If an invoice document referred to more than one purchase order, it would have to be run through the system multiple times.&#160;With eFLOW, invoice processing is streamlined with immediate data recognition and validation; the company's P2P processes are optimized, enabling a quick, safe and cost-effective document flow to and from their customers.
			
	Yoss Perl, Director EMEA for Top Image Systems, remarked, "We are very proud to have been selected by one of Italy's leading biopharmaceutical companies.&#160;This customer had been processing a broad range of different types of orders, contracts and invoices manually, and they needed a platform to uniformly optimize and process every company document.&#160;In addition, they needed to ensure easy retrieval of all documents via the same system.&#160;The eFLOW&#174; platform gives them the opportunity to do all of this and more.&#160;We are confident that this important win will promote Top Image Systems across the Italian pharmaceutical market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - A slide in IBM Corp's (IBM.N) sales in China amid a broad backlash against claims of U.S. government spying has triggered a rare visit to Beijing by Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of the world's biggest technology services company arrives in China's capital on Wednesday for three days of meetings with government leaders, according to people familiar with her visit. The visit comes as U.S. firms like IBM and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) seek to restore trust with Chinese regulators and reverse slumping sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing has encouraged state-owned companies to buy China-branded products since last year's revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of spying. That has undercut business at some U.S.-based multinationals operating in the world's second-biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Beijing, Rometty will have meetings with Chinese officials including Vice Premier Wang Yang, responsible for helping to formulate China's economic policy. The IBM chief also is expected to meet officials from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and top state-backed customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precise agenda for the meetings couldn't be ascertained immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM doesn't talk about or confirm our executives' travel plans," said New York-based company spokesman Edward Barbini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though IBM books only about 5 percent of its sales in China, it has been operating there for 30 years, tapping into the country's rise as an economic power. China sales fell more than 20 percent over the second half of last year, dragging down the company's emerging markets business overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an unwelcome distraction for the Armonk, N.Y.-based firm as it continues to embrace higher-margin software and technology services while moving away from hardware. Last month, IBM agreed to sell its low-end server business to Lenovo Group Ltd. (0992.HK), the Chinese firm that acquired IBM's ThinkPad business nearly a decade earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $2.3 billion deal was struck at about one-half the reported asking price a year earlier, after the low-margin server business posted seven quarters of losses as clients moved to cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECOND VISIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rometty is the second top IBM executive to travel to Beijing in the last four months to meet Chinese officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, IBM dispatched its head of governmental programs, Christopher Padilla, the former Under Secretary for International Trade at the U.S. Commerce Department, following announcement of the company's third-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Padilla met with Wang Chao, China's Vice Minister for Commerce, along with officials from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, according to people familiar with his visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rometty, in her meetings, is expected to emphasize the tech giant's commitment to local partnerships, future cooperation, and information security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of Snowden's revelations, U.S. technology companies, including IBM, "face an uphill battle proving their equipment is not compromised", A.M. Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research wrote last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. cloud computing industry alone may lose as much as $35 billion in worldwide sales over the next three years, according to estimates by the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit think-tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension &amp; Relief Fund sued IBM at U.S. District Court in Manhattan, accusing the firm of concealing how the U.S. spying scandal would reduce its China business. IBM had lobbied Congress to pass legislation allowing it to share personal data of customers in China and elsewhere with the NSA, the lawsuit claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These allegations are ludicrous and irresponsible and IBM will vigorously defend itself in court," IBM spokesman Doug Shelton said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, IBM is uncharacteristically reliant on hardware sales, primarily to state-owned enterprises. While sales of mainframe computers, servers, and storage account for about 15 percent of IBM's worldwide revenue, in China hardware comprises 40 percent of local revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is going through a very significant economic set of reform," IBM's chief financial official Martin Schroeter told analysts on the company's earnings call last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While there is more clarity on the overall plan, we continue to believe that it will take some time for our business in China to improve," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Matthew Miller; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)&lt;/p&gt;

to run tubing, which is often done prior to bringing wells into
production," Robertson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no drilling or hydraulic fracturing at the time,
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robertson said the company did not immediately know the
cause of the explosion. Wild Well Control, an organization
trained specifically to deal with natural gas explosions, was on
site, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron's primary concern at this point is to contain the
fire and ensure the safety of its employees, contractors and the
surrounding community," Robertson said.&lt;/p&gt;

			ExxonMobil Announces First Production From Damar Gas Development
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Field peak capacity forecasted at 200 million cubic feet of gas per day
      
			
        Onshore fabrication completed in less than a year
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced the start of natural 
      gas production at the Damar field off the east coast of Peninsular 
      Malaysia. ExxonMobil subsidiary, ExxonMobil Exploration and Production 
      Malaysia Inc., has a 50 percent interest in the project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Damar field has a projected capacity of 200 million cubic feet of 
      gas per day. ExxonMobil and joint-venture partner Petronas Carigali Sdn. 
      Bhd. have planned a total of 16 development wells for the platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Damar will help meet increasing natural gas demand in Malaysia,&#8221; said 
      Neil W. Duffin, president of ExxonMobil Development Company. &#8220;It also 
      represents one of several projects that will add to ExxonMobil&#8217;s global 
      production in the coming years as we remain focused on delivering 
      profitable volumes over the long term.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Damar was developed under a gas production sharing contract between 
      ExxonMobil, Petronas Carigali and Petronas. ExxonMobil is the operator 
      of the Damar field and Petronas Carigali holds a 50 percent interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Damar startup follows the previously announced Telok gas development 
      in Malaysia, which began production in March 2013. The projects provide 
      additional gas supplies to help meet Malaysia's power and industrial 
      needs and promote growth of the country&#8217;s natural gas industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      this release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, 
      including production rates, ultimate recoveries, and project plans and 
      schedules, could differ materially due to changes in market conditions 
      affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term oil and gas price 
      levels; political or regulatory developments; reservoir performance; 
      timely completion of development projects; technical or operating

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2001-CIBC2; Maintains Negative Outlooks
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC), commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates, series 2001-CIBC2. A detailed list of rating actions 
      follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are primarily due to sufficient credit enhancement and 
      the continued principal paydown since Fitch's last rating action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 29.9% of the remaining pool; expected losses of 
      the original pool are at 5.7%, including losses already incurred to date 
      (4.2%). Collin Creek Mall, the largest loan in the pool (77.8%), remains 
      the largest loss contributor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the January 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced approximately 94.8% to $77.2 million from 
      $1.149 billion at issuance. Currently, there are only eight loans 
      remaining in the pool, two of which (3.6%) are defeased. There are no 
      loans in special servicing. Interest shortfalls are affecting classes G 
      through NR with cumulative unpaid interest totaling $2.7 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Negative Outlooks reflect Fitch's concern over the concentration of 
      the remaining pool and the risk of interest shortfalls should the 
      largest loan transfer to special servicing. Classes C and D, both rated 
      'AAAsf', could be downgraded if shortfalls were to reach these classes. 
      According to Fitch's criteria, ratings at 'AAAsf' and 'AAsf' should not 
      incur interest shortfalls. Please see the following report 'Criteria for 
      Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance' for more 
      information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest loan in the pool is the Collin Creek Mall (77.8%), which is 
      secured by the non-anchor spaces (332,055 sf) of a 1.1 million square 
      foot regional mall in Plano, TX. The shadow anchors include Amazing 
      Jake, Macy's, JC Penney, and Sears, all of which are under long-term 
      leases. Dillards, a former shadow anchor, vacated in January 2014 after 
      its lease expiration. The borrower is working to re-tenant the space. 
      Property performance has deteriorated since year-end (YE) 2009, 
      primarily due to a decrease in rents and an increase in operating 
      expenses. The servicer-reported YE 2012 and trailing 12 month (TTM) 
      first quarter (1Q) 2013 debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 0.87x and 
      0.91x, respectively, compared to 0.97x at YE 2012, 1.1x at YE 2010, 
      1.64x at YE 2009 and 1.75x at issuance. The property has experienced 
      strong market competition from newer retail centers nearby. As of Sept. 
      30, 2013, the in-line space was 94% leased and 90% occupied, compared to 
      98% occupied at issuance. The loan remains current on debt service. The 
      pool faces a high level of binary risk given this loan's size relative 
      to the remaining trust. Losses are modeled in Fitch's stressed analysis; 
      however, if the loan has difficulty refinancing, the loss severity could 
      exceed current expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.1 million class C at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$14.4 million class D at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$28.9 million class E at 'Bsf'; Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$12 million class F at 'CCCsf'; RE45%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$16.8 million class G at 'Dsf'; RE0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Classes A-1 through B have paid in full. Classes H, J, K, L and M have 
      been depleted due to losses and remains at 'Dsf/RE0%'. Fitch does not 
      rate NR class certificates. Fitch has previously withdrawn the ratings 
      on the Interest-only class X-1 and X-2.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners has hired JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) to explore a sale of logistics provider Jacobson Companies Inc, hoping to fetch as much as $700 million, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An auction for Jacobson is expected to start in the next few weeks, the people said this week. The company has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of around $75 million, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources asked not to be identified because the process is confidential. Oak Hill Capital declined to comment while Jacobson and JPMorgan representatives did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobson is the fourth largest provider of warehousing and third-party logistics services in the United States, according to its website.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 13 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Oak Hill Capital
Partners has hired JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to explore a sale
of logistics provider Jacobson Companies Inc, hoping to fetch as
much as $700 million, according to people familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An auction for Jacobson is expected to start in the next few
weeks, the people said this week. The company has annual
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of
around $75 million, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources asked not to be identified because the process
is confidential. Oak Hill Capital declined to comment while
Jacobson and JPMorgan representatives did not respond to
requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobson is the fourth largest provider of warehousing and
third-party logistics services in the United States, according
to its website. It has more than 32 million square feet of
warehouse space and over 6,000 employees at 141 locations, and

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has picked up more popular support and remains best placed to lead a coalition government after a national election due by May, an opinion poll showed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling Congress will slump to its weakest showing in parliament since independence in 1947, the Times Now-CVoter poll forecast, presenting a challenge to Rahul Gandhi, who is leading the party in its toughest election battle yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 700 million people are eligible to vote in the world's largest democratic exercise to choose a new government. India, Asia's third largest economy, is growing at its slowest pace in a decade, choking off employment opportunities for tens of hundreds of youth who join the workforce each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies led by Narendra Modi will win 227 seats of the 543 at stake in the lower house of parliament, the poll said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rule a party requires the support of 272 lawmakers, and the BJP will have to cast around for support among regional groups who are also expected to do well in the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey conducted in October by the same polling agency soon after the aggressive Modi was named the party's prime ministerial candidate put his party's support at 186 seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest poll was conducted in a sample of just over 14,000 voters across 28 states between January 15 to February 8. Indian opinion polls have had a mixed record in the past, given the country's huge and diverse electorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi, a three-time chief minister of booming Gujarat state, has steadily pulled ahead, promising to revive the economy, cut red tape and fight corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday he received U.S. ambassador Nancy Powell at his home in the state capital Gandhinagar, the highest-level meeting since the U.S. State Department revoked his visa in 2005 over religious violence in Gujarat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rights groups and political rivals accuse Modi of failing to protect minority Muslims in the violence that gripped the state after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was set on fire. Modi has denied any wrongdoing and a Supreme Court panel absolved him of any responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congress may end up with just 89 seats out of the 543 seats, the poll said, losing ground to the BJP in the big heartland states of northern but also southern India where its move to carve up another province has led to a revolt in the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its leader Gandhi, the fourth generation member of the long-ruling Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, has struggled to draw support for the ruling party mired by corruption scandals and paralysis. He has himself seemed distant at times, unsure of how to stop the slide in the 129-year-old party's fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An anti-graft party that took Delhi by storm, winning power in a local election in December, will win seven seats in the national election, the survey said, far less than what its supporters are aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since taking power in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi, or the Common Man's, Party has faced criticism for pursuing street activism even after coming into government and of making promises it is struggling to keep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)&lt;/p&gt;

			J.P. Morgan Announces
			New Senior Leadership in Germany, 
      Austria and Switzerland
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan today announced changes to strengthen and reshape its 
      leadership team across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Martin Wiesmann will become the Senior Country Officer (SCO) of 
      Germany with responsibility for all operations across all lines of 
      business in the country, effective immediately. With more than 20 years 
      of experience in the banking industry, Wiesmann has worked on a large 
      number of MA and capital market transactions in the transport, 
      industrials and financial institutions sectors, and has gained broad 
      expertise in the area of privatization. Wiesmann has been head of 
      Investment Banking in Germany and Austria since August 2012. Prior to 
      joining J.P. Morgan in 2007, he worked for 12 years in the Investment 
      Banking division of Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pascal Ravery will become Chairman of the Swiss Management 
      Committee in addition to his current role as a Vice Chairman of European 
      Investment Banking. Ravery joined J.P. Morgan in 1992 and has held 
      leadership positions in MA and in France, as well as managing 
      pan-European coverage of large clients on some of their most 
      transformative deals. He became Vice Chairman of European Investment 
      Banking in 2007. Ravery will remain a senior figure across businesses in 
      Switzerland as the firm continues to build this franchise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Nick Bossart,
			a member of the Swiss Management Committee 
      and head of Investment Banking in Switzerland, will succeed Pascal as 
      SCO of Switzerland, effective immediately. Prior to joining J.P. Morgan 
      in 2012, Bossart worked for Deutsche Bank for 12 years in London and 
      Zurich in areas including Swiss Corporate Finance, Global Banking, and 
      Investment Banking Coverage  Advisory. The operations of the firm&#8217;s 
      Private Bank subsidiary in Geneva will continue to remain separately 
      accountable, given its position as an EMEA hub for the global Private 
      Bank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Anton Ulmer will join J.P. Morgan as the SCO of Austria, 
      effective April 1. Ulmer joins from Morgan Stanley, where he led the 
      Investment Banking business in Austria since 2007. He previously worked 
      for five years at J.P. Morgan in MA before becoming head of Corporate 
      Development and a member of the Management Committee at Wienerberger in 
      Vienna. He has also worked in the Investment Banking division of 
      Deutsche Bank. During the last 17 years, Anton has worked on a large 
      number of capital markets and MA transactions across a wide range of 
      industries and has been an adviser on some of the highest profile deals 
      in Austria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These moves will reinvigorate our leadership team across key markets in 
      Europe,&#8221; said Viswas Raghavan, head of Banking in Europe, the Middle 
      East and Africa (EMEA). &#8220;We are privileged at J.P. Morgan to be able to 
      count on an outstanding bench of senior leaders who each bring extensive 
      knowledge and leadership experience to their roles. This new team will 
      serve our clients with fresh ideas using all of J.P. Morgan&#8217;s global 
      resources, from our fortress balance sheet to the full capabilities of 
      our diverse businesses around the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Senior Country Officer role at J.P. Morgan is crucial to setting 
      the tone for our daily operations in each location. Each of these 
      appointments will help to energize our staff and strengthen our local 
      governance,&#8221; said Emilio Saracho, deputy CEO of EMEA for J.P. Morgan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Across Germany, Austria and Switzerland, J.P. Morgan has operations in 
      Asset Management, Commercial Banking, Investment Banking, Private 
      Banking, Markets and Treasury Services. The firm, which has offices in 
      Frankfurt, Geneva, Vienna (Asset Management) and Zurich, holds leading 
      positions across the entire region in each business line, and it has 
      been in the region since 1928 when Chase National Bank opened a 
      representative office in Berlin. In 1960, the firm obtained an 
      unrestricted license to offer all the banking services of a universal 
      bank throughout the Federal Republic of Germany. It opened its first 
      representative office in Geneva in 1964.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;IBM Standardizing on EPUB to Reduce Digital Barriers and Increase Mobile Support&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, WA--(Marketwired - Feb 13, 2014) -  International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a collaboration to develop a white paper highlighting lessons learned from IBM's recent decision to support EPUB as the company's primary packaged portable document format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPUB is the widely adopted open standard format, for digital publications, developed by IDPF, based on HTML5 and other technologies from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), as well as technologies from IDPF. IDPF is a trade and standards association with over 300 members in over 45 countries.&#160;Increased client demand for mobile solutions, accessibility through the cloud, and the transformational opportunities both pose for enterprise content are the key drivers for IBM's move to the next-generation portable document format. By standardizing on EPUB, IBM is also extending its leadership in accessibility and delivering a richer user experience and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We applaud IBM's innovation in adopting EPUB across the spectrum of enterprise content and in its education solutions, to create a better reading experience for its content across devices and the spectrum of individual needs," said Bill McCoy, Executive Director, IDPF. "We look forward to collaborating to showcase lessons learned by a global IT leader in order to help other enterprises and content publishers move digital publishing onto the Open Web Platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also recently joined IDPF as well as the Readium Foundation, a consortium formed last year to develop open source tools libraries to accelerate adoption of the latest IDPF standards and bootstrap the development of compatible reading solutions. Over 40 industry leaders, including IBM, are contributing funds, people, and technology to advance the Readium effort.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the fourth quarter focused on the consumer sector, with investment plays ranging from high-end auction house Sotheby's to big retailers Target Corp and Walgreen Co&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Motors also became the flavor of the quarter with many hedge funds as the U.S. government exited its position. This year, however, the stock price has fallen nearly 14 percent, making for a rough start for new Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Friday, the automaker's stock rose 75 cents, or 2.13 percent, to $35.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soros Fund Management LLC, founded by billionaire investor George Soros, purchased new stakes in banking giants J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup in the fourth quarter. Soros also boosted holdings in GM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings don't disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there's also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don't always present a complete picture of a manager's stock holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP MORGAN CHASE, CITIGROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soros's fund owned about 2.8 million shares of JP Morgan as of December 31, and 2.3 million shares of Citi. Soros held no shares in either bank at the end of the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOTHEBY'S&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist investor Marcato Capital Management, run by Mick McGuire, boosted the firm's holdings of Sotheby's by 35 percent, having bought an additional 1,200,000 shares in the auction house to now own 4,562,991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management also is a huge fan of Sotheby's, buying an additional 265,000 shares, bringing the firm's stake to 2.2 million shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FACEBOOK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiger Consumer Management got back into Facebook after exiting it in the third quarter. The filing shows the fund owned 1,384,507 shares of the social media powerhouse at the end of the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors bought an additional 13.9 million class A shares, bringing its stake to 18.3 million class A shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scout Capital Management closed out of its position, selling 3 million shares. Scout Capital may be going on a junk food diet, as it liquidated its entire position in Whole Foods and Starbucks but added 3.9 million shares in Yum! Brands Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund's owners said last month that they are splitting up and shutting down the $6.7 billion fund after 13 years. Returns were strong at 21 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GENERAL MOTORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle Bass's Hayman Capital announced in early December that he established a position and that the 4,606,005 million shares he owned made up nearly one quarter of his portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridger Capital trimmed its holdings in General Motors Co by selling 155,000 shares, but the fund still owns 1,695,000 shares, which ranks the stock as the fund's fourth largest position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bronson Point Management, founded by former managers at SAC and Pequot, added to its holding of GM by buying another 400,000 shares, increasing its stake by 34 percent. And Cooperman's Omega added a new position, buying 1.04 million shares of the automaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leon Cooperman's Omega added a new position, buying 1.04 million shares, and Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management opened a new stake of 2.74 mln shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soros Fund Management held more than 4.9 million shares of GM and more than 1.4 million call options, the filing showed, up from around 1.28 million shares and more than 350,000 call options on September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NETFLIX INC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue Ridge sold all of its Netflix stake, liquidating 349,000 shares of the American provider of on-demand Internet streaming media, while billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn cut his stake by 2.9 million shares, bringing his exposure to 2.7 million shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan's Tiger Global Management bought an additional 223,000 shares, bringing their stake to 663,000 shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TARGET CORP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlson Capital took a new position in Target, buying 1.4 million shares only weeks before the retailer made headlines after becoming the victim of computer hackers who stole millions of credit card records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WALGREEN CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viking Global Investors opened a new stake of 11.6 million shares.

It owned 2,432,00 shares at the end of the quarter, making it the firm's biggest position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, a proposed all-stock deal in which Comcast Corp would take over Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIRIUS XM HOLDINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viking Global Investors opened a new stake of 15.1 million shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aaron Cowen's Suvretta Capital opened a new position, buying 322,000 shares to make it his fund's third biggest positions, while Omega Advisors added 209,630 shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adage sold 607,400 shares of the scientific instrument maker, cutting its stake by 43 percent to own 800,505 shares at the end of the quarter.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A flaw in recent versions of Internet Explorer was used to attack visitors to a website for U.S. military veterans, and also appears to have been used earlier against French aerospace industry employees, researchers said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw in Microsoft Corp's IE 10 Web browser was reported on Thursday, days after it was used inside the Web page of nonprofit U.S. group Veterans of Foreign Wars. The VFW said Friday that an unspecified federal law enforcement agency is investigating and that the malicious code on its site had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security firm Websense Inc said it found similar attack code on a page set up on January 20 with a Web address nearly identical to one used by a French aerospace association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests the attacks using the flaw have been going on for at least three weeks, but might have succeeded earlier against higher-value targets and escaped discovery, said Websense Director of Security Research Alexander Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FireEye Inc, which discovered the VFW attack, said it appeared connected to previous attacks against the Japanese financial sector, security firm Bit9 and others that Symantec Corp security researchers attributed to a large and well-organized group in China. (here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest attacks are considered to be sophisticated as they rely on a previously unknown flaw of a sort that can cost $50,000 or more when sold by shadowy brokers to government agencies or contractors. The industry calls these flaws "zero-day vulnerabilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also seem part of a multistage operation, with the attackers seeking to break into the computers of U.S. veterans or French defense contractors in the future. Once there, they could look for military plans or designs or passwords that would enable them to impersonate the individuals electronically. Assuming those victims' identities in emails sent to more prominent targets would make it more likely that the recipients would click on baited links or unwitting install more spying software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the initial report in the new campaign mentioned only IE 10, Microsoft said it had determined that IE 9 is also vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recommend customers upgrade to Internet Explorer 11 for added protection," said Adrienne Hall, general manager of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the use of the unknown flaw, Websense's Watson said the attacks were not that hard to spot. For one thing, a program that exploited the flaw was submitted on January 20 to Virus Total, a free Google Inc service that shows whether any major antivirus provider would block the sample. In this case, none did. In addition, the programming language operated in the open, without complicated obfuscation that can deter analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson said that was why he felt the attacks could prove to be by a new group, or even two different new groups. As an example, the exploit code might have been written elsewhere, and used with more success, then passed along to a new group with less expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French page that was imitated is GIFAS, which claims more than 300 members, including contractors making satellites, missiles and other arms, as well as helicopters, military planes and engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links to the fake page might have been sent via email to industry officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the VFW's case, the hackers broke into the real Web page and inserted code shown to visitors that would lead to infection if they were using the right version of IE. FireEye said hundreds or thousands of infections occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VFW spokeswoman Randi K. Law said the nonprofit group was working with law enforcement and private security incident responders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this point, there is no indication that any member or donor data was compromised," she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether that statement referred to the computers of website visitors or merely data stored by the VFW itself, and she did not respond to follow-up questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI did not return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph Menn.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Jennifer Ablan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 14 (Reuters) - Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the
fourth quarter focused on the consumer sector, with investment
plays ranging from high-end auction house Sotheby's to
big retailers Target Corp and Walgreen Co&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Motors also became the flavor of the quarter
with many hedge funds as the U.S. government exited its
position. This year, however, the stock price has fallen nearly
14 percent, making for a rough start for new Chief Executive
Officer Mary Barra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Friday, the automaker's stock rose 75 cents, or 2.13
percent, to $35.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soros Fund Management LLC, founded by billionaire investor
George Soros, purchased new stakes in banking giants J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup in the fourth quarter.
Soros also boosted holdings in GM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what
are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine
a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy

sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the
public filings don't always present a complete picture of a
manager's stock holdings.

Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund
managers either took new positions or exited from in the fourth
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP MORGAN CHASE, CITIGROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soros's fund owned about 2.8 million shares of JP Morgan as
of December 31, and 2.3 million shares of Citi. Soros held no
shares in either bank at the end of the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOTHEBY'S&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist investor Marcato Capital Management, run by Mick
McGuire, boosted the firm's holdings of Sotheby's by 35 percent,
having bought an additional 1,200,000 shares in the auction
house to now own 4,562,991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management also is a huge
fan of Sotheby's, buying an additional 265,000 shares, bringing
the firm's stake to 2.2 million shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FACEBOOK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiger Consumer Management got back into Facebook after
exiting it in the third quarter. The filing shows the fund owned
1,384,507 shares of the social media powerhouse at the end of
the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors bought an
additional 13.9 million class A shares, bringing its stake to
18.3 million class A shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scout Capital Management closed out of its position, selling
3 million shares. Scout Capital may be going on a junk food
diet, as it liquidated its entire position in Whole Foods
 and Starbucks but added 3.9 million shares in
Yum! Brands Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund's owners said last month that they are splitting up
and shutting down the $6.7 billion fund after 13 years. Returns
were strong at 21 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GENERAL MOTORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle Bass's Hayman Capital announced in early December that
he established a position and that the 4,606,005 million shares
he owned made up nearly one quarter of his portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridger Capital trimmed its holdings in General Motors Co by
selling 155,000 shares, but the fund still owns 1,695,000
shares, which ranks the stock as the fund's fourth largest
position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bronson Point Management, founded by former managers at SAC
and Pequot, added to its holding of GM by buying another 400,000
shares, increasing its stake by 34 percent. And Cooperman's
Omega added a new position, buying 1.04 million shares of the
automaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leon Cooperman's Omega added a new position, buying 1.04
million shares, and Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management
opened a new stake of 2.74 mln shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soros Fund Management held more than 4.9 million shares of
GM and more than 1.4 million call options, the filing showed, up
from around 1.28 million shares and more than 350,000 call
options on September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NETFLIX INC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue Ridge sold all of its Netflix stake, liquidating
349,000 shares of the American provider of on-demand Internet
streaming media, while billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn
cut his stake by 2.9 million shares, bringing his exposure to
2.7 million shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan's Tiger Global Management
bought an additional 223,000 shares, bringing their stake to
663,000 shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TARGET CORP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlson Capital took a new position in Target, buying 1.4

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Feb 14 (Reuters) - The European Union's antitrust
regulator will accept Visa Europe's offer to cap its credit card
fees for retailers, two people familiar with the matter said, as
the EU strives to cut the cost of paying with plastic and boost
online commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission says such fees for using credit and
debit cards cost businesses across Europe 10 billion euros
($13.7 billion) a year. The charges are an important money
spinner for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe, Europe's largest card payments company which is
owned and operated by more than 3,000 European financial
institutions, proposed last year cutting the charges levied on
retailers to 0.3 percent of the value of each transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reduction ranges from 40 to 60 percent depending on the
types of cards used by the consumer and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer came after the European Commission told the
European licensee of Visa Inc that such fees were
anti-competitive and resulted in higher consumer prices, putting
it at risk of a hefty fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission is expected to accept Visa Europe's
commitments. A decision is imminent," said one of the people on
Friday, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission spokesman for competition policy, Antoine
Colombani, and Visa Europe declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lobbying group EuroCommerce, whose 1997 complaint triggered
an antitrust investigation into MasterCard, said regulators
should have been tougher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of retail, yes, it is better because fees are
lower for retailers, prices could be lower for consumers, but
the fees could be lower," said EuroCommerce adviser Ruth
Milligan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EuroCommerce members include French supermarket chain
Carrefour, Swedish retailer Ikea and
Britain's Tesco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU competition authority said last year that Visa
Europe's proposal covered cross-border fees in Europe and
domestic charges in 10 EU countries including Italy, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Ireland and Hungary, and was valid for four
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe agreed to reduce its debit card charges to 0.2
percent in 2010 to end a separate antitrust investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, Europe's second-largest card payments
company, capped its debit and credit card fees at 0.2 percent
and 0.3 percent respectively in 2009 after coming under
regulatory fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission last year unveiled draft rules to limit card
fees on retailers, which need approval from the European
Parliament and EU countries before becoming law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			General rate case filing seeks inclusion of two new power plants 
      in customer prices, effective 2015
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR)
			today reported net 
      income of $105 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, for the year ended 
      Dec.&#160;31, 2013. This compares with $141 million, or $1.87 per diluted 
      share, for 2012. Net income was $47 million, or 59 cents per diluted 
      share, for the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with $28 million, or 38 
      cents per diluted share, for the comparable period of 2012. The decrease 
      in annual net income was largely due to the write-off of the Cascade 
      Crossing Transmission Project and a customer billing refund in the 
      second quarter of 2013 (49 cents per share) and incremental replacement 
      power costs due to plant outages in the second half of 2013 (13 cents 
      per share).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In 2013, we completed two RFP processes, which resulted in the 
      selection of three new long-term generation resources that will deliver 
      value to our customers, and achieved a fair outcome in the 2014 general 
      rate case,&#8221; said Jim Piro, president and chief executive officer. &#8220;In 
      2014, we are focused on constructing the three new generation resources 
      on time and on budget and continually emphasizing operational 
      excellence.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Generation projects
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Construction is underway on all three generation projects selected last 
      year through the competitive RFP processes and each of these projects 
      continue to be on time and on budget. The majority of engines and 
      generators are now on site for Port Westward Unit 2, a 220 megawatt 
      natural gas-fired capacity resource. This plant is needed to help PGE 
      integrate the variable output from wind and solar facilities and meet 
      customer demand for power during peak events such as heat waves or cold 
      fronts. Foundations are being poured and roads are being built at 
      Tucannon River Wind Farm, a 267 megawatt wind farm in Southeastern 
      Washington that will help PGE increase the amount of renewable power in 
      its system and meet state renewable power standards. Construction on 
      Carty Generating Station, a highly-efficient 440 megawatt natural 
      gas-fired baseload plant, began in early January with ground clearing 
      and site development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			General rate case filing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With Tucannon River and Port Westward Unit 2 expected to begin serving 
      customers in the first half of 2015, PGE has initiated a comprehensive 
      10-month review and approval process with the Oregon Public Utility 
      Commission in order to include these resources in prices when the plants 
      go online. Late yesterday, PGE filed a general rate case with a 2015 
      test year requesting an overall customer price increase of 4.6 percent 
      effective early 2015. The rate case requests recovery of incremental 
      costs to bring these two new plants into service and to provide safe, 
      reliable and sustainable power to customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The request is based on a return on equity of 10 percent, a capital 
      structure of 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, and an average rate 
      base of $3.9 billion. The specific impact on individual customers&#8217; bills 
      will vary depending on usage and customer class. If the OPUC approves 
      PGE&#8217;s request as submitted, a typical residential customer using a 
      monthly average of 840 kilowatt-hours of power would see their bill 
      increase by about 5 dollars per month.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE expects the Commission to issue a final order with approved price 
      changes before the end of 2014, with new customer prices expected to be 
      effective in three stages. A price reduction for base business costs, 
      resulting from amortization of several customer credits, is expected to 
      be effective on Jan. 1, 2015, and price increases related to each of the 
      two new generation facilities are expected to be effective when each 
      facility is providing service to customers in the first half of 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fourth quarter operating results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues increased $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 
      compared with the fourth quarter of 2012, which was driven by a 6 
      percent increase in energy deliveries resulting from cooler weather. 
      During the fourth quarter of 2013, heating degree-days (an indicator of 
      the extent to which customers are likely to have used electricity for 
      heating) were 26 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. 
      Residential energy deliveries increased 12 percent and commercial and 
      industrial deliveries combined increased 2 percent. Adjusting for the 
      effects of weather, total retail deliveries in the fourth quarter of 
      2013 were comparable to the fourth quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Purchased power and fuel expense increased $26 million in the fourth 
      quarter of 2013 compared with the fourth quarter of 2012, with $16 
      million related to an 8 percent increase in average variable power cost 
      per MWh and $9 million related to a 5 percent increase in total system 
      load. The increase in the average variable power cost per MWh was driven 
      by the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Less favorable regional hydro conditions in the fourth quarter of 2013 
        compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 contributing to an increase 
        in the price per MWh of purchased power;
      
			
        An 11 percent decrease in energy received from PGE owned and 
        contracted hydroelectric projects, which was replaced with purchased 
        power; and
      
			
        Unplanned thermal plant outages. During the fourth quarter of 2013, 
        the company&#8217;s Coyote Springs natural gas-fired generating plant was 
        offline until November 30, 2013 and Colstrip Unit 4 coal-fired 
        generating facility was offline until January 23, 2014. As a result, 
        the company replaced such power with purchased power, incurring $6 
        million of incremental replacement power costs.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net variable power costs, which consists of purchased power and fuel 
      expense net of wholesale revenues and is used in the company&#8217;s power 
      cost adjustment mechanism, increased $16 million in the fourth quarter 
      of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase is largely 
      due to the increase in the average variable power cost per MWh partially 
      offset by a higher average price per MWh for wholesale sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total production, distribution, administrative and other expenses 
      (operating and maintenance expenses) were $117 million in the fourth 
      quarter of 2013 compared with $114 million in the fourth quarter of 
      2012. The $3 million increase was largely due to higher benefits expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Income taxes decreased $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 
      compared with the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to an adjustment 
      to increase the Company&#8217;s net deferred income tax liability in 2012, 
      which was driven by an increase in PGE&#8217;s composite state tax rate, and 
      changes related to production tax credits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2013 annual operating results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues increased $5 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily 
      due to the net effect of the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A $20 million increase resulting from higher volumes of energy 
        deliveries driven by more extreme weather in 2013 compared to 2012. 
        Residential energy deliveries were up 3 percent in 2013, while 
        commercial and industrial deliveries combined were comparable to 2012. 
        Adjusting for the effects of weather, total retail deliveries were 
        comparable to prior year; and
      
			
        A $5 million increase related to the sale of natural gas and oil not 
        needed for operations;
      
			
        A $31 million increase in wholesale revenues consisting of a 55 
        percent increase in average price of wholesale power, combined with a 
        5 percent increase in the volume sold; partially offset by
      
			
        A $38 million decrease as a result of lower average retail prices due 
        to lower expected power costs as established in the annual update 
        tariff for power costs and a larger portion of energy deliveries going 
        to customers who purchase their energy from electricity service 
        suppliers;
      
			
        A $9 million decrease related to an industrial customer refund 
        recorded in the second quarter of 2013 for a billing error covering a 
        period of several years; and
      
			
        A $4 million decrease related to the company&#8217;s power cost adjustment 
        mechanism, as the estimated refund to customers related to the 2011 
        PCAM was reduced in 2012, with no estimated refund to or collection 
        from customers recorded in 2013.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Purchased power and fuel expense increased $31 million in 2013 compared 
      with 2012, largely due to a 4 percent increase in average variable power 
      cost per MWh. This increase was due to the combination of the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Less favorable regional hydro conditions in 2013 compared with 2012 
        contributing to an increase in the price per MWh of purchased power;
      
			
        An 11 percent decrease in the energy received from PGE owned and 
        contracted hydroelectric projects, which was replaced with thermal 
        generation and purchased power.
      
			
        Unplanned thermal plant outages at three of its generating facilities 
        during the second half of 2013. As a result, the company replaced such 
        power with purchased power, incurring $17 million of incremental 
        replacement power costs.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net variable power costs for 2013 were comparable to 2012. A 55 percent 
      increase in the average price per MWh of wholesale sales, was offset by 
      the increase in the average variable power cost per MWh.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total production, distribution, administrative and other expenses 
      (operating and maintenance expenses) were $444 million in 2013 compared 
      with $427 million in 2012. The $17 million increase is primarily due to 
      higher repair and maintenance costs for the company&#8217;s generating plants 
      and distribution system, as well as higher pension costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cascade Crossing transmission project consists of $52 million of costs 
      charged to expense in the second quarter of 2013 due to the suspension 
      of permitting and development of the project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interest expense, net decreased $7 million in 2013 compared with 2012, 
      with $4 million related to the timing of the 2013 maturities and 
      issuances of long-term debt and $3 million related to an increase in the 
      allowance for borrowed funds used for construction resulting from a 
      higher average construction work-in-progress balance with the 
      commencement of the construction for three new generating facilities in 
      2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other income, net increased $10 million in 2013 compared with 2012, 
      primarily driven by an increase in the allowance for equity funds used 
      for construction from the higher average CWIP balance, as well as an 
      increase in earnings from the non-qualified benefit plan trust assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Income taxes decreased $43 million, in 2013 compared with 2012, which 
      resulted in the company&#8217;s effective tax rate decreasing to 16.8 percent 
      in 2013 compared with 31.4 percent in 2012. These decreases are 
      primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income for 2013 compared with 
      2012, which was driven by the $52 million charge to expense in 2013 
      related to Cascade Crossing, combined with other unfavorable impacts to 
      2013 pre-tax income. Also contributing to the decreases was an increase 
      to deferred tax balances in 2012 for a change in the blended statutory 
      income tax rate and an increase in production tax credits in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Adjusted operating earnings per share
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Excluding the impacts of the Cascade Crossing charge and the customer 
      billing matter, PGE&#8217;s adjusted operating earnings for 2013 would be 
      $1.84 per share, as shown below:

      PGE believes this non-GAAP adjusted earnings reconciliation is useful to 
      investors, analysts, rating agencies and other parties, as it 
      facilitates the analysis of our results of operations from one period to

&lt;p&gt;ATHENS (Reuters) - Swiss-based Coca-Cola HBC (CCH.L) (EEEr.AT), the world's No.2 bottler of Coca-Cola (KO.N) posted a 3 percent rise in 2013 profit on Friday, the first in three years, as cost cutting more than offset soft demand for its beverages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Updates with SPC writedown details, share reaction)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australian soft drink bottler
Coca-Cola Amatil posted an 83 percent fall in full-year
profit on Tuesday, its worst result for 20 years as earnings
were hit by a writedown at its struggling SPC Ardmona fruit
cannery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA, which has also been hurt by a price war with
Suntory-owned Schweppes, said it will launch a review
of its operating cost structure amid concerns about weak
consumer confidence and spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the company fell 5.5 percent in early trading to
A$11.20, touching a two-and-a-half year low. The stock is down
about 20 percent over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA's net profit fell to A$79.9 million ($72.1 million) from
A$457.8 million a year ago, as it wrote off SPC Ardmona assets
by A$404 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Victorian state government stepped in last week with a
A$22 million subsidy to help bailout out the cannery and
preserve jobs after the federal government rejected pleas from
CCA for a A$25 million grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA said the writedown reflected the write-off of A$277
million in remaining goodwill, a A$39.7 million writedown in the
value of brand names and a A$87.3 million charge covering
writedowns in inventory, property, plant and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottler and distributor bought SPC for around A$700
million in 2005 and has since invested a further A$170 million
on plant, equipment and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA Managing Director Terry Davis said the poor 2013 results
reflected, in part, difficult trading conditions for the
company's Australian beverage business and competition for SPC
from imported private label products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA's Australian beverage business accounts for around 70
percent of its overall earnings, but the company is making a big
push into Indonesia, whose population of 250 million people is
around 10 times the size of the Australian market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA said it expects to deliver volume growth of more than 10
percent in Indonesia in 2014, in line with 2013, but noted
headwinds from a depreciation in the rupiah and high wages and
fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the medium term outlook for volume and earnings
growth in Indonesia continues to be positive, 2014 local
currency earnings growth is expected to be impacted by high cost
inflation," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 1.1080 Australian dollars)

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australia's Coca-Cola Amatil
 posted an 82.5 percent fall in full-year net profit on
Tuesday, due to writedowns and redundancy provisions in the wake
of a state government bailout of its struggling SPC Ardmona
fruit cannery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, which has also been hurt by a price war with
Suntory-owned Schweppes, reported net profit of A$79.9
million ($72.11 million), compared with A$457.8 million a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was largely due to a writedown of SPC Ardmona assets by
A$404.0 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Victorian state government stepped in last week with a
A$22 million subsidy for SPC Ardmona after the federal
government rejected pleas from CCA for a A$25 million grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares have dropped 18 percent over the past
year. They closed at A$11.85 on Monday.

			SMART 
      Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: SMT) (TSX: SMA), a leading collaboration 
      company and global provider of interactive displays for enterprise, 
      announces several new additions to the SMART 
      Room System&#8482; for Microsoft&#174; Lync&#174;. 
      Enhancements include interactive sharing that enables touch and inking 
      into any software application; integration with SMART Meeting Pro PE&#8482; 
      (Personal Edition) software and the introduction of unbound workspace, 
      as well as new display sizes and combinations to bring collaboration to 
      more work spaces. These additions further differentiate SMART in the 
      Lync Room System (LRS) category and are being unveiled for the first 
      time at the Microsoft Lync Conference 2014 which opens today in Las 
      Vegas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have seen tremendous market response to the SMART Room System for 
      Microsoft Lync and demand is growing from business users around the 
      world,&#8221; says Scott Brown, President, Enterprise for SMART Technologies. 
      &#8220;We have taken customer feedback and expanded collaborative capabilities 
      both in-room and with remote users, and introduced new sizes so there is 
      a SMART Room System for virtually every size of meeting room in an 
      organization. These additional features demonstrate our ongoing 
      commitment to Lync users and reinforce our position as the leading 
      provider in the Lync Room System category with a customer-first approach 
      ensuring meetings are intuitive, productive and collaborative.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Freedom to interactSMART is changing the way users engage 
      with and capture content in a Lync meeting. With the introduction of 
      interactive sharing, users now have the freedom to work with any content 
      directly on the display without being restricted by a mouse and 
      keyboard. The multi-touch capabilities enable natural interaction with 
      any application, letting users easily collaborate using familiar 
      programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the addition of SMART&#8217;s leading collaboration software, SMART 
      Meeting Pro PE, the collaboration experience has been extended. Users 
      are no longer restricted to only making annotations into PowerPoint or 
      the Lync whiteboard. Now notes can be made onto any software 
      application, including popular applications such as Microsoft Word&#174;, 
      Excel&#174; and PDF files and saved directly into the files in the 
      native format for future reference or editing in real time. SMART 
      Meeting Pro also includes unbound workspace, the revolutionary 
      whiteboard application that allows for panning and zooming to any level 
      of detail, regardless of the complexity of the content to promote 
      free-flowing, comprehensive collaboration sessions. This feature has 
      already proven to be a game changer for data-intensive industries and is 
      now available as part of the SMART Room System experience. No other Lync 
      Room System offers this outstanding level of collaboration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Largest range of room sizesThe SMART Room System was 
      originally announced with the largest array of interactive display 
      options with three room sizes including both 70&#8221; (177.8 cm) and 84&#8221; 
      (213.36cm) display combinations. Now, the company has added two new 
      sizes, including single and dual 55&#8221; (139.7 cm) displays, to offer even 
      more selection for enterprise customers. The range of choices 
      accommodates room sizes ranging from 50 ft2 to 300 ft2, 
      suitable for 2 to 16 participants. The additional sizes make the SMART 
      Room System the only LRS offering smaller screen sizes suitable for 
      executive offices and informal workspaces, as well as extra-large sizes 
      for formal board rooms and auditoriums.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pricing and availabilityThe custom-designed SMART Room 
      System for Microsoft Lync is shipping globally and includes one or more 
      SMART Board interactive displays, integrated components comprising a 
      codec, camera, speakers, a room control console and table-top 
      microphones. New 55&#8221; displays are expected to ship at the end of 
      February and interactive sharing; including integration with SMART 
      Meeting Pro Personal, is expected to become available in June 2014. For

			&lt;p&gt;Sales Expert Takes the Time to Review "Advocacy: Championing Ideas and Influencing Others" by John Daly&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SCOTCH PLAINS, NJ--(Marketwired - Feb 17, 2014) -  John Daly, who worked with Merck, IBM and other leading companies is recognized as an established author with over 100 scholarly articles, wrote Advocacy which was published by Yale Press in 2012. The book has an average of 5 stars from Amazon reviews which was vetted by 15 verified readers.&#160;Thomas F. La Vecchia, MBA aka the Sales Expert took the time to weigh in on his review and offer thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom's take is that this book is for anyone who is looking to get their ideas across when working in a large group.&#160;This is especially true in the corporate setting where getting credit for a position may be contingent on credit received by one previous contribution or idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In "Advocacy: Championing Ideas and Influencing Others," Daly explains in full detail how to transform ideas into practice.&#160;In the informational age it's easy to simply "borrow" ideas, but true, novel ideas are few and far between&#160;That is why John Daly's book is critical for those not only looking to express their own ideas, but also turn them into actionable items.&#160;In summary, Tom recommends this book as one of the critical ways to cultivate and execute new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Daly's book can be found on Amazon:

			ExxonMobil Awards First Commercial License for InteliRed Remote Gas 
      Detection System to Providence Photonics
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company has awarded the first commercial 
      license for its innovative InteliRed&#8482; remote gas detection system to 
      co-developer Providence Photonics, LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The InteliRed system is designed to improve process safety and 
      environmental performance at oil refineries, chemical plants, liquefied 
      natural gas (LNG) facilities and other gas processing facilities. This 
      new, state-of-the-art system employs a specially developed computer 
      algorithm to autonomously analyze infrared camera images to detect 
      escaping hydrocarbon gases. The InteliRed system provides an early 
      warning alert of hydrocarbon leaks with minimal false alarms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Providence Photonics, LLC is an affiliate of Providence Engineering 
      headquartered in Baton Rouge, La. ExxonMobil and Providence scientists 
      co-developed the InteliRed system over a four-year period culminating in 
      field tests of the system that began last year at an LNG liquefaction 
      plant in Qatar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The InteliRed system is the latest example of ExxonMobil&#8217;s continuous 
      focus on process safety and environmental protection,&#8221; said Sara N. 
      Ortwein, president of ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company. &#8220;Our 
      collaboration with the imaging experts at Providence Photonics has 
      resulted in a remote gas detection system that is very accurate and, 
      with its robust design, is capable of operating in the harsh 
      environments of many different oil and gas processing facilities around 
      the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This system automatically and relentlessly scans for hydrocarbon gas 
      leaks from process equipment and notifies operators to take action 
      before the leak can become a hazard,&#8221; said Yousheng Zeng, Providence 
      managing partner. &#8220;Our global license from ExxonMobil enables Providence 
      to bring this unique process safety technology to our customers around 
      the world.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman
Sachs has appointed two heads of investment banking in
Russia, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are new positions and show the bank's commitment to
the Russian market where investment banks as a whole have had a
modest increase in revenues over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sergei Arsenyev and Dmitri Sedov will become co-heads of
investment banking, the memo sent on Friday said. They will be
working with Paolo Zannoni and Nick Jordan, co-chief executive
officers for Goldman in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arsenyev joined Goldman in 2000 in Russia and was focused on
coverage of family offices and the government. Sedov joined in
2007 in the investment banking division and has focused on
technology, media, telecoms, infrastructure, industrials and
healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International investment banks can find Russia a tough
market, where state-controlled VTB and Sberbank
 have big market shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, VTB ranked No. 1 for investment banking with 12
percent of the fees, while Sberbank and JPMorgan tied
for second place with nearly 7 percent and Goldman was seventh
with 4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total investment banking fees in Russia earned throughout
2013 totalled $805.5 million, up 3 percent from 2012, according
to Thomson Reuters figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While equity capital markets issuance increased 8 percent
last year, debt capital markets issuance fell 4 percent and
mergers and acquisitions slumped 51 percent to its lowest annual
total since 2009 when measured by Russian targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman ranked second for Russian equity capital markets
underwriting last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is among the banks organising the stock market
listing of German retailer Metro's Russian
cash-and-carry unit, sources familiar with the transaction have
previously said. [ID nL5N0LC18Y]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan Euro Liquidity 
Fund's (the prime fund) 'AAAmmf' rating following its merger with the JPMorgan 
Euro Government Liquidity Fund (the government fund). Fitch has simultaneously 
withdrawn the government fund's 'AAAmmf' rating as it will cease to exist. Fitch 
will no longer provide ratings or analytical coverage of the government fund. 
The funds are managed by JP Morgan Asset Management (UK) Limited (JPMAM).
The assets of the government fund will merge into the prime fund on 14 February 
2014, as announced to shareholders to 16 December 2013. Fitch does not expect 
the merger to cause any material distortion to the composition of the prime fund 
given the relatively small size of the government fund (EUR700m) relative to the 
prime fund (EUR10.8bn), as of 31 January 2014. Furthermore the assets from the 
government fund are of high quality (high quality government bonds and 
repurchase agreements backed by such bonds) and will therefore have no negative 
effect on the credit, market or liquidity risk of the prime fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEY RATING DRIVERS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main drivers of the affirmation of the prime fund's rating are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--The fund's overall credit quality, liquidity and diversification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--The fund's minimal exposure to interest rate and spread risks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Maturity profile and available liquidity in line with Fitch's rating criteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--The capabilities and resources of JPMAM as investment advisor
The 'AAAmmf' rating reflects the prime fund's extremely strong capacity to 
achieve the investment objectives of preserving principal and providing 
shareholder liquidity through limiting credit, market and liquidity risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INVESTMENT ADVISOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMAM is a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM, A+/Stable/F1). 
JPM is a major global provider of custody, clearing and other securities 
services and one of the world's largest cash managers. As of 31 December 2013, 
assets under management were USD1.6trn, including USD505bn in short-term fixed 
income. Fitch views JPM and JPMAM's investment advisory capabilities, financial 
and resource commitments, operational controls, corporate governance, and 
compliance procedures as consistent with the 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the 
fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RATING SENSITIVITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality or market 
risk profiles of the fund. A material and sustained adverse deviation from Fitch 
guidelines for any key rating driver could cause the rating to be downgraded by 
Fitch. Furthermore, given the fund's primary investment focus on the financial 
sector, the rating may be sensitive to material adverse changes in the sector 
globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SURVEILLANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch receives weekly fund holdings information and other pertinent fund data 
from the fund's administrator to conduct surveillance against ratings guidelines 
and maintain its money market fund ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch continues to maintain ratings on the following sub-funds of the JPMorgan 
Liquidity Fund SICAV:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - Sterling Liquidity Fund: 'AAAmmf'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - Sterling Gilt Liquidity Fund: 'AAAmmf'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - US Dollar Liquidity Fund: 'AAAmmf'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - US Dollar Government Liquidity Fund: 'AAAmmf'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - US Dollar Treasury Liquidity Fund: 'AAAmmf'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Electric Co is suing the Internal Revenue Service for a $658 million tax refund related to a tax loss the company claimed as it exited the reinsurance market more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a civil complaint filed on Friday in U.S. District Court for Connecticut, GE said the IRS wrongly disallowed a $2.2 billion loss it claimed from the 2003 sale of a reinsurance subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint said GE, a large conglomerate that sells jet engines and financial products, is owed a $439.3 million federal income tax refund plus $219 million in interest. A court date has yet to be set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The dispute involves a good-faith difference of opinion over the tax consequences of a restructuring done more than a decade ago," GE spokesman Seth Martin said in a statement.

			EHE Announces Services to Help Manufacturers Automate their EHS 
      Programs with Microsoft SharePoint
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EHE (www.eheinc.com), 
      a leading provider of environmental and engineering consulting services, 
      has announced its EHS Automation Consulting services to help 
      manufacturers achieve greater compliance, time and cost savings by 
      automating their environmental health and safety (EHS) programs with 
      Microsoft&#174; SharePoint&#174;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;EHS programs, despite their critical role in manufacturing, are often 
      managed outside a company&#8217;s information technology network. Many EHS 
      programs, although requiring data input from many sources, and often 
      from a variety of locations, are managed using Word documents and Excel 
      spreadsheets. This is costly, time-consuming, and grossly inefficient,&#8221; 
      said Bob Foster, Director of Automation Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For many manufacturers, the solution can be found in their existing 
      Microsoft SharePoint platform &#8212; the ubiquitous web-based information 
      management platform that&#8217;s already in use for communications between 
      people and departments throughout their company,&#8221; Foster said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EHE&#8217;s EHS 
      Automation Consulting services team works with manufacturers to 
      develop SharePoint-based applications that automate the process of 
      collecting, analyzing, processing, and displaying information across the 
      organization. EHE is a leader in EHS consulting, providing EHS program 
      development, compliance, and oversight services across a wide range of 
      industries for 25 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EHE works closely with EHS managers to seamlessly automate their 
      current EHS processes using the SharePoint platform. For users, there&#8217;s 
      virtually no change in workflow as they continue to access familiar 
      Microsoft solutions. Data entry is streamlined across locations and 
      devices &#8212; from desktop to mobile devices to electronic forms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The greatest benefits of the system are reaped from the use of 
      SharePoint functionality to auto-administrate work processes to vastly 
      improve operational efficiency. Such automation can include managing 
      multi-step workflows that can eliminate many administrative hours &#8212; 
      including automatically initiating processes such as reviewing data for 
      significant patterns, sending documents and forms to responsible parties 
      for review, and ensuring that reports are properly completed in the 
      required time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Specific applications can range from the management and reporting of 
      accidents and incidents, to safety inspections, chemical inventories, 
      and training records.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Tracking the due dates and the completion of various EHS tasks is a 
      huge administrative burden in itself, and frequently consumes much of 
      the manager&#8217;s time &#8212; to the extent that beneficial program initiatives 
      often lay dormant as efforts are focused on maintaining basic 
      compliance,&#8221; noted Foster.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By leveraging the SharePoint platform, EHE provides manufacturers with 
      a single software solution to address and integrate various program 
      information and task requirements to produce a single program dashboard 
      &#8212; for centralized reporting and analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Unconventional Gas Market 2014-2018 with BP 
      plc, Chesapeake Energy Corp., Chevron Corp., ExxonMobil Corp., and Royal 
      Dutch Shell plc Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/lx8pbs/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Unconventional Gas Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Unconventional Gas market to grow at a 
      CAGR of 4.7 percent over the period 2013-2018. One of the key factors 
      contributing to this market growth is the depleting conventional gas 
      reserves. The Global Unconventional Gas market has also been witnessing 
      rapid technological advancements. However, the capital-intensive market 
      could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key vendors dominating this space are Arrow Energy Pty Ltd., BG Group 
      plc, BP plc, Chesapeake Energy Corp., Chevron Corp., Dart Energy Ltd., 
      Devon Energy Corp., ExxonMobil Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell plc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other vendors mentioned in the report are Aberdeen Drilling Management 
      Ltd., Alkane Energy, Baker Hughes Inc., BHP Billiton Group, Cathy Oil 
      and Gas Ltd., China United Coalbed Methane Corp., Constellation Energy 
      Group, Devon Energy Corp., Double Eagle Petroleum Co., Encana Corp., 
      Essar Energy Plc, Gazprom Oao, GDF Suez S.A., Halliburton Co., 
      Mitsubishi Corp., Penn Virginia Corp., Osaka Gas Co. Ltd., Sinopec Ltd, 
      Storm Cat Energy Corp., Strait Oil  Gas Ltd., Tlou Energy, Total S.A., 
      and Warren Resources Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: Over the years, 
      there has been a tremendous increase in the technological advancements 
      that have led to the increase in extraction of unconventional gas from 
      reservoirs. The technological advancements include unlocking the 
      potential of unconventional gas, managing produced water, development 
      and determination of gas, well log interpretation, and the development 
      of well simulation models. Also, the market vendors are increasing their 
      investments in RD, which in turn is reducing the time and cost for 
      horizontal drilling. Moreover, the overall volume of production, cost, 
      and risk has significantly reduced due to the rapid technological 
      advancements in the industry. Therefore, the rapid technological 
      advancements are one of the key trends that are expected to propel the 
      growth of the Global Unconventional Gas market during the forecast 
      period.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Removing admin rights mitigates 92% of critical Microsoft 
      vulnerabilities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New analysis of &#8220;Patch Tuesday&#8221; bulletins shows benefits of stripping 
      admin rights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      92% of all vulnerabilities reported by Microsoft with a critical 
      severity rating can be mitigated by removing admin rights, according to 
      new research from Avecto.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The market leading privilege management firm analyzed data from security 
      bulletins issued by Microsoft throughout 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The results also revealed that removing admin rights would mitigate 96% 
      of critical vulnerabilities affecting Windows operating systems, 91% 
      critical vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Office and 100% of 
      vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft bulletins are issued on the second Tuesday of each month, a 
      date known commonly as Patch Tuesday, and provide fixes for known 
      security issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If malware infects a user with admin rights, it can cause incredible 
      damage locally, as well as on a wider network. Additionally, employees 
      with admin rights have access to install, modify and delete software and 
      files as well as change system settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Paul Kenyon, co-founder and EVP of Avecto said: &#8220;It&#8217;s astounding just 
      how many vulnerabilities can be overcome by the removal of admin rights.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The dangers of admin rights have been well documented for some time, 
      but what&#8217;s more concerning is the number of enterprises we talk to that 
      are still not fully aware of how many admin users they have. Without 
      clear visibility and control, they are facing an unknown and 
      unquantified security threat.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Awareness of the importance of privilege management is growing, but we 
      need to get to the point where it&#8217;s a standard measure for all 
      organizations. These findings make it clear that it&#8217;s a critical element 
      of an endpoint security strategy that just cannot be ignored.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Paul concluded: &#8220;This analysis focuses purely on known vulnerabilities, 
      and cyber criminals will be quick to take advantage of bugs that are 
      unknown to vendors. Defending against these unknown threats is 
      difficult, but removing admin rights is the most effective way to do so.&#8221;

			Methodology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The research analyzed Microsite security bulletins from 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A vulnerability was classed as one that could be mitigated by removing 
      admin rights if the following sentence was found within the executive 
      summary: &#8220;users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user 
      rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with 
      administrative users rights.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Microsoft-Certified Governance Platform Records Voice Calls and Electronic Communications; Ensures Compliance With the Dodd-Frank Act, as Well as FCA and PRA Regulations in the UK&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;REDWOOD CITY, CA--(Marketwired - Feb 18, 2014) - 
				Actiance, helping organizations benefit from communications, collaboration and social networking, today announced that its flagship governance solution Vantage is now a qualified Microsoft Lync 2013 call recording application. This designation is awarded through the Microsoft Lync Independent Software Vendor (ISV) qualification program and signifies that Actiance Vantage meets industry standards for performance, reliability and interoperability with Lync Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With its qualification for Microsoft Lync, Actiance will be able to leverage the latest technology from Microsoft for the recording, storage and retrieval of communication," said Dan Benedict, Program Manager of Lync ISV Developer Programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many organizations are required to capture and retain voice conversations across channels, including those that take place across Microsoft Lync 2013. As a Microsoft-certified solution, Actiance effectively mitigates the risk of costly sanctions and fines by helping businesses capture and archive both two-way and conference calls. The Actiance platform also consolidates control, monitoring and archiving of Microsoft Lync voice calls with other types of electronic communications that organizations are required to capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When comparing solutions, the Vantage platform was the only option that had a really tight integration with the Lync product itself; it wasn't just a voice compliance product," said Jamie Wheeldon, IT Infrastructure Architect at Schroders. "It meant that we were able to capture the entire conversation on Lync, including instant messaging, from any location or handset. This, in combination with the fact that the platform was Microsoft certified, meant that Vantage was the obvious choice for our business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, regulations set forth by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) require financial services firms to record both telephone conversations and all other electronic communications related to client orders and the conclusion of transactions in the equity, bond and derivatives market. In the US, the Dodd-Frank Act requires firms that trade in commodity interest to record all oral communications if gross revenues total over $5 million. These firms include futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and retail foreign exchange dealers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike disparate point solutions, Actiance enables organizations to record voice calls according to these types of regulations as part of a unified, comprehensive governance platform that also retains records for a multitude of networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our governance platform reaches a broad range of enterprises, and its depth of capabilities and effectiveness in addressing complex requirements makes it the ideal fit for heavily-regulated industries such as financial services," said Scott Whitney, VP Product Management of Actiance. "This certification is validation that we continue to achieve the highest standards in the solutions we deliver to customers, empowering them to optimally run their businesses with confidence in their compliance and security." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Actiance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actiance&#174; is a global leader in communication, collaboration, and social media governance for the enterprise. Its governance platform is used by millions of professionals across dozens of industries. With the power of communication, collaboration, and social media at their fingertips, Actiance helps professionals everywhere to engage with customers and colleagues so they can unleash social business. The Actiance platform gives organizations the ability to ensure compliance for all their communications channels. It provides real-time content monitoring, centralized policy management, contextual capture of content, and smart archiving, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of eDiscovery and helps protect users from malware and accidental or malicious leakage of information.

        Keurig Cold&#8482; at-home beverage system.
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company today reported full-year and fourth quarter 2013 
      results. Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The 
      Coca-Cola Company said, &#8220;2013 was marked by ongoing global macroeconomic 
      challenges in many markets around the world. And while our business was 
      not immune to these pressures leading to moderated global volume growth, 
      we delivered sound financial results in line with our long-term profit 
      targets and gained global value share in total nonalcoholic 
      ready-to-drink beverages as well as global volume and value share in 
      core sparkling and still beverages for the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While we move forward in what remains an uncertain global economy, the 
      long-term fundamentals driving our business and industry have not 
      changed. A rising middle class, greater urbanization and increasing 
      personal consumption expenditures in markets around the world will 
      continue to drive greater demand for our beverages as consumers look for 
      moments of refreshment. As we work to restore momentum in our business 
      during 2014, we see many reasons to believe we can accelerate our growth 
      and achieve our 2020 Vision. We are committed to accelerating marketing 
      investments in our brands, further advancing our innovation strategies 
      and maximizing productivity and reinvestment for growth. All of us at 
      The Coca-Cola Company remain resolute in our commitment to deliver 
      results in line with our long-term growth model and 2020 Vision for 
      sustainable value and success.&#8221;

      environmental conditions across various regions impacted consumer 
      spending and overall nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverage 
      industry performance during the year, we grew global value share in 
      NARTD beverages, with volume and value share gains in core sparkling and 
      still beverages for the year, supported by the strongest portfolio of 
      brands in the industry. The Company reported solid volume growth for the 
      full year in certain developed markets, including Germany (+2%), the 
      Northwest Europe and Nordics business unit (+1%) and Japan (+1%). Our 
      China and India businesses both grew slower than in recent years amidst 
      slowing economic environments, but saw stronger performance in the 
      second half of the year due to a focus on execution and normalized 
      weather.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite global volume growth below our expectations and long-term growth 
      target, we delivered sound financial results for the full year. 
      Excluding the impact of structural changes, primarily the 
      deconsolidation of certain Company-owned bottling operations, the 
      Company delivered comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 3%, 
      capturing global price/mix of 1%. Importantly, excluding the impact of 
      structural changes, we grew comparable currency neutral operating income 
      6% for 2013. We also grew comparable currency neutral EPS 8% for the 
      year. Both of these profit growth rates are in line with our long-term 
      targets. In 2013, we returned $8.5 billion in cash to our shareowners 
      through dividends and net share repurchases. This performance 
      underscores our ability to generate sound financial results even in a 
      challenging year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide sparkling beverage volume was up 1% for the year, led by brand 
      Coca-Cola, and was even for the fourth quarter. Growth for the year was 
      broad based across our sparkling portfolio, including Fanta and Sprite, 
      enabling us to capture global core sparkling volume share for the eighth 
      consecutive year. We continued to drive innovation in our portfolio, 
      launching Coca-Cola Life, a naturally sweetened mid-calorie cola, in 
      Argentina and Chile. We grew worldwide still beverage volume 5% for the 
      full year and 6% for the fourth quarter, with growth across multiple 
      beverage categories, including juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink 
      teas, packaged water, sports drinks and energy drinks.

        Our Eurasia and Africa Group grew volume 6% in the quarter. All five 
        of the group&#8217;s business units delivered volume growth for the quarter 
        and full year, even with social unrest and challenging macroeconomic 
        environments in certain markets. During the quarter, we gained volume 
        share in NARTD beverages, with share gains in sparkling beverages, 
        juices and juice drinks and sports drinks. Sparkling beverage volume 
        grew mid single digits in the quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola, as we 
        focused on driving executional capabilities in the marketplace and 
        leveraging our marketing platforms including the Sochi Olympics and 
        &#8220;Share a Coke&#8221;.
      
			
        Reported operating income declined 11% in the quarter with comparable 
        currency neutral operating income down 2% in the quarter, reflecting 
        volume growth and positive price/mix offset by the timing of certain 
        operating expenses. Reported operating income increased 1% for the 
        full year. Comparable currency neutral operating income increased 9% 
        for the full year, driven by revenue growth across most business 
        units, partially offset by investments in our brands.

        For the quarter, our Europe Group's volume grew 1% representing a 
        sequential improvement versus the third quarter year-to-date results, 
        with our sparkling beverage volume also growing 1% in the quarter. 
        While there has been some improvement in our performance, we are still 
        seeing ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and weak consumer confidence 
        impacting consumer spending, particularly in the southern region of 
        Europe. We continue to focus on our share positions with the Europe 
        Group maintaining volume share in NARTD beverages and gaining volume 
        and value share in core sparkling beverages and sports drinks.
      
			
        The consolidation of the innocent branded juice and smoothie business 
        contributed significantly to the group&#8217;s price/mix and thus net 
        revenues in both the quarter and the year. However, it contributed 
        less meaningfully to the group&#8217;s operating income due to the higher 
        cost of goods sold associated with a finished goods business and our 
        level of investment as we continue to build and expand the business.
      
			
        Reported operating income declined 11% in the quarter, with comparable

        primarily due to cycling the impact of the timing of operating 
        expenses in the prior year quarter. For the full year, reported 
        operating income declined 3%. Comparable currency neutral operating 
        income declined 1% for the full year, reflecting the decline in volume.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Latin America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Latin America Group's volume was even in the quarter with the 
        group gaining volume share in NARTD beverages, resulting in the ninth 
        consecutive year of share gains. However, sparkling beverage volume 
        was down 3% as the category&#8217;s performance moderated primarily due to 
        ongoing economic challenges, particularly in Mexico and Brazil, while 
        we maintained volume share in sparkling beverages.
      
			
        Reported operating income decreased 2% in the quarter, with comparable 
        currency neutral operating income up 13%, reflecting favorable pricing 
        across all business units in the group coupled with volume growth in 
        the Latin Center and South Latin business units, partially offset by 
        investments in our brands. Comparable currency neutral operating 
        income increased 12% for the full year, reflecting volume growth and 
        strong pricing for the group, partially offset by continued 
        investments in the business, including investments related to the 2014 
        FIFA World CupTM.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			North America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        We gained volume and value share in NARTD beverages in the fourth 
        quarter, while our volume was down 1%. The overall NARTD industry in 
        North America continued to be impacted by a challenging external 
        environment. While our sparkling beverage volume declined 3% in the 
        quarter, we outperformed the rest of the industry in both volume and 
        value share, as we leveraged our occasion-brand-price-package-channel 
        (OBPPC) strategy to provide increased consumer choice along with 
        preferred price points. Still beverage volume grew 4% in the quarter, 
        with balanced growth and volume and value share gains across every 
        still beverage category, making this the 15th consecutive 
        quarter that our still beverage portfolio has either maintained or 
        gained both volume and value share. Powerade delivered high 
        single-digit growth in the quarter, gaining both volume and value 
        share, with growth coming from both the base business and new Powerade 
        Zero Drops.
      
			
        Fourth quarter reported operating income was even. Comparable currency 
        neutral operating income declined 12% in the quarter, reflecting 
        softer volume trends, especially in sparkling beverages, and the 
        timing of certain operating expenses. Full-year reported operating 
        income decreased 6% with comparable currency neutral operating income 
        down 3%, reflecting a challenging external environment and the impact 
        of product and package mix.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pacific
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Pacific Group's volume grew 4% in the quarter, representing a 
        sequential improvement versus the third quarter year-to-date results. 
        Growth was broad based with 8% growth in India, 5% growth in China and 
        3% growth in Japan. Sparkling beverage volume growth was up low single 
        digits in the quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola and Sprite, both up 2%. 
        Still beverage volume grew high single digits in the quarter, with 
        double-digit growth in packaged water and mid single-digit growth in 
        teas and juices and juice drinks.
      
			
        Reported operating income increased 7% in the quarter and comparable 
        currency neutral operating income increased 16% in the quarter, 
        reflecting volume growth, a shift in product and channel mix within 
        certain markets, productivity initiatives and the tight control and 
        timing of expenses. Reported operating income decreased 2% for the 
        full year while comparable currency neutral operating income increased 
        6% for the full year, reflecting volume growth and the tight control 
        of expenses.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bottling Investments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Bottling Investments Group's (BIG) volume grew 7% in the quarter 
        on a comparable basis, led by Germany, China and India, after 
        adjusting for the net impact of structural changes, primarily the 
        deconsolidation of the Philippine and Brazilian bottling operations in 
        2013. BIG volume, including the impact of structural changes, was down 
        29% in the quarter and down 17% for the full year.
      
			
        Reported operating loss in the quarter increased $43 million, 
        primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of Company-owned bottling 
        operations. Comparable currency neutral operating income decreased 60% 
        in the quarter due to the structural changes referenced above, but was 
        partially offset by improved performance in a number of our markets 
        and the benefit of an additional selling day in the quarter. Reported 
        operating income for the full year declined 18%, and comparable 
        currency neutral operating income was even for the full year, 
        reflecting an increase in revenues resulting from volume growth and 
        positive pricing in the majority of our markets, offset by the 
        deconsolidation of Company-owned bottling operations in 2013.

			FINANCIAL REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Summary of Fourth Quarter 2013 Financial 
      Performance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported net revenues declined 4%. Excluding the impact of structural 
      changes, comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 4% in the 
      quarter, reflecting an increase in concentrate sales and positive 
      price/mix. Structural changes that impacted net revenues were primarily 
      the deconsolidation of bottling operations in the Philippines and Brazil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported operating income decreased 4%, reflecting a 6% currency 
      headwind, a 4% unfavorable impact due to the structural changes 
      referenced above, as well as the effect of items impacting 
      comparability. Excluding the impact of structural changes, comparable 
      currency neutral operating income increased 6%. Items impacting 
      comparability reduced fourth quarter 2013 operating income by $278 
      million and reduced fourth quarter 2012 operating income by $300 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported EPS was $0.38 and comparable EPS was $0.46. Items impacting 
      comparability reduced fourth quarter 2013 reported EPS by a net $0.08 
      and reduced fourth quarter 2012 reported EPS by a net $0.04. Comparable 
      currency neutral EPS was up 7% for the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Summary of Full-Year 2013 Financial Performance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported net revenues declined 2%. Excluding the impact of the 
      structural changes referenced above, comparable currency neutral net 
      revenues grew 3%. We achieved 1% global price/mix for the year, with 
      positive pricing across key markets, leading to global NARTD value share 
      growth for the 26th consecutive quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported operating income decreased 5%, reflecting a 4% currency 
      headwind, a 2% unfavorable impact due to the structural changes 
      referenced above, as well as the effect of items impacting 
      comparability. Excluding the impact of structural changes, comparable 
      currency neutral operating income increased 6%, in line with our 
      long-term target, reflecting volume growth, continued investments around 
      the world in the health and strength of our brands and the efficient 
      management of operating expenses. Items impacting comparability reduced 
      2013 operating income by $1,032 million and reduced 2012 operating 
      income by $471 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported EPS was $1.90 and comparable EPS was $2.08. Items impacting 
      comparability reduced 2013 reported EPS by a net $0.18 and reduced 2012 
      reported EPS by a net $0.04. Comparable currency neutral EPS was up 8% 
      for the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full-year cash from operations was $10,542 million, down 1%, primarily 
      due to the unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates, an increase 
      in tax payments and the deconsolidation of the Brazilian and Philippine 
      bottling operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the year, our dividend payout was $5.0 billion and our net share 
      repurchases totaled $3.5 billion, at the high end of our stated outlook 
      of $3.0 to $3.5 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Effective Tax Rate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The reported effective tax rates for the quarter and full year were 
      23.3% and 24.8%, respectively. The underlying effective annual tax rate 
      on operations in 2013 was 23.0%, and we expect it to be approximately 
      the same for 2014. The variance between the reported rate and the 
      underlying rate was due to the tax effect of various items impacting 
      comparability, separately disclosed in this document in the 
      Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of 
      significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when 
      they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2014 Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bottling transactions completed in 2013 are anticipated to have an 
      unfavorable 1% structural impact on both our full-year 2014 net revenues 
      and operating income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Currency exchange rates are expected to have an unfavorable impact on 
      our reported results in 2014. Based on current spot rates, our existing 
      hedge positions, and the cycling of our prior year rates, we estimate 
      currency to be an approximate 7% headwind on our full-year operating 
      income, and an approximate 10% headwind on first quarter operating 
      income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The underlying effective annual tax rate on operations in 2014 is 
      currently expected to be approximately 23.0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2014, we are targeting net share repurchases of $2.5 to $3.0 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Productivity Initiatives
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2014, we are expanding our previously announced productivity and 
      reinvestment program to drive an incremental $1 billion in productivity 
      by 2016 that will be redirected primarily into increased media 
      investments. This commitment is incremental to the productivity and 
      reinvestment initiatives that we committed to delivering from 2012 
      through the end of 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Productivity is a core pillar of our 2020 Vision and a priority of our 
      Company as we design and implement the most effective and efficient 
      business system. The primary components of the incremental productivity 
      goal will consist of (i) expanded savings through global supply chain 
      optimization as well as data and information technology system 
      standardization, which will be reinvested in global brand-building 
      initiatives with an emphasis on increased media spending, and (ii) 
      improved effectiveness of our marketing investments by transforming our 
      marketing and commercial model to redeploy into more consumer-facing 
      marketing investments to generate the highest possible return and 
      accelerate growth.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For details on items impacting comparability in the quarter and for the 
      full year, see the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial

		&lt;p&gt;
			NOTES
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the 
        results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period.
      
			
        &#8220;Concentrate sales&#8221; represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, 
        beverage bases and powders sold by, or used in finished beverages sold 
        by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers.
      
			
        &#8220;Sparkling beverages&#8221; means NARTD beverages with carbonation, 
        including energy drinks and carbonated waters and flavored waters.
      
			
        &#8220;Still beverages&#8221; means nonalcoholic beverages without carbonation, 
        including noncarbonated waters, flavored waters and enhanced waters, 
        juices and juice drinks, teas, coffees, sports drinks and 
        noncarbonated energy drinks.
      
			
        All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit 
        case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are 
        computed based on average daily sales for the fourth quarter, unless 
        otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full 
        year. &#8220;Unit case&#8221; means a unit of measurement equal to 24 eight-ounce 
        servings of finished beverage. &#8220;Unit case volume&#8221; means the number of 
        unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverages directly or 
        indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers.
      
			
        Fourth quarter 2013 financial results were impacted by one additional 
        selling day, which partially offset the impact of two fewer selling 
        days in first quarter 2013 results. Unit case volume results for the 
        quarters are not impacted by the variance in selling days due to the 
        average daily sales computation referenced above.
      
			
        In January 2012, the Company announced that Beverage Partners 
        Worldwide (BPW), our joint venture with Nestl&#233; in the ready-to-drink 
        tea category, will focus its geographic scope primarily in Europe and 
        Canada. The joint venture was phased out in all other territories by 
        the end of 2012, and the Company's agreement to distribute products in 
        the United States terminated at the end of 2012. We have eliminated 
        the BPW and Nestl&#233; licensed volume and associated concentrate sales 
        for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012 in those countries impacted by these 
        structural changes.
      
			
        As previously announced, effective Jan. 1, 2013, the Company 
        transferred our India and South West Asia business unit from the 
        Eurasia and Africa operating segment to the Pacific operating segment. 
        The countries included in our India and South West Asia business unit 
        are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. This 
        change in organizational structure did not impact the other geographic 
        operating segments, Bottling Investments or Corporate. The 
        reclassified historical operating segment data reflecting the change 
        in organizational structure was disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the 
        U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 21, 2013.
      
			
        The Company reports its financial results in accordance with 
        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). 
        However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures 
        provide users with additional meaningful financial information that 
        should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. 
        Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making 
        financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the 
        Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in 
        addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported 
        results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial 
        information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.

        Intersegment revenues were $169 million for Europe, $22 million for

        and $17 million for Bottling Investments.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before taxes were reduced by 
        $50 million for Europe, $92 million for North America, $10 million for 
        Pacific, $108 million for Bottling Investments and $24 million for 
        Corporate due to charges related to the Company's productivity and 
        reinvestment program as well as other restructuring initiatives.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $5 million for Corporate due to impairment charges recorded 
        on certain of the Company's intangible assets.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $11 million for Pacific due to a charge associated with 
        certain of the Company's fixed assets.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $1 million for Corporate due to transaction costs 
        associated with certain of the Company's bottling partners.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by a net $134 million 
        for Bottling Investments due to the Company's proportionate share of 
        unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method 
        investees.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $30 million for 
        Corporate due to a charge the Company recognized on the early 
        extinguishment of certain long-term debt.

        Intersegment revenues were $154 million for Europe, $95 million for 
        Latin America, $2 million for North America, $130 million for Pacific 
        and $22 million for Bottling Investments.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $1 million for Europe, $70 million for North America, $2 
        million for Pacific, $119 million for Bottling Investments and $20 
        million for Corporate due to charges related to the Company's 
        productivity and reinvestment program as well as other restructuring 
        initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income 
        taxes were increased by $1 million for Europe due to the refinement of 
        previously established accruals related to the Company's 2008-2011 
        productivity initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income (loss) 
        before income taxes were increased by $1 million for North America due 
        to the refinement of previously established accruals related to the 
        Company's integration of Coca-Cola Enterprises' ("CCE") former North 
        America business.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $6 million for North America due to the loss or damage of 
        certain fixed assets as a result of Hurricane Sandy.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $6 million for Corporate due to the elimination of the 
        Company's proportionate share of gross profit in inventory on sales to 
        Embotelladora Andina S.A. ("Andina") following its merger with 
        Embotelladoras Coca-Cola Polar S.A. ("Polar"). Subsequent to this 
        transaction, the Company has an ownership interest in Andina that we 
        account for under the equity method of accounting.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        increased by $3 million for Corporate due to a net gain on the sale of 
        land held by one of the Company's consolidated bottling operations, 
        partially offset by transaction costs associated with the Company's 
        acquisition of an equity ownership interest in Mikuni Coca-Cola 
        Bottling Co., Ltd. ("Mikuni"), a bottling partner with operations in 
        Japan.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $185 million for 
        Corporate due to the gain the Company recognized as a result of the 
        merger of Andina and Polar.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $108 million for 
        Corporate due to the loss the Company recognized on the sale of a 
        majority ownership interest in our Philippine bottling operations to 
        Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A.B. de C.V. ("Coca-Cola FEMSA"), which was 
        completed in January 2013. As of December 31, 2012, the assets and 
        liabilities associated with our Philippine bottling operations were 
        classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $82 million for 
        Corporate due to the Company acquiring an ownership interest in Mikuni 
        for which we paid a premium over the publicly traded market price. 
        This premium was expensed on the acquisition date.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $25 million for 
        Bottling Investments due to the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of 
        unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method 
        investees.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $16 million for 
        Corporate due to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values of 
        certain cost method investments.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $1 million for Europe 
        and was increased by $1 million for Eurasia and Africa, $1 million for 
        Latin America, $1 million for North America and $1 million for Pacific 
        due to changes in the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide 
        ("BPW"), our 50/50 joint venture with Nestl&#233; S.A. ("Nestl&#233;") in the 
        ready-to-drink tea category.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $5 million for 
        Corporate due to charges associated with the Company's indemnification 
        of a previously consolidated entity.

      During the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the results of our operating 
      segments were impacted by the following items:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Intersegment revenues were $689 million for Europe, $191 million for 
        Latin America, $16 million for North America, $497 million for Pacific 
        and $78 million for Bottling Investments.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $2 million for Eurasia and Africa, $57 million for Europe, 
        $282 million for North&#160;America, $26 million for Pacific, $194 million 
        for Bottling Investments and $121 million for Corporate due to charges 
        related to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program as well 
        as other restructuring initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income 
        (loss) before income taxes were increased by $2 million for North 
        America due to the refinement of previously established accruals 
        related to the Company's integration of CCE's former North America 
        business. Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income 
        taxes were increased by $1 million for Pacific and $1 million for 
        Corporate due to the refinement of previously established accruals 
        related to the Company's 2008-2011 productivity initiatives.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $195 million for Corporate due to impairment charges 
        recorded on certain of the Company's intangible assets.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $22 million for Pacific due to charges associated with 
        certain of the Company's fixed assets.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $8 million for Corporate due to transaction costs 
        associated with certain of the Company's bottling partners.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        increased by $3 million for North America due to the refinement of 
        previously established accruals related to the loss or damage of 
        certain fixed assets as a result of Hurricane Sandy.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $615 million for 
        Corporate due to a gain the Company recognized on the deconsolidation 
        of our Brazilian bottling operations as a result of their combination 
        with an independent bottling partner.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $9 million for 
        Bottling Investments and $140 million for Corporate due to the 
        devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, including our proportionate 
        share of the charge incurred by an equity method investee which has 
        operations in Venezuela.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by a net $114 million 
        for Corporate due to the merger of four of the Company's Japanese 
        bottling partners in which we held equity method investments prior to 
        their merger.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $139 million for 
        Corporate due to a gain the Company recognized as a result of 
        Coca-Cola FEMSA issuing additional shares of its own stock during the 
        period at a per share amount greater than the carrying value of the 
        Company's per share investment.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by a net $159 million 
        for Bottling Investments due to the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of

        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $53 million for 
        Corporate due to charges the Company recognized on the early 
        extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges include both 
        the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying 
        amount of the debt extinguished as well as hedge accounting 
        adjustments reclassified from accumulated comprehensive income to 
        earnings.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $1 million for 
        Corporate due to an adjustment to the Company's loss on the sale of a

        Philippine bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the year ended December&#160;31, 2012, the results of our operating 
      segments were impacted by the following items:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Intersegment revenues were $642 million for Europe, $271 million for 
        Latin America, $15 million for North America, $628 million for Pacific 
        and $88 million for Bottling Investments.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $1 million for Europe, $227 million for North America, $3 
        million for Pacific, $164 million for Bottling Investments and $38 
        million for Corporate due to charges related to the Company's 
        productivity and reinvestment program as well as other restructuring 
        initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income 
        taxes were increased by $4 million for Europe, $1 million for Pacific 
        and $5 million for Corporate due to the refinement of previously 
        established accruals related to the Company's 2008-2011 productivity 
        initiatives. Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income 
        taxes were increased by $6 million for North America due to the 
        refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company's 
        integration of CCE's former North America business.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $21 million for North America due to costs associated with 
        the Company detecting residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not 
        registered in the U.S. for use on citrus products, in orange juice 
        imported from Brazil for distribution in the U.S. As a result, the 
        Company began purchasing additional supplies of Florida orange juice 
        at a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $20 million for North America due to changes in the 
        Company's ready-to-drink tea strategy as a result of our current U.S. 
        license agreement with Nestl&#233; terminating at the end of 2012.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $6 million for North America due to the loss or damage of 
        certain fixed assets as a result of Hurricane Sandy.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        reduced by $6 million for Corporate due to the elimination of the 
        Company's proportionate share of gross profit in inventory on sales to 
        Andina following its merger with Polar. Subsequent to this 
        transaction, the Company has an ownership interest in Andina that we 
        account for under the equity method of accounting.
      
			
        Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes were 
        increased by $3 million for Corporate due to a gain on the sale of 
        land held by one of the Company's consolidated bottling operations, 
        partially offset by transaction costs associated with the Company's 
        acquisition of an equity ownership interest in Mikuni, a bottling 
        partner with operations in Japan.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $185 million for 
        Corporate due to the gain the Company recognized as a result of the 
        merger of Andina and Polar.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $92 million for 
        Corporate due to a gain the Company recognized as a result of 
        Coca-Cola FEMSA issuing additional shares of its own stock during the 
        period at a per share amount greater than the carrying amount of the 
        Company's per share investment.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $108 million for 
        Corporate due to the loss the Company recognized on the pending sale 
        of a majority ownership interest in our Philippine bottling operations 
        to Coca-Cola FEMSA, which was completed in January 2013. As of 
        December 31, 2012, the assets and liabilities associated with our 
        Philippine bottling operations were classified as held for sale in our 
        consolidated balance sheets.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $82 million for 
        Corporate due to the Company acquiring an ownership interest in Mikuni 
        for which we paid a premium over the publicly traded market price. 
        This premium was expensed on the acquisition date.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was increased by $8 million for 
        Bottling Investments due to the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of 
        unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method 
        investees.
      
			
        Income (loss) before income taxes was reduced by $16 million for 
        Corporate due to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values of 
        certain cost method investments.

      The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting 
      principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred 
      to herein as "reported"). However, management believes that certain 
      non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful 
      financial information that should be considered when assessing our 
      ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial 
      measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in 
      evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should 
      be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company&#8217;s 
      reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP 
      financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of 
      accounting.

			ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following information is provided to give qualitative and 
      quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items 
      impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, 
      our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly 
      titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to 
      consider as "items impacting comparability" based on how management 
      views our business; makes financial, operating and planning decisions; 
      and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, 
      gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting 
      only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as 
      relating to different and unrelated underlying activities or events 
      across comparable periods, are generally considered "items impacting 
      comparability". In addition, we provide the impact that changes in 
      foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency 
      neutral").

			Asset Impairments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company 
      recorded charges of $5 million and $195&#160;million, respectively, related 
      to certain intangible assets. The charges of $195 million included $113 
      million related to the impairment of trademarks recorded in our Bottling 
      Investments and Pacific operating segments. These impairments were 
      primarily due to a strategic decision to phase out certain local-market 
      value brands which resulted in a change in the expected useful life of 
      the intangible assets. The charges were determined by comparing the fair 
      value of the trademarks, derived using discounted cash flow analyses, to 
      the current carrying value. Additionally, the remaining charge of 
      $82&#160;million was related to goodwill recorded in our Bottling Investments 
      operating segment. This charge was primarily the result of management's 
      revised outlook on market conditions and volume performance. The total 
      impairment charges of $195 million were recorded in our Corporate 
      operating segment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, the Company 
      recorded charges of $16 million due to other-than-temporary declines in 
      the fair values of certain cost method investments.

			Restructuring
		&lt;/p&gt;

      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company 
      recorded charges of $102 million and $188&#160;million, respectively. The 
      Company recorded charges of $119 million and $163 million during the 
      three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. These 
      charges were related to the integration of our German bottling and 
      distribution operations as well as other restructuring initiatives 
      outside the scope of the Company's productivity and reinvestment program.

      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company 
      recorded charges of $182 million and $494&#160;million, respectively. The 
      Company recorded charges of $93 million and $270 million during the 
      three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. These 
      charges were related to our productivity and reinvestment program. This 
      program is designed to further enable our efforts to strengthen our 
      brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term growth. The first 
      component of this program is a global productivity initiative focused 
      around four primary areas: global supply chain optimization; global 
      marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and 
      operational excellence; and data and information technology systems 
      standardization.

      The second component of our productivity and reinvestment program 
      involves an integration initiative in North America related to our 
      acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s ("CCE") former North America 
      business. The Company has identified incremental synergies in North 
      America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply 
      operations, which will better enable us to serve our customers and 
      consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a combined productivity and reinvestment program, the Company 
      anticipates generating annualized savings of $550 million to $650 
      million. In February 2014, we announced the expansion of this program to 
      drive an incremental $1 billion in productivity by 2016 that will be 
      redirected primarily into increased media investments.

			Productivity Initiatives
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company reversed charges of 
      $2 million. During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, 
      the Company reversed charges of $1 million and $10&#160;million, 
      respectively. These reversals were related to previously established 
      accruals associated with our 2008-2011 productivity initiatives. These 
      initiatives were focused on providing additional flexibility to invest 
      for growth and impacted a number of areas, including aggressively 
      managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques; redesigning 
      key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness; better 
      leveraging our size and scale; and driving savings in indirect costs.

      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company 
      recorded net charges of $134 million and $159&#160;million, respectively. 
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, the Company 
      recorded net charges of $25 million and net gains of $8 million, 
      respectively. These amounts represent the Company&#8217;s proportionate share 
      of unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method 
      investees.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company reversed charges of 
      $2 million. During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, 
      the Company reversed charges of $1 million and $6 million, respectively. 
      These reversals were related to previously established accruals 
      associated with the Company's integration of CCE's former North America 
      business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Transaction Gains/Losses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company recorded a gain of 
      $615 million related to the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling 
      operations upon their combination with an independent bottler. 
      Subsequent to this transaction, the Company accounts for our investment 
      in the newly combined Brazilian bottling operations under the equity 
      method of accounting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company recorded a net loss 
      of $114 million related to our investment in the four bottling partners 
      that merged in July 2013 to form Coca-Cola East Japan Bottling Company, 
      Ltd. ("CCEJ"), through a share exchange.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of the transactions described above in Brazil and Japan, the 
      Company recorded a charge of $60 million during the year ended 
      December&#160;31, 2013. This charge was due to the deferral of the revenue 
      and corresponding gross profit associated with the intercompany portion 
      of our concentrate sales to CCEJ and the newly combined Brazilian 
      bottling operations until the finished beverage products made from those 
      concentrates are sold to a third party.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the year ended December&#160;31, 2013 the Company recorded a gain of 
      $139 million. During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, 
      the Company recorded a gain of $92 million. These gains were recognized 
      as a result of Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Coca-Cola FEMSA") 
      issuing additional shares of its own stock during the period at a per 
      share amount greater than the carrying amount of the Company's per share 
      investment. Accordingly, the Company is required to treat these types of 
      transactions as if the Company sold a proportionate share of its 
      investment in the equity method investee.

      In addition to the items above, during the three months and year ended 
      December&#160;31, 2013, the Company recorded charges of $1 million and $8 
      million, respectively, due to transaction costs associated with certain 
      of our bottling partners. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the 
      Company recorded a benefit of $1 million due to an adjustment to the 
      Company's loss on the sale of a majority ownership interest in our 
      previously consolidated Philippine bottling operations to Coca-Cola 
      FEMSA in January 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, the Company 
      recorded a gain of $185 million due to the merger of Embotelladora 
      Andina S.A. ("Andina") and Embotelladoras Coca-Cola Polar S.A. 
      ("Polar"), two Latin American bottling partners, with Andina being the 
      acquiring company. The merger of the two companies was a noncash 
      transaction that resulted in Polar shareholders exchanging their 
      existing Polar shares for newly issued shares of Andina at a specified 
      exchange rate. Prior to the merger, the Company held an investment in 
      Andina that was classified as an available-for-sale security, and we 
      also held an investment in Polar that was accounted for under the equity 
      method of accounting. Subsequent to this transaction, the Company holds 
      an investment in Andina that we account for under the equity method of 
      accounting. In addition, the Company recorded a charge of $6 million 
      during the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, due to the 
      elimination of our proportionate share of gross profit in inventory on 
      sales to Andina as a result of the merger.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On December 13, 2012, the Company and Coca-Cola FEMSA executed a share 
      purchase agreement for the sale of a majority ownership interest in our 
      consolidated Philippine bottling operations. This transaction was 
      completed in January 2013. As a result of this agreement, the Company 
      was required to classify our Philippine bottling operations as held for 
      sale, and we recognized a loss of $108 million during the three months 
      and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, based on the agreed upon sale price 
      and related transaction costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, the Company 
      recorded a charge of $82 million due to the acquisition of an ownership 
      interest in Mikuni Coca-Cola Bottling Co., Ltd. ("Mikuni") for which we 
      paid a premium over the publicly traded market price. Although the 
      Company paid this premium to obtain specific rights that have an 
      economic and strategic value to the Company, they do not qualify as an 
      asset and were therefore expensed on the acquisition date. The Company 
      accounted for our investment in Mikuni under the equity method of 
      accounting prior to the merger of the four Japanese bottling partners 
      into CCEJ discussed above.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, the Company 
      recognized a net gain of $4 million due to the sale of land held by one 
      of the Company's consolidated bottling operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, the Company 
      recorded a charge of $5 million associated with our indemnification of a 
      previously consolidated entity. The impact of this charge effectively 
      reduced the gain the Company recognized when we initially sold the 
      entity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Certain Tax Matters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company 
      recorded a net tax benefit of $15 million and $35 million, respectively, 
      related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain 
      tax positions, including interest and penalties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, the Company 
      recorded a net tax benefit of $124 million and $150 million, 
      respectively. This benefit was primarily related to the reversal of 
      certain valuation allowances, partially offset by amounts required to be 
      recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest 
      and penalties.

			Impact of Natural Disasters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused widespread flooding and wind 
      damage across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, primarily in 
      New York and New Jersey, and as a result the Company experienced lost 
      sales in the impacted areas. In addition, during the three months and 
      year ended December&#160;31, 2012, we recorded charges of $6&#160;million due to 
      the loss or damage of certain fixed assets resulting from the hurricane. 
      During the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company reversed charges of 
      $3 million due to the refinement of previously established accruals 
      related to the loss or damage of certain fixed assets resulting from the 
      hurricane.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company uses derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price 
      risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing 
      process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these 
      derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge 
      accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair 
      values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for 
      outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our 
      non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying 
      exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of 
      income. We believe this adjustment provides meaningful information 
      related to the impact of our economic hedging activities. During the 
      three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the net impact of the 
      Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities 
      described above resulted in a decrease of $23 million and an increase of 
      $72 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP operating income. During the 
      three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2012, the net impact of the 
      Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities 
      described above resulted in an increase to our non-GAAP operating income 
      of $82 million and $5&#160;million, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Early Extinguishment of Long-Term Debt
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company 
      recorded charges of $30 million and $53&#160;million, respectively, due to 
      the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Hyperinflationary Economies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company recorded a charge 
      of $149 million related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, 
      including our proportionate share of the charge incurred by an equity 
      method investee which has operations in Venezuela.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fixed Assets
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months and year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the Company 
      recorded charges of $11 million and $22&#160;million, respectively, 
      associated with certain of the Company's fixed assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Beverage Partners Worldwide and License Agreement with Nestl&#233; S.A.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended December&#160;31, 2012, the Company reversed 
      charges of $3 million related to previously established accruals 
      associated with changes in the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide 
      ("BPW"), our 50/50 joint venture with Nestl&#233; S.A. ("Nestl&#233;") in the 
      ready-to-drink tea category. During the year ended December 31, 2012, 
      the Company recorded net charges of $11 million due to these BPW 
      changes. In addition, as a result of our current U.S. license agreement 
      with Nestl&#233; terminating at the end of 2012, the Company recorded charges 
      of $20 million during the year ended December&#160;31, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Brazilian Orange Juice
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In December 2011, the Company learned that orange juice being imported 
      from Brazil contained residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not 
      registered in the U.S. for use on citrus products. As a result, the 
      Company began purchasing additional supplies of Florida orange juice at 
      a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice. During the year ended 
      December 31, 2012, the Company incurred charges of $21 million related 
      to these events, including the increased raw material costs.

			Currency Neutral
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management evaluates the operating performance of our Company and our 
      international subsidiaries on a currency neutral basis. We determine our 
      currency neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as 
      appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results by 
      the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of 
      current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current 
      period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as 
      appropriate, the derived current period local currency operating results 
      by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of 
      the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to 
      translate the Company's financial statements in the comparable prior 
      year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating 
      results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not 
      changed from the comparable prior year period.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Feb 18 (Reuters) - A 33-year-old man jumped to
his death from the skyscraper roof of U.S. investment bank
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's Asia headquarters on Tuesday,
police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was certified dead in hospital after the fall at
around 2 p.m., a police spokeswoman told Reuters. Police did not
yet know the circumstances surrounding his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horrified finance workers in neighbouring offices circulated
pictures via social media of the man standing above the company
logo emblazoned on top of the Chater House building in central
Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank declined to confirm if the man was an employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A sad and tragic incident occurred in Chater House, Hong
Kong, today, which is currently being investigated by the
police. Out of respect for those involved, we cannot yet comment
further," JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese-language newspaper, Apple Daily, carried a
photograph of the man lying in a pool of blood on the busy road,
next to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed visa bans on 20 senior Ukrainian government officials believed to be responsible for a violent crackdown by riot police against protesters, a senior State Department official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senior official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, would not name those affected by the U.S. visa ban, which bars the individuals from applying for visas to travel to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today we moved to restrict visas to some 20 senior members of the Ukrainian government and other individuals we consider responsible for ordering human rights abuses related to political oppression in Ukraine," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These individuals represent the full chain of command we consider responsible for ordering the security forces to move against" the protesters, the official said, adding that the visa bans were easily reversible if the situation improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev said it had revoked the visas of several Ukrainians linked to police violence against demonstrators at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official said a truce agreed between Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich and opposition leaders late on Wednesday represented "a glimmer of hope." Whether or not the truce holds would depend on talks scheduled between the government and opposition on Thursday, according to the official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will watch whether this truce holds and whether they are able to move on to political compromise and a transition government that can take Ukraine forward," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the event that things go well these visa sanctions we put in place are reversible but in the event they do not go well there are other steps we can take in close coordination with the EU in coming days," the official added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union has said it is preparing targeted sanctions against those responsible for the violence. It has also dispatched foreign ministers from Germany, France and Poland to Kiev on Thursday, hours before an emergency EU meeting in Brussels to decide on sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials have warned that Washington is prepared to slap financial sanctions on government officials if the bloodshed worsens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday called on Ukraine's armed forces to stay out of the country's political crisis and warned there would be consequences for those who "step over the line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. warning followed concerns that the military was preparing to move against protesters and after Yanukovich appointed a new head of the armed forces general staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior State Department official said there was also growing concern from Washington after U.S. officials were unable to reach senior Ukrainian military and intelligence officers by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official said the calls were meant to "express our view with regard to allowing peaceful protests and allowing political compromise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been trying to reestablish those contacts over the last few days and nobody is picking up the phone on the Ukrainian side, which is worrying," the official said, adding that the "changing of the guard" in the military was a concern and hoped it did not mean the military was ready to get involved in the anti-government protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ukraine is not presently seeking membership in NATO, it does cooperate with the Western military alliance in a number of areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Diane Craft and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

armed forces to stay out of the country's political crisis and
warned there would be consequences for those who "step over the
line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. warning followed concerns that the military was
preparing to move against protesters and after Yanukovich
appointed a new head of the armed forces general staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior State Department official said there was also
growing concern from Washington after U.S. officials were unable
to reach senior Ukrainian military and intelligence officers by
phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official said the calls were meant to "express our view
with regard to allowing peaceful protests and allowing political
compromise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been trying to reestablish those contacts over the
last few days and nobody is picking up the phone on the
Ukrainian side, which is worrying," the official said, adding
that the "changing of the guard" in the military was a concern
and hoped it did not mean the military was ready to get involved
in the anti-government protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ukraine is not presently seeking membership in NATO,
it does cooperate with the Western military alliance in a number
of areas.&lt;/p&gt;

      Visa to Enable Secure, Cloud-Based Mobile Payments
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Introduces new standards, tools and guidelines for Visa payWave
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Extends Visa Ready Program to enable Visa payment functionality in 
      the cloud
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa today announced it is offering clients new options to securely 
      deploy mobile payment programs, including for the first time an option 
      to host Visa payWave-enabled accounts in a secure, virtual cloud. The 
      move expands Visa&#8217;s support for mobile payments globally and will give 
      financial institutions greater choice in offering consumers secure ways 
      to pay with smartphones.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa&#8217;s support for cloud-based payments follows the introduction of a 
      new feature in the Android mobile operating system called Host 
      Card Emulation (HCE); HCE allows any NFC application on an Android 
      device to emulate a smart card, letting users wave-to-pay with their 
      smartphones, while permitting financial institutions to host payment 
      accounts in a secure, virtual cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our clients and partners around the globe are continuously looking for 
      flexible, cost efficient and secure ways to enable mobile payments,&#8221; 
      said Elizabeth Buse, Executive Vice President, Global Solutions, Visa 
      Inc. &#8220;The Android HCE feature provides us with a platform to evolve the 
      Visa payWave standard, support the development of secure, cloud-based 
      mobile applications, while at the same time offer greater choice to our 
      clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to data released by International 
      Data Corporation in February 2014, 78 percent of smartphones sold in 
      Q4 2013 run on the Android operating system, and Android is enjoying 
      strong gains in markets outside the U.S., including in China and Latin 
      America. Android also recently became the fastest platform to reach one 
      billion users worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Android community continues to build innovative ways to improve the 
      lives of mobile users. We introduced HCE to make it easier for 
      developers to create NFC applications like mobile payments, loyalty 
      programs, transit passes, and other custom services,&#8221; said Benjamin 
      Poiesz, Google Android Product Manager. &#8220;Visa's move to enable NFC 
      payments with Android devices is welcome news and will guide the way for 
      the payments industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Visa Ready for Cloud-Based Payment Applications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to supporting clients who are hosting the Visa account data 
      on secure elements in smartphones, Visa is extending the Visa Ready 
      Program to also support financial institutions and partners who wish to 
      securely deploy Visa accounts in the cloud. The program provides new 
      standards, tools, services and implementation guidelines, and ensures 
      that cloud-based applications with Visa payment functionality are 
      compatible with Visa&#8217;s requirements and payment industry security 
      standards. The program includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Standards: Visa has enhanced its contactless payment 
        application, Visa payWave, and is introducing a new standard, 
        requirements, program approval process and implementation guidelines 
        to enable financial institutions to securely host Visa accounts in a 
        virtual cloud. The initial Visa payWave standard for cloud-based 
        deployment is available now. Future versions of the Visa payWave 
        standard will add support for QR codes and in-app payments.
      
			
				Tools: Visa is also developing a software development kit (SDK) 
        to support clients who wish to develop their own cloud-based payment 
        applications or want to enhance their existing mobile banking 
        applications with Visa payWave functionality.
      
			
				Services: Visa is developing a new service and platform, to 
        enable clients and partners to issue Visa accounts digitally &#8211; in the 
        cloud, on secure elements in smartphones, or linked to a digital 
        wallet. The solution will also enable the issuance of payment tokens 
        that will replace the 16-digit payment account number and can be 
        limited for use with a specific device, payment channel or merchant.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ensuring payment security is one of Visa&#8217;s highest priorities and 
      security in cloud-based payments is no exception. Visa will deploy 
      several layers of security to protect payment accounts in the cloud, 
      including at the Visa network, application and hardware levels. One-time 
      use data, real-time transaction analysis, payment tokens and device 
      fingerprinting technology make up a multi-layered defense against 
      unauthorized account access.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Additional Visa Client Quotes:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa clients in Australia, Canada and the U.S. are applauding Visa&#8217;s 
      decision to enable cloud-based mobile payments. The following are 
      supporting quotes by leading financial institutions:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We're pleased to support Visa's announcement today, which is an 
      important development in helping customers transact in a simple and 
      secure way. Incorporating cloud-based NFC mobile payments with Visa 
      payWave contributes to setting a level of market maturity that supports 
      choice for the customer and uses existing merchant terminals,&#8221; said Marj 
      Demmer, General Manager, Cards and Payments, ANZ.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement from Visa will assist NAB in achieving its goal of 
      secure account storage on the cloud, which will allow customers to shop 
      online or in-store with their mobile device,&#8221; said Michael Starkey, 
      General Manager, Channel Development, Digital and Direct Banking, 
      National Australia Bank. &#8220;This is an exciting opportunity for NAB, and 
      its partners, because it overcomes the limitations&#160;existing solutions 
      that are currently in pilot, which house account information on the 
      phone and limit NFC solutions to a small selection of Android devices as 
      a result.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe Visa&#8217;s decision to enable cloud-based NFC payments is a 
      critical step in providing clarity and certainty to our consumer and 
      merchant clients of an innovative, easy and secure mobile payments 
      solution,&#8221; said Linda Mantia, Executive Vice-President, Cards  Payment 
      Solutions at RBC, Canada&#8217;s largest financial institution and considered 
      a pioneer in cloud-based mobile solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Customers have migrated to their smartphone and we are at the doorstep 
      of consumers migrating to mobile commerce in greater mass,&#8221; said Dominic 
      Venturo, Chief Innovation Officer, U.S. Bank Payment Services. &#8220;This new 
      development, combined with the security benefits of tokenization, is an 
      important step for the industry because it enables an open, scalable 
      approach for issuers like U.S. Bank to provide customers with a secure 
      way to make contactless payment using their Android-based phones.&#8221;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LyncConf 2014 - Plantronics 
      (NYSE:PLT), a pioneer in wearable technology and audio communications, 
      is demonstrating new applications that work with Microsoft Lync and 
      Plantronics&#8217; sensor-enabled wearable devices to help improve 
      productivity for users, particularly when they are on the go. 
      Plantronics will demonstrate how a connected worker can use their 
      headset to seamlessly transfer an active Lync call from their computer 
      to their mobile phone as they move away from their desk. In addition, 
      Plantronics will showcase how its Smart 
      Presence application can provide more accurate presence information 
      in Microsoft Lync when a user is on a mobile or desk phone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Plantronics&#8217; new Smart Presence application and seamless transfer 
      technology will be on display at the LyncConf 2014 in booth #522 at the 
      Aria Casino and Hotel Convention Center. The company will also showcase 
      third party applications that leverage the Smart Presence integration 
      with Lync to enhance automated call distribution in a call center 
      environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited that Plantronics
			is providing workers in multiple 
      environments with a variety of devices that can transition 
      communications more easily from Lync and Skype to a mobile device,&#8221; said 
      Giovanni Mezgec, General Manager of Lync Product Marketing at Microsoft. 
      &#8220;This provides customers the flexibility to choose a solution that meets 
      their specialized communication and collaboration needs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Plantronics&#8217; portfolio of wearable audio devices that are optimized for 
      Lync, include comprehensive offerings for Lync users. Plantronics&#8217; 
      unified communication offerings connect to multiple devices, provide 
      world class audio experience in challenging environments, and provide 
      smarter communication and collaboration through wearable technology that 
      leverages information about users including the ability to sense when a 
      device is worn or not, proximity intelligence and mobile call state 
      awareness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Plantronics provides Lync customers with the flexibility to work 
      anywhere by enabling them to move between devices and places throughout 
      the day to maximize the benefits of the Microsoft Lync experience,&#8221; said 
      Bill Loewenthal, vice president of Enterprise Solutions at Plantronics. 
      &#8220;The ability of our audio devices to easily transition communications in 
      multiple environments and deliver information about the user&#8217;s world 
      makes communicating easier because it anticipates a user&#8217;s needs and 
      provides more accurate information to those around them. Our 
      capabilities improve the ease of audio connections between people and 
      signal the promise of wearable technology.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Seamless Transfer and Voyager Legend UC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The seamless transfer feature is able to seamlessly transfer a 
      Lync-based call from a PC to a mobile phone using information from 
      Plantronics&#8217; Voyager Legend UC headset as the user moves out of 
      proximity from their PC. The proximity information from the headset 
      triggers Microsoft Lync to transfer the call to the mobile device the 
      user takes with them on the go. Seamless transfer is a capability that 
      will be included in the Plantronics application and will be available in 
      the Microsoft Lync catalog later this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Smart Presence
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Plantronics Smart Presence for Microsoft Lync 2013 provides enhanced 
      presence capabilities when used with Plantronics Spokes for Windows 
      software and supported Plantronics audio devices including Voyager 
      Legend UC, Savi 700 series, Blackwire 700 series and Calisto 620. The 
      application will change a user&#8217;s Microsoft Lync presence status to &#8220;In a 
      call&#8221; when on a mobile phone call, traditional PBX desk phone or third 
      party softphone call to enhance and provide the presence state in Lync. 
      Smart Presence for Lync 2013 is the first application from an audio 
      device vendor to be included in the Lync 
      Application Catalog. The Smart Presence for Lync 2013 application is 
      also available on Plantronics&#8217; website.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Third Party Concept Applications for the Contact Center
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Plantronics will be showcasing third party applications that enhance 
      Automated Call Distribution (ACD) developed by Zylink and Clarity 
      Connect, both Microsoft partners with contact center applications tested 
      and qualified for Lync 2013. By using wearable technology sensors in 
      Plantronics audio devices and Spokes SDK, available at plantronics.com/developer, 
      both of these developers have enhanced a contact center agent&#8217;s 
      availability for call distribution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Plantronics Lync Optimized Solutions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Savi 
      Series &#8211; DECT&#8482; headsets for Maximum Range and Clarity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Savi series of DECT headsets, including the Savi 745, delivers a

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA Feb 19 (Reuters) - Austria's OMV said it
was working with partner Chevron to reduce the costs of
their North Sea Rosebank oil and gas project and hoped to reach
a final investment decision in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two had planned to decide this year, but U.S. oil
company Chevron said in November the development of the project
was not economically attractive. OMV last year estimated the
cost at $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now estimate that a final decision will come in 2015,"
OMV's head of exploration and production, Jaap Huijskes, told
reporters on Wednesday after the Austrian company presented its
2013 results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both Chevron and we are now doing a load of work to ensure
that in 2015 there will be an economic value," Huijskes said.
"We are working on getting the number below what we mentioned
last year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's concerns last year raised doubts about a
resurgence of the North Sea oil industry as fears grow over
costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OMV bought its 50 percent stake in the project from Norway's
Statoil last year, and Huijskes said OMV still intended
to sell a 10 to 20 percent stake, although he gave no details of
how close it might be to any deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of work ongoing, both to reduce the cost but
also to rephase the cost to make sure that some of the drilling
gets delayed to later on in the field life, which will have
quite a big impact on the economics of the field," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OMV plans to invest around 3 billion euros ($4 billion) in
exploration and production this year, of a total capital
expenditure budget of 3.9 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said last month it planned to keep spending roughly
$40 billion per year for the next few years on new oil and
natural gas projects in a bid to lift production that is on
track to be flat for the third straight year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN MATEO, Calif., Feb. 19, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AtHoc, Inc., the leader in network-centric interactive crisis communication systems, today announced it has appointed Dan Nelson to the company's Strategic Advisory Board. Nelson has 33 years' experience in the international energy industry and will help advise and guide AtHoc's continued growth in industrial markets, particularly the energy and chemical sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Nelson spent 33 years with ExxonMobil Corporation. Upon the 1999 merger of Exxon and Mobil, Nelson was named chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil Saudi Arabia, based in Riyadh, a position he held until 2004. Nelson then served as a corporate vice president directing the company's government relations efforts from 2004 to 2009. Nelson began his career at Mobil Corporation in 1976 in the supply and trading area and, at Mobil, held a variety of management roles related to the Middle East, liquefied natural gas and power development, and supply and oil trading, living and working in New York City, London, Washington, D.C. and Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"It is our privilege to welcome Dan to AtHoc's Strategic Advisory Board," said Guy Miasnik, president and CEO of AtHoc. "His insights on international business and the industrial market will be a tremendous asset for advising AtHoc on how to help global organizations ensure the safety of their employees, community and environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"I can speak from personal experience that those working in the heavy industry sector confront any number of potential hazards on a daily basis," said Nelson. "AtHoc offers expertise and technology that are critical for large organizations to protect the lives of their employees, the integrity of their facilities and the communities where they work and live on a global basis. I want to support that process and hope my involvement will help AtHoc continue to expand and grow into new markets around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Nelson currently is a managing partner of International Strategic Insights, a Washington, D.C.-based advisory firm that he and several partners founded in 2009.

&lt;p&gt;* Q4 profit 2.5 bln pesos from 3.0 bln pesos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* New telecoms reform bites into sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Revenue rises 8.3 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Grupo
Televisa, the world's largest Spanish-language content producer,
on Thursday said its fourth-quarter profit fell 17.8 percent on
higher costs, currency losses and lower sales resulting from a
new telecoms reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company , which is facing tougher
regulation as Mexico tries to increase competition in its
television and phone markets, reported fourth-quarter profit of
2.464 billion pesos ($188 million), down from 2.998 billion
pesos in the same period in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa said revenue rose 8.3 percent in the quarter to
21.443 billion pesos, thanks to selling more advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a reform approved last year, pay-television operators
must carry public broadcast channels, and the broadcasters must
offer their signals to pay-TV companies. Televisa said its sales
were dented by a decrease in the money it generated from selling
its channels to competitors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reform is also expected to cut into Televisa's revenues
as it encourages more competitors in public broadcast and pay
television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detailed laws that will lay out how the reform will be
enacted are set to be presented to Mexico's Congress shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Televisa ended the day up 0.5 percent at 74.61
pesos before the company reported its results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Management Commentary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our start to the year was weak, weighed down by reduced market demand and lower prices for our products, however, performance improved as the year progressed," said Al Cadotte, President and CEO of Newalta. "In the final three quarters of 2013, before non-recurring items Adjusted EBITDA grew by 20 percent over the prior year. The last three quarters are indicative of the results we expect from our business plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the fourth quarter, improved performance across all of our operations was offset by non-recurring charges of about $4.5 million. For the year, Adjusted EBITDA excluding non-recurring charges, was $156.0 million, up 10 percent compared to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continued to advance our growth plans in 2013 with several notable achievements:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				We increased our long-term onsite contract revenue base to 14 percent of revenue in 2013, up from 10 percent in 2012.  
					
				We commissioned our first U.S. satellite facility mid-year and we constructed two more that will be operational in Q1 of 2014. 
					
				Our mature fine tailings ("MFT") project with Syncrude Canada Ltd. exceeded expectations with operations starting up in May 2013 and continuing through to the end of the year. We also constructed and commissioned our Shell Canada Ltd. MFT contract on budget and on schedule. 
					
				We commissioned one satellite facility at mid-year in our Oilfield Division and constructed two more for commissioning in Q1 of 2014. 
					
				We signed a development agreement with DuPont Canada to demonstrate a new wastewater process. Construction is now complete and the unit will be operational in early 2014. 
					
				We increased our quarterly dividend 10 percent compared to last year. 
					
				Late in the year, we began a comprehensive review of our Industrial Division with actions planned predominately in the first quarter of 2014 to drive improved profitability and higher investment returns. 
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;"The improvements we are making to the profitability of the Industrial Division, and the reductions we will achieve in SGA costs combined with the contributions from our 2013 growth capital investments will all contribute to much improved results in 2014. We expect a strong start to the year with first quarter performance well ahead of last year. This will set the stage for a strong year of growth, profitability and attractive shareholder returns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth quarter revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were relatively flat compared to prior year. Contributions from all divisions increased; however, gains were offset by non-recurring charges of approximately $4.5 million. Net loss in the quarter was $10.3 million, compared to net earnings of $4.1 million in the prior year. Higher Divisional EBITDA and lower net finance charges were more than offset by non-cash restructuring related impairment charges. In Q4 2013, we recognized $21.2 million for impairment of certain assets related to the planned facility closures and divestitures in the Industrial division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 revenue increased 8% to $783.4 million compared to prior year while Adjusted EBITDA was $150.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA before non-recurring charges was $156.0 million, up 10% over 2012. Improved performance was primarily driven by contributions from New Markets and Oilfield. 2013 net earnings was $21.9 million, down 49% from 2012 due primarily to the non-cash restructuring related impairment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-recurring charges in the quarter and 2013 were $4.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Non-recurring charges included: charges for positions eliminated during the year; the settlement of an out of period disputed account; and U.S. employee compensation for previous periods as a result of a U.S. Federal Department of Labor ("DOL") settlement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the DOL reviewed our compensation structure for a misclassification of certain operating employees under the applicable labour standards. Our compensation package for U.S. employees was consistent with our Canadian pay structure. As a result of the DOL review, in Q4 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement and recognized $4.2 million for U.S. employee compensation:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				$2.2 million was charged to SGA for compensation related to prior years; and 
					
				$2.0 million was charged to New Markets for compensation related to 2013, including $0.5 million related to Q4 2013. 
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;Other Highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.11 per share ($0.44 per share annualized) paid January 15, 2014 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, were $72.2 million and $171.1 million, respectively, focused primarily on growth capital projects in New Markets and Oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the ongoing strength of our pipeline of capital projects and organic growth opportunities, particularly in New Markets and Oilfield, our 2014 capital budget is $180 million, with growth capital and maintenance expenditures of $145 million and $35 million, respectively. We will continue to invest in New Markets and Oilfield to drive strong returns and growth in our core growth areas. The capital program will be funded primarily by funds from operations. We expect to spend approximately 40% of the capital budget in the first half of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2014, we formed an alliance with Halliburton Canada to offer tailored onsite services, specializing in drilling fluids and waste management services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, we announced a comprehensive review to improve productivity and profitability, particularly in the Industrial Division and in SGA expenses across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have developed a plan focused on rationalizing our Eastern Industrial operations and related overhead. The plan includes redirecting lines of business, consolidations, closures and divestitures of certain facilities, as well as overhead reductions related to supporting impacted operations. We will execute the plan throughout 2014, and expect to implement the bulk of the plan in the first half of the year. Once implemented, we expect approximately $10 million in annualized ongoing cash savings and approximately $5 million in one-time cash restructuring costs. To date, we have taken actions that will deliver 60 percent of the identified savings, including closure of three facilities in eastern Canada and overhead reductions in associated support functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to SGA, we are assessing our current cost structure to align resources with business needs, anticipating incremental cost savings to those identified under the industrial plan above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continue to assess our cost structure across all business lines and further actions may be implemented. We will assess and update savings and cost estimates throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amendment to By-laws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, today the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the by-laws of Newalta that requires shareholders to give advanced notice to Newalta of any proposal to nominate directors for election to the Board of Directors in circumstances where nominations are made other than by requisitioning a meeting or making a shareholder proposal, each pursuant to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta).  The amendment to the by-laws is effective immediately. Shareholders will be asked to confirm and ratify the amended by-laws at the next annual and special meeting of shareholders to be held on May 7, 2014. A copy of the amended by-laws is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly Conference Call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management will hold a conference call on Friday, February 21, 2014 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss Newalta's performance for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2013.

These financial measures are identified and defined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"EBITDA", "EBITDA per share", "Adjusted EBITDA", and "Adjusted EBITDA per share" are measures of our operating profitability. EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to how these activities are financed, assets are amortized or impaired, or how the results are taxed in various jurisdictions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to recognizing stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation, a component of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes in the price of our common shares. As such, Adjusted EBITDA provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our operating results over a period of time. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are derived from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. EBITDA per share and Adjusted EBITDA per share are derived by dividing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by the basic weighted average number of shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;"Adjusted net earnings" and "Adjusted net earnings per share" are measures of our profitability. Adjusted net earnings provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to recognizing stock-based compensation recovery or expense, the gain or loss on embedded derivatives and restructuring related charges. Stock-based compensation expense, a component of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes in the price of our common shares. The gain on the embedded derivative is a result of the change in the trading price of the debentures and the volatility of the applicable bond market. Restructuring related charges are related to initiatives outside of our normal course of business. As such, Adjusted net earnings provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our results over a period of time. Adjusted net earnings per share is derived by dividing Adjusted net earnings by the basic weighted average number of shares. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;NEWALTA - WHO WE ARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta is North America's leading provider of innovative, engineered environmental solutions that enable customers to reduce disposal, enhance recycling and recover valuable resources from industrial residues. We serve customers onsite directly at their operations and through a network of 85 locations in Canada and the U.S. Our proven processes, portfolio of more than 250 operating permits and excellent record of safety make us the first choice provider of sustainability enhancing services to oil, natural gas, petrochemical, refining, lead, manufacturing and mining markets. With a skilled team of more than 2,200 people, a two decade track record of profitable expansion and commitment to commercializing new solutions, Newalta is positioned for sustained future growth and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following section contains forward looking information as it outlines our strategic focus for our business plan. Our business plan is based on several key assumptions including growth capital contributions, commodity prices and activity levels of the industries we serve. Changes to these assumptions could cause our actual results to differ materially from the plan outlined below. Please refer to the Sensitivities section for a summary of the key metrics used to derive our plan and the Capital Expenditures section for an understanding of our expected returns from growth capital projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRATEGY:
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter 2014, we continue to focus on maximizing shareholder returns through low risk growth investments that provide the highest returns and stable cash flows and on improving operational fitness to maximize the profitability of our core operations. In line with this focus and as part of our business planning process, we have revised our growth capital plan over the plan period and expect to spend approximately $150 to $200 million in growth capital each year. Our growth capital investments will drive strong performance and attractive returns in the years ahead. Over the plan period to 2017, we expect a 15% and 20% compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively. We will continue to increase contracts as a percentage of revenue to be in excess of 20% by the end of the plan. Adjusted SGA will improve towards 8% of annual revenue by the end of 2017 and we will continue to work towards a debt leverage ratio of 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our key priorities for 2014 and 2015 are:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Invest in low-risk, high-return organic growth opportunities to grow the business; 
					
					
						Drive expansion in New Markets and Oilfield; 
							
						
					
				Improve returns on existing assets through streamlining and consolidation initiatives; 
					
					
						Drive cost alignment particularly in the Industrial division and in SGA expenses;

				&lt;p&gt;RISKS TO OUR STRATEGY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we remain optimistic about our long-term outlook, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties in carrying out our activities. See the Risk Management section for further discussion on our Risk Management program. A complete list of our risk factors is disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Information Form.&lt;/p&gt;
			
					
						Risk
						
						
						Mitigation
					
					
						
						
					
					
						Market activity is lower than anticipated
								
							Lower market activity can translate into reduced waste volumes and weaker commodity prices, impacting returns on existing assets and our capacity to invest in organic growth capital.
						
						
						&#8226; Improve productivity.
							
                    &#8226; Develop new technologies that make our processes more effective and cost efficient.
							
                    &#8226; Grow onsite contract revenue to mitigate exposure to commodity prices.
							
                    &#8226; Maintain debt leverage to provide adequate financial flexibility.
							
                    &#8226; Utilize, as needed, proven defensive toolkit to manage costs and capital expenditures.
					
					
						Safety record 
							
                    Failure to meet customer safety standards while working on customer sites or at our facilities could result in limitations in our ability to maintain and secure new contracts.
						
						
						&#8226; Since 1993, safety has been established as one of our core values.
							
                    &#8226; Long standing history of safety excellence.
							
                    &#8226; Our Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") team works with operators, customers and regulators to ensure that we foster a culture of safety and prevention to ensure we maintain our strong record.
							
                    &#8226; Designs for facilities and onsite equipment are subject to strict hazards and operability studies and engineering practices.
					
					
						Competition
							
                    Competition can come from generators of waste processing streams internally or new third party waste processors entering the market.
						
						
						&#8226; We are well established in the industry with an excellent safety record and employee training.
							
                    &#8226; We have a strong customer focused approach and service differentiation to secure Newalta brand loyalty across all business lines. 
							
                    &#8226; Barriers to entry include facility network and infrastructure as well as regulatory permits. 
							
                    &#8226; Our facilities are optimally located near the point of waste generation and our network provides our customers with a backstop for process guarantees to better serve their needs.
							
                    &#8226; Our onsite services are targeted to facilitate customers managing their waste onsite.
					
					
						Changes in environmental regulations
							
                    Changes in environmental regulations also impact our business.
						
						
						&#8226; Generally, we have a positive bias to changes in environmental regulations as they provide opportunities for service expansion.
							
                    &#8226; We are actively engaged in the review of forthcoming legislation to ensure that our operations can adapt as needed and to ensure that we are prepared to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.
					
					
						Failure to commercialize identified technologies into our processes
							
                    Failure to commercialize new technologies could reduce our competitiveness.
						
						
						&#8226; We have a staged approach for developing technologies, which differentiates between proven and unproven technologies and ensures resources can be redeployed efficiently to other initiatives.
							
                    &#8226; Other initiatives include expansion of services and business development.
							
                    &#8226; Performance from our current assets employed is not contingent on the commercialization of the identified technologies.
					
					
						Organizational capabilities
							
                    Failure to effectively recruit, retain and integrate top talent in period of growth could negatively impact our ability to meet our long-term targets.
						
						
						&#8226; Develop our people through talent development programs which include customized leadership training and comprehensive on-boarding.
							
                    &#8226; Engage new employees in EHS training programs and Safety Leadership programs.
							
                    &#8226; Use of cross-functional training and teams to promote integration.
					
				&lt;p&gt;CORPORATE OVERVIEW &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong contributions from all divisions in the fourth quarter were partially offset by non-recurring charges of approximately $4.5 million. Fourth quarter revenue was $203.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $32.8 million, relatively flat compared to prior year. Net loss in the quarter was $10.3 million, compared to net earnings of $4.1 million in the prior year. Higher Divisional EBITDA and lower net finance charges were more than offset by non-cash restructuring related impairment charges. In Q4 2013, we recognized $21.2 million for impairment of certain assets related to planned facility closures and divestitures in the Industrial division.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expected Adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2013 to be approximately 20% higher than for the same period last year, based on commodity prices and drilling activity remaining at Q3 levels. Commodity prices were significantly lower in Q4 than in Q3 and results were also impacted by non-recurring charges. Adjusting for these factors, Adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2013 was up in excess of 20% over prior year, in line with management expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 revenue increased 8% to $783.4 million compared to prior year while Adjusted EBITDA was $150.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA, before non-recurring charges, was $156.0 million, up 10%, over 2012. This improvement was primarily driven by contributions from New Markets and Oilfield. Revenue from contracts (fee for service solutions with terms longer than one year and no direct commodity price exposure) generated 14% of annual consolidated revenue, compared to 10% in 2012. This improvement was largely driven by our Heavy Oil contracts. 2013 net earnings was $21.9 million, down 49% from 2012 due primarily to the non-cash restructuring related impairment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-recurring charges in the quarter and 2013 were $4.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Non-recurring charges included: charges for positions eliminated during the year; the settlement of an out of period disputed account; and U.S. employee compensation for previous periods as a result of a U.S. Federal Department of Labor ("DOL") settlement. 
        In 2013, the DOL reviewed our compensation structure for a misclassification of certain operating employees under the applicable labour standards. Our compensation package for U.S. employees was consistent with our Canadian pay structure. As a result of the DOL review, in Q4 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement and recognized $4.2 million for U.S. employee compensation:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				$2.2 million was charged to SGA for compensation related to prior years; and 
					
				$2.0 million was charged to New Markets for compensation related to 2013, including $0.5 million related to Q4 2013.  
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;New Markets revenue and gross profit in the quarter increased 19% and 4%, respectively, to $62.5 million and $17.7 million compared to prior year. Improved performance in the quarter was driven by growth in Heavy Oil. For the year, revenue and gross profit from New Markets increased 21% and 11%, respectively, to $227.6 million and $75.2 million compared to 2012. Strong returns from our growth capital investments, primarily our MFT contracts, drove improved performance in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oilfield revenue and gross profit in the quarter increased by 7% and 14%, respectively, to $47.5 million and $16.9 million compared to prior year. This improvement was driven by increased activity and growth capital contributions at our facilities. For the year, revenue and gross profit increased 2% and 13%, respectively, to $184.6 million and $69.7 million compared to 2012. Positive results at our facilities were driven by contributions from growth capital investments, increased volumes and improved commodity prices. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in drill site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial revenue in the quarter decreased by 8% to $93.8 million while gross profit increased by 62% to $11.6 million, compared to prior year. The improvement in gross profit was primarily driven by lower amortization at the Stoney Creek Landfill ("SCL") and contributions from Eastern Industrial. 2013 revenue and gross profit was $371.2 million and $43.7 million, respectively, relatively flat to prior year. Improved results from our processing facilities and onsite services were offset by lower contributions from our oil recycling services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA ($Millions):
				http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/NewaltaGraphs.pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, were $72.2 million and $171.1 million, respectively, focused primarily on growth capital projects in New Markets and Oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTLOOK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter 2014, we are poised for growth, supported by our growth capital program and the comprehensive review to improve productivity and profitability. We have initiated several actions related to this review and expect to see some benefits from these actions as early as Q1 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to Q1 2013, we are expecting Q1 2014 (excluding the impact of restructuring costs) to be significantly stronger across all three divisions. Commodity prices and drilling activity are expected to improve while volumes at SCL and Ville Ste-Catherine ("VSC") will be in line with our historical quarterly average. In Q1 2014, we expect Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA to increase, as it did in Q1 2013, due to timing of cash outflows related to our 2013 capital program; and then to steadily improve through the year to end 2014 at approximately 2.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, growth capital investments combined with profitability initiatives focused primarily on the Industrial Division and reductions in SGA, will drive strong returns and improved results over prior year. Our 2013 growth capital investments in satellites will deliver returns from six new satellites operational for most of the year, three in Canada and three in the US. In addition, our 2014 capital program includes the construction of five new satellites in Oilfield and the U.S. Improved market conditions and management initiatives are expected to drive improvements in both our oil recycling and drill site businesses. Activity levels at VSC, SCL and in the oil and gas sector are expected to be in line with 2013. Total Adjusted SGA will be approximately 10% of annualized revenue. We continue to focus on growing our portfolio of longer term contracts, strengthening our foundation of stable cash flow, and maximizing returns from our existing assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, we announced a comprehensive review to improve productivity and profitability, particularly in the Industrial Division and in SGA expenses across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have developed a plan focused on rationalizing our Eastern Industrial operations and related overhead. The plan includes redirecting lines of business, consolidations, closures and divestitures of certain facilities, as well as overhead reductions related to supporting impacted operations. We will execute the plan throughout 2014, though expect to implement the bulk of the plan in the first half of the year. Once implemented, we expect approximately $10 million in annualized ongoing cash savings and approximately $5 million in one-time cash restructuring costs. To date in Q1, we have taken actions that will deliver 60% of the identified savings, including closure of three facilities in eastern Canada and overhead reductions in associated support functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to SGA, we are assessing our current cost structure to align resources with business needs, and anticipate additional cost savings to those identified under the Industrial plan above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continue to assess our cost structure across all business lines and further actions may be implemented. Management will assess and update savings and cost estimates throughout the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - NEW MARKETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Markets includes a network of more than 10 locations with over 400 employees in western Canada and the U.S. New Markets' services involve the mobilization of equipment and our people to manage waste on our customers' sites; the processing of oilfield-generated wastes and the sale of recovered crude oil to our account at our locations. New Markets is organized into the Heavy Oil and U.S. business units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We operate onsite services in both Heavy Oil and U.S. Onsite services include: site remediation, dredging and dewatering and drill site processing equipment, including solids control and drill cuttings management. In Heavy Oil, we provide specialized onsite services using centrifugation for heavy oil producers involved in heavy oil mining and Steam-assisted gravity drainage ("SAGD") production. Our onsite services, excluding drill site, generally follow a similar sales cycle. We establish our market position through the execution of short-term projects which ideally may lead to longer term contracts, providing a more stable cash flow. The cycle to establish longer term contracts can be between 18 months to three years. Characteristics of projects and contracts are:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Projects:  non-recurring and/or seasonal services completed in less than one year, primarily completed between March and November and will vary from period-to-period, and 
					
				Contracts: generally are year round arrangements based on fee for service solutions with terms longer than one year, no direct commodity price exposure and may evolve from projects.

			&lt;p&gt;Q4 2013 revenue and gross profit from New Markets increased 19% and 4%, respectively, to $62.5 million and $17.7 million compared to prior year. Improved performance was driven by growth in Heavy Oil partially offset by non-recurring charges of $1.5 million related to the DOL settlement. Excluding the DOL settlement, Divisional EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was approximately 40%, in line with Q4 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 revenue and gross profit increased 21% and 11%, respectively, to $227.6 million and $75.2 million compared to prior year. Strong returns from our growth capital investments in Heavy Oil drove improved performance. Revenue from contracts (fee for service solutions with terms longer than one year and no direct commodity price exposure) generated 46% of annual divisional revenue, compared to 37% in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, we made significant progress on our New Market growth plans, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				invested over $68 million in growth capital to support our Heavy oil contracts and U.S. satellite expansion; 
					
				signed contract with Shell to process MFT; built, commissioned and began operations in the fall; 
					
				successfully extended winter operations through to the end of the year at the Syncrude MFT site; and 
					
				established three new satellites in the U.S., one in Eagle Ford and two in the Bakken. 
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;HEAVY OIL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy Oil is dedicated to serving both the oil sands in Alberta and the heavy oil region in Alberta and Saskatchewan. We began working in the heavy oil industry 18 years ago when we introduced centrifugation as a solution to treat waste oil emulsions. This business has expanded from processing heavy oil waste at facilities in our network to long-term contracts to process waste on our customers' site. Leveraging our facilities as staging areas, we deliver a broad range of specialized services at numerous customer sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy Oil revenue is primarily generated from:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Over the past five years we have worked with customers to develop specialized onsite services where revenue is generally based on processed volumes, with no exposure to crude oil prices for these services. In addition, these services create cost savings and provide more environmentally beneficial solutions for our customers. Growth in this business will come from further development of onsite services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q4 2013 revenue increased 32% compared to prior year due to increased volumes at our facilities and returns from growth capital invested in onsite. For the year, revenue increased 29% primarily driven by returns from growth capital invested, including our two contracts to process MFT. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Q4 2013 Oilfield revenue increased 7% while gross profit and divisional EBITDA increased 14% and 13%, respectively, compared to prior year. Results were positively impacted by strong contributions from growth capital investments and increased waste volumes. 2013 revenue was flat while gross profit increased 13% compared to the prior year. Strong contributions at our oilfield facilities from growth capital investments, increased waste volumes and improved commodity prices drove improved performance throughout the year. These gains were partially offset by a decline in drill site utilization. Drill site utilization was 24%, down from 41% in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, we made the following progress on our Oilfield growth plans, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				invested over $38 million in growth capital primarily focused on our satellite expansion and productivity improvements; 
					
				constructed three new satellites, one in Kindersley, SK which began operations mid-year, and another two in Shaunavon, SK and Waskada, MB which will begin operations in early 2014; 
					
				successfully commissioned a thermal solids processing technology at one our facilities expanding our service offerings; and 
					
				secured a strategic partner as part of our plan to recover our drill site business. Our alliance with Baroid, a Halliburton Product Service Line, will offer integrated onsite solutions for fluids and waste management in western Canada.

				"Divisional EBITDA" is a measure of the division's profitability and an indication of the results generated by the division's principal business activities prior to how the assets are amortized. Divisional EBITDA is the sum of gross profit and amortization.
				"Assets employed" is provided to assist management and investors in determining the effectiveness of the use of the assets at a divisional level. Assets employed is the sum of capital assets, intangible assets and goodwill allocated to each division. Assets employed as defined does not include capital assets held by corporate. Corporate assets include information technology, leasehold improvements and technical development. 2012 information has been restated to conform to current presentation.
				"Assets contributing" is provided to assist management and investors to understand how our capital spending contributes to our growth. It excludes assets related to growth capital projects not yet operational. 
				
			&lt;p&gt;Compared to Q4 2012, Q4 revenue decreased by 8% while Divisional EBITDA increased 10%. Results were primarily driven by contributions from Eastern Industrial, particularly VSC, which benefited from productivity initiatives and improved market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gross profit increased by 62% compared to Q4 2012, primarily due to lower amortization at SCL and contributions from Eastern Industrial. The decrease in amortization was primarily driven by an amendment to our landfill permit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 Industrial revenue and Divisional EBITDA was relatively flat to prior year. Results were weighed down by lower contributions in Q1 2013 due to reduced commodity prices and lower event-based business at SCL. Performance throughout the remainder of 2013 improved, with Divisional EBITDA for the last three quarters of 2013 up 8% over the same period in 2012. Results from our industrial processing facilities and onsite services drove this improvement and were tempered by lower contributions from our oil recycling services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assets employed and assets contributing declined by 5% and 3%, respectively, due largely to a $21.2 million restructuring related impairment charge recognized in Q4. This charge related to certain Eastern Industrial facilities planned for closure or sale in 2014 as part of the rationalization plan announced in December 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, we made the following progress in Industrial, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Q4 2013 Eastern Industrial revenue decreased 10% from Q4 2012. Growth at our processing facilities was more than offset by lower VSC revenue and SCL volumes due to timing. Q4 2013 VSC revenue decreased 21% due primarily to a shift in our tolling/direct mix towards tolling sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 Eastern Industrial revenue increased 6%. Strong results at industrial processing facilities and VSC were partially offset by somewhat lower volumes at SCL. VSC revenue increased 11% due to higher volumes and improved commodity pricing. Our tolling/direct mix was approximately 50/50 for 2013, consistent with 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

				Non-recurring items include prior year charges related to the DOL settlement, charges for positions eliminated during the period, and the settlement of an out of period disputed account. 
			&lt;p&gt;The above table removes stock-based compensation, amortization and non-recurring items from SGA to provide improved transparency with respect to the comparison of our results. In addition, SGA includes research and development expenses related to our Technical Development group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q4 2013 and 2013, Adjusted selling general and administrative ("Adjusted SGA") was up 30% and 18%, respectively, from the prior year. This increase was driven by non-recurring items and investments in people and people development to support our growth initiatives. Adjusted SGA before non-recurring items was 10.9% of our annual revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock-based compensation fluctuates based on the effects of vesting, volatility in our share price and dividend rate changes. Approximately 55% of stock-based compensation expense is estimated to be settled with equity, with the balance to be settled in cash. &lt;/p&gt;

				Reflects capitalized interest of $520 and $2,798 in Q4 2013 and 2013, respectively, and $1,595 and $4,664 in Q4 2012 and 2012, respectively.
				Relates to decommissioning liability.
				Relates to the early redemption feature for the Series 1 and 2 Senior Unsecured Debentures. 
			&lt;p&gt;For the quarter, the increase in finance charges before the gain on the embedded derivatives and the unwinding of the discount was primarily attributable to lower capitalized interest on growth investments and higher average debt levels. Compared to 2012, 2013 finance charges before the gain on the embedded derivatives and the unwinding of the discount were flat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-cash gain on the embedded derivatives is associated with the early redemption feature for the Series 1 and Series 2 Senior Unsecured Debentures (collectively the "Senior Unsecured Debentures") recognized during the quarter. This has no impact on current or future cash flows. The gain is an estimate of the fair value of the embedded derivatives and is primarily impacted by the risk-free rate, market volatility, and our credit spread.

				&lt;p&gt;In Q4, deferred tax recovery was $2.7 million compared to deferred tax expense of $0.7 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower pre-tax income as a result of restructuring related impairment. Deferred taxes were also impacted by several items including: changes in statutory and other rates; non-deductible items including stock-based compensation and the gain on embedded derivatives; and changes in estimates in respect of prior year tax pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 deferred taxes decreased to $6.0 million from $11.2 million in 2012, impacted by the same factors as the quarter. The effective tax rate was relatively flat to prior year. Our statutory tax rate in Canada was 25.75% for 2013 and was 25.72% in 2012. Loss carry forwards were approximately $145 million at December 31, 2013. We do not anticipate paying significant income tax until 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term liquidity refers to the speed with which a company's assets can be converted into cash, or its ability to do so, as well as cash on hand. Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial obligations that are settled by cash or another financial asset. Our liquidity risk may arise due to general day-to-day cash requirements and in the management of our assets, liabilities and capital resources. Liquidity risk is managed against our financial leverage to meet obligations and commitments in a balanced manner. For further information on our liquidity risk management, refer to Note 18 to the Financial Statements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our debt capital structure is as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;We continue to focus on managing our working capital accounts while supporting our growth. Working capital at December 31, 2013, was negative $1.8 million (December 31, 2012: $10.6 million). The change was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments at year end. At current activity levels, working capital is expected to be sufficient to meet our ongoing commitments and operational requirements of the business. We continue to manage working capital well within our prescribed targets, commensurate with activity levels. For further information on credit risk management, please refer to Note 18 to the Financial Statements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEBT RATINGS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DBRS Limited ("DBRS") and Moody's Investor Service, Inc.

				&lt;p&gt;SOURCES OF CASH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our liquidity needs can be sourced in several ways including: Funds from operations, borrowings against or increases in our Credit Facility, new debt instruments, the issuance of securities from treasury, return of letters of credit or replacement of letters of credit with other types of financial security and proceeds from the sale of assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CREDIT FACILITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At December 31, 2013, $117.1 million was available and undrawn to fund growth capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes, as well as to provide letters of credit to third parties for financial security up to a maximum amount of $60 million. The aggregate dollar amount of outstanding letters of credit is not categorized in the financial statements as long-term debt; however, the issued letters of credit reduce the amount available under the Credit Facility and are included in the definition of Total Debt for covenant purposes. Under the Credit Facility, surety bonds (including performance and bid bonds) to a maximum of $125 million are excluded from the definition of Total Debt. As at December 31, 2013, surety bonds issued and outstanding totalled $40.5 million. The principal borrowing amount within our credit facility is $250 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We renewed and extended our Credit Facility effective July 12, 2013. Key changes to the Credit Facility included extending it by one year, to July 12, 2016, increasing the amount available from $225 million to $250 million and improved pricing. Management may, at its option, request an extension of the Credit Facility on an annual basis. If no request to extend the Credit Facility is made by us, the entire amount of the outstanding indebtedness would be due in full on July 12, 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial performance relative to the financial ratio covenants(1) under the Credit Facility is reflected in the table below. &lt;/p&gt;

				We are restricted from declaring dividends if we are in breach of any covenants under our Credit Facility. 
				Senior Secured Debt means the Total Debt less the Senior Unsecured Debentures. 
				EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, the closest measure of which is net earnings. For the purpose of calculating the covenant, EBITDA is defined as the trailing twelve-months consolidated net income for Newalta before the deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash items (such as non-cash stock-based compensation and gains or losses on asset dispositions and any extraordinary items). Additionally, EBITDA is normalized for any acquisitions or dispositions as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. 
				Total Debt comprises outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility, including bank overdraft balance and the Senior Unsecured Debentures.
				
			&lt;p&gt;Our Total Debt was $382.9 million as at December 31, 2013, which reflected a $40.7 million increase over December 31, 2012. The Total Debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.54 is in line with Q3 2013 and slightly above Q4 2012 of 2.46. Our covenant ratios under the Credit Facility remained well within their thresholds. We will manage within our covenants throughout 2014 while our business plan target for Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio remains at approximately 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SENIOR UNSECURED DEBENTURES

			&lt;p&gt;We will manage within our covenants throughout 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USES OF CASH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our primary uses of funds include maintenance and growth capital expenditures as well as acquisitions, payment of dividends, operating and SGA expenses and the repayment of debt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAPITAL EXPENDITURES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Growth capital expenditures" or "growth and acquisition capital expenditures" are capital expenditures that are intended to improve our efficiency and productivity, allow us to access new markets and diversify our business. Growth capital, or growth and acquisition capital, are reported separately from maintenance capital because these types of expenditures are discretionary. "Maintenance capital expenditures" are capital expenditures to replace and maintain depreciable assets at current service levels. Maintenance capital expenditures are reported separately from growth activity because these types of expenditures are not discretionary and are required to maintain current operating levels. On an annual basis, maintenance capital, combined with repair and maintenance expense, (included in cost of sales), is approximately 8% of the value of property, plant and equipment. Maintenance capital and repair and maintenance expense combined, approximate amortization expense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the periods indicated are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

				The numbers in this table differ from Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the numbers above do not reflect the net change in working capital related to capital asset accruals. 
			&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, were $72.2 million and $171.1 million, respectively. Growth capital expenditures in the quarter and year primarily relate to equipment for our MFT contracts, satellite facilities, expansion at our Oilfield facilities and Technical Development. Maintenance capital expenditures relate primarily to process equipment improvements at our facilities. Capital expenditures in the quarter and year were funded from funds from operations and our credit facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the ongoing strength of our pipeline of capital projects and organic growth opportunities, particularly in New Markets and Oilfield, our 2014 capital budget is $180 million, with growth capital and maintenance expenditures of $145 million and $35 million, respectively. We will continue to invest in New Markets and Oilfield to drive strong returns and growth in our core growth areas. The capital program will be funded primarily by funds from operations. We expect to spend approximately 40% of the capital budget in the first half of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth expenditures will comprise of approximately $70 million for New Markets, $40 million for Oilfield, $8 million for Industrial and $12 million for onsite equipment, available to all divisions. The remaining $15 million in growth capital expenditures are for Technical Development and corporate investments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may revise the capital budget, from time-to-time, in response to changes in market conditions that materially impact our financial performance and/or investment opportunities. Management evaluates capital projects based on their internal rate of return, timing of payback, fit with our corporate strategy, and the risk associated with the projects, among other factors. Capital spending is prioritized towards projects that provide stable cash flows and where there is a high degree of certainty of completing the project on time and on budget. Of the total divisional growth capital expenditures over the last three years, 50% has been allocated to New Markets, 30% to Oilfield and 20% to Industrial. Going forward, we anticipate annual Industrial growth capital expenditures to be approximately 10% of the total divisional growth capital spend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management targets a three to four year cash flow payback on growth capital investments at the branch or project level, once capital is contributing. After allocation of supporting overheads, management targets a blended return of between four and five years on all growth capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management and the Board also review corporate and division return on capital metrics, applying traditional definitions of Return on Capital Employed ("ROCE"), (where we apply Net earnings plus tax adjusted interest as the numerator and Net Assets as the denominator), as well as a ROC - Cash and Divisional ROC as one of the means to evaluate overall effectiveness of our growth capital program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIVIDENDS AND SHARE CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In determining the dividend to be paid to our shareholders, the Board of Directors considers a number of factors, including: the forecasts for operating and financial results; maintenance and growth capital requirements; as well as market activity and conditions. After a review of all factors, the Board declared $6.1 million in dividends or $0.11 per share, paid January 15, 2014, to shareholders on record as at December 30, 2013.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As at February 20, 2014, Newalta had 55,452,192 shares outstanding, and outstanding options to purchase up to 4,018,334 shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

				&lt;p&gt;Quarterly performance is affected by, among other things, weather conditions, timing of onsite projects, the value of our products, foreign exchange rates, market demand and the timing of our growth capital investments as well as acquisitions and the contributions from those investments. Revenue from certain business units is impacted by seasonality. However, due to the diversity of our business, the impact is limited on a consolidated basis. For example, waste volumes received at our Oilfield facilities decline in the second quarter due to road bans which restrict drilling activity. This decline is offset by increased activity in our Eastern Industrial onsite business due to the aqueous nature of work performed, as well as potentially by fluctuations in the value of our products or event-based waste receipts at SCL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly results over the last two years were impacted by fluctuations in the share price, which impacts the stock-based compensation expense, non-cash gains or losses on the embedded derivatives and by commodity prices, with weaker commodity prices having a larger impact on Q2 2012, Q4 2012, Q1 2013 and Q4 2013. The timing of our Heavy Oil contracts also impacted quarterly results, with lower contributions in the winter months as experienced in Q1 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly revenue in 2012 grew, reflecting strong demand for our services. Compared to Q1, Q2 2012 net earnings increased significantly due to lower stock-based compensation expense and net finance charges. In Q2, Adjusted EBITDA was down due to the weaker commodity prices in the quarter and higher SGA expenses. Q3 2012 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA increased from growth in New Markets. Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 decreased from Q3 2012 due to changes in commodity prices, reduced oilfield activity and higher stock-based compensation expense. Net earnings for the second half of 2012 decreased due to higher stock-based compensation expense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2013 declined from Q4 2012 due to the impact of lower commodity pricing, timing of contracts and projects in New Markets, higher Adjusted SGA expenses, offset by improved performance in Oilfield and VSC. Net earnings increased as a result of lower stock-based compensation expense, net finance charges and deferred income taxes. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in Q2 2013 increased from Q1 2013 primarily due to timing of contracts and projects in New Markets and improved performance in Oilfield. Net earnings decreased due to higher stock-based compensation expense, net finance charges related to a non-cash loss on embedded derivatives and deferred income taxes. Strong year-over-year performance continued in Q3 2013. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 increased from Q2 driven primarily by contributions from our growth capital investments in New Markets and higher event-based business at SCL. Net earnings increased due to improved performance, lower net finance charges related to a non-cash loss on embedded derivatives, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes. Q4 results were impacted by restructuring related impairment, non-recurring charges, weaker commodity prices, and the timing of Heavy Oil contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY OF SEGMENTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SENSITIVITIES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our revenue is sensitive to changes in commodity prices for crude oil, base oils and lead. The direct impact of these commodity prices is reflected in the revenue received from the sale of products such as crude oil, base oils and lead. Approximately 20% of our revenue is sensitive to direct impact of commodity prices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results are also impacted by drilling activity. Drilling sensitivities are impacted by the area in which drilling occurs compared to areas which we operate and the drilling techniques employed. Where possible, we actively manage these impacts by strategically geographically balancing mobile assets to meet demand and shifts in activity levels where necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following table provides management's estimates of fluctuations in key inputs and prices and the direct impact on revenue from product sales and SGA:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Our stock-based compensation expense is sensitive to changes in our share price. At December 31, 2013, a $1 change in our share price between $15 per share and $20 per share has a $1.2 - $1.5 million direct impact on annual stock-based compensation reflected in SGA. We anticipate that approximately 45% of stock-based compensation will be settled in cash in future periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISK MANAGEMENT &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effectively manage the risk associated with our business and strategic objectives, our risk management approach continues to evolve. Our approach provides the framework to understand and address risks faced by our organization. Risk categories identified include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Strategic - risk to earnings, capital, and strategic objectives arising due to changes in the business environment 
					
				Operational - risk of loss due to failed internal processes and systems, human and technical errors, or external events 
					
				Financial - risk associated with financial processes, obligations, and assets 
					
				People - risk to Business Plan due to recruiting, training, labour availability, union relations, and managerial structure 
					
				Legal/Regulatory - risk of loss due to compliance with laws, ethical standards, and contractual obligations 
					
				Technology and Data - risk that IT systems are not adequate to support strategic and business objectives 
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Such estimates relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as transactions are settled in the future. Amounts recorded for amortization, accretion, future decommissioning obligations, embedded derivatives, deferred income taxes, valuation of warrants and impairment calculations are based on estimates. By their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty, and the impact of the difference between the actual and the estimated costs on the financial statements of future periods could be material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECOVERABILITY OF ASSET CARRYING VALUES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta assesses its property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill for impairment at the asset level and the cash generating unit ("CGU") level by comparing the carrying values of the assets or CGUs being tested with their recoverable amounts. The recoverable amounts are the greater of the assets' or CGUs' values in use or their fair values less costs to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carrying values of all assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances include items such as: significant changes in the manner in which an asset is used, including plans to restructure the operation to which an asset belongs, or plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date. The carrying values of our CGUs are tested annually for impairment. Judgment is required in the aggregation of assets into CGU's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The determination of the recoverable amount involves estimating the assets or CGU's fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use, which is based on its discounted future cash flows using an applicable discount rate. Future cash flows are calculated based on management's best estimate of future inflation and are discounted based on management's current assessment of market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, we announced our intention to streamline resources in the Industrial division through a rationalization of business lines and facilities in 2014. As a result of this initiative, we assessed the recoverable amount for certain assets directly impacted by this initiative to be lower than their carrying value and recognized $21.2 million for restructuring related impairment in Q4 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-tax asset impairment charge recognized in the Industrial division was allocated as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

				The total asset impairment charge contains $5.5 million which relates to assets which have been classified as held for sale at December 31, 2013.
				
			&lt;p&gt;As at December 31, 2012, there was no impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECOMMISSIONING LIABILITY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta recognizes a provision for future remediation and post abandonment activities in the consolidated financial statements as the net present value of the estimated future expenditures required to settle the estimated future obligation at the balance sheet date. The recorded liability increases over time to its future amount through unwinding of the discount. The measurement of the decommissioning liability involves the use of estimates and assumptions including the discount rate, the expected timing of future expenditures and the amount of future abandonment costs. Decommissioning estimates are reviewed annually and estimated by management, in consultation with Newalta's engineers and environmental, health and safety staff, on the basis of current regulations, costs, technology and industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revisions to the estimated amount or timing of the obligations are reflected prospectively as increases or decreases to the recorded liability and the related asset. Actual decommissioning expenditures, up to the recorded liability at the time, are drawn against the liability as the costs are incurred. Amounts capitalized to the related assets are amortized to income in line with the depreciation of the underlying asset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAIR VALUE CALCULATION ON SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AND SHARE APPRECIATION RIGHTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have one share-based compensation plan (the "Option Plan"). Under the Option Plan, we may grant to directors, officers, employees and consultants of Newalta or any of its affiliates, options to acquire up to 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of Newalta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fair value of share-based payments is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, depending on the characteristics of the share-based payment. There are a number of estimates used in the calculation such as the future forfeiture rate, expected option life and the future price volatility of the underlying security which can vary from actual future events. The factors applied in the calculation are management's best estimates based on historical information and future forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may also grant share appreciation rights ("SARs") to directors, officers, employees and consultants of Newalta or any of its affiliates. SARs entitle the holder thereof to receive cash from Newalta in an amount equal to the positive difference between the grant price and the trading price of our common shares on the exercise date. The grant price is calculated based on the five-day volume weighted average trading price of our common shares on the TSX. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fair value at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model method with the share-based compensation expense recognized over the vesting period of the options. There are a number of estimates used in the calculation such as the future forfeiture rate, expected option life and the future price volatility of the underlying security which can vary from actual future events. The factors applied in the calculation are management's best estimates based on historical information and future forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAXATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calculation of deferred income taxes is based on a number of assumptions including estimating the future periods in which temporary differences, tax losses and other tax credits will reverse. Tax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimated fair value of derivative instruments resulting in financial assets and liabilities, by their very nature, are subject to measurement uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEASES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta makes judgments in determining whether certain leases, in particular those with long contractual terms where the lessee is the sole user and Newalta is the lessor, are operating or finance leases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVENUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta may enter into arrangements with customers which contain multiple elements in which revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when earned based on the relative fair value of each unit of accounting as determined by internal or third party analyses of market-based prices. Significant judgment is required to allocate contract consideration to each unit of accounting and determine whether the arrangement is a single unit of accounting or a multiple element arrangement. Depending upon how such judgment is exercised, the timing and amount of revenue recognized could differ significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We adopted the following standards for the first time in the financial year beginning January 1, 2013. There have been no material impacts upon adoption:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;BUSINESS RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Prior to making any investment decision regarding Newalta, investors should carefully consider, among other things, the risks described herein (including the risks and uncertainties listed on the front page of this MDA and throughout this MDA) and the risk factors set forth in the most recently filed Annual Information Form of Newalta which are incorporated by reference herein. For further information on our risk management framework, please refer to the section on Risk Management.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Annual Information Form is available through the internet on the Canadian System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ("SEDAR") which can be accessed at www.sedar.com. Copies of the Annual Information Form may be obtained, on request without charge, from Newalta Corporation at 211 - 11th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2R 0C6, or by facsimile at (403) 806-7032. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINANCIAL AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carrying values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate the fair value of these financial instruments due to their short term maturities. Our credit risk from our customers is mitigated by our broad customer base and diverse product lines. Historically, on an annual basis, our top 25 customers generate approximately 45% of our total revenue, with 10% of these customers having a credit rating of A or higher and 55% of these customers having ratings of BBB or higher. In the normal course of operations, we are exposed to movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates relative to the Canadian dollar. The foreign exchange risk arises primarily from U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt and working capital. We have not entered into any financial derivatives to manage the risk for the foreign currency exposure as at December 31, 2013. Management assesses our working capital foreign exchange exposure regularly and may draw U.S. denominated long-term debt as required, which serves as a natural hedge, to mitigate our balance sheet exposure.  The floating interest rate profile of our long-term debt exposes us to interest rate risk. We do not use hedging instruments to mitigate this risk. The carrying value of the senior secured long-term debt approximates fair value due to its floating interest rates. For further information regarding our financial and other instruments, please refer to Note 18 to the Financial Statements in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer (collectively the "Certifying Officers") have evaluated the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting using the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As of December 31, 2013, the Certifying Officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were effective. There have not been any changes in the internal control over financial reporting in Q4 of 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional information relating to Newalta, including the Annual Information Form, is available through the internet on the SEDAR, which can be accessed at www.sedar.com.

				&lt;p&gt;NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the three months and years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Unaudited - all tabular data in thousands of Canadian Dollars except per share and ratio data)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 1. CORPORATE STRUCTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta Corporation (the "Corporation" or "Newalta") was incorporated on October 29, 2008, pursuant to the laws of the Province of Alberta. Newalta completed an internal reorganization resulting in a name change from Newalta Inc. to Newalta Corporation effective January 1, 2010. Newalta provides cost-effective solutions to industrial customers to improve their environmental performance with a focus on recycling and recovery of products from industrial residues. These services are provided both through our network of facilities across Canada and at our customers' facilities where we mobilize our equipment and people to process material directly onsite. Our customers operate in a broad range of industries including oil and gas, petrochemical, refining, lead, manufacturing and mining industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These consolidated financial statements ("Financial Statements") were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and include the accounts of Newalta and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions including revenue and expenses were eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on February 20, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critical judgments and estimate uncertainties in applying accounting policies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense for the period. Such estimates relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as transactions are settled in the future. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are applied prospectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) The following are the critical judgments that management made in applying Newalta's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Determining components under multiple element revenue agreements;
            Determining whether agreements not in the legal form of a lease, contain a lease;
            Determining whether certain leases, are operating or finance leases;
            Determining the aggregation of assets into cash generating units ("CGUs");
            Determining key assumptions for impairment testing;
            Determining the existence of contingent liabilities or whether an outflow of resources is probable and this needs to be accounted for as a provision; 
			&lt;p&gt;(ii) The following sections contain critical estimates and assumptions with the most significant effect on amounts recognized in the financial statements. They are discussed further in the accounting policies that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Revenue (Note 2k)
				Recoverability of asset carrying values for impairment testing purposes (Note 2i and 5)
				Fair value determination of stock-based payments (Note 2o and 9)
				Income Tax (Note 2m and 10)
				Decommissioning liability (Note 2j and 11)
				Derivative instruments (Note 2p and 17)
				
			&lt;p&gt;BASIS OF PREPARATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial statements were prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principal accounting policies are set out below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a)
				Cash &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash is defined as cash and short-term deposits with maturities of three months or less, when purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) Offsetting Financial Instruments &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported on the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) Inventories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inventories are comprised of oil, lead and other recycled products, spare parts and supplies, and are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventories are valued using the weighted average costing method. Cost of finished goods includes the laid down cost of materials plus the cost of direct labour applied to the product and the applicable share of overhead expense. Cost of other items of inventories comprise the laid down cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d) Property, plant and equipment &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment. Amortization rates are calculated to amortize the costs, net of residual value, over the assets' estimated useful lives. Significant parts of property, plant and equipment that have different depreciable lives are amortized separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant and equipment is principally depreciated at rates of 5-10% of the declining balance (buildings, site improvements, tanks and mobile equipment) or from 5-14 years straight line (vehicles, computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements), depending on the expected life of the asset. Some equipment is depreciated based on utilization rates. The utilization rate is determined by dividing the cost of the asset by the estimated future hours of service. Residual values, up to 20% of original cost, may be established for buildings, site improvements, and onsite equipment. These residual values are not depreciated. The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landfill assets represent the costs of landfill available space, including original acquisition cost, incurred landfill construction and development costs, including leachate collection systems installed during the operating life of the site, and capitalized landfill closure and post-closure costs. The cost of landfill assets, together with projected landfill construction and development costs for permitted capacity plus unpermitted capacity that management believes is probable of ultimately being permitted, is amortized on a per-unit basis as landfill space is consumed. The impact on annual amortization expense of changes in estimated capacity and construction costs is accounted for prospectively. Management annually updates landfill capacity estimates which include permitted and unpermitted but probable capacities. Estimates are based on survey information provided by independent engineers, and projected landfill construction and development costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta applies the following criteria for evaluating the probability of obtaining a permit for additional capacity, which provides management with a basis to evaluate the likelihood of success of unpermitted expansions:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Management has submitted the application and expects to receive all necessary approvals to accept waste.
            At the time the expansion is included in Newalta's estimate of the landfill's useful economic life, it is probable that the required approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located.
            Additional capacity and related additional costs, including permitting, final closure and post-closure costs, were estimated based on the conceptual design of the proposed expansion. 
			&lt;p&gt;e) Permits and other intangible assets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permits and other intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment, and consist of certain production processes, trademarks, permits and agreements which are amortized over the period of the contractual benefit of 8 to 30 years on a straight line basis. Certain permits are deemed to have indefinite lives and therefore are not amortized. There are nominal fees to renew these permits provided that Newalta remains in good standing with regulatory authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;f) Assets held for sale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale, and are reported in prepaid and other assets on the balance sheet, when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and a sale is considered highly probable. Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of net book value and fair value less costs to sell. Once classified as held for sale, amortization is no longer recorded on the assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;g) Leases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lessee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of Newalta's leases are classified as operating leases therefore the leased assets are not recognized in Newalta's consolidated balance sheets. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of Newalta's benefit, including any rent-free periods. Lease incentives are recognized as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leases may include additional payments for real estate taxes, maintenance and insurance. These amounts are expensed in the period to which they relate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lessor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assets subject to operating leases are recognized and classified according to the nature of the leased asset. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and expensed over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income. The depreciation policy for leased assets is consistent with the depreciation policy for similar owned assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;h) Goodwill &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of acquired businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i) Impairment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impairment testing compares the carrying values of the assets or CGUs being tested with their recoverable amounts (recoverable amounts being the greater of the assets' or CGUs' values in use or their fair values less costs to sell). Value in use is assessed using the present value of the expected future cash flows of the relevant asset. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the asset is tested as part of a CGU, which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The key assumptions for the value in use calculation include discount and growth rate estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows based on the best information available as of the date of the impairment test. The weighted average growth rates reflect a nominal inflationary rate as required by IFRS that is calculated over the remaining useful life of each asset or CGU. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual CGUs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impairment losses are immediately recognized to the extent that the asset or CGU carrying values exceed their recoverable amounts. Should the recoverable amounts for previously impaired assets or CGUs subsequently increase, the impairment losses previously recognized (other than in respect of goodwill) may be reversed to the extent that the reversal is not a result of "unwinding of discount" and that the resulting carrying value does not exceed the carrying value that would have been the result if no impairment losses had been previously recognized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asset impairment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carrying values of all assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances include items such as: significant changes in the manner in which an asset is used, including plans to restructure the operation to which an asset belongs, or plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CGU impairment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carrying values of Newalta's CGUs are tested annually for impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to CGUs expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. To the extent that the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the excess would first reduce the carrying value of goodwill and any remainder would reduce the carrying values of the long-term assets of the CGUs on a pro-rated basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management has determined that Newalta's CGUs are: Industrial West business unit, Industrial East business unit, Ville Ste-Catherine ("VSC") business unit, Oilfield division, Heavy Oil business unit and United States ("U.S.") business unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;j) Provisions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provisions are recognized when Newalta has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that Newalta will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of that obligation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decommissioning liabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta provides for estimated future decommissioning costs for all its facilities based on the useful lives of the assets and the long-term commitments of certain sites. Over this period, Newalta recognizes the liability for the future decommissioning liabilities associated with property, plant and equipment. These obligations are initially measured at the discounted future value of the liability. This value is capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset and amortized over the asset's useful life. The balance of the liability is adjusted each period for the unwinding of the discount, with the associated expense included within finance charges. Decommissioning costs and timing are estimated by management, in consultation with Newalta's engineers and environmental, health and safety staff, on the basis of current regulations, costs, technology and industry standards. Other key estimates include discount and inflation rates. Actual decommissioning costs are charged against the provision as incurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;k) Revenue recognition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods and/or delivery of services have transferred to the buyer, recoverability of consideration is probable, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, Newalta retains no continuing managerial involvement with the goods, and the costs required to complete the contract can be estimated reliably. Revenue is measured net of returns and trade discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta offers individual services, products and integrated solutions to meet customer needs. Integrated solutions may involve the delivery of multiple services and products occurring in different reporting periods. As appropriate, these multiple element arrangements are separated into components and consideration is allocated based upon their relative fair values. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual and integrated solutions may include one or more of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) Sale of Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's waste processing services are generally sold based upon service orders or contracts with a customer that include fixed or determinable prices based upon hourly, daily, or throughput rates. Revenue is recognized when services are rendered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ii) Sale of Products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Newalta's sale of recycled and recovered waste products is recognized when products are delivered to customers or pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iii) Construction Contracts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction contract revenue results from some of Newalta's onsite projects. Construction revenue includes the initial amount negotiated in the contract plus any change in terms of scope of work performed. If costs can be measured reliably, revenue is recognized based on the stage of completion of the contract, determined by the physical portion of work performed. Otherwise, construction revenue will be recognized to the extent contract costs are likely to be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iv) Operating Leases &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating lease revenue is derived from some of Newalta's onsite projects. Lease accounting is applied to a component of a contract if it conveys the right of use of a specific asset to a customer but does not convey the risks and/or benefits of ownership. Revenue from operating leases is recognized over the processing period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;l) Research and development &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research and development costs are incurred in the design, testing and commercialization of Newalta's products and services. Research costs, other than capital expenditures, are expensed as incurred. The costs incurred in developing new technologies are expensed as incurred unless they meet the criteria under IFRS for deferral and amortization. These costs will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the product, commencing with commercial production. In the event that a product program for which costs were deferred is modified or cancelled, Newalta will assess the recoverability of the deferred costs and if considered unrecoverable, will expense the costs in the period the assessment is made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;m) Income Tax&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the statements of operations, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta and its wholly-owned subsidiaries follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Current income tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured based upon temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred income tax expense is computed based on the change during the year in the deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Effects of changes in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when substantively enacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the benefits from tax losses and deductions with no accounting basis, provided those benefits are probable to be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the tax laws and rates that are anticipated to apply in the period of estimated realization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;n) Earnings per share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adding the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year to the additional shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares had been issued, using the "treasury stock" method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o) Stock-based incentive plans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Corporation's stock-based incentive plans consist of stock options, stock appreciation rights and share units, and are granted to executives, employees and non-employee directors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta has one active stock-based option incentive plan (the "Option Plan"). Under the Option Plan, Newalta may grant to directors, officers, employees and consultants of Newalta or any of its affiliates, rights to acquire up to 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Corporation (the "Shares").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, the Board of Directors modified the Option Plan to eliminate the ability for option holders to settle options for cash. As a result of this change, the stock based compensation liability relating to stock options was reclassified to contributed surplus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Option Plan is equity settled. The fair value of options at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model method with the stock-based compensation expense recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense ("SGA") that is recognized over the vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus. When options are exercised, the proceeds, together with the amount recorded in contributed surplus, are transferred to shareholders' capital. Forfeitures are estimated and accounted for at the grant date and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock appreciation rights ("SARs")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARs entitle the holder to receive cash from Newalta in an amount equal to the positive difference between the grant price and the trading price of the Shares on the exercise date. The grant price is calculated based on the five-day volume weighted average trading price of the Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange. SARs generally expire five years after they are granted and the vesting period is determined by the Board of Directors of Newalta. The fair value at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model method with the stock-based compensation expense recognized over the vesting period of the options and recorded as SGA with a corresponding entry to accrued liabilities or other liabilities. The fair value is subsequently re-measured at the end of each reporting period. Forfeitures are estimated and accounted for at the grant date and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share units&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta has a cash-settled Deferred Share Unit ("DSU") plan that exists for non-executive directors. Under this plan, notional DSUs are granted annually and vest immediately. The measurement of the compensation expense and corresponding liability for these awards is based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as a stock-based compensation expense which is recorded as a SGA with a corresponding increase in accrued liabilities. Dividend equivalent grants, if any, are recorded as stock-based compensation expense in the period the dividend is paid. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized in earnings. Each DSU entitles the holder to receive a cash payment equal to the five-day volume weighted average trading price of the Shares preceding the date of redemption. The DSUs may only be redeemed within the period beginning on the date a holder ceases to be a participant under the plan and ending on December 31 of the following calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cash-settled Performance Share Unit ("PSU") plan has been established for officers and other eligible employees. Under this plan, notional PSUs are granted based on corporate performance criterion and vest no later than December 31 of the third year after the year to which the relevant PSU was granted. Each vested PSU entitles the holder to receive a cash payment equal to the five-day volume weighted average trading price of the Shares preceding the date of redemption multiplied by a vesting factor. The vesting factor is based on performance conditions established by the Board of Directors prior to the date of grant of the PSU. The stock-based compensation expense of the PSUs is recorded as SGA on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding entry to either accrued liabilities or other liabilities. This estimated value is adjusted each period based on the period-end trading price of the Shares and an estimated vesting factor, with any changes in the fair value of the liability being recognized in earnings. Dividend equivalent grants, if any, are recorded as stock-based compensation expense in the period the dividend is paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p) Financial instruments Classification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's financial instruments are classified into one of four categories and are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured as noted in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Cash and accounts and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables. Senior secured debt, senior unsecured debentures, bank indebtedness, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable and other liabilities are classified as financial liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta categorizes its financial instruments carried at fair value into one of three different levels, depending on the significance of inputs employed in their measurement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level 1 includes assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. An active market for an asset or liability is considered to be a market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Newalta's cash, "AFS" investments, and senior unsecured debentures are classified as level 1 financial instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level 2 includes valuations determined using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1. Financial instruments in this category are valued using models or other industry standard valuation techniques derived from observable market data. Such valuation techniques include inputs such as quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors and broker quotes that can be observed or corroborated in the market for the entire duration of the derivative instrument. Instruments valued using Level 2 inputs include the embedded derivative within the senior unsecured debentures, held-for-trading investments, and senior secured debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level 3 includes valuations based on inputs which are less observable, unavailable or where the observable data does not support a significant portion of the instruments' fair value. Generally, Level 3 valuations are longer dated transactions, occur in less active markets, occur at locations where pricing information is not available or have no binding broker quote to support Level 2 classification. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, Newalta did not have any Level 3 assets or liabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embedded derivatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The embedded derivatives are classified at fair value through profit and loss ("FVTPL"). They were valued using the option adjusted spread ("OAS") model, which requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. They are valued at fair value upon initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized through finance charges in the consolidated statement of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction costs incurred with respect to the credit facility are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the facility. The asset is recognized in prepaid expenses and other assets on the balance sheet while the amortization is included in financing charges within net income. Transaction costs associated with other financial liabilities are netted against the related liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impairment of financial assets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment were affected.&lt;/p&gt;

						Other financial assets
						
						
						Carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account
						
						
					
				&lt;p&gt;q) Functional and presentation currency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the Corporation's subsidiaries is measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Corporation's functional currency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon consolidation, the financial statements of the subsidiary that have a functional currency different from that of the Corporation are translated into Canadian dollars whereby assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates (as this is considered a reasonable approximation of actual rates), and gains and losses in translation are recognized in the shareholders' equity section as accumulated other comprehensive income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Corporation were to dispose of its entire interest in a foreign operation, or to lose control, joint control, or significant influence over a foreign operation, the foreign currency gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income related to the foreign operation would be recognized in net earnings. If the Corporation were to dispose of part of an interest in a foreign operation which remains a subsidiary, a proportionate amount of foreign currency gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income related to the subsidiary would be reallocated between controlling and non-controlling interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;r) Borrowing costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset form part of the cost of that asset. A qualifying asset requires a period of six months or greater to be prepared for its intended use or sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;s) Recent pronouncements issued&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following standards were adopted by Newalta for the first time in the financial year beginning January 1, 2013. There have been no material impacts upon adoption:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				IFRS 10, "Consolidated Financial Statements"
            IFRS 11, "Joint Arrangements"
            IFRS 12, "Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities"
            IFRS 13, "Fair Value Measurement" 
			&lt;p&gt;A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2014, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. None of these are expected to have a material impact on Newalta's financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 3.

				Due to increased capacity and decreased future estimated costs realized in July 2013, the amortization rate per metric tonne (MT) for Stoney Creek landfill has decreased from approximately $13/MT to $6/MT.
				
			&lt;p&gt;a) Borrowing costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, Newalta capitalized $0.8 million and $2.8 million respectively, (for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012 - $1.6 million and $4.7 million respectively) of borrowing costs to qualifying assets using a capitalization rate of 5.86% and 5.96% respectively (December 31, 2012 - 6.25% and 6.3% respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) Assets held for sale
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assets held for sale of $2.5 million as at December 31, 2013 includes land and buildings of $0.9 million and equipment of $1.4 million relating to planned sales of facilities and assets in the Industrial division. It was determined at December 31, 2013 that the sale of these facilities assets and/or their operations was highly probable, therefore the carrying amount of the assets has been reclassified to current assets, within prepaid expenses and other assets on the balance sheet. The fair value measurement for the disposal group has been categorized as a Level 2 fair value based on market inputs that are observable for the assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) Restructuring related impairment
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, Newalta announced their intention to streamline resources in the Industrial division through a rationalization of business lines and facilities in 2014. This initiative resulted in Newalta recording a non-cash impairment loss of $21.2 million. The recoverable amount of $10.3 million was based on fair value less costs to sell. The company used an expected future cash flow approach with a risk adjusted discount rate of 11.6% on a pre-tax basis. The fair value measurement for the asset impairment charge has been categorized as a Level 3 fair value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-tax asset impairment charge was allocated as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;CGU impairment &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In assessing goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment at December 31, 2013 and 2012, Newalta compared the aggregate recoverable amount of the assets included in the CGUs to their respective carrying amounts. The recoverable amount was determined based on the value in use of the CGUs, using growth rates reflective of previous years growth, excluding future growth capital spending and associated revenues. There was no impairment at the CGU level as at December 31, 2013 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key assumptions included the following:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;On June 17, 2013, Newalta entered into an amended and restated extendible revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility"). The maturity of this Credit Facility is July 12, 2016. The principal borrowing amount was increased from $225 million to $250 million. There were no other significant changes to the terms of the Credit Facility. Newalta may, at its option, request an extension of the credit facility on an annual basis. If no request to extend the Credit Facility is made by Newalta, the entire amount of the outstanding indebtedness would be due in full on July 12, 2016. The Credit Facility also requires Newalta to be in compliance with certain covenants. As at December 31, 2013 and 2012, Newalta was in compliance with all covenants (Note 13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, the weighted average interest rate on senior secured debt was 2.98% and 3.12%, respectively, (for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012 - 3.29% and 3.56% respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 8.

				&lt;p&gt;Series 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 23, 2010, Newalta issued $125.0 million of 7.625% series 1 senior unsecured debentures ("series 1"). The series 1 debentures mature on November 23, 2017. The series 1 debentures bear interest at 7.625% per annum and such interest is payable in equal instalments semi-annually in arrears on May 23 and November 23 in each year. The series 1 debentures are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to any subordinated debt that may be issued by Newalta or any of its subsidiaries. The series 1 debentures are effectively subordinated to all secured debt to the extent of collateral on such debt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November 23, 2013, the series 1 debentures are redeemable at the option of Newalta, in whole or in part, at redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount, plus in each case accrued interest to the redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on November 23 of the years as follows: Year 2013 - 103.813%; Year 2014 - 102.542%; Year 2015 - 101.906%; Year 2016 and thereafter - 100%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a change of control occurs, Newalta will be required to offer to purchase all or a portion of each debenture holder's series 1 debentures, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the series 1 debentures offered for repurchase plus accrued interest to the date of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Series 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 14, 2011, Newalta issued $125.0 million of 7.75% series 2 senior unsecured debentures ("series 2"). The series 2 debentures mature on November 14, 2019. The series 2 debentures bear interest at 7.75% per annum and such interest is payable in equal instalments semi-annually in arrears on May 14 and November 14 in each year, commencing on May 14, 2012. The series 2 debentures are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to any subordinated debt that may be issued by Newalta or any of its subsidiaries. The series 2 debentures are effectively subordinated to all secured debt to the extent of collateral on such debt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to November 14, 2015, Newalta may on one or more occasions: &lt;/p&gt;

				Redeem the series 2 debentures, in whole or in part, at a redemption price which is equal to the greater of (a) the Canada Yield Price (as defined in the trust indenture) and (b) 101% of the aggregate principal amount of series 2 debentures redeemed, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;After November 14, 2015, the series 2 debentures are redeemable at the option of Newalta, in whole or in part, at redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount, plus in each case accrued interest to the redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on November 14 of the years as follows: Year 2015 - 103.875%; Year 2016 - 101.938%; Year 2017 and thereafter - 100%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a change of control occurs, Newalta will be required to offer to purchase all or a portion of each debenture holder's series 2 debentures, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the series 2 debentures offered for repurchase plus accrued interest to the date of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 9.

				Incentive Plan Liabilities
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As at December 31, 2013, the total liability related to the Corporation's incentive plans was $10.4 million, with $7.9 million classified as current and $2.5 million classified as non-current (December 31, 2012 total incentive plan liabilities of $27.0 million, with $22.8 million classified as current and $4.2 million classified as non-current). The current liability associated with the Corporation's incentive plans is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the balance sheet. Non-current liability is recorded in Other liabilities on the balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, the Board of Directors modified the Option Plan to eliminate the ability for option holders to settle options for cash. As a result of this change, the stock based compensation liability of $12.6 million relating to stock options was reclassified to contributed surplus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 10. INCOME TAX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

				&lt;p&gt;NOTE 11. RECONCILIATION OF DECOMMISSIONING LIABILITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future decommissioning liability was estimated by management based on the anticipated costs to abandon and reclaim facilities and wells, and the projected timing of these expenditures. The net present value of this amount, $61.1 million (December 31, 2012 - $78.9 million) was accrued and recorded in decommissioning liability on the balance sheet at December 31, 2013. The estimated future cost for decommissioning liability at December 31, 2013, was $327.0 million over an expected range up to 200 years. Effective July 1, 2013, a permit amendment decreased the future obligation at Stoney Creek landfill. Newalta used the Bank of Canada's long term bond rate of 3.20% as at December 31, 2013 (December 31, 2012 - 2.37%) and an inflation rate of 2% (December 31, 2012 - 2%) to calculate the present value of the decommissioning liability with the exception of Stoney Creek landfill for which we used a discount rate of 6% (December 31, 2012 - 6%).

			&lt;p&gt;Management and the Board of Directors review and assess Newalta's capital structure and dividend policy at least at each regularly scheduled board meeting which are held at a minimum four times annually. The financial strategy may be adjusted based on the current outlook of the underlying business, the capital requirements to fund growth initiatives and the state of the debt and equity capital markets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Newalta may:&lt;/p&gt;

				We are restricted from declaring dividends if we are in breach of any covenants under our credit facility.
				Senior secured debt means the total debt less the senior unsecured debentures. 
				EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, the closest measure of which is net earnings. For the purpose of calculating the covenant, EBITDA is defined as the trailing twelve months consolidated net income for Newalta before the deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash items (such as non-cash stock-based compensation and gains or losses on asset dispositions).

			&lt;p&gt;NOTE 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic earnings per share calculations for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the respective years. Diluted earnings per share include the potential dilution of outstanding options under incentive plans to acquire shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calculation of diluted earnings per share does not include anti-dilutive options. These options would not be exercised during the period because their exercise price is higher than the average market price for the period. The inclusion of these options would cause the diluted earnings per share to be overstated. The number of excluded options for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 952,500 (680,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;b) Enertech Partnership Agreement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Newalta contributed $1.2 million to the Enertech Partnership Agreement. Newalta is contingently committed to capital contributions up to a maximum of $7.0 million over the 10 year investment period. The investment is classified as held-for-trading and is recorded in other long-term assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As at December 31, 2013, Newalta had issued letters of credit and surety bonds in respect of compliance with environmental licenses in the amount of $16.2 million and $40.5 million, respectively ($16.0 million and $43.8 million as at December 31, 2012).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 17.

The fair values of Newalta's financial instruments that are included in the consolidated balance sheets, with the exception of the debentures, approximate their recorded amount due to the short-term nature of those instruments for cash, bank indebtedness, accounts and other receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable, senior secured debt and the note receivable, due to the floating nature of the interest rate applicable to these instruments.

				&lt;p&gt;Embedded derivatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior unsecured debentures have early redemption features at values based on percentages of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Due to the redemption rates being fixed, an embedded derivative exists when compared to current market rates. Newalta estimates the fair value of the embedded derivatives using a valuation model that considers the current bond prices and spreads associated with the senior unsecured debentures. Newalta has recognized gains of $3.4 million and $3.0 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, respectively (for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012 - $1.3 million and $13.4 million) and has determined the fair value of the embedded derivative for the senior unsecured debentures to be $17.1 million as at December 31, 2013. A corresponding embedded derivative asset was included within other long-term assets on the balance sheet. Subsequent changes in fair value will be included in finance charges on the consolidated statements of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offsetting financial instruments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain waste processing revenue sources entitle customers to credits on the sale of recovered products.

				&lt;p&gt;Credit risk and economic dependence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta is subject to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable balances. No single customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2013, (one customer balance represented 10% as at December 31, 2012). Newalta views the credit risks on these amounts as normal for the industry. Credit risk is minimized by Newalta's broad customer base and diverse product lines, and is mitigated by the ongoing assessment of the credit worthiness of its customers as well as monitoring the amount and age of balances outstanding. Newalta's assessment of credit risk has remained unchanged from the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Newalta's largest customer represented 11% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 (10% for the year ended December 31, 2012). This revenue is recognized within the Industrial division. No other customer's revenue exceeded 10% for the period presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the nature of operations, established collection history and industry norms, receivables are not considered past due until 90 days after invoice date, although standard payment terms require payment within 30 to 90 days. Depending on the nature of the service and/or product, customers may be provided with extended payment terms while Newalta gathers certain processing or disposal data. Included in the Corporation's trade receivable balance, are receivables totaling $5.7 million (December 31, 2012 - $5.0 million), which are considered to be outstanding beyond normal repayment terms at December 31, 2013. A provision of $1.1 million (December 31, 2012 - $0.5 million) has been established as an allowance for doubtful accounts. No additional provision has been made as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered collectible. Newalta does not hold any collateral over these balances but may hold credit insurance for specific non-domestic customer accounts. Total accounts receivable of $149.0 million is comprised of $120.6 million of trade receivables, accrued receivables of $20.2 million and other receivables of $8.2 million.  &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;To determine the recoverability of a trade receivable, management analyzes accounts receivable, first identifying customer groups that represent minimal risk (large oil and gas and other low risk large companies, governments and municipalities). Impairment of the remaining accounts is determined by identifying specific accounts that are at risk, and then by applying a formula based on aging to the remaining amounts receivable. All amounts identified as at risk are provided for in an allowance for doubtful accounts. The changes in this account for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Liquidity risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors of Newalta, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Corporation's short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. Management mitigates liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and other borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Newalta's assessment of liquidity risk has remained unchanged from the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest rate risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that its credit facility has a variable interest rate. Management does not enter into any derivative contracts to manage the exposure to variable interest rates. The senior unsecured debentures have fixed interest rates until their maturity dates, at which point, any remaining amounts owing under these debentures will need to be repaid or refinanced. Newalta's assessment of interest rate risk has remained unchanged from the prior year. The table below provides an interest rate sensitivity analysis to net earnings as at period end:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Market risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of Newalta's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Newalta is exposed to foreign exchange market risk. Foreign exchange risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment, recognized asset or liability will fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The risk arises primarily from U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt and working capital. As at December 31, 2013, Newalta had $13.6 million in net working capital and $10 million in long-term debt both denominated in U.S. dollars. Management has not entered into any financial derivatives to manage the risk for the foreign currency exposure as at December 31, 2013. Newalta's assessment of market risk has remained unchanged from the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The table below provides a foreign currency sensitivity analysis to net earnings on long-term debt and working capital outstanding as at period end:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;NOTE 22. SEGMENTED INFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2013, Newalta reorganized the reporting structure into three divisions - New Markets, Oilfield and Industrial. These divisions constitute Newalta's reportable segments. The reportable segments were reorganized to improve alignment of operations for customers, to create an optimum management structure for expected growth and to provide improved disclosure to investors. The reportable segments are distinct strategic business units whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Corporation's executive officers in order to assess financial performance and make resource allocation decisions. The reportable segments have separate operating management and operate in distinct competitive and regulatory environments. &lt;/p&gt;
			
				The New Markets segment includes mobilization of equipment and staff to process waste at our customer sites, the processing of oilfield-generated wastes including treatment, water disposal, landfilling, and the sale of recovered crude oil; site remediation, centrifugation, dredging and dewatering, and the supply and operation of drill site processing equipment, including solids control and drill cuttings management. 
					
				The Oilfield segment includes the processing of oilfield-generated wastes including treatment and disposal, water disposal, clean oil terminalling, custom treating, the sale of recovered crude oil and the supply and operation of drill site processing equipment, including solids control and drill cuttings management. 
					
				The Industrial segment includes oil recycling services, lead battery recycling, landfilling of non-hazardous solid waste and the processing of industrial wastes including collection, treatment and disposal.

			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter of 2014, Newalta initiated a restructuring plan which will reduce operating expenses and SGA going forward. This decision is consistent with Newalta's ongoing strategy to improve productivity and profitability within the Industrial division and SGA. Total costs related to restructuring operations will be determined as the plan is finalized. The restructuring plan and related costs are anticipated to be substantially realized by December 31, 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Management Commentary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our start to the year was weak, weighed down by reduced market demand and lower prices for our products, however, performance improved as the year progressed," said Al Cadotte, President and CEO of Newalta. "In the final three quarters of 2013, before non-recurring items Adjusted EBITDA grew by 20 percent over the prior year. The last three quarters are indicative of the results we expect from our business plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the fourth quarter, improved performance across all of our operations was offset by non-recurring charges of about $4.5 million. For the year, Adjusted EBITDA excluding non-recurring charges, was $156.0 million, up 10 percent compared to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continued to advance our growth plans in 2013 with several notable achievements:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				We increased our long-term onsite contract revenue base to 14 percent of revenue in 2013, up from 10 percent in 2012.&#160; 
					
				We commissioned our first U.S. satellite facility mid-year and we constructed two more that will be operational in Q1 of 2014. 
					
				Our mature fine tailings ("MFT") project with Syncrude Canada Ltd. exceeded expectations with operations starting up in May 2013 and continuing through to the end of the year. We also constructed and commissioned our Shell Canada Ltd. MFT contract on budget and on schedule. 
					
				We commissioned one satellite facility at mid-year in our Oilfield Division and constructed two more for commissioning in Q1 of 2014. 
					
				We signed a development agreement with DuPont Canada to demonstrate a new wastewater process. Construction is now complete and the unit will be operational in early 2014. 
					
				We increased our quarterly dividend 10 percent compared to last year. 
					
				Late in the year, we began a comprehensive review of our Industrial Division with actions planned predominately in the first quarter of 2014 to drive improved profitability and higher investment returns.&#160;
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;"The improvements we are making to the profitability of the Industrial Division, and the reductions we will achieve in SGA costs combined with the contributions from our 2013 growth capital investments will all contribute to much improved results in 2014.&#160;We expect a strong start to the year with first quarter performance well ahead of last year. This will set the stage for a strong year of growth, profitability and attractive shareholder returns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth quarter revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were relatively flat compared to prior year. Contributions from all divisions increased; however, gains were offset by non-recurring charges of approximately $4.5 million.&#160;Net loss in the quarter was $10.3 million, compared to net earnings of $4.1 million in the prior year.&#160;Higher Divisional EBITDA and lower net finance charges were more than offset by non-cash restructuring related impairment charges.&#160;In Q4 2013, we recognized $21.2 million for impairment of certain assets related to the planned facility closures and divestitures in the Industrial division.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 revenue increased 8% to $783.4 million compared to prior year while Adjusted EBITDA was $150.1 million.&#160;Adjusted EBITDA before non-recurring charges was $156.0 million, up 10% over 2012.&#160;Improved performance was primarily driven by contributions from New Markets and Oilfield. 2013 net earnings was $21.9 million, down 49% from 2012 due primarily to the non-cash restructuring related impairment.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-recurring charges in the quarter and 2013 were $4.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively.&#160;Non-recurring charges included: charges for positions eliminated during the year; the settlement of an out of period disputed account; and U.S. employee compensation for previous periods as a result of a U.S. Federal Department of Labor ("DOL") settlement.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the DOL reviewed our compensation structure for a misclassification of certain operating employees under the applicable labour standards.&#160;Our compensation package for U.S. employees was consistent with our Canadian pay structure.&#160;As a result of the DOL review, in Q4 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement and recognized $4.2 million for U.S. employee compensation:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				$2.2 million was charged to SGA for compensation related to prior years; and 
					
				$2.0 million was charged to New Markets for compensation related to 2013, including $0.5 million related to Q4 2013.&#160;
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;Other Highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.11 per share ($0.44 per share annualized) paid January 15, 2014 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, were $72.2 million and $171.1 million, respectively, focused primarily on growth capital projects in New Markets and Oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the ongoing strength of our pipeline of capital projects and organic growth opportunities, particularly in New Markets and Oilfield, our 2014 capital budget is $180 million, with growth capital and maintenance expenditures of $145 million and $35 million, respectively.&#160;We will continue to invest in New Markets and Oilfield to drive strong returns and growth in our core growth areas. The capital program will be funded primarily by funds from operations. We expect to spend approximately 40% of the capital budget in the first half of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2014, we formed an alliance with Halliburton Canada to offer tailored onsite services, specializing in drilling fluids and waste management services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, we announced a comprehensive review to improve productivity and profitability, particularly in the Industrial Division and in SGA expenses across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have developed a plan focused on rationalizing our Eastern Industrial operations and related overhead. The plan includes redirecting lines of business, consolidations, closures and divestitures of certain facilities, as well as overhead reductions related to supporting impacted operations. We will execute the plan throughout 2014, and expect to implement the bulk of the plan in the first half of the year. Once implemented, we expect approximately $10 million in annualized ongoing cash savings and approximately $5 million in one-time cash restructuring costs. To date, we have taken actions that will deliver 60 percent of the identified savings, including closure of three facilities in eastern Canada and overhead reductions in associated support functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to SGA, we are assessing our current cost structure to align resources with business needs, anticipating incremental cost savings to those identified under the industrial plan above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continue to assess our cost structure across all business lines and further actions may be implemented.&#160;We will assess and update savings and cost estimates throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amendment to By-laws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, today the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the by-laws of Newalta that requires shareholders to give advanced notice to Newalta of any proposal to nominate directors for election to the Board of Directors in circumstances where nominations are made other than by requisitioning a meeting or making a shareholder proposal, each pursuant to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta).&#160; The amendment to the by-laws is effective immediately. Shareholders will be asked to confirm and ratify the amended by-laws at the next annual and special meeting of shareholders to be held on May 7, 2014. A copy of the amended by-laws is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly Conference Call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management will hold a conference call on Friday, February 21, 2014 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss Newalta's performance for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2013.

			&lt;p&gt;NEWALTA - WHO WE ARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta is North America's leading provider of innovative, engineered environmental solutions that enable customers to reduce disposal, enhance recycling and recover valuable resources from industrial residues.&#160;We serve customers onsite directly at their operations and through a network of 85 locations in Canada and the U.S.&#160;Our proven processes, portfolio of more than 250 operating permits and excellent record of safety make us the first choice provider of sustainability enhancing services to oil, natural gas, petrochemical, refining, lead, manufacturing and mining markets.&#160;With a skilled team of more than 2,200 people, a two decade track record of profitable expansion and commitment to commercializing new solutions, Newalta is positioned for sustained future growth and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following section contains forward looking information as it outlines our strategic focus for our business plan. Our business plan is based on several key assumptions including growth capital contributions, commodity prices and activity levels of the industries we serve. Changes to these assumptions could cause our actual results to differ materially from the plan outlined below. Please refer to the Sensitivities section for a summary of the key metrics used to derive our plan and the Capital Expenditures section for an understanding of our expected returns from growth capital projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRATEGY:
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter 2014, we continue to focus on maximizing shareholder returns through low risk growth investments that provide the highest returns and stable cash flows and on improving operational fitness to maximize the profitability of our core operations.&#160;In line with this focus and as part of our business planning process, we have revised our growth capital plan over the plan period and expect to spend approximately $150 to $200 million in growth capital each year.&#160;Our growth capital investments will drive strong performance and attractive returns in the years ahead.&#160;Over the plan period to 2017, we expect a 15% and 20% compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively.&#160;We will continue to increase contracts as a percentage of revenue to be in excess of 20% by the end of the plan.&#160;Adjusted SGA will improve towards 8% of annual revenue by the end of 2017 and we will continue to work towards a debt leverage ratio of 2.0.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our key priorities for 2014 and 2015 are:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;RISKS TO OUR STRATEGY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we remain optimistic about our long-term outlook, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties in carrying out our activities.

						Risk
						&#160;
						Mitigation
					
					
						&#160;
					
					
						Market activity is lower than anticipated
								
							Lower market activity can translate into reduced waste volumes and weaker commodity prices, impacting returns on existing assets and our capacity to invest in organic growth capital.
						&#160;
						&#8226; Improve productivity.
							
                    &#8226; Develop new technologies that make our processes more effective and cost efficient.
							
                    &#8226; Grow onsite contract revenue to mitigate exposure to commodity prices.
							
                    &#8226; Maintain debt leverage to provide adequate financial flexibility.
							
                    &#8226; Utilize, as needed, proven defensive toolkit to manage costs and capital expenditures.
					
					
						Safety record 
							
                    Failure to meet customer safety standards while working on customer sites or at our facilities could result in limitations in our ability to maintain and secure new contracts.
						&#160;
						&#8226; Since 1993, safety has been established as one of our core values.
							
                    &#8226; Long standing history of safety excellence.
							
                    &#8226; Our Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") team works with operators, customers and regulators to ensure that we foster a culture of safety and prevention to ensure we maintain our strong record.
							
                    &#8226; Designs for facilities and onsite equipment are subject to strict hazards and operability studies and engineering practices.
					
					
						Competition
							
                    Competition can come from generators of waste processing streams internally or new third party waste processors entering the market.
						&#160;
						&#8226; We are well established in the industry with an excellent safety record and employee training.
							
                    &#8226; We have a strong customer focused approach and service differentiation to secure Newalta brand loyalty across all business lines. 
							
                    &#8226; Barriers to entry include facility network and infrastructure as well as regulatory permits. 
							
                    &#8226; Our facilities are optimally located near the point of waste generation and our network provides our customers with a backstop for process guarantees to better serve their needs.
							
                    &#8226; Our onsite services are targeted to facilitate customers managing their waste onsite.
					
					
						Changes in environmental regulations
							
                    Changes in environmental regulations also impact our business.
						&#160;
						&#8226; Generally, we have a positive bias to changes in environmental regulations as they provide opportunities for service expansion.
							
                    &#8226; We are actively engaged in the review of forthcoming legislation to ensure that our operations can adapt as needed and to ensure that we are prepared to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.
					
					
						Failure to commercialize identified technologies into our processes
							
                    Failure to commercialize new technologies could reduce our competitiveness.
						&#160;
						&#8226; We have a staged approach for developing technologies, which differentiates between proven and unproven technologies and ensures resources can be redeployed efficiently to other initiatives.
							
                    &#8226; Other initiatives include expansion of services and business development.
							
                    &#8226; Performance from our current assets employed is not contingent on the commercialization of the identified technologies.
					
					
						Organizational capabilities
							
                    Failure to effectively recruit, retain and integrate top talent in period of growth could negatively impact our ability to meet our long-term targets.
						&#160;
						&#8226; Develop our people through talent development programs which include customized leadership training and comprehensive on-boarding.
							
                    &#8226; Engage new employees in EHS training programs and Safety Leadership programs.
							
                    &#8226; Use of cross-functional training and teams to promote integration.
					
				&lt;p&gt;CORPORATE OVERVIEW &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong contributions from all divisions in the fourth quarter were partially offset by non-recurring charges of approximately $4.5 million. Fourth quarter revenue was $203.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $32.8 million, relatively flat compared to prior year.&#160;Net loss in the quarter was $10.3 million, compared to net earnings of $4.1 million in the prior year.&#160;Higher Divisional EBITDA and lower net finance charges were more than offset by non-cash restructuring related impairment charges.&#160;In Q4 2013, we recognized $21.2 million for impairment of certain assets related to planned facility closures and divestitures in the Industrial division. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expected Adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2013 to be approximately 20% higher than for the same period last year, based on commodity prices and drilling activity remaining at Q3 levels.&#160;Commodity prices were significantly lower in Q4 than in Q3 and results were also impacted by non-recurring charges. Adjusting for these factors, Adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2013 was up in excess of 20% over prior year, in line with management expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 revenue increased 8% to $783.4 million compared to prior year while Adjusted EBITDA was $150.1 million.&#160;Adjusted EBITDA, before non-recurring charges, was $156.0 million, up 10%, over 2012.&#160;This improvement was primarily driven by contributions from New Markets and Oilfield. Revenue from contracts (fee for service solutions with terms longer than one year and no direct commodity price exposure) generated 14% of annual consolidated revenue, compared to 10% in 2012. This improvement was largely driven by our Heavy Oil contracts.&#160;2013 net earnings was $21.9 million, down 49% from 2012 due primarily to the non-cash restructuring related impairment.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-recurring charges in the quarter and 2013 were $4.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively.&#160;Non-recurring charges included: charges for positions eliminated during the year; the settlement of an out of period disputed account; and U.S. employee compensation for previous periods as a result of a U.S. Federal Department of Labor ("DOL") settlement.&#160;
        In 2013, the DOL reviewed our compensation structure for a misclassification of certain operating employees under the applicable labour standards.&#160;Our compensation package for U.S. employees was consistent with our Canadian pay structure.&#160;As a result of the DOL review, in Q4 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement and recognized $4.2 million for U.S. employee compensation:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				$2.2 million was charged to SGA for compensation related to prior years; and 
					
				$2.0 million was charged to New Markets for compensation related to 2013, including $0.5 million related to Q4 2013.&#160; 
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;New Markets revenue and gross profit in the quarter increased 19% and 4%, respectively, to $62.5 million and $17.7 million compared to prior year.&#160;Improved performance in the quarter was driven by growth in Heavy Oil.&#160;For the year, revenue and gross profit from New Markets increased 21% and 11%, respectively, to $227.6 million and $75.2 million compared to 2012.&#160;Strong returns from our growth capital investments, primarily our MFT contracts, drove improved performance in 2013.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oilfield revenue and gross profit in the quarter increased by 7% and 14%, respectively, to $47.5 million and $16.9 million compared to prior year. This improvement was driven by increased activity and growth capital contributions at our facilities.&#160;For the year, revenue and gross profit increased 2% and 13%, respectively, to $184.6 million and $69.7 million compared to 2012.&#160;Positive results at our facilities were driven by contributions from growth capital investments, increased volumes and improved commodity prices.&#160;This improvement was partially offset by a decline in drill site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial revenue in the quarter decreased by 8% to $93.8 million while gross profit increased by 62% to $11.6 million, compared to prior year.&#160;The improvement in gross profit was primarily driven by lower amortization at the Stoney Creek Landfill ("SCL") and contributions from Eastern Industrial.&#160;2013 revenue and gross profit was $371.2 million and $43.7 million, respectively, relatively flat to prior year. Improved results from our processing facilities and onsite services were offset by lower contributions from our oil recycling services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA ($Millions):&#160;http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/NewaltaGraphs.pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, were $72.2 million and $171.1 million, respectively, focused primarily on growth capital projects in New Markets and Oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTLOOK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter 2014, we are poised for growth, supported by our growth capital program and the comprehensive review to improve productivity and profitability.&#160;We have initiated several actions related to this review and expect to see some benefits from these actions as early as Q1 2014.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to Q1 2013, we are expecting Q1 2014 (excluding the impact of restructuring costs) to be significantly stronger across all three divisions. Commodity prices and drilling activity are expected to improve while volumes at SCL and Ville Ste-Catherine ("VSC") will be in line with our historical quarterly average. In Q1 2014, we expect Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA to increase, as it did in Q1 2013, due to timing of cash outflows related to our 2013 capital program; and then to steadily improve through the year to end 2014 at approximately 2.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, growth capital investments combined with profitability initiatives focused primarily on the Industrial Division and reductions in SGA, will drive strong returns and improved results over prior year.&#160;Our 2013 growth capital investments in satellites will deliver returns from six new satellites operational for most of the year, three in Canada and three in the US.&#160;In addition, our 2014 capital program includes the construction of five new satellites in Oilfield and the U.S. Improved market conditions and management initiatives are expected to drive improvements in both our oil recycling and drill site businesses. Activity levels at VSC, SCL and in the oil and gas sector are expected to be in line with 2013.&#160;Total Adjusted SGA will be approximately 10% of annualized revenue. We continue to focus on growing our portfolio of longer term contracts, strengthening our foundation of stable cash flow, and maximizing returns from our existing assets.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, we announced a comprehensive review to improve productivity and profitability, particularly in the Industrial Division and in SGA expenses across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have developed a plan focused on rationalizing our Eastern Industrial operations and related overhead. The plan includes redirecting lines of business, consolidations, closures and divestitures of certain facilities, as well as overhead reductions related to supporting impacted operations. We will execute the plan throughout 2014, though expect to implement the bulk of the plan in the first half of the year. Once implemented, we expect approximately $10 million in annualized ongoing cash savings and approximately $5 million in one-time cash restructuring costs. To date in Q1, we have taken actions that will deliver 60% of the identified savings, including closure of three facilities in eastern Canada and overhead reductions in associated support functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to SGA, we are assessing our current cost structure to align resources with business needs, and anticipate additional cost savings to those identified under the Industrial plan above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continue to assess our cost structure across all business lines and further actions may be implemented. Management will assess and update savings and cost estimates throughout the year.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - NEW MARKETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Markets includes a network of more than 10 locations with over 400 employees in western Canada and the U.S.&#160;New Markets' services involve the mobilization of equipment and our people to manage waste on our customers' sites; the processing of oilfield-generated wastes and the sale of recovered crude oil to our account at our locations.&#160;New Markets is organized into the Heavy Oil and U.S. business units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We operate onsite services in both Heavy Oil and U.S.&#160;Onsite services include: site remediation, dredging and dewatering and drill site processing equipment, including solids control and drill cuttings management. In Heavy Oil, we provide specialized onsite services using centrifugation for heavy oil producers involved in heavy oil mining and Steam-assisted gravity drainage ("SAGD") production. Our onsite services, excluding drill site, generally follow a similar sales cycle.&#160;We establish our market position through the execution of short-term projects which ideally may lead to longer term contracts, providing a more stable cash flow.&#160;The cycle to establish longer term contracts can be between 18 months to three years.&#160;Characteristics of projects and contracts are:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Projects: &#160;non-recurring and/or seasonal services completed in less than one year, primarily completed between March and November and will vary from period-to-period, and 
					
				Contracts:&#160;generally are year round arrangements based on fee for service solutions with terms longer than one year, no direct commodity price exposure and may evolve from projects.&#160;

			&lt;p&gt;Q4 2013 revenue and gross profit from New Markets increased 19% and 4%, respectively, to $62.5 million and $17.7 million compared to prior year.&#160;Improved performance was driven by growth in Heavy Oil partially offset by non-recurring charges of $1.5 million related to the DOL settlement.&#160;Excluding the DOL settlement, Divisional EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was approximately 40%, in line with Q4 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 revenue and gross profit increased 21% and 11%, respectively, to $227.6 million and $75.2 million compared to prior year. Strong returns from our growth capital investments in Heavy Oil drove improved performance.&#160;Revenue from contracts (fee for service solutions with terms longer than one year and no direct commodity price exposure) generated 46% of annual divisional revenue, compared to 37% in 2012.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, we made significant progress on our New Market growth plans, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;HEAVY OIL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy Oil is dedicated to serving both the oil sands in Alberta and the heavy oil region in Alberta and Saskatchewan.&#160;We began working in the heavy oil industry 18 years ago when we introduced centrifugation as a solution to treat waste oil emulsions. This business has expanded from processing heavy oil waste at facilities in our network to long-term contracts to process waste on our customers' site. Leveraging our facilities as staging areas, we deliver a broad range of specialized services at numerous customer sites.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy Oil revenue is primarily generated from:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Q4 2013 Oilfield revenue increased 7% while gross profit and divisional EBITDA increased 14% and 13%, respectively, compared to prior year.&#160;Results were positively impacted by strong contributions from growth capital investments and increased waste volumes.&#160;2013 revenue was flat while gross profit increased 13% compared to the prior year.&#160;Strong contributions at our oilfield facilities from growth capital investments, increased waste volumes and improved commodity prices drove improved performance throughout the year.&#160;These gains were partially offset by a decline in drill site utilization.&#160;Drill site utilization was 24%, down from 41% in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, we made the following progress on our Oilfield growth plans, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				invested over $38 million in growth capital primarily focused on our satellite expansion and productivity improvements;

			&lt;p&gt;Compared to Q4 2012, Q4 revenue decreased by 8% while Divisional EBITDA increased 10%. Results were primarily driven by contributions from Eastern Industrial, particularly VSC, which benefited from productivity initiatives and improved market conditions.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gross profit increased by 62% compared to Q4 2012, primarily due to lower amortization at SCL and contributions from Eastern Industrial.&#160;The decrease in amortization was primarily driven by an amendment to our landfill permit.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 Industrial revenue and Divisional EBITDA was relatively flat to prior year. Results were weighed down by lower contributions in Q1 2013 due to reduced commodity prices and lower event-based business at SCL.&#160;Performance throughout the remainder of 2013 improved, with Divisional EBITDA for the last three quarters of 2013 up 8% over the same period in 2012. Results from our industrial processing facilities and onsite services drove this improvement and were tempered by lower contributions from our oil recycling services.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assets employed and assets contributing declined by 5% and 3%, respectively, due largely to a $21.2 million restructuring related impairment charge recognized in Q4.&#160;This charge related to certain Eastern Industrial facilities planned for closure or sale in 2014 as part of the rationalization plan announced in December 2013.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, we made the following progress in Industrial, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				initiated a comprehensive review with a focus on improving returns with plans to streamline, realign resources, and rationalize business lines and facilities;&#160;

			&lt;p&gt;The above table removes stock-based compensation, amortization and non-recurring items from SGA to provide improved transparency with respect to the comparison of our results.&#160;In addition, SGA includes research and development expenses related to our Technical Development group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q4 2013 and 2013, Adjusted selling general and administrative ("Adjusted SGA") was up 30% and 18%, respectively, from the prior year.&#160;This increase was driven by non-recurring items and investments in people and people development to support our growth initiatives.&#160;Adjusted SGA before non-recurring items was 10.9% of our annual revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock-based compensation fluctuates based on the effects of vesting, volatility in our share price and dividend rate changes.&#160;Approximately 55% of stock-based compensation expense is estimated to be settled with equity, with the balance to be settled in cash. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For the quarter, the increase in finance charges before the gain on the embedded derivatives and the unwinding of the discount was primarily attributable to lower capitalized interest on growth investments and higher average debt levels.&#160;Compared to 2012, 2013 finance charges before the gain on the embedded derivatives and the unwinding of the discount were flat.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-cash gain on the embedded derivatives is associated with the early redemption feature for the Series 1 and Series 2 Senior Unsecured Debentures (collectively the "Senior Unsecured Debentures") recognized during the quarter.&#160;This has no impact on current or future cash flows.&#160;The gain is an estimate of the fair value of the embedded derivatives and is primarily impacted by the risk-free rate, market volatility, and our credit spread.&#160;See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for further information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance charges associated with the Senior Unsecured Debentures include annual coupon rates of 7.625% and 7.75% as well as the accretion of issue costs and gains or losses on the embedded derivatives for both series. &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;In Q4, deferred tax recovery was $2.7 million compared to deferred tax expense of $0.7 million in the prior year.&#160;The decrease was driven primarily by lower pre-tax income as a result of restructuring related impairment.&#160;Deferred taxes were also impacted by several items including: changes in statutory and other rates; non-deductible items including stock-based compensation and the gain on embedded derivatives; and changes in estimates in respect of prior year tax pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 deferred taxes decreased to $6.0 million from $11.2 million in 2012, impacted by the same factors as the quarter.&#160;The effective tax rate was relatively flat to prior year.&#160;Our statutory tax rate in Canada was 25.75% for 2013 and was 25.72% in 2012.&#160;Loss carry forwards were approximately $145 million at December 31, 2013.&#160;We do not anticipate paying significant income tax until 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term liquidity refers to the speed with which a company's assets can be converted into cash, or its ability to do so, as well as cash on hand.&#160;Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial obligations that are settled by cash or another financial asset.&#160;Our liquidity risk may arise due to general day-to-day cash requirements and in the management of our assets, liabilities and capital resources.&#160;Liquidity risk is managed against our financial leverage to meet obligations and commitments in a balanced manner.&#160;For further information on our liquidity risk management, refer to Note 18 to the Financial Statements.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our debt capital structure is as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;We continue to focus on managing our working capital accounts while supporting our growth.&#160;Working capital at December 31, 2013, was negative $1.8 million (December 31, 2012:&#160;$10.6 million).&#160;The change was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments at year end. At current activity levels, working capital is expected to be sufficient to meet our ongoing commitments and operational requirements of the business.&#160;We continue to manage working capital well within our prescribed targets, commensurate with activity levels.&#160;For further information on credit risk management, please refer to Note 18 to the Financial Statements.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEBT RATINGS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DBRS Limited ("DBRS") and Moody's Investor Service, Inc.

				&lt;p&gt;SOURCES OF CASH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our liquidity needs can be sourced in several ways including: Funds from operations, borrowings against or increases in our Credit Facility, new debt instruments, the issuance of securities from treasury, return of letters of credit or replacement of letters of credit with other types of financial security and proceeds from the sale of assets.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CREDIT FACILITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At December 31, 2013, $117.1 million was available and undrawn to fund growth capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes, as well as to provide letters of credit to third parties for financial security up to a maximum amount of $60 million.&#160;The aggregate dollar amount of outstanding letters of credit is not categorized in the financial statements as long-term debt; however, the issued letters of credit reduce the amount available under the Credit Facility and are included in the definition of Total Debt for covenant purposes.&#160;Under the Credit Facility, surety bonds (including performance and bid bonds) to a maximum of $125 million are excluded from the definition of Total Debt.&#160;As at December 31, 2013, surety bonds issued and outstanding totalled $40.5 million. The principal borrowing amount within our credit facility is $250 million.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We renewed and extended our Credit Facility effective July 12, 2013.&#160;Key changes to the Credit Facility included extending it by one year, to July 12, 2016, increasing the amount available from $225 million to $250 million and improved pricing.&#160;Management may, at its option, request an extension of the Credit Facility on an annual basis.&#160;If no request to extend the Credit Facility is made by us, the entire amount of the outstanding indebtedness would be due in full on July 12, 2016.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial performance relative to the financial ratio covenants(1) under the Credit Facility is reflected in the table below. &lt;/p&gt;

				Senior Secured Debt means the Total Debt less the Senior Unsecured Debentures.&#160;
				EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, the closest measure of which is net earnings.&#160;For the purpose of calculating the covenant, EBITDA is defined as the trailing twelve-months consolidated net income for Newalta before the deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash items (such as non-cash stock-based compensation and gains or losses on asset dispositions and any extraordinary items).&#160;Additionally, EBITDA is normalized for any acquisitions or dispositions as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period.&#160;
				Total Debt comprises outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility, including bank overdraft balance and the Senior Unsecured Debentures.
				
			&lt;p&gt;Our Total Debt was $382.9 million as at December 31, 2013, which reflected a $40.7 million increase over December 31, 2012.&#160;The Total Debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.54 is in line with Q3 2013 and slightly above Q4 2012 of 2.46.&#160;Our covenant ratios under the Credit Facility remained well within their thresholds.&#160;We will manage within our covenants throughout 2014 while our business plan target for Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio remains at approximately 2.0.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SENIOR UNSECURED DEBENTURES

				The numbers in this table differ from Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the numbers above do not reflect the net change in working capital related to capital asset accruals. 
			&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, were $72.2 million and $171.1 million, respectively.&#160;Growth capital expenditures in the quarter and year primarily relate to equipment for our MFT contracts, satellite facilities, expansion at our Oilfield facilities and Technical Development.&#160;Maintenance capital expenditures relate primarily to process equipment improvements at our facilities.&#160;Capital expenditures in the quarter and year were funded from funds from operations and our credit facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the ongoing strength of our pipeline of capital projects and organic growth opportunities, particularly in New Markets and Oilfield, our 2014 capital budget is $180 million, with growth capital and maintenance expenditures of $145 million and $35 million, respectively.&#160;We will continue to invest in New Markets and Oilfield to drive strong returns and growth in our core growth areas. The capital program will be funded primarily by funds from operations. We expect to spend approximately 40% of the capital budget in the first half of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth expenditures will comprise of approximately $70 million for New Markets, $40 million for Oilfield, $8 million for Industrial and $12 million for onsite equipment, available to all divisions. The remaining $15 million in growth capital expenditures are for Technical Development and corporate investments.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may revise the capital budget, from time-to-time, in response to changes in market conditions that materially impact our financial performance and/or investment opportunities.&#160;Management evaluates capital projects based on their internal rate of return, timing of payback, fit with our corporate strategy, and the risk associated with the projects, among other factors.&#160;Capital spending is prioritized towards projects that provide stable cash flows and where there is a high degree of certainty of completing the project on time and on budget.&#160;Of the total divisional growth capital expenditures over the last three years, 50% has been allocated to New Markets, 30% to Oilfield and 20% to Industrial.&#160;Going forward, we anticipate annual Industrial growth capital expenditures to be approximately 10% of the total divisional growth capital spend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management targets a three to four year cash flow payback on growth capital investments at the branch or project level, once capital is contributing.&#160;After allocation of supporting overheads, management targets a blended return of between four and five years on all growth capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management and the Board also review corporate and division return on capital metrics, applying traditional definitions of Return on Capital Employed ("ROCE"), (where we apply Net earnings plus tax adjusted interest as the numerator and Net Assets as the denominator), as well as a ROC - Cash and Divisional ROC as one of the means to evaluate overall effectiveness of our growth capital program.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIVIDENDS AND SHARE CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In determining the dividend to be paid to our shareholders, the Board of Directors considers a number of factors, including: the forecasts for operating and financial results; maintenance and growth capital requirements; as well as market activity and conditions. After a review of all factors, the Board declared $6.1 million in dividends or $0.11 per share, paid January 15, 2014, to shareholders on record as at December 30, 2013.&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As at February 20, 2014, Newalta had 55,452,192 shares outstanding, and outstanding options to purchase up to 4,018,334 shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

				&lt;p&gt;Quarterly performance is affected by, among other things, weather conditions, timing of onsite projects, the value of our products, foreign exchange rates, market demand and the timing of our growth capital investments as well as acquisitions and the contributions from those investments.&#160;Revenue from certain business units is impacted by seasonality.&#160;However, due to the diversity of our business, the impact is limited on a consolidated basis.&#160;For example, waste volumes received at our Oilfield facilities decline in the second quarter due to road bans which restrict drilling activity.&#160;This decline is offset by increased activity in our Eastern Industrial onsite business due to the aqueous nature of work performed, as well as potentially by fluctuations in the value of our products or event-based waste receipts at SCL.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly results over the last two years were impacted by fluctuations in the share price, which impacts the stock-based compensation expense, non-cash gains or losses on the embedded derivatives and by commodity prices, with weaker commodity prices having a larger impact on Q2 2012, Q4 2012, Q1 2013 and Q4 2013.&#160;The timing of our Heavy Oil contracts also impacted quarterly results, with lower contributions in the winter months as experienced in Q1 2013.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly revenue in 2012 grew, reflecting strong demand for our services.&#160;Compared to Q1, Q2 2012 net earnings increased significantly due to lower stock-based compensation expense and net finance charges.&#160;In Q2, Adjusted EBITDA was down due to the weaker commodity prices in the quarter and higher SGA expenses.&#160;Q3 2012 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA increased from growth in New Markets.&#160;Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 decreased from Q3 2012 due to changes in commodity prices, reduced oilfield activity and higher stock-based compensation expense.&#160;Net earnings for the second half of 2012 decreased due to higher stock-based compensation expense.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2013 declined from Q4 2012 due to the impact of lower commodity pricing, timing of contracts and projects in New Markets, higher Adjusted SGA expenses, offset by improved performance in Oilfield and VSC.&#160;Net earnings increased as a result of lower stock-based compensation expense, net finance charges and deferred income taxes.&#160;Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in Q2 2013 increased from Q1 2013 primarily due to timing of contracts and projects in New Markets and improved performance in Oilfield.&#160;Net earnings decreased due to higher stock-based compensation expense, net finance charges related to a non-cash loss on embedded derivatives and deferred income taxes.&#160;Strong year-over-year performance continued in Q3 2013.&#160;Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 increased from Q2 driven primarily by contributions from our growth capital investments in New Markets and higher event-based business at SCL.&#160;Net earnings increased due to improved performance, lower net finance charges related to a non-cash loss on embedded derivatives, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes. Q4 results were impacted by restructuring related impairment, non-recurring charges, weaker commodity prices, and the timing of Heavy Oil contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY OF SEGMENTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Our stock-based compensation expense is sensitive to changes in our share price.&#160;At December 31, 2013, a $1 change in our share price between $15 per share and $20 per share has a $1.2 - $1.5 million direct impact on annual stock-based compensation reflected in SGA. We anticipate that approximately 45% of stock-based compensation will be settled in cash in future periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISK MANAGEMENT &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effectively manage the risk associated with our business and strategic objectives, our risk management approach continues to evolve. Our approach provides the framework to understand and address risks faced by our organization.&#160;Risk categories identified include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Strategic - risk to earnings, capital, and strategic objectives arising due to changes in the business environment 
					
				Operational - risk of loss due to failed internal processes and systems, human and technical errors, or external events 
					
				Financial - risk associated with financial processes, obligations, and assets 
					
				People - risk to Business Plan due to recruiting, training, labour availability, union relations, and managerial structure

			&lt;p&gt;CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period.&#160;Such estimates relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements.&#160;Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as transactions are settled in the future.&#160;Amounts recorded for amortization, accretion, future decommissioning obligations, embedded derivatives, deferred income taxes, valuation of warrants and impairment calculations are based on estimates.&#160;By their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty, and the impact of the difference between the actual and the estimated costs on the financial statements of future periods could be material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECOVERABILITY OF ASSET CARRYING VALUES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta assesses its property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill for impairment at the asset level and the cash generating unit ("CGU") level by comparing the carrying values of the assets or CGUs being tested with their recoverable amounts.&#160;The recoverable amounts are the greater of the assets' or CGUs' values in use or their fair values less costs to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carrying values of all assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances include items such as: significant changes in the manner in which an asset is used, including plans to restructure the operation to which an asset belongs, or plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date.&#160;The carrying values of our CGUs are tested annually for impairment.&#160;Judgment is required in the aggregation of assets into CGU's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The determination of the recoverable amount involves estimating the assets or CGU's fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use, which is based on its discounted future cash flows using an applicable discount rate.&#160;Future cash flows are calculated based on management's best estimate of future inflation and are discounted based on management's current assessment of market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, we announced our intention to streamline resources in the Industrial division through a rationalization of business lines and facilities in 2014. As a result of this initiative, we assessed the recoverable amount for certain assets directly impacted by this initiative to be lower than their carrying value and recognized $21.2 million for restructuring related impairment in Q4 2013.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-tax asset impairment charge recognized in the Industrial division was allocated as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As at December 31, 2012, there was no impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECOMMISSIONING LIABILITY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta recognizes a provision for future remediation and post abandonment activities in the consolidated financial statements as the net present value of the estimated future expenditures required to settle the estimated future obligation at the balance sheet date.&#160;The recorded liability increases over time to its future amount through unwinding of the discount.&#160;The measurement of the decommissioning liability involves the use of estimates and assumptions including the discount rate, the expected timing of future expenditures and the amount of future abandonment costs. Decommissioning estimates are reviewed annually and estimated by management, in consultation with Newalta's engineers and environmental, health and safety staff, on the basis of current regulations, costs, technology and industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revisions to the estimated amount or timing of the obligations are reflected prospectively as increases or decreases to the recorded liability and the related asset.&#160;Actual decommissioning expenditures, up to the recorded liability at the time, are drawn against the liability as the costs are incurred.&#160;Amounts capitalized to the related assets are amortized to income in line with the depreciation of the underlying asset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAIR VALUE CALCULATION ON SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AND SHARE APPRECIATION RIGHTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have one share-based compensation plan (the "Option Plan").&#160;Under the Option Plan, we may grant to directors, officers, employees and consultants of Newalta or any of its affiliates, options to acquire up to 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of Newalta.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fair value of share-based payments is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, depending on the characteristics of the share-based payment.&#160;There are a number of estimates used in the calculation such as the future forfeiture rate, expected option life and the future price volatility of the underlying security which can vary from actual future events.&#160;The factors applied in the calculation are management's best estimates based on historical information and future forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may also grant share appreciation rights ("SARs") to directors, officers, employees and consultants of Newalta or any of its affiliates.&#160;SARs entitle the holder thereof to receive cash from Newalta in an amount equal to the positive difference between the grant price and the trading price of our common shares on the exercise date.&#160;The grant price is calculated based on the five-day volume weighted average trading price of our common shares on the TSX.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fair value at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model method with the share-based compensation expense recognized over the vesting period of the options.&#160;There are a number of estimates used in the calculation such as the future forfeiture rate, expected option life and the future price volatility of the underlying security which can vary from actual future events.&#160;The factors applied in the calculation are management's best estimates based on historical information and future forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAXATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calculation of deferred income taxes is based on a number of assumptions including estimating the future periods in which temporary differences, tax losses and other tax credits will reverse.&#160;Tax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimated fair value of derivative instruments resulting in financial assets and liabilities, by their very nature, are subject to measurement uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEASES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta makes judgments&#160;in determining whether certain leases, in particular those with long contractual terms where the lessee is the sole user and Newalta is the lessor, are operating or finance leases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVENUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta may enter into arrangements with customers which contain multiple elements in which revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when earned based on the relative fair value of each unit of accounting as determined by internal or third party analyses of market-based prices. Significant judgment is required to allocate contract consideration to each unit of accounting and determine whether the arrangement is a single unit of accounting or a multiple element arrangement. Depending upon how such judgment is exercised, the timing and amount of revenue recognized could differ significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We adopted the following standards for the first time in the financial year beginning January 1, 2013. There have been no material impacts upon adoption:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;BUSINESS RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Prior to making any investment decision regarding Newalta, investors should carefully consider, among other things, the risks described herein (including the risks and uncertainties listed on the front page of this MDA and throughout this MDA) and the risk factors set forth in the most recently filed Annual Information Form of Newalta which are incorporated by reference herein. For further information on our risk management framework, please refer to the section on Risk Management.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Annual Information Form is available through the internet on the Canadian System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ("SEDAR") which can be accessed at www.sedar.com.&#160;Copies of the Annual Information Form may be obtained, on request without charge, from Newalta Corporation at 211 - 11th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2R 0C6, or by facsimile at (403) 806-7032.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINANCIAL AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carrying values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate the fair value of these financial instruments due to their short term maturities.&#160;Our credit risk from our customers is mitigated by our broad customer base and diverse product lines.&#160;Historically, on an annual basis, our top 25 customers generate approximately 45% of our total revenue, with 10% of these customers having a credit rating of A or higher and 55% of these customers having ratings of BBB or higher.&#160;In the normal course of operations, we are exposed to movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates relative to the Canadian dollar.&#160;The foreign exchange risk arises primarily from U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt and working capital.&#160;We have not entered into any financial derivatives to manage the risk for the foreign currency exposure as at December 31, 2013.&#160;Management assesses our working capital foreign exchange exposure regularly and may draw U.S. denominated long-term debt as required, which serves as a natural hedge, to mitigate our balance sheet exposure. &#160;The floating interest rate profile of our long-term debt exposes us to interest rate risk.&#160;We do not use hedging instruments to mitigate this risk.&#160;The carrying value of the senior secured long-term debt approximates fair value due to its floating interest rates.&#160;For further information regarding our financial and other instruments, please refer to Note 18 to the Financial Statements in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2013.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer (collectively the "Certifying Officers") have evaluated the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting using the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.&#160;As of December 31, 2013, the Certifying Officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were effective.&#160;There have not been any changes in the internal control over financial reporting in Q4 of 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional information relating to Newalta, including the Annual Information Form, is available through the internet on the SEDAR, which can be accessed at www.sedar.com.&#160;Copies of the Annual Information Form of Newalta may be obtained from Newalta Corporation on the internet at www.newalta.com, by mail at 211 - 11th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2R 0C6, or by facsimile at (403) 806-7032.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the three months and years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Unaudited - all tabular data in thousands of Canadian Dollars except per share and ratio data)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 1. CORPORATE STRUCTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta Corporation (the "Corporation" or "Newalta") was incorporated on October 29, 2008, pursuant to the laws of the Province of Alberta. Newalta completed an internal reorganization resulting in a name change from Newalta Inc. to Newalta Corporation effective January 1, 2010. Newalta provides cost-effective solutions to industrial customers to improve their environmental performance with a focus on recycling and recovery of products from industrial residues. These services are provided both through our network of facilities across Canada and at our customers' facilities where we mobilize our equipment and people to process material directly onsite. Our customers operate in a broad range of industries including oil and gas, petrochemical, refining, lead, manufacturing and mining industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 2.&#160;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These consolidated financial statements ("Financial Statements") were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and include the accounts of Newalta and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.&#160;All intercompany balances and transactions including revenue and expenses were eliminated.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on&#160;February 20, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critical judgments and estimate uncertainties in applying accounting policies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense for the period. Such estimates relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements.&#160;Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as transactions are settled in the future.&#160;Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.&#160;Revisions to estimates are applied prospectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) The following are the critical judgments that management made in applying Newalta's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Determining components under multiple element revenue agreements;
            Determining whether agreements not in the legal form of a lease, contain a lease;
            Determining whether certain leases, are operating or finance leases;
            Determining the aggregation of assets into cash generating units ("CGUs");
            Determining key assumptions for impairment testing;
            Determining the existence of contingent liabilities or whether an outflow of resources is probable and this needs to be accounted for as a provision; 
			&lt;p&gt;(ii) The following sections contain critical estimates and assumptions with the most significant effect on amounts recognized in the financial statements. They are discussed further in the accounting policies that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Revenue (Note 2k)
				Recoverability of asset carrying values for impairment testing purposes (Note 2i and 5)
				Fair value determination of stock-based payments (Note 2o and 9)
				Income Tax (Note 2m and 10)
				Decommissioning liability (Note 2j and 11)
				Derivative instruments (Note 2p and 17)
				
			&lt;p&gt;BASIS OF PREPARATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial statements were prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value, as explained in the accounting policies below.&#160;Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principal accounting policies are set out below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a)
				Cash &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash is defined as cash and short-term deposits with maturities of three months or less, when purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) Offsetting Financial Instruments &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported on the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) Inventories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inventories are comprised of oil, lead and other recycled products, spare parts and supplies, and are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventories are valued using the weighted average costing method. Cost of finished goods includes the laid down cost of materials plus the cost of direct labour applied to the product and the applicable share of overhead expense. Cost of other items of inventories comprise the laid down cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d) Property, plant and equipment &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment.&#160;Amortization rates are calculated to amortize the costs, net of residual value, over the assets' estimated useful lives. Significant parts of property, plant and equipment that have different depreciable lives are amortized separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant and equipment is principally depreciated at rates of 5-10% of the declining balance (buildings, site improvements, tanks and mobile equipment) or from 5-14 years straight line (vehicles, computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements), depending on the expected life of the asset.&#160;Some equipment is depreciated based on utilization rates. The utilization rate is determined by dividing the cost of the asset by the estimated future hours of service. Residual values, up to 20% of original cost, may be established for buildings, site improvements, and onsite equipment. These residual values are not depreciated.&#160;The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landfill assets represent the costs of landfill available space, including original acquisition cost, incurred landfill construction and development costs, including leachate collection systems installed during the operating life of the site, and capitalized landfill closure and post-closure costs. The cost of landfill assets, together with projected landfill construction and development costs for permitted capacity plus unpermitted capacity that management believes is probable of ultimately being permitted, is amortized on a per-unit basis as landfill space is consumed. The impact on annual amortization expense of changes in estimated capacity and construction costs is accounted for prospectively.&#160;Management annually updates landfill capacity estimates which include permitted and unpermitted but probable capacities. Estimates are based on survey information provided by independent engineers, and projected landfill construction and development costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta applies the following criteria for evaluating the probability of obtaining a permit for additional capacity, which provides management with a basis to evaluate the likelihood of success of unpermitted expansions:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Management has submitted the application and expects to receive all necessary approvals to accept waste.
            At the time the expansion is included in Newalta's estimate of the landfill's useful economic life, it is probable that the required approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located.
            Additional capacity and related additional costs, including permitting, final closure and post-closure costs, were estimated based on the conceptual design of the proposed expansion. 
			&lt;p&gt;e) Permits and other intangible assets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permits and other intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment, and consist of certain production processes, trademarks, permits and agreements which are amortized over the period of the contractual benefit of 8 to 30 years on a straight line basis. Certain permits are deemed to have indefinite lives and therefore are not amortized. There are nominal fees to renew these permits provided that Newalta remains in good standing with regulatory authorities.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;f) Assets held for sale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale, and are reported in prepaid and other assets on the balance sheet, when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and a sale is considered highly probable. Assets held for sale&#160;are stated at the lower of net book value and fair value less costs to sell. Once classified as held for sale, amortization is no longer recorded on the assets.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;g) Leases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lessee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of Newalta's leases are classified as operating leases therefore the leased assets are not recognized in Newalta's consolidated balance sheets. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of Newalta's benefit, including any rent-free periods. Lease incentives are recognized as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leases may include additional payments for real estate taxes, maintenance and insurance. These amounts are expensed in the period to which they relate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lessor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assets subject to operating leases are recognized and classified according to the nature of the leased asset. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and expensed over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income. The depreciation policy for leased assets is consistent with the depreciation policy for similar owned assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;h) Goodwill &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of acquired businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i) Impairment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impairment testing compares the carrying values of the assets or CGUs being tested with their recoverable amounts (recoverable amounts being the greater of the assets' or CGUs' values in use or their fair values less costs to sell). Value in use is assessed using the present value of the expected future cash flows of the relevant asset. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the asset is tested as part of a CGU, which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The key assumptions for the value in use calculation include discount and growth rate estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows based on the best information available as of the date of the impairment test. The weighted average growth rates reflect a nominal inflationary rate as required by IFRS that is calculated over the remaining useful life of each asset or CGU. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual CGUs.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impairment losses are immediately recognized to the extent that the asset or CGU carrying values exceed their recoverable amounts. Should the recoverable amounts for previously impaired assets or CGUs subsequently increase, the impairment losses previously recognized (other than in respect of goodwill) may be reversed to the extent that the reversal is not a result of "unwinding of discount" and that the resulting carrying value does not exceed the carrying value that would have been the result if no impairment losses had been previously recognized.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asset impairment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carrying values of all assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances include items such as: significant changes in the manner in which an asset is used, including plans to restructure the operation to which an asset belongs, or plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CGU impairment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carrying values of Newalta's CGUs are tested annually for impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to CGUs expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. To the extent that the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the excess would first reduce the carrying value of goodwill and any remainder would reduce the carrying values of the long-term assets of the CGUs on a pro-rated basis.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management has determined that Newalta's CGUs are: Industrial West business unit, Industrial East business unit, Ville Ste-Catherine ("VSC") business unit, Oilfield division, Heavy Oil business unit and United States ("U.S.") business unit.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;j) Provisions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provisions are recognized when Newalta has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that Newalta will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of that obligation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decommissioning liabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta provides for estimated future decommissioning costs for all its facilities based on the useful lives of the assets and the long-term commitments of certain sites. Over this period, Newalta recognizes the liability for the future decommissioning liabilities associated with property, plant and equipment. These obligations are initially measured at the discounted future value of the liability.&#160;This value is capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset and amortized over the asset's useful life. The balance of the liability is adjusted each period for the unwinding of the discount, with the associated expense included within finance charges. Decommissioning costs and timing are estimated by management, in consultation with Newalta's engineers and environmental, health and safety staff, on the basis of current regulations, costs, technology and industry standards. Other key estimates include discount and inflation rates. Actual decommissioning costs are charged against the provision as incurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;k) Revenue recognition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods and/or delivery of services have transferred to the buyer, recoverability of consideration is probable, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, Newalta retains no continuing managerial involvement with the goods, and the costs required to complete the contract can be estimated reliably. Revenue is measured net of returns and trade discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta offers individual services, products and integrated solutions to meet customer needs. Integrated solutions may involve the delivery of multiple services and products occurring in different reporting periods. As appropriate, these multiple element arrangements are separated into components and consideration is allocated based upon their relative fair values.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual and integrated solutions may include one or more of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) Sale of Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's waste processing services are generally sold based upon service orders or contracts with a customer that include fixed or determinable prices based upon hourly, daily, or throughput rates. Revenue is recognized when services are rendered.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ii) Sale of Products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Newalta's sale of recycled and recovered waste products is recognized when products are delivered to customers or pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iii) Construction Contracts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction contract revenue results from some of Newalta's onsite projects.&#160;Construction revenue includes the initial amount negotiated in the contract plus any change in terms of scope of work performed.&#160;If costs can be measured reliably, revenue is recognized based on the stage of completion of the contract, determined by the physical portion of work performed.&#160;Otherwise, construction revenue will be recognized to the extent contract costs are likely to be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iv) Operating Leases &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating lease revenue is derived from some of Newalta's onsite projects.&#160;Lease accounting is applied to a component of a contract if it conveys the right of use of a specific asset to a customer but does not convey the risks and/or benefits of ownership.&#160;Revenue from operating leases is recognized over the processing period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;l) Research and development &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research and development costs are incurred in the design, testing and commercialization of Newalta's products and services. Research costs, other than capital expenditures, are expensed as incurred. The costs incurred in developing new technologies are expensed as incurred unless they meet the criteria under IFRS for deferral and amortization. These costs will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the product, commencing with commercial production. In the event that a product program for which costs were deferred is modified or cancelled, Newalta will assess the recoverability of the deferred costs and if considered unrecoverable, will expense the costs in the period the assessment is made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;m) Income Tax&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.&#160;Tax is recognized in the statements of operations, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.&#160;In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta and its wholly-owned subsidiaries follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes.&#160;Current income tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured based upon temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred income tax expense is computed based on the change during the year in the deferred income tax assets and liabilities.&#160;Effects of changes in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when substantively enacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the benefits from tax losses and deductions with no accounting basis, provided those benefits are probable to be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the tax laws and rates that are anticipated to apply in the period of estimated realization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;n) Earnings per share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.&#160;Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adding the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year to the additional shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares had been issued, using the "treasury stock" method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o) Stock-based incentive plans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Corporation's stock-based incentive plans consist of stock options, stock appreciation rights and share units, and are granted to executives, employees and non-employee directors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta has one active stock-based option incentive plan (the "Option Plan").&#160;Under the Option Plan, Newalta may grant to directors, officers, employees and consultants of Newalta or any of its affiliates, rights to acquire up to 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Corporation (the "Shares").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, the Board of Directors modified the Option Plan to eliminate the ability for option holders to settle options for cash.&#160;As a result of this change, the stock based compensation liability relating to stock options was reclassified to contributed surplus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Option Plan is equity settled. The fair value of options at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model method with the stock-based compensation expense recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense ("SGA") that is recognized over the vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus. When options are exercised, the proceeds, together with the amount recorded in contributed surplus, are transferred to shareholders' capital. Forfeitures are estimated and accounted for at the grant date and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock appreciation rights ("SARs")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARs entitle the holder to receive cash from Newalta in an amount equal to the positive difference between the grant price and the trading price of the Shares on the exercise date.&#160;The grant price is calculated based on the five-day volume weighted average trading price of the Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.&#160;SARs generally expire five years after they are granted and the vesting period is determined by the Board of Directors of Newalta. The fair value at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model method with the stock-based compensation expense recognized over the vesting period of the options and recorded as SGA with a corresponding entry to accrued liabilities or other liabilities.&#160;The fair value is subsequently re-measured at the end of each reporting period.&#160;Forfeitures are estimated and accounted for at the grant date and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share units&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta has a cash-settled Deferred Share Unit ("DSU") plan that exists for non-executive directors. Under this plan, notional DSUs are granted annually and vest immediately. The measurement of the compensation expense and corresponding liability for these awards is based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as a stock-based compensation expense which is recorded as a SGA with a corresponding increase in accrued liabilities. Dividend equivalent grants, if any, are recorded as stock-based compensation expense in the period the dividend is paid. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized in earnings. Each DSU entitles the holder to receive a cash payment equal to the five-day volume weighted average trading price of the Shares preceding the date of redemption.&#160;The DSUs may only be redeemed within the period beginning on the date a holder ceases to be a participant under the plan and ending on December 31 of the following calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cash-settled Performance Share Unit ("PSU") plan has been established for officers and other eligible employees.&#160;Under this plan, notional PSUs are granted based on corporate performance criterion and vest no later than December 31 of the third year after the year to which the relevant PSU was granted.&#160;Each vested PSU entitles the holder to receive a cash payment equal to the five-day volume weighted average trading price of the Shares preceding the date of redemption multiplied by a vesting factor.&#160;The vesting factor is based on performance conditions established by the Board of Directors prior to the date of grant of the PSU.&#160;The stock-based compensation expense of the PSUs is recorded as SGA on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding entry to either accrued liabilities or other liabilities. This estimated value is adjusted each period based on the period-end trading price of the Shares and an estimated vesting factor, with any changes in the fair value of the liability being recognized in earnings. Dividend equivalent grants, if any, are recorded as stock-based compensation expense in the period the dividend is paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p) Financial instruments Classification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's financial instruments are classified into one of four categories and are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured as noted in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Cash and accounts and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables. Senior secured debt, senior unsecured debentures, bank indebtedness, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable and other liabilities are classified as financial liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta categorizes its financial instruments carried at fair value into one of three different levels, depending on the significance of inputs employed in their measurement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level 1 includes assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. An active market for an asset or liability is considered to be a market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.&#160;Newalta's cash, "AFS" investments, and senior unsecured debentures are classified as level 1 financial instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level 2 includes valuations determined using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1. Financial instruments in this category are valued using models or other industry standard valuation techniques derived from observable market data. Such valuation techniques include inputs such as quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors and broker quotes that can be observed or corroborated in the market for the entire duration of the derivative instrument. Instruments valued using Level 2 inputs include the embedded derivative within the senior unsecured debentures, held-for-trading investments, and senior secured debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level 3 includes valuations based on inputs which are less observable, unavailable or where the observable data does not support a significant portion of the instruments' fair value. Generally, Level 3 valuations are longer dated transactions, occur in less active markets, occur at locations where pricing information is not available or have no binding broker quote to support Level 2 classification.&#160;At December 31, 2013 and 2012, Newalta did not have any Level 3 assets or liabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embedded derivatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The embedded derivatives are classified at fair value through profit and loss ("FVTPL"). They were valued using the option adjusted spread ("OAS") model, which requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. They are valued at fair value upon initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized through finance charges in the consolidated statement of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction costs incurred with respect to the credit facility are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the facility. The asset is recognized in prepaid expenses and other assets on the balance sheet while the amortization is included in financing charges within net income. Transaction costs associated with other financial liabilities are netted against the related liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impairment of financial assets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment were affected.&lt;/p&gt;

						Other financial assets
						&#160;
						Carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account
						&#160;
					
				&lt;p&gt;q) Functional and presentation currency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the Corporation's subsidiaries is measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Corporation's functional currency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon consolidation, the financial statements of the subsidiary that have a functional currency different from that of the Corporation are translated into Canadian dollars whereby assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates (as this is considered a reasonable approximation of actual rates), and gains and losses in translation are recognized in the shareholders' equity section as accumulated other comprehensive income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Corporation were to dispose of its entire interest in a foreign operation, or to lose control, joint control, or significant influence over a foreign operation, the foreign currency gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income related to the foreign operation would be recognized in net earnings. If the Corporation were to dispose of part of an interest in a foreign operation which remains a subsidiary, a proportionate amount of foreign currency gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income related to the subsidiary would be reallocated between controlling and non-controlling interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;r) Borrowing costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset form part of the cost of that asset. A qualifying asset requires a period of six months or greater to be prepared for its intended use or sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;s) Recent pronouncements issued&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following standards were adopted by Newalta for the first time in the financial year beginning January 1, 2013. There have been no material impacts upon adoption:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				IFRS 10, "Consolidated Financial Statements"
            IFRS 11, "Joint Arrangements"
            IFRS 12, "Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities"
            IFRS 13, "Fair Value Measurement" 
			&lt;p&gt;A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2014, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. None of these are expected to have a material impact on Newalta's financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 3.&#160;INVENTORIES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inventories consist of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

				Due to increased capacity and decreased future estimated costs realized in July 2013, the amortization rate per metric tonne (MT) for Stoney Creek landfill has decreased from approximately $13/MT to $6/MT.
				
			&lt;p&gt;a) Borrowing costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, Newalta capitalized $0.8 million and $2.8 million respectively, (for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012 - $1.6 million and $4.7 million respectively) of borrowing costs to qualifying assets using a capitalization rate of 5.86% and 5.96% respectively (December 31, 2012 - 6.25% and 6.3% respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) Assets held for sale
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assets held for sale of $2.5 million as at December 31, 2013 includes land and buildings of $0.9 million and equipment of $1.4 million relating to planned sales of facilities and assets in the Industrial division. It was determined at December 31, 2013 that the sale of these facilities assets and/or their operations was highly probable, therefore the carrying amount of the assets has been reclassified to current assets, within prepaid expenses and other assets on the balance sheet. The fair value measurement for the disposal group has been categorized as a Level 2 fair value based on market inputs that are observable for the assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) Restructuring related impairment
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, Newalta announced their intention to streamline resources in the Industrial division through a rationalization of business lines and facilities in 2014. This initiative resulted in Newalta recording a non-cash impairment loss of $21.2 million. The recoverable amount of $10.3 million was based on fair value less costs to sell. The company used an expected future cash flow approach with a risk adjusted discount rate of 11.6% on a pre-tax basis. The fair value measurement for the asset impairment charge has been categorized as a Level 3 fair value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-tax asset impairment charge was allocated as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;CGU impairment &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In assessing goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment at December 31, 2013 and 2012, Newalta compared the aggregate recoverable amount of the assets included in the CGUs to their respective carrying amounts.&#160;The recoverable amount was determined based on the value in use of the CGUs, using growth rates reflective of previous years growth, excluding future growth capital spending and associated revenues. There was no impairment at the CGU level as at December 31, 2013 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key assumptions included the following:&lt;/p&gt;

The principal borrowing amount was increased from $225 million to $250 million. There were no other significant changes to the terms of the Credit Facility. Newalta may, at its option, request an extension of the credit facility on an annual basis. If no request to extend the Credit Facility is made by Newalta, the entire amount of the outstanding indebtedness would be due in full on July 12, 2016. The Credit Facility also requires Newalta to be in compliance with certain covenants.&#160;As at December 31, 2013 and 2012, Newalta was in compliance with all covenants (Note 13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, the weighted average interest rate on senior secured debt was 2.98% and 3.12%, respectively, (for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012 - 3.29% and 3.56% respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 8.

				&lt;p&gt;Series 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 23, 2010, Newalta issued $125.0 million of 7.625% series 1 senior unsecured debentures ("series 1"). The series 1 debentures mature on November 23, 2017. The series 1 debentures bear interest at 7.625% per annum and such interest is payable in equal instalments semi-annually in arrears on May 23 and November 23 in each year. The series 1 debentures are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to any subordinated debt that may be issued by Newalta or any of its subsidiaries. The series 1 debentures are effectively subordinated to all secured debt to the extent of collateral on such debt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November 23, 2013, the series 1 debentures are redeemable at the option of Newalta, in whole or in part, at redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount, plus in each case accrued interest to the redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on November 23 of the years as follows: Year 2013 - 103.813%; Year 2014 - 102.542%; Year 2015 - 101.906%; Year 2016 and thereafter - 100%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a change of control occurs, Newalta will be required to offer to purchase all or a portion of each debenture holder's series 1 debentures, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the series 1 debentures offered for repurchase plus accrued interest to the date of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Series 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 14, 2011, Newalta issued $125.0 million of 7.75% series 2 senior unsecured debentures ("series 2"). The series 2 debentures mature on November 14, 2019. The series 2 debentures bear interest at 7.75% per annum and such interest is payable in equal instalments semi-annually in arrears on May 14 and November 14 in each year, commencing on May 14, 2012. The series 2 debentures are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to any subordinated debt that may be issued by Newalta or any of its subsidiaries. The series 2 debentures are effectively subordinated to all secured debt to the extent of collateral on such debt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to November 14, 2015, Newalta may on one or more occasions: &lt;/p&gt;

				Redeem the series 2 debentures, in whole or in part, at a redemption price which is equal to the greater of (a) the Canada Yield Price (as defined in the trust indenture) and (b) 101% of the aggregate principal amount of series 2 debentures redeemed, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

				Incentive Plan Liabilities
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As at December 31, 2013, the total liability related to the Corporation's incentive plans was $10.4 million, with $7.9 million classified as current and $2.5 million classified as non-current (December 31, 2012 total incentive plan liabilities of $27.0 million, with $22.8 million classified as current and $4.2 million classified as non-current). The current liability associated with the Corporation's incentive plans is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the balance sheet. Non-current liability is recorded in Other liabilities on the balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, the Board of Directors modified the Option Plan to eliminate the ability for option holders to settle options for cash.&#160;As a result of this change, the stock based compensation liability of $12.6 million relating to stock options was reclassified to contributed surplus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE 10.&#160;INCOME TAX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.&#160;Significant components of Newalta's deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;NOTE 11.&#160;RECONCILIATION OF DECOMMISSIONING LIABILITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future decommissioning liability was estimated by management based on the anticipated costs to abandon and reclaim facilities and wells, and the projected timing of these expenditures. The net present value of this amount, $61.1 million (December 31, 2012 - $78.9 million) was accrued and recorded in decommissioning liability on the balance sheet at December 31, 2013. The estimated future cost for decommissioning liability at December 31, 2013, was $327.0 million over an expected range up to 200 years. Effective July 1, 2013, a permit amendment decreased the future obligation at Stoney Creek landfill. Newalta used the Bank of Canada's long term bond rate of 3.20% as at December 31, 2013 (December 31, 2012 - 2.37%) and an inflation rate of 2% (December 31, 2012 - 2%) to calculate the present value of the decommissioning liability with the exception of Stoney Creek landfill for which we used a discount rate of 6% (December 31, 2012 - 6%).

			&lt;p&gt;Management and the Board of Directors review and assess Newalta's capital structure and dividend policy at least at each regularly scheduled board meeting which are held at a minimum four times annually. The financial strategy may be adjusted based on the current outlook of the underlying business, the capital requirements to fund growth initiatives and the state of the debt and equity capital markets.

Additionally, EBITDA is normalized for extraordinary and non-recurring items, and for any acquisitions or dispositions as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. 
				Total debt comprises outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility, including our bank surplus or overdraft balance and the senior unsecured debentures.

				&lt;p&gt;Embedded derivatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior unsecured debentures have early redemption features at values based on percentages of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Due to the redemption rates being fixed, an embedded derivative exists when compared to current market rates. Newalta estimates the fair value of the embedded derivatives using a valuation model that considers the current bond prices and spreads associated with the senior unsecured debentures. Newalta has recognized gains of $3.4 million and $3.0 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, respectively (for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012 - $1.3 million and $13.4 million) and has determined the fair value of the embedded derivative for the senior unsecured debentures to be $17.1 million as at December 31, 2013. A corresponding embedded derivative asset was included within other long-term assets on the balance sheet.&#160;Subsequent changes in fair value will be included in finance charges on the consolidated statements of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offsetting financial instruments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain waste processing revenue sources entitle customers to credits on the sale of recovered products.

				&lt;p&gt;Credit risk and economic dependence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta is subject to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable balances. No single customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2013, (one customer balance represented 10% as at December 31, 2012). Newalta views the credit risks on these amounts as normal for the industry. Credit risk is minimized by Newalta's broad customer base and diverse product lines, and is mitigated by the ongoing assessment of the credit worthiness of its customers as well as monitoring the amount and age of balances outstanding.&#160;Newalta's assessment of credit risk has remained unchanged from the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Newalta's largest customer represented 11% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 (10% for the year ended December 31, 2012). This revenue is recognized within the Industrial division. No other customer's revenue exceeded 10% for the period presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the nature of operations, established collection history and industry norms, receivables are not considered past due until 90 days after invoice date, although standard payment terms require payment within 30 to 90 days. Depending on the nature of the service and/or product, customers may be provided with extended payment terms while Newalta gathers certain processing or disposal data. Included in the Corporation's trade receivable balance, are receivables totaling $5.7 million (December 31, 2012 - $5.0 million), which are considered to be outstanding beyond normal repayment terms at December 31, 2013. A provision of $1.1 million (December 31, 2012 - $0.5 million) has been established as an allowance for doubtful accounts. No additional provision has been made as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered collectible. Newalta does not hold any collateral over these balances but may hold credit insurance for specific non-domestic customer accounts. Total accounts receivable of $149.0 million is comprised of $120.6 million of trade receivables, accrued receivables of $20.2 million and other receivables of $8.2 million.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;To determine the recoverability of a trade receivable, management analyzes accounts receivable, first identifying customer groups that represent minimal risk (large oil and gas and other low risk large companies, governments and municipalities). Impairment of the remaining accounts is determined by identifying specific accounts that are at risk, and then by applying a formula based on aging to the remaining amounts receivable. All amounts identified as at risk are provided for in an allowance for doubtful accounts. The changes in this account for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Liquidity risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors of Newalta, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Corporation's short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. Management mitigates liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and other borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Newalta's assessment of liquidity risk has remained unchanged from the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest rate risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that its credit facility has a variable interest rate. Management does not enter into any derivative contracts to manage the exposure to variable interest rates. The senior unsecured debentures have fixed interest rates until their maturity dates, at which point, any remaining amounts owing under these debentures will need to be repaid or refinanced.&#160;Newalta's assessment of interest rate risk has remained unchanged from the prior year.&#160;The table below provides an interest rate sensitivity analysis to net earnings as at period end:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Market risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of Newalta's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Newalta is exposed to foreign exchange market risk. Foreign exchange risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment, recognized asset or liability will fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The risk arises primarily from U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt and working capital. As at December 31, 2013, Newalta had $13.6 million in net working capital and $10 million in long-term debt both denominated in U.S. dollars. Management has not entered into any financial derivatives to manage the risk for the foreign currency exposure as at December 31, 2013.&#160;Newalta's assessment of market risk has remained unchanged from the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The table below provides a foreign currency sensitivity analysis to net earnings on long-term debt and working capital outstanding as at period end:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;NOTE 22.&#160;SEGMENTED INFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2013, Newalta reorganized the reporting structure into three divisions - New Markets, Oilfield and Industrial. These divisions constitute Newalta's reportable segments. The reportable segments were reorganized to improve alignment of operations for customers, to create an optimum management structure for expected growth and to provide improved disclosure to investors. The reportable segments are distinct strategic business units whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Corporation's executive officers in order to assess financial performance and make resource allocation decisions. The reportable segments have separate operating management and operate in distinct competitive and regulatory environments. &lt;/p&gt;
			
				The New Markets segment includes mobilization of equipment and staff to process waste at our customer sites, the processing of oilfield-generated wastes including treatment, water disposal, landfilling, and the sale of recovered crude oil; site remediation, centrifugation, dredging and dewatering, and the supply and operation of drill site processing equipment, including solids control and drill cuttings management. 
					
				The Oilfield segment includes the processing of oilfield-generated wastes including treatment and disposal, water disposal, clean oil terminalling, custom treating, the sale of recovered crude oil and the supply and operation of drill site processing equipment, including solids control and drill cuttings management. 
					
				The Industrial segment includes oil recycling services, lead battery recycling, landfilling of non-hazardous solid waste and the processing of industrial wastes including collection, treatment and disposal.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 20 (Reuters) - Anixter International Inc, which
is backed by real estate mogul Sam Zell, has enlisted Goldman
Sachs to find a buyer, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday,
citing people with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which distributes communications and security
products including electronic wires, has tried to sell itself
"several times" over the past few years, the report cited one of
the sources as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glenview, Illinois-based Anixter is weighing a sale again as
its shares have climbed and on the back of
stronger-than-expected revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares, which have gained about 17 percent so
far this year, rose as much as 6 percent to an all-time high of
$109.19 on Thursday. Shares edged higher in extended trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zell owns a 15 percent stake in the company, according to
Thomson Reuters data. Zell and his son, Matthew, also serve on
Anixter's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said Anixter would look for second-round bids
next month and that French company Rexel SA is one of
the bidders. The company had a market valuation of $3.42 billion
as of Thursday's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP and U.K
engineering firm Melrose Industries Plc are among the
companies that have looked and passed on buying Anixter in
recent weeks, according to the Bloomberg report. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anixter's Chief Financial Officer Ted Dosch said it was
company policy not to comment on market rumors. Goldman Sachs
could not be immediately reached for comment outside regular
U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;

			JPMorgan Chase and Shareholder Proponents Reach Agreement Resulting 
      in Withdrawal of Shareholder Proposals
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. today announced that it has reached agreement with 
      shareholder proponents on the withdrawal of two proposals for the 2014 
      annual meeting and the steps the company will take in response.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth along with a number of other 
      sponsors had submitted a proposal, now withdrawn, that the board 
      commission a report describing the steps the company has taken to 
      address a number of challenges faced by the bank. The company agrees 
      with the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth that comprehensive 
      communications around best practices and lessons learned is valuable for 
      all of our stakeholders and agreed to prepare a report similar to that 
      proposed. This report will consolidate the relevant information and 
      provide it to shareholders in a readily available document.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sister Barbara Aires of the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth, said, 
      &#8220;Our resolution pressed for comprehensive transparency regarding the 
      challenges faced by the bank and controls put in place to address them. 
      Through fruitful and instructive dialogue we were able to reach a 
      mutually agreeable solution with the company. We look forward to the 
      timely completion of the planned report.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Needmor Fund had also submitted a proposal, now withdrawn, that the 
      board require that the Chair be independent, beginning with the next CEO 
      transition. The company emphasized that it continues to welcome an 
      ongoing dialogue with the proponents and other corporate governance 
      professionals focusing on major issues related to the Chair and CEO 
      roles at public companies, including specific questions corporate 
      directors might consider in reviewing the implications of combining or 
      separating the roles of CEO and Chair.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Timothy Smith of Walden Asset Management, speaking on behalf of the 
      Needmor Fund, said, &#8220;We are pleased with the positive response from the 
      company and are confident that the goodwill stimulated from both of the 
      agreements announced today will lead to productive ongoing work 
      regarding these important governance matters.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lee Raymond, Lead Independent Director of the company&#8217;s board, said, 
      &#8220;Engagement with shareholders is important and facilitates a better 
      understanding of governance practices and communications that promote 
      the best interests of the company and its shareholders.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange for the withdrawal of a shareholder proposal the bank agreed to develop some type of public event on the criteria boards should use in setting up the roles of chairman and chief executive officer, shareholder activists said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the bank will provide more details of its risk mitigation efforts, both sides said, leading to the withdrawal of a related proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Engagement with shareholders is important and facilitates a better understanding of governance practices and communications that promote the best interests of the company and its shareholders," Lee Raymond, JPMorgan's lead independent director, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filers of both resolutions are affiliated with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in New York.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb 20 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co said on Thursday that
Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard would retire in May, and it
named Kathy Waller, controller, to succeed him as CFO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fayard, 62, has been CFO for about 15 years. Waller, 55,
joined Coke in 1987 from Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gary's a great guy, he's been a great CFO. He doesn't just
know the numbers, he can describe the company's strategy as well
as an operating guy," said Kevin Dryer, a portfolio manager at
Gabelli Funds LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement from the world's biggest soda company came
hours after rival PepsiCo was hit with a renewed push
from billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz to split its
challenged North American beverage business from its more robust
snacks operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke and PepsiCo are grappling with declining soda sales in
the United States, as increasingly health-conscious consumers
opt for alternatives like bottled water and tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola's chief executive, Muhtar Kent, is scheduled to
speak at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in
Boca Raton, Florida, on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some conference attendees expect Kent to discuss Coke's
plans to refranchise some of its bottling operations following
the 2010 acquisition of its North American bottler, which was
aimed at cutting costs, speeding innovation and turning around a
sagging market. PepsiCo did a similar deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Coke and Pepsi have traditionally moved together on
major initiatives, they are currently out of step. Coke has been
open about its plan to ultimately franchise its North American
bottler, while PepsiCo has not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo says it has carefully weighed a variety of corporate
changes, ranging from a spin-off of North American beverages to
the sale of some bottling operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has said that its current structure was best for
shareholders since the interplay between North American snacks
and beverages benefit its overall business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's shares closed up 0.5 percent at $37.30 on the New
York Stock Exchange on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			American Locker Group Reports Sale of Disney Concessions Assets
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      American Locker Group Incorporated (OTCQB: ALGI), a recognized leader in 
      secure storage solutions, reported today that, on February 14, 2014, the 
      Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary American Locker Security 
      Systems, Inc. (&#8220;ALSS&#8221;) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the 
      &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with Best Lockers, LLC (&#8220;Best&#8221;), whereby the 
      Company and ALSS sold approximately 4,100 lockers, kiosks and other 
      assets related to the locker concessions services provided by ALSS at 
      Disneyland Resort&#174;, located in Anaheim, California, to Best 
      for a purchase price of $1,218,075.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company also reported that, in connection with the Purchase 
      Agreement, the Company, ALSS and Best entered into a Subcontract 
      Agreement dated February 14, 2014 (the &#8220;Subcontract&#8221;) whereby Best has 
      agreed to perform all of ALSS&#8217;s obligations under an existing 
      concessions services agreement (the &#8220;Disney Contract&#8221;), between ALSS and 
      Disneyland Resort (&#8220;Disney&#8221;). In exchange for performing all of ALSS&#8217;s 
      obligations under the Disney Contract, Best has the right to receive all 
      of the payments owed to ALSS under the Disney Contract. Best has also 
      agreed that, in the event it enters into an agreement to supply locker 
      concessions or locker systems to any parks or resorts owned or operated

      "This is a transaction that benefits all of the parties involved," said 
      Anthony Johnston, President and CEO of American Locker. "In 2010, 
      American Locker began locker concessions services to Disney. We 
      purchased Best Lockers&#8217; electronic locker software system for that 
      solution. Practically, it makes sense that Best Lockers provide the 
      continuing day-to-day support at Disney while American Locker continues 
      to provide any new physical locker requirements. Disney will be 
      well-served by both companies. In late 2013, American Locker introduced 
      our own internally-developed, electronic locker software solution. Our 
      locker focus going forward is to provide affordable electronic locker 
      solutions to our new customers and, for those many existing American 
      Locker customers with key and coin-operated American Locker systems, an 
      affordable electronic retrofit alternative."

&lt;p&gt;Feb 20 (Reuters) - A deal with shareholder activists will
allow JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to avoid another battle at its
spring shareholder meeting over whether the bank should have an
independent chairman, a person briefed on the matter said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange for the withdrawal of a shareholder proposal the
bank agreed to develop some type of public event on the criteria
boards should use in setting up the roles of chairman and chief
executive, this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity
because the news has not been officially announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the bank will provide more details of its risk
mitigation efforts, leading to the withdrawal of a related
proposal, this person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A judge on Thursday weighed the limits of the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to punish former Goldman Sachs Group Inc trader Fabrice Tourre, including whether the agency could block him from asking the bank to cover any penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hearing in New York, District Judge Katherine Forrest grappled with the SEC's request that Tourre pay $1.15 million after a jury found him liable for fraud in one of the highest-profile trials to spill out of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of that request, the SEC had pushed for an order preventing Tourre from accepting reimbursement from Goldman Sachs or anyone else for the $910,000 in penalties the agency requested the judge impose as part of that potential judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no punishment in a penalty that is automatically paid by your employer," said Bridget Fitzpatrick, a lawyer for the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a lawyer for Tourre said no court had ever held that an employer could not pay for an employee's penalties in an SEC case. The judge at one point asked why the SEC had not asked Congress to pass a specific law saying employers could not reimburse penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's an easy fix for that," Forrest said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hearing provided some of the first hints of how the judge might penalize Tourre, a French citizen who became a symbol of the financial meltdown after the SEC sued him in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, a federal jury found Tourre, 35, liable for six of the seven civil charges stemming from SEC claims that he misled investors in a complex investment product linked to mortgages called Abacus 2007-AC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Tourre of concealing from investors that Paulson &amp; Co Inc, the hedge fund of billionaire John Paulson, had helped put the deal together and planned to bet it would fail. Investors lost about $1 billion, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SHOES OF THE LEGISLATURE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest made no rulings at the hearing, which Tourre did not attend, saying instead she would issue a decision in the "near future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if Goldman would be willing to cover any penalty imposed. Goldman Sachs declined to comment, but court papers show the bank told the SEC in November no agreement or informal understanding existed on reimbursing Tourre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court papers last month, Tourre's lawyers said their client in fact planned to transfer "sufficient funds" to his U.S. bank account to satisfy the SEC's requested judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has not stopped Tourre's lawyers from opposing a request by the SEC Forrest block him from accepting reimbursement for the potential penalty. Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer with Allen &amp; Overy who represents Tourre, said the SEC was asking Forrest to be first judge to ever restrict reimbursement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You would be putting yourself in the shoes of the legislature," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISGORGEMENT AND INJUNCTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the penalty, the SEC has also pushed for Forrest to order Tourre to disgorge $175,463 in ill-gotten gains the agency calculates he received as a bonus in 2007, when he earned $1.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Forrest questioned if the SEC had already obtained the ill-gotten gains it might seek from the $15 million Goldman Sachs itself had disgorged as part of a $550 million settlement in the case in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also expressed concerns about the SEC's request for an injunction prohibiting future violations of the securities laws. As a proposition, injunctions like that "don't make a whole lot of sense" since the SEC could sue him anyway if he broke the law, Forrest said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While SEC lawyers argued the injunction would allow them to hold Tourre in contempt if he committed fraud again, they acknowledged the agency rarely has taken such an action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Forrest said she was concerned an injunction could "stigmatize" Tourre as he pursues a career outside of the securities sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre has been pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago, and his lawyers have said he is looking to go into academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead a broad injunction, Forrest suggested she would consider crafting one that would become active if Tourre re-entered the securities sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two senior officials at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and predecessor companies repeatedly confronted Bernard Madoff over irregularities in his business, a new lawsuit said, suggesting that bank leaders had "direct knowledge" of his Ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday on behalf of shareholders against Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and 12 other current and former executives and directors was based in part by statements made by Madoff himself during a series of interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan was uniquely positioned for 20 years to see Madoff's crimes and put a stop to them," the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But faced with the prospect of shutting down Madoff's account and losing lucrative profits," it added, "JPMorgan - at its highest level - chose to turn a blind eye."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Tasha Pelio declined to comment on the lawsuit, one of several seeking to hold bank officials responsible for failing to uncover the fraud before it surfaced publicly in December 2008.

Madoff Investment Securities LLC; and other shareholders. Picard has estimated that Madoff customers lost $17.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accords included a "deferred prosecution agreement," or DPA, to resolve criminal charges, under which JPMorgan acknowledged its responsibility for failing to stop Madoff, who was an important client of the bank for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upper management was not implicated in that agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But David Rosenfeld, a lawyer who filed the new lawsuit, said "many hours" of interviews with Madoff, including in person on October 28 at the federal prison in Butner, North Carolina, suggested that top officials knew of the fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The DPA did not disclose how senior executives at JPMorgan knew that he was engaged in some kind of fraud, and that he should have been shut down years earlier," Rosenfeld, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd, said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Madoff could be trusted, Rosenfeld said: "I think he can. He certainly sounded credible to us, and there is no reason for him to lie at this point. He is remorseful, and he does feel compelled now to do what he can to help his victims.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - WhatsApp? Not Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 20 (Reuters) - WhatsApp? Not Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's top deal adviser for nine of the past 10 years,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc has been notably absent on 2014's

but last week Comcast Corp agreed to buy Time Warner

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Feb 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's 
commodity revenues fell 12 percent last year, the bank said in a
filing on Thursday, shedding new light on the unit as the bank
prepares to sell its physical trading arm to Swiss-based trader
Mercuria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop in commodity revenues at JPMorgan is the second in
two years, and follows tighter restrictions across Wall Street
on banks trading with their own money and growing scrutiny of
their role in the natural resources supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said principal transaction revenues in commodities were
$2.073 billion in 2013, down from $2.363 billion the previous
year and $2.823 billion in 2011, the bank said in its annual
10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A
bank spokesman declined to comment on the figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the data offer a rare glimpse into the bank's large
oil, gas, power and metals trading business, they are not
considered a definitive indicator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenues don't include the cost of operating its
commodities trading operation, which has numbered as many as 600
staff in 10 offices globally. The figures also do not
distinguish between the physical trading team that JPMorgan is
selling and the derivatives activities that it will keep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks also say accounting differences mean the outright
numbers are not a complete reflection of how they operate their
commodity businesses. No Wall Street firm declares the exact
profit or loss of individual trading operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in commodities, the trajectory has been clear. Total
commodity trading revenues on Wall Street have fallen by about
two-thirds in the last five years, with the top 10 banks
notching just $4.5 billion last year, according to London-based
analytics firm Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan announced last summer it was selling its vast
physical commodities operations, shortly after reaching a $410
settlement with energy regulators in the United States over
allegations the bank had manipulated electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria, a private commodities dealer run by two former
Goldman Sachs oil traders, entered exclusive talks with the bank
to buy its physical business two weeks ago. JPMorgan has valued
the business at $3.3 billion in documents circulated to
potential buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal value has yet to be agreed and will depend to a
large extent on the valuation of large stockpiles of oil and
metals the bank holds, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, the bank held $10.2 billion in
physical commodities, according to the SEC filing, down from $16
billion at the end of 2012. That includes precious metals like
gold and platinum that will not be included in any sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the bank is halting its trading of physical oil
cargoes and industrial metals, it will continue to trade
financial commodity contracts and precious metals for clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh (Reuters) - A Pennsylvania coroner was attempting on Thursday to extract DNA from bone fragments thought to belong to a contractor who was working at a Chevron natural gas well when it exploded in Greene County last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian McKee, 27, from Morgantown, West Virginia, was reported missing after the Lanco 7H well exploded on February 11, causing a fire that raged for five days and kept emergency crews from approaching the scene. The bone fragments, burnt during the blaze, were recovered on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKee, who was expecting a child with his fiancee, worked for drilling equipment maker Cameron International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police will officially notify McKee's family when the Greene County Coroner's Office is able to identify the DNA, said state trooper Stephanie Plume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire broke out as workers were preparing to run tubing down the well shaft last week. Chevron said that no drilling or fracking was taking place when the incident occurred, but it has no detail on the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another worker was also injured in the explosion but has since been released from hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days after the first well burst into flames, two other adjacent wells on the same drilling pad caught fire. These wells burned out a day later by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in a statement on Tuesday that the situation at the site was still dangerous. It is working with Wild Well Control, a well fire specialist, to cool the fire site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Environmental Protection issued a permit allowing the company to pipe over one million gallons of water per day from nearby Dunkard Creek to cool the area and minimize the potential of re-ignition during response efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edward McAllister and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

reported a smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter loss due to cost
cuts, and forecast a slight improvement in demand for
metallurgical, or steel-making, coal in 2014, sending its shares
up 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's outlook is in contrast to that of other U.S.
miners such as Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources
 who expect an improvement in demand for
electricity-generating thermal coal rather than metallurgical
coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Along with a projected steel demand growth (in 2014),
demand for metallurgical coal is expected to grow by close to 30
million tons," Walter Energy's Chief Executive Walter Scheller
said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weak prices for both types of coal due to low demand and
excess supply for the past year or so have forced Walter Energy
and other miners to rein in spending to cope with the weak
prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy cut its capital expenditure by 60.6 percent to
$153.9 million in 2013 and expects to spend less than $150
million in 2014, Chief Financial Officer Bill Harvey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company's good job streamlining its operations to work
through the current downturn should be well received by
investors," analysts at Simmons &amp; Co said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However not all analysts shared the company's enthusiasm for
a recovery in demand for metallurgical coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that in absence of a price recovery and greater
clarity on asset sales and the capital structure, the name
remains the most exposed to current weakness in the met coal
market," Brean Capital analyst Lucas Pipes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy acknowledged that the weak market would delay
its restructuring efforts, from which its expects generate about
$250 million through asset sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company now expects most of the sales to take place in
the second half of 2014, compared to its earlier target of an 
April finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE MET COAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Walter Energy said it expects metallurgical coal
sales in the first quarter to exceed that in the fourth quarter,
and full-year sales to modestly exceed that in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company expects to produce about 11 million to 12
million tons of metallurgical coal in 2014, compared with the
11.6 million metric tons it produced in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, with operations in North America and the United
Kingdom, said it would produce lesser thermal coal in 2014 than
it did in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company cut production costs by 20.6 percent in the
fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, helping alleviate a 10 percent
drop in the price of metallurgical coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy's sales of metallurgical rose 16 percent to
2.9 million metric tons, accounting for about 85 percent of
total coal sales volume in the quarter. The company also
produces thermal coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However total revenue slipped about 1 percent to $472
million, reflecting low coal prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding one-time items, Walter posted a loss of 55 cents
per share in quarter, compared with the average analyst estimate
of 84 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking into account a tax-related charge of $140.2 million,
the company's net loss increased to $174.3 million, or $2.79 per
share, from $71 million or $1.13 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter's shares rose 2.3 percent to $11.31 in afternoon
trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares,
which have fallen about 71 percent in the past year, touched a
high of $11.77 earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Cyvera Launches New TRAPS XP Agent to Protect Microsoft Windows XP Users&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Secures Windows XP Machines From Cyber Threats as Microsoft Support Deadline Looms&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, CA and TEL AVIV, ISRAEL--(Marketwired - Feb 20, 2014) - &#160;Cyvera Ltd, the developer of innovative cyber defense solutions to stop Zero-Day attacks, has released TRAPS XP, a software agent designed to prevent cyber-attacks on endpoints running the Legacy Microsoft Windows XP and embedded XP operating systems.&#160;The new TRAPS XP is part of Cyvera's proven TRAPS (Targeted Remote Attack Prevention System) product-line, which prevents both known and unknown (Zero-Day) cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Microsoft support deadline for Windows XP approaches, Cyvera's TRAPS XP provides millions of XP users a proven method for preventing attacks on their unpatched computers.&#160;
        "In less than two months, Microsoft will no longer provide security updates for XP, leaving users vulnerable to virtually every attack launched that aims to utilize the system vulnerabilities" said Nati Davidi, co-founder and co-CEO of Cyvera.&#160;"Cyvera's unique approach to preventing attacks was calibrated to enable XP users to be protected indefinitely from data loss or theft resulting from vulnerabilities exposure, even without updating the system. The result is the designated TRAPS XP version."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NetMarketShare estimates more than 30% of personal computers currently run Windows XP.&#160;Some of the most mission-critical systems -- in industries like banking, defense, healthcare -- are still running the legacy operating system and will be considerably more vulnerable to sophisticated attacks once security updates are no longer available. Further, approximately two-thirds of malware developed for Windows 7 work well on Windows XP; which means that any security update released for Windows 7 has a 66% chance of exposing never-to-be-patched security holes in Windows XP.&#160;Cyvera's solution is available now and will be demonstrated for the first time at the RSA Conference next week in San Francisco South Expo Booth #2510.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global IT organizations recognize the risk that the Windows XP support deadline presents. "An added advantage of Cyvera's solution is the continuous life-cycle protection of software and operating systems beyond their End of Support dates. This includes protection for Operating Systems, such as Windows XP, which will no longer receive patches and support," said Golan Ben-Oni, chief security officer and senior VP network infrastructure, IDT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyvera's Targeted Remote Attack Prevention System (TRAPS) stops any attack before harmful activity can occur. This unique technology approach is based on obstruction and deception of the attacker; placing traps and obstacles across every conceivable path an attack could take and preventing it before malicious activity can be initiated. It is not based on signature detection or behavioral analysis, and therefore requires no signatures or definitions update, or prior knowledge of a given attack, in order to prevent it.&#160;As a result, Cyvera is particularly effective against Zero-Day and other types of sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyvera TRAPS is a client-based platform, consisting of endpoint agents with centralized management.&#160;It can be installed on any Windows-based platform in one click and managed through Cyvera's Management Center. In addition, Cyvera TRAPS requires very little computational resource and produces virtually no false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Cyvera
				Cyvera is winning the fight against cybercrime by stopping unknown, zero-day attacks before they can unleash malicious, harmful activity.&#160;It has prevented every zero-day attack since first launching its cyber defense platform in March 2012 and has been recognized as a Gartner Cool Vendor.&#160;Cyvera's mission is to develop cyber defense solutions that eliminate fear, enabling organizations to operate freely and securely.&#160;For more information visit www.cyvera.com.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

      For the 11th consecutive year, the ExxonMobil 
      Foundation will offer &#8220;Introduce a Girl to Engineering&#8221; activities 
      at ExxonMobil 
      sites around the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      More than 450 ExxonMobil employees will host over 2,500 middle-school 
      students at 16 locations to increase interest in science, technology, 
      engineering and math (STEM) fields as part of the Girl Day initiative by DiscoverE,
			formerly known as the National Engineers Week Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In order to increase interest in STEM careers, especially among girls, 
      it is vital that we provide opportunities for interaction with 
      successful STEM professionals,&#8221; said Suzanne McCarron, president of the 
      ExxonMobil Foundation. &#8220;Through &#8216;Introduce a Girl to Engineering&#8217; 
      activities, ExxonMobil hopes to engage girls early in their education in 
      order to dispel common misconceptions that prevent women from pursuing 
      fulfilling careers in math and science.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through the program, ExxonMobil employees will lead fun, hands-on 
      activities connecting math and science to real-life applications, while 
      also reinforcing classroom instruction. Activities will include 
      demonstrations on the energy industry&#8217;s use of 3D technology to search 
      for oil and natural gas as well as water purification, bridge building 
      and other science-related experiments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Attracting girls to math and science, and ultimately STEM careers, is 
      critical to ensuring that the growing technological needs of the United 
      States can be met. According to the 2013 Economic and Statistics 
      Administration Report, women comprise half of the U.S. workforce, but 
      hold fewer than 25 percent of STEM jobs and only 14 percent of 
      engineering positions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since ExxonMobil began hosting &#8220;Introduce a Girl to Engineering&#8221; events 
      more than a decade ago, nearly 10,000 students have participated in 
      activities conducted at company facilities or through classroom

We expect that these accomplishments will continue to yield benefits going forward, and we are focused on achieving further improvements in 2014."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-Year 2013 Consolidated Financial Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy reported a net loss in 2013 of $359.0 million, or $5.74 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $1.1 billion, or $16.96 per diluted share in 2012.

A reconciliation of Loss from continuing operations to EBITDA from continuing operations, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is provided in the Company's "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" included with this release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Sales Volume and Pricing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth quarter 2013 met coal sales volume, including both hard coking coal ("HCC") and low-volatility ("low-vol") pulverized coal injection product ("PCI"), totaled 2.9 million metric tons ("MMTs"), an increase of 13.8% compared with 2012. HCC sales volume was 2.4 MMTs, an increase of 15.4% compared with 2012. Low-vol PCI sales volume totaled 0.5 MMTs, an increase of 7.5% compared with the prior-year comparable quarter. Met coal sales volume in the fourth quarter 2013 increased to 85% of total coal sales volume compared with 79% in the prior-year comparable quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average selling price for HCC was $137.39 per MT, down from the fourth quarter of 2012 average pricing of $152.50 per MT. Low-vol PCI pricing averaged $118.63 per MT in fourth quarter 2013 compared with $127.83 per MT in the prior-year comparable quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Cash Cost of Sales &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal cash cost of sales for fourth quarter 2013 averaged $107.52 per MT, down 20.6% compared with 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Production &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal production increased 28.3% to 3.2 MMTs in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with 2.5 MMTs in the prior-year period. Production improvements were driven by a significant increase in output from the Company's Mine No. 4 in Alabama, along with higher volume at the Company's Wolverine mine in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal average cash cost of production was $68.02 per MT in the quarter, down 28.1% compared with the prior-year comparable quarter. The improvement in average cash cost of production per ton was primarily the result of continued favorable operating performance from the Company's low and mid-vol mines in Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Expenses &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGA expenses totaled $20.3 million in the quarter, compared with $28.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Fourth quarter 2013 SGA expenses exclude $4.6 million of operations-related direct administrative charges included in cost of sales resulting from a 2013 change in accounting practice.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest expense for the quarter increased to $64.6 million compared with $49.6 million in 2012, primarily driven by an increase in the amount of our long-term debt and higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital Expenditures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company's capital expenditures totaled $45.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with $60.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures for the full-year 2013 totaled $153.9 million compared with $391.5 million for 2012. Lower capital spending in 2013 reflects the Company's continued focus on disciplined capital spending in light of current market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available liquidity was $587.3 million at December 31, 2013, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $260.8 million plus $326.5 million of availability under the Company's $375.0 million revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of $48.5 million.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety and Stewardship Highlights &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy improved safety performance in 2013. In addition, several mine rescue teams and individuals in the Company's U.S. operations won national recognition at the National Mine Rescue and First Aid contest. The Company also had an employee inducted into the National Mine Rescue Hall of Fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of Non-GAAP Measures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release contains the use of certain U.S. non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures. These non-GAAP measures are provided as supplemental information for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide additional insights into the performance of the Company, and they reflect how management analyzes Company performance and compares that performance against other companies. In addition, some investors use these measures to compare the Company against other companies and to help analyze the Company's ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs.&#160;Management also believes that these non-GAAP measures present a useful measure of the Company's ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing operations. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other entities. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is provided in the financial section of this release.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conference Call Webcast &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company will hold a webcast to discuss its fourth quarter 2013 results today, Feb. 20, 2014, at 10:00 a.m. ET.

						Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton is based on reported Cost of Sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost of Production per Ton is based on period costs of mining and includes items such as manpower, fuel and other similar production items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost per Ton is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe Average Cash Cost per Ton is a useful measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and future potential performance. Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

						Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton is based on reported Cost of Sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost of Production per Ton is based on period costs of mining and includes items such as manpower, fuel and other similar production items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost per Ton is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe Average Cash Cost per Ton is a useful measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and future potential performance. Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

						EBITDA from continuing operations is defined as earnings excluding discontinued operations before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and depletion expense. EBITDA from continuing operations is a financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA from continuing operations is a useful measure as some investors and analysts use EBITDA from continuing operations to compare us against other companies and to help analyze our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs.

						Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude net restructuring charges, asset impairments, loss on investment, other items including proxy contest expenses and foreign currency adjustments and gain on early extinguishment of debt. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant to a reader in understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure of our profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a useful measure of our ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing operations. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate our operating performance. Investors should be aware that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Adjusted net income (loss) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from Adjusted net income (loss) are significant to a reader in understanding and assessing our results of operations.

		&lt;p&gt;BIRMINGHAM, AL--(Marketwired - Feb 20, 2014) - Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT), a leading, publicly traded "pure-play" producer of metallurgical ("met") coal for the global steel industry, today announced results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Operationally, we finished the year with our mines performing well. Our fourth quarter results reflect the ongoing focus on improving safety, reducing costs and increasing productivity," said Walt Scheller, Chief Executive Officer. "For the year, we achieved our cost reduction targets, lowering met coal cash cost of production per ton by more than 17 percent and reducing SGA expenses to an annual run-rate of $80 million. We expect that these accomplishments will continue to yield benefits going forward, and we are focused on achieving further improvements in 2014."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-Year 2013 Consolidated Financial Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy reported a net loss in 2013 of $359.0 million, or $5.74 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $1.1 billion, or $16.96 per diluted share in 2012. Included in the Company's financial results are non-cash charges totaling $144.6 million in 2013 and $19.2 million in 2012 for increases in the valuation allowance for certain of the Company's deferred income tax assets. Excluding the valuation allowance charge, restructuring and asset impairment charges, gain on early extinguishment of debt and other items, the adjusted net loss for 2013 totaled $210.8 million, or $3.37 per diluted share. Results for 2012 included a non-cash goodwill impairment and restructuring charge of $1.1 billion, or $17.53 per share, primarily related to the 2011 acquisition of Western Coal. Excluding the goodwill impairment and restructuring charge, the valuation allowance and other items, adjusted net income for 2012 totaled $49.9 million, or $0.80 per diluted share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth Quarter 2013 Consolidated Financial Results &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company reported a net loss of $174.3 million, or $2.79 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with a net loss of $71.0 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2012. Fourth quarter 2013 results include a $140.2 million charge for an increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, as described above. Excluding the valuation allowance charge, restructuring and asset impairment charges and other items, the adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $34.6 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared with an adjusted net loss of $51.2 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated revenues totaled $472.0 million as compared with $478.8 million in 2012, reflecting a 13.8% increase in met coal sales volume, more than offset by the impact of lower met coal prices, which declined an average of $14.26 per metric ton ("MT") compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the quarter totaled $59.9 million. Excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, foreign exchange gains and other items, adjusted EBITDA totaled $59.2 million. Fourth quarter 2012 adjusted EBITDA totaled $6.8 million. A reconciliation of Loss from continuing operations to EBITDA from continuing operations, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is provided in the Company's "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" included with this release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Sales Volume and Pricing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth quarter 2013 met coal sales volume, including both hard coking coal ("HCC") and low-volatility ("low-vol") pulverized coal injection product ("PCI"), totaled 2.9 million metric tons ("MMTs"), an increase of 13.8% compared with 2012. HCC sales volume was 2.4 MMTs, an increase of 15.4% compared with 2012. Low-vol PCI sales volume totaled 0.5 MMTs, an increase of 7.5% compared with the prior-year comparable quarter. Met coal sales volume in the fourth quarter 2013 increased to 85% of total coal sales volume compared with 79% in the prior-year comparable quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average selling price for HCC was $137.39 per MT, down from the fourth quarter of 2012 average pricing of $152.50 per MT. Low-vol PCI pricing averaged $118.63 per MT in fourth quarter 2013 compared with $127.83 per MT in the prior-year comparable quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Cash Cost of Sales &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal cash cost of sales for fourth quarter 2013 averaged $107.52 per MT, down 20.6% compared with 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Production &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal production increased 28.3% to 3.2 MMTs in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with 2.5 MMTs in the prior-year period. Production improvements were driven by a significant increase in output from the Company's Mine No. 4 in Alabama, along with higher volume at the Company's Wolverine mine in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal average cash cost of production was $68.02 per MT in the quarter, down 28.1% compared with the prior-year comparable quarter. The improvement in average cash cost of production per ton was primarily the result of continued favorable operating performance from the Company's low and mid-vol mines in Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Expenses &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGA expenses totaled $20.3 million in the quarter, compared with $28.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Fourth quarter 2013 SGA expenses exclude $4.6 million of operations-related direct administrative charges included in cost of sales resulting from a 2013 change in accounting practice.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest expense for the quarter increased to $64.6 million compared with $49.6 million in 2012, primarily driven by an increase in the amount of our long-term debt and higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital Expenditures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company's capital expenditures totaled $45.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with $60.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures for the full-year 2013 totaled $153.9 million compared with $391.5 million for 2012. Lower capital spending in 2013 reflects the Company's continued focus on disciplined capital spending in light of current market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available liquidity was $587.3 million at December 31, 2013, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $260.8 million plus $326.5 million of availability under the Company's $375.0 million revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of $48.5 million.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety and Stewardship Highlights &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy improved safety performance in 2013. In addition, several mine rescue teams and individuals in the Company's U.S. operations won national recognition at the National Mine Rescue and First Aid contest. The Company also had an employee inducted into the National Mine Rescue Hall of Fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of Non-GAAP Measures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release contains the use of certain U.S. non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures. These non-GAAP measures are provided as supplemental information for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide additional insights into the performance of the Company, and they reflect how management analyzes Company performance and compares that performance against other companies. In addition, some investors use these measures to compare the Company against other companies and to help analyze the Company's ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs.&#160;Management also believes that these non-GAAP measures present a useful measure of the Company's ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing operations. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other entities. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is provided in the financial section of this release.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conference Call Webcast &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company will hold a webcast to discuss its fourth quarter 2013 results today, Feb. 20, 2014, at 10:00 a.m. ET.

						Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton is based on reported Cost of Sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost of Production per Ton is based on period costs of mining and includes items such as manpower, fuel and other similar production items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost per Ton is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe Average Cash Cost per Ton is a useful measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and future potential performance. Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

						Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton is based on reported Cost of Sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost of Production per Ton is based on period costs of mining and includes items such as manpower, fuel and other similar production items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost per Ton is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe Average Cash Cost per Ton is a useful measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and future potential performance. Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

						EBITDA from continuing operations is defined as earnings excluding discontinued operations before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and depletion expense. EBITDA from continuing operations is a financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA from continuing operations is a useful measure as some investors and analysts use EBITDA from continuing operations to compare us against other companies and to help analyze our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs.

						Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude net restructuring charges, asset impairments, loss on investment, other items including proxy contest expenses and foreign currency adjustments and gain on early extinguishment of debt. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant to a reader in understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure of our profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a useful measure of our ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing operations. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate our operating performance. Investors should be aware that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Adjusted net income (loss) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from Adjusted net income (loss) are significant to a reader in understanding and assessing our results of operations.

			14 Microsoft Technology Centers (MTC) in Four Continents Worldwide 
      Now Offer X-IO Storage
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Performance driven storage from X-IO helps customers to unlock the 
      potential of Microsoft based solution sets
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Storage industry innovator X-IO Technologies today announced that its 
      &#8220;Intelligent Storage Element&#8221; (ISE) storage solutions are now installed 
      in 14 Microsoft Technology Centers (MTC) globally. As one of a small 
      number of specialized hardware partners in Microsoft&#8217;s worldwide 
      network, X-IO&#8217;s performance driven storage is being tested as part of 
      the Microsoft enterprise architecture in locations including Paris, 
      Johannesburg, New York, Beijing and Munich, with plans for this to 
      increase over the next 12 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The digital universe grew by 50 percent in the last 12 months and 
      analysts predict storage volumes will reach up to four zetabytes 
      worldwide by the end of 2013. Managing the applications to utilize this 
      data deluge needs a collaborative environment. Microsoft&#8217;s MTCs are 
      designed to provide enterprises with access to innovative technologies 
      and world-class expertise, enabling users to design and deploy solutions 
      to meet their exact needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Storage is all about achieving a balance of performance, risk and cost. 
      X-IO&#8217;s ISE storage solutions offer incredible performance but at a 
      competitive price. They have performed very impressively with Microsoft 
      software to date,&#8221; said Cary Gottesman, Technology Architect, Microsoft 
      Technology Center, New York. &#8220;They work particularly well with our 
      database applications, including SQL Server, where the ISE is a 
      compelling option because it&#8217;s fast, easy to install and does exactly 
      what it&#8217;s supposed to do. This is done without any fuss from a small 
      footprint. X-IO&#8217;s ISE storage solutions are an ideal fit for MTCs and we 
      currently have enterprises across a number of sectors, including 
      financial and retail testing the systems. I am always very happy to 
      recommend X-IO.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a member of the MTC Alliances program, X-IO is part of a select group 
      of industry leaders in hardware, software and services. By working 
      together, the MTCs and their partners provide customers with the 
      products and services that exactly meet their needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Over the last 12 months we have deployed X-IO ISE solutions in over 14 
      of the Microsoft Technology Centres. Enterprises globally are now 
      benchmark testing X-IO as part of their Microsoft infrastructure 
      environments and seeing dramatic application performance," said Gavin 
      McLaughlin, Solutions Development Director, X-IO.&#160;"Our high performance 
      storage offers customers more and plays a critical role in helping 
      enterprises get the most out of Microsoft's modern operating system, 
      server and productivity software."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      About X-IO
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      X-IO Technologies is the only hardware company to have solved 
      fundamental challenges confronting enterprise storage. X-IO&#8217;s 
      Intelligent Storage Element (ISE) architecture, invented as a division 
      of Seagate Technology, addresses the demand of customers for long duty

      Fitch Affirms Coca-Cola's IDRs at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Negative
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and the 
      debt ratings of The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its subsidiaries 
      as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term IDR at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Bank credit facilities at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper (CP) at 'F1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. 
      (CCR)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term IDR at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior shelf at 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable. Coca-Cola 
      had approximately $37.1 billion of debt as of Dec. 31, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook revision to Negative is due to Fitch's concern with 
      Coca-Cola's high gross leverage that has been elevated by substantial 
      commercial paper (CP) balances. Coca-Cola's gross leverage is weak for 
      the rating category at 2.8x on a total debt-to-operating EBITDA basis at 
      the end of 2013, up from 2.4x a year ago. Coca-Cola's CP balance remains 
      substantial at $16.9 billion at the end of 2013, a slight increase of 
      $700 million in the past year. This compares to $12.9 billion in 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch between its 
      U.S. cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows which 
      the company has not felt a need to repatriate at this time. Coca-Cola 
      maintains a comparable cash balance along with its committed bank lines 
      to provide backup to its CP borrowings. At the end of 2013, Coca-Cola's 
      liquidity position of $26.6 billion consisted of $17.1 billion of cash, 
      $3.1 billion of short-term investments, and $6.4 billion of availability 
      under its committed credit lines and revolving credit facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch views the significant cash balances that back Coca-Cola's CP 
      program and lower its net leverage to 1.26x as a key mitigating factor. 
      However, the vast majority of the company's cash is offshore, making it 
      costly to repatriate if necessary. Additionally, the CP mix is slightly 
      less than 50% of the firm's overall capital structure which Fitch 
      believes increases Coca-Cola's financial risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite the company's good liquidity and on-going market access, the 
      higher sustained levels of CP and the uncertainty of when Coca-Cola 
      could use cash to reduce CP balances remain a concern. Coca-Cola has 
      indicated that $20 billion is the upper limit for its CP program. Fitch 
      believes Coca-Cola should advance a longer-term definitive plan to 
      address its large CP balance with any reduction in cash matching any 
      corresponding reduction in CP levels resulting in lower gross debt. 
      Following its late 2013 refinancing, nearer-term debt maturities in 2014 
      were reduced. Coca-Cola also used a portion of the proceeds to term-out 
      CP as CP balances at the end of the third quarter 2013 had risen to 
      $18.8 billion. Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturities include $1 billion 
      coming due in 2014 and $3.5 billion maturing in 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest 
      global beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola 
      has 17 $1 billion brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, 
      Powerade, Minute Maid, and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated 
      soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage portfolio, the ratings 
      consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in the U.S., growing 
      scrutiny over artificial sweeteners and modest CSD growth in other 
      developed countries. However, this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's 
      market strength in developing, higher-growth geographies with low per 
      capita consumption characteristics that should provide an important 
      longer-term offset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to consistently 
      generate considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash 
      flow (FCF). For 2013, Coca-Cola generated $10.5 billion and $3 billion 
      (after adjusting for dividends) of CFFO and FCF, respectively, after 
      generating $10.6 billion and $3.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 
      2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has committed to $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net share 
      repurchases in 2014, after repurchasing a net $3.5 billion in 2013. 
      Fitch expects Coca-Cola's FCF in 2014 to be at least in the $3.5 billion 
      range driven in part by reduced pension contributions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency in the past 
      with top-line and cash flow growth driven by increasing volume, 
      price/mix and improved operating expense leverage. Persistent global 
      macroeconomic pressure, higher taxes, negative perceptions of artificial 
      sweeteners and weather-related issues made volume growth more 
      challenging during 2013. Coca-Cola reported that global volume grew 2%, 
      below the lower end of its long-term financial targets of 3%-4% for 
      worldwide volume growth. Reported revenue and operating income grew 3% 
      and 6%, respectively, when excluding the impact of structural changes, 
      which is at the low end of its 6%-8% target for operating income growth. 
      As such, the global economic recovery remains challenging, negatively 
      affecting consumer spending, with pockets of volatility across emerging 
      market regions. Reflecting these challenges, Coca-Cola announced an 
      incremental $1 billion productivity savings by 2016 that will be 
      primarily redirected for increased media investments to support the 
      brand, which Fitch views favorably.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ratings also consider the potential for future acquisitions given the 
      company's transaction history. Coca-Cola has material flexibility to 
      engage in smaller acquisitions through its cash balances and free cash 
      generation. Fitch views the new 10-year agreement with Green Coffee 
      Mountain Roaster's for $1.25 billion as a positive for Coca-Cola's 
      operating profile. The shifting secular trends within the soft drink 
      industry make this investment essential to create an additional avenue 
      for growth. This provides a defensive position against at-home 
      competitive threats and enables opportunities for new consumption 
      occasions across an emerging distribution channel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and 
      Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default 
      risk is very low at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are 
      structurally superior to the notes issued by Coca-Cola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATINGS SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, 
      lead Fitch to affirm the ratings with a Stable Outlook include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Coca-Cola develops a definitive plan to reduce CP balances and gross 
      debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, 
      lead to negative rating action include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --If Coca-Cola's ratings are negatively affected by a large 
      debt-financed acquisition or share repurchase program, a reduction in 
      cash and cash equivalents without a commensurate reduction in CP 
      balances, and/or the lack of a plan to reduce gross leverage over the 
      longer term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, further negative pressure from increased declines with CSD 
      volumes in the U.S., greater than expected volatility in emerging market 
      regions, aggressive excise taxes increases in multiple regions, shift in 
      focus from pricing to volume, and margin erosion from channel mix shifts 
      could also affect ratings.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
CHICAGO, February 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the
Issuer Default 
Ratings (IDRs) and the debt ratings of The Coca-Cola Company
(Coca-Cola) and its 
subsidiaries as follows:
The Coca-Cola Company
--Long-term IDR at 'A+';
--Bank credit facilities at 'A+';
--Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';
--Short-term IDR at 'F1';
--Commercial paper (CP) at 'F1'. 
Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments
Canada, Ltd. (CCR)
--Long-term IDR at 'A+';
--Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';
--Senior shelf at 'A+'.
The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable.
Coca-Cola had 
approximately $37.1 billion of debt as of Dec. 31, 2013.
The Rating Outlook revision to Negative is due to Fitch's
concern with 
Coca-Cola's high gross leverage that has been elevated by
substantial commercial 
paper (CP) balances. Coca-Cola's gross leverage is weak for the
rating category 
at 2.8x on a total debt-to-operating EBITDA basis at the end of
2013, up from 
2.4x a year ago. Coca-Cola's CP balance remains substantial at
$16.9 billion at 
the end of 2013, a slight increase of $700 million in the past
year. This 
compares to $12.9 billion in 2011.
The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch
between its U.S. 
cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows
which the company 
has not felt a need to repatriate at this time. Coca-Cola
maintains a comparable 
cash balance along with its committed bank lines to provide
backup to its CP 
borrowings. At the end of 2013, Coca-Cola's liquidity position
of $26.6 billion 
consisted of $17.1 billion of cash, $3.1 billion of short-term
investments, and 
$6.4 billion of availability under its committed credit lines
and revolving 
credit facility.
Fitch views the significant cash balances that back Coca-Cola's
CP program and 
lower its net leverage to 1.26x as a key mitigating factor.
However, the vast 
majority of the company's cash is offshore, making it costly to
repatriate if 
necessary. Additionally, the CP mix is slightly less than 50% of
the firm's 
overall capital structure which Fitch believes increases
Coca-Cola's financial 
risk.
Despite the company's good liquidity and on-going market access,
the higher 
sustained levels of CP and the uncertainty of when Coca-Cola
could use cash to 
reduce CP balances remain a concern. Coca-Cola has indicated
that $20 billion is 
the upper limit for its CP program. Fitch believes Coca-Cola
should advance a 
longer-term definitive plan to address its large CP balance with
any reduction 
in cash matching any corresponding reduction in CP levels
resulting in lower 
gross debt. Following its late 2013 refinancing, nearer-term
debt maturities in 
2014 were reduced. Coca-Cola also used a portion of the proceeds
to term-out CP 
as CP balances at the end of the third quarter 2013 had risen to
$18.8 billion. 
Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturities include $1 billion coming
due in 2014 and 
$3.5 billion maturing in 2015.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Coca-Cola ratings are supported by its position as the world's
largest global 
beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola
has 17 $1 
billion brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite,
Powerade, Minute Maid, 
and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks
(CSDs) in Coca-Cola's 
beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline
in CSD volumes in 
the U.S., growing scrutiny over artificial sweeteners and modest
CSD growth in 
other developed countries. However, this risk is mitigated by
Coca-Cola's market 
strength in developing, higher-growth geographies with low per
capita 
consumption characteristics that should provide an important
longer-term offset.
Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to
consistently generate 
considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow
(FCF). For 
2013, Coca-Cola generated $10.5 billion and $3 billion (after
adjusting for 
dividends) of CFFO and FCF, respectively, after generating $10.6
billion and 
$3.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012. 
Coca-Cola has committed to $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net
share repurchases 
in 2014, after repurchasing a net $3.5 billion in 2013. Fitch
expects 
Coca-Cola's FCF in 2014 to be at least in the $3.5 billion range
driven in part 
by reduced pension contributions.
Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency in the
past with 
top-line and cash flow growth driven by increasing volume,
price/mix and 
improved operating expense leverage. Persistent global
macroeconomic pressure, 
higher taxes, negative perceptions of artificial sweeteners and
weather-related 
issues made volume growth more challenging during 2013.
Coca-Cola reported that 
global volume grew 2%, below the lower end of its long-term
financial targets of 
3%-4% for worldwide volume growth. Reported revenue and
operating income grew 3% 
and 6%, respectively, when excluding the impact of structural
changes, which is 
at the low end of its 6%-8% target for operating income growth.
As such, the 
global economic recovery remains challenging, negatively
affecting consumer 
spending, with pockets of volatility across emerging market
regions. Reflecting 
these challenges, Coca-Cola announced an incremental $1 billion
productivity 
savings by 2016 that will be primarily redirected for increased
media 
investments to support the brand, which Fitch views favorably.
Ratings also consider the potential for future acquisitions
given the company's 
transaction history. Coca-Cola has material flexibility to
engage in smaller 
acquisitions through its cash balances and free cash generation.
Fitch views the 
new 10-year agreement with Green Coffee Mountain Roaster's for
$1.25 billion as 
a positive for Coca-Cola's operating profile. The shifting
secular trends within 
the soft drink industry make this investment essential to create
an additional 
avenue for growth. This provides a defensive position against
at-home 
competitive threats and enables opportunities for new
consumption occasions 
across an emerging distribution channel. 
Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola
Company and Coca-Cola 
Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default
risk is very low 
at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally
superior to the 
notes issued by Coca-Cola.
RATINGS SENSITIVITIES
Positive: Future developments that may, individually or
collectively, lead Fitch 
to affirm the ratings with a Stable Outlook include: 
--Coca-Cola develops a definitive plan to reduce CP balances and
gross debt. 
Negative: Future developments that may, individually or
collectively, lead to 
negative rating action include:
--If Coca-Cola's ratings are negatively affected by a large
debt-financed 
acquisition or share repurchase program, a reduction in cash and
cash 
equivalents without a commensurate reduction in CP balances,
and/or the lack of 
a plan to reduce gross leverage over the longer term. 
In addition, further negative pressure from increased declines
with CSD volumes 
in the U.S., greater than expected volatility in emerging market
regions, 
aggressive excise taxes increases in multiple regions, shift in
focus from 
pricing to volume, and margin erosion from channel mix shifts
could also affect 
ratings.
Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola as follows:
The Coca-Cola Company
--Long-term IDR 'A+';
--Bank credit facilities 'A+';
--Senior unsecured debt 'A+';
--Short-term IDR 'F1';
--CP 'F1'.
Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments

--Long-term IDR 'A+';

      Fitch Expects to Rate Goldman Sachs International Bank CD Programme 
      'A/F1'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings expects to assign ratings of 'A/F1' to Goldman Sachs 
      International Bank's (GSIB) Certificate of Deposit (CD) Programme.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings primarily reflect Fitch's view that GSIB is a core 
      subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman) and therefore 
      Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of GSIB are equalized with Goldman's IDRs. 
      The CDs represent unsecured obligations and are expected to rank pari 
      passu with all unsecured obligations of GSIB. As such, the ratings of 
      the CD programme are equalized with GSIB's IDRs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes that GSIB is a key part of Goldman's international 
      operations acting as a primary European bond dealer; originating, 
      trading and syndicating loans; conducting securities borrowing/lending 
      activities; and offering multi-currency deposits. GSIB maintains prudent 
      liquidity and capitalization which are augmented by the capacity to tap 
      liquidity and additional capital from Goldman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given Fitch's view that GSIB is a core subsidiary of Goldman, IDRs of 
      GSIB would change as a result of any changes to Goldman's IDRs. In the 
      event that Fitch no longer considers GSIB as a core part of Goldman's 
      operations, ratings of GSIB and the CD programme could be negatively 
      affected.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 21 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said on Friday its oil and natural gas
reserves fell slightly last year, largely due to drops in the
United States and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had proved reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of
oil equivalent on Dec. 31, roughly 1.3 percent less than the end
of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declining reserves has become a widespread concern for
international oil companies, many of which have massive capital
budgets to find and extract oil and natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proved, developed reserves, a measurement of reserves that
can be recovered with existing wells, fell in the U.S., Africa,
Asia and Europe, and rose in Australia and in the western
hemisphere outside the U.S., the company said in a regulatory
filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said last month it would keep its massive capital
budget, worth about $40 billion, on track for the next few
years, a contrast to peers who are cutting spending.&lt;/p&gt;

Friday announced deals to sell bottling operations in the
greater Chicago and central Florida areas as it slowly undoes

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Shares in Mexican broadcaster and pay TV provider Grupo Televisa, the world's biggest producer of Spanish-language content, rose sharply on Friday, a day after it raised the value of its investment in U.S. broadcaster Univision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company raised the value of its option to convert loans to Univision UVN.UL into an equity position after it said an anonymous investor took a $125 million stake in the company, valuing it at $8 billion or 15 times core profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) shares rose 4.21 percent to 77.75 pesos shortly before midday, after climbing more than 6 percent immediately following the company's conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has equity and debentures that, with U.S. regulatory approval, could be converted into a 37 percent stake in Univision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives from Televisa, which reported a drop in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, said they increased the fair-value of their option in Univision by $385 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was a conservative increase, Televisa Chairman Alfonso de Angoitia said on the call with analysts. "At that valuation that was paid by that financial investor we could value it at $3 billion, but we are being conservative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mexican firm also expects royalties from Univision to increase this year on rising demand for Televisa's content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory changes in Mexico could introduce more competition into the country's television, Internet and phone markets this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa is likely to be deemed a dominant broadcaster by Mexico's regulator in a decision expected in March. That means the company will have to offer its public broadcast channels to pay-television producers for free as part of a process known as 'must carry, must offer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In spite of the negative impact of 'must offer' in our content business, we are giving guidance for the content revenue growth in 2013 of mid-single digits," said Angoitia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For 2014, we expect Univision to continue delivering solid top line results, potentially resulting in royalties to Televisa of $350 million," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royalties from Univision were $273.2 million in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's
largest publicly traded oil company, said on Friday its crude
oil and natural gas reserves rose slightly in 2013, lifted by
projects in U.S. shale fields and Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proved reserve additions of 1.6 billion barrels oil
equivalent from places like the Permian Basin in Texas and the
Bakken Shale in North Dakota helped Exxon replace 103 percent of
its 2013 output, the Irving, Texas company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Exxon's reserve replacement ratio, a key measure of
growth for investors, was 115 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At year end, Exxon's proved reserves totaled 25.2 billion
oil-equivalent barrels. The reserves were 53 percent liquids,
which typically bring higher profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon fell 9 cents to $95.28 in morning trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      reputation and lead-response company, today announced the launch of its 
      Microsoft Windows 8.1 App, now available for use on Microsoft Surface

      dealers looking to better manage their social footprint and online 
      presence.

      This new Windows 8.1 based social media app is a game-changer for the 
      automotive industry. Because it was built as a native app leveraging the 
      Windows 8.1 platform, it is able to deliver an at-a-glance view of all 
      social and review activities for a dealership.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The newly launched app features include the ability to see survey 
      statistics on an individual employee level and displays the information 
      immediately on the first screen without the need to click through 
      multiple screens. This format provides real-time results, saving a 
      dealer time and ensuring more of the information is viewed.

				Recent Activity &#8211; Alerts and tracking for all recent social 
        media activity is available for quick reference to better understand 
        prospect and customer social engagement.
      
			
				Online Reviews &#8211; Dealers are alerted to all online reviews and 
        can take action to respond to customers instantly, increasing customer 
        satisfaction and engagement. The app monitors and proactively manages 
        over 20 review sites including the top five auto review sites: 
        Cars.com, Edmunds, Google+ Local, Yelp, and Yahoo! Local.
      
			
				Survey Stats &#8211; Dealers have the ability to survey sales and 
        service customers daily to get instant feedback. This information is 
        incredibly helpful to improve operations and respond to customers by 
        phone, text or email, right from the app.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Exxon Mobil Corporation Announces 2013 Reserves Replacement Totaled 
      103 Percent
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Reserves replacement exceeded 100 percent for 20th 
        consecutive year
      
			
        Reserves additions totaled 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels
      
			
        Liquids replaced at a ratio of 153 percent, bringing total proved 
        reserves base to 53 percent liquids
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today it replaced 103 percent 
      of its 2013 production by adding proved oil and gas reserves totaling 
      1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels, including a 153 percent replacement 
      ratio for crude oil and other liquids.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our industry-leading record of long-term reserves replacement 
      demonstrates the success of our global strategy to identify, evaluate, 
      pursue and capture high-quality opportunities,&#8221; said Rex W. Tillerson, 
      chairman and chief executive officer. &#8220;The size and diversity of 
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s global resource base, the largest held by an international 
      oil company, provide us with unequaled investment flexibility to 
      profitably develop new supplies of energy to meet future demand.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At year-end 2013, ExxonMobil's proved reserves totaled 25.2 billion 
      oil-equivalent barrels, which was made up of 53 percent liquids, up from 
      51 percent in 2012, and 47 percent natural gas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquid additions during 2013 totaled 1.2 billion barrels, or 153 percent 
      of production, and natural gas additions totaled 400 million 
      oil-equivalent barrels for a 52 percent replacement ratio. Excluding the 
      impact of asset sales, reserves additions during 2013 replaced 106 
      percent of production.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It was the 20th consecutive year that ExxonMobil replaced more than 100 
      percent of its production. The average replacement ratio over the past 
      10 years -- considered a better indicator of reserves performance due to 
      the long-term nature of the industry -- was 120 percent. Liquids 
      replacement over the period averaged 104 percent and natural gas 
      replacement averaged 141 percent. The reserves additions made over the 
      10-year period comprise a diverse range of resource types and have broad 
      geographical representation. ExxonMobil&#8217;s reserves life at current 
      production rates is 16 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reserve additions in 2013 at Upper Zakum in Abu Dhabi totaled more than 
      700 million barrels of crude oil. Reserve additions from the 
      liquids-rich Woodford, Bakken and Permian plays in the United States and 
      the Montney and Duvernay plays in Canada totaled more than 300 million 
      oil equivalent barrels. Other additions to proved reserves were made in 
      Canada, Kazakhstan, the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria and the Netherlands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reserves additions in 2013 reflect new developments with significant 
      funding commitments as well as revisions and extensions of existing 
      fields resulting from drilling, studies and analysis of reservoir 
      performance. The annual reporting of proved reserves is the product of 
      the corporation&#8217;s long-standing, rigorous process that ensures 
      consistency and management accountability in all reserves bookings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Resource Base
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During 2013, ExxonMobil added 6.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its 
      resource base, driven primarily by resource additions in Canada, 
      Argentina, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. 
      Additions include continued success in by-the-bit exploration 
      discoveries, undeveloped resource additions and strategic acquisitions. 
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s by-the-bit conventional exploration success in 2013 
      included discoveries in Tanzania, Nigeria and Australia. In addition, 
      discovery and delineation of North American unconventional assets 
      contributed to the resource base. Overall, the corporation&#8217;s resource 
      base totaled nearly 91 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2013, 
      taking into account field revisions, production, and asset sales. The 
      resource base includes proved reserves, plus other discovered resources 
      that are expected to be ultimately recovered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CAUTIONARY NOTE: Proved reserve figures in this release are based on 
      current SEC definitions. For years prior to 2009 reflected in our 
      10-year average replacement ratio and 20-straight years of at least 100% 
      replacement, proved reserve volumes were determined on bases that 
      differed from SEC definitions in effect at the time. Specifically, for 
      years prior to 2009, reserves were determined using the price and cost 
      assumptions we use in managing the business, not the historic prices 
      used in the SEC definitions. Reserves also include oil sands and equity 
      company reserves for all periods, which were excluded from SEC reserves 
      prior to 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The reserves replacement ratio is calculated for a specified period 
      utilizing the applicable proved oil-equivalent reserves additions 
      divided by oil-equivalent production.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The terms &#8220;resources&#8221; and &#8220;resource base&#8221; include quantities of 
      discovered oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves 
      but that are expected to be ultimately recovered in the future. The term 
      &#8220;resource base&#8221; is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as 
      &#8220;probable&#8221; or &#8220;possible&#8221; reserves.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The term &#8220;project&#8221; as used in this release does not necessarily have the 
      same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.

&lt;p&gt;MADRID Feb 21 (Reuters) - Spain's largest cable operator
Ono has hired Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan
 to coordinate its plans for a stock market flotation, a
source with knowledge of the situation said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ono, which sells fixed and mobile phone, TV and internet
services, has been preparing a 7 billion euro ($9.6
billion)listing to capitalise on strong investor interest in
European cable firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A number of names have been rumoured, but these two banks
have the mandate," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ono declined to comment. The telecoms group will hold a
shareholders' meeting on March 13 to formally approve the
initial public offering (IPO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity funds Providence Equity Partners, Thomas H.
Lee Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors and Quadrangle Capital own
54 percent of Ono. Spanish bank Santander holds 4.4
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ono believes it has an enterprise value of around 7 billion
euros, including debt worth 3.4 billion euros. Based on this,
around 25 percent of the company would float on the stock
exchange after the listing, a separate source, who had been
briefed on the board's talks, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ono's private equity owners had also been approached by
Britain's Vodafone with a takeover offer, sources have
previously told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company's board decided earlier this month to press
on with the IPO plans and did not discuss takeover proposals,
putting pressure on potential bidders to up their offers.&lt;/p&gt;

      Troy Taylor will be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the new 
      bottling company that will serve Central Florida, including Tampa/St. 
      Petersburg. With more than 20 years of business leadership experience, 
      Taylor has significant knowledge in leading strategic initiatives and 
      transactions for franchise-related businesses, including multiple 
      Coca-Cola-related investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Troy Taylor has been a trusted advisor to The Coca-Cola Company on 
      critical strategic initiatives for more than a decade,&#8221; said Douglas. 
      &#8220;He is well-known and respected by our System, and we are pleased to 
      welcome him as a new bottling partner.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I have long believed that Coca-Cola serves up moments of happiness and 
      I am excited to join the Coca-Cola family. This new arrangement expands 
      on an already successful, long-standing relationship I have with the 
      Company,&#8221; said Taylor. &#8220;Together we are committed to delivering 
      excellent service to customers and refreshing experiences to consumers 
      in the Sunshine State.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As we have said, the Coca-Cola System should be a reflection of the 
      communities where we operate and the consumers and customers that we 
      serve,&#8221; said Douglas. &#8220;Partnering with these two top-notch ownership 
      groups is further evidence of this commitment,&#8221; said Douglas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola has always been a leader in giving back to the communities 
      where it does business,&#8221; said M. Jude Reyes, Founder and Co-Chairman of 
      Reyes Holdings. &#8220;As a new member of the Coca-Cola family, we share those 
      values and are dedicated to being the best distributor we can be while 
      contributing back to the communities in which we operate.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In April 2013, The Coca-Cola Company announced that it had signed 
      Letters of Intent with five U.S. bottlers which committed to creating a 
      stronger U.S. business model through the granting of new, expanded 
      territories. The five bottlers are Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, 
      Coca-Cola Bottling Company United Inc., Swire Coca-Cola USA, Coca-Cola 
      Bottling Company High Country and Corinth Coca-Cola Bottling Works, Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company is very encouraged by the transition of High Country, which 
      closed at the end of 2013. Looking ahead, the Company is aligned with 
      the other four bottlers announced in 2013. It is expected that they will 
      reach Definitive Agreements shortly and those transactions will begin 
      closing later this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In all of the newly granted territories, the new bottlers and The 
      Coca-Cola Company will work collaboratively to implement key elements of 
      their evolving U.S. operating model, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A grant of exclusive territory rights and the sale by Coca-Cola 
        Refreshments (CCR) of distribution assets and cold drink equipment
      
			
        A finished goods model under which production assets will remain with 
        CCR, which would facilitate future implementation of a national 
        product supply system
      
			
        An improved, more integrated information technology platform

			JPMorgan Chase and Shareholder Proponents Reach Agreement Resulting 
      in Withdrawal of Shareholder Proposals
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. today announced that it has reached agreement with 
      shareholder proponents on the withdrawal of two proposals for the 2014 
      annual meeting and the steps the company will take in response.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth along with a number of other 
      sponsors had submitted a proposal, now withdrawn, that the board 
      commission a report describing the steps the company has taken to 
      address a number of challenges faced by the bank. The company agrees 
      with the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth that comprehensive 
      communications around best practices and lessons learned is valuable for 
      all of our stakeholders and agreed to prepare a report similar to that 
      proposed. This report will consolidate the relevant information and 
      provide it to shareholders in a readily available document.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sister Barbara Aires of the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth, said, 
      &#8220;Our resolution pressed for comprehensive transparency regarding the 
      challenges faced by the bank and controls put in place to address them. 
      Through fruitful and instructive dialogue we were able to reach a 
      mutually agreeable solution with the company. We look forward to the 
      timely completion of the planned report.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Needmor Fund had also submitted a proposal, now withdrawn, that the 
      board require that the Chair be independent, beginning with the next CEO 
      transition. The company emphasized that it continues to welcome an 
      ongoing dialogue with the proponents and other corporate governance 
      professionals focusing on major issues related to the Chair and CEO 
      roles at public companies, including specific questions corporate 
      directors might consider in reviewing the implications of combining or 
      separating the roles of CEO and Chair.

      Timothy Smith of Walden Asset Management, speaking on behalf of the 
      Needmor Fund, said, &#8220;We are pleased with the positive response from the

      regarding these important governance matters.&#8221;

      Lee Raymond, Lead Independent Director of the company&#8217;s board, said,

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is reducing the price of Windows 8.1 for manufacturers of low-cost computers and tablets by 70 percent to compete with cheaper products like Google Inc's Chromebooks, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing sources familiar with the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is pushing to reach a far wider audience for smartphones running its Windows Phone software by turning to cheaper chipsets and easing restrictions on how phone makers use its software to encourage them to drive down costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Parker, Microsoft's senior vice president for handset makers, said the changes have attracted a range of new handset makers to build Windows Phones, including South Korea's LG Electronics, India's Xola and Karbonn, and ZTE, Foxconn, Lenovo, Gionee and Longcheer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are open for business on Windows Phone to anyone who wants to build a Windows phone," Parker said at the Mobile World Congress trade fair on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Phones typically sell for several hundred dollars a piece, although Nokia's Lumia 520 handset has an unsubsidized price of about 139 euros ($190) in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sub-$100 smartphone market, however, is dominated by Google's Android operating system, which has lower licensing costs, is more adaptable by device makers, and runs on more, and cheaper, chip sets that run radio and other functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android phones from dozens of handset makers accounted for almost four out of every five smartphones sold, or 781.2 million units, last year, according to Strategy Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was a distant third in market share terms, behind Apple, which shipped 153.4 million smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 5.7 million Windows Mobile units were shipped worldwide, Strategy Analytics said. While it gained a more than 10 percent share in some markets, for example Italy, other markets like the United States remained tough, Vice President Joe Belgiore said in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next major update of the software in coming months would allow it to support less expensive chip sets from its existing supplier, Qualcomm Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the Windows Phone standards would also be eased, he said. Microsoft had previously kept a tight grip on hardware specifications, for example insisting on three physical buttons, to create a uniform Windows Phone user experience, regardless of handset maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is no longer a requirement, allowing phone makers to use cheaper soft keys and adapt designs used for Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belgiore said Microsoft was investing in improvements that would help handset makers get Windows Phone on devices at "lower costs in terms of manufacturing, licensing and those sorts of things".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in a bid to reach immigrant workers looking to cheaply call home, Microsoft is including support for dual SIM cards, allowing users to switch phone tariffs to make cheaper local or international calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lion's share of Windows Phones, more than 90 percent last year according to AdDuplex, are made by Nokia. Microsoft is just about to close a deal to buy Nokia's handset business for $7.2 billion. HTC, Huawei and Samsung also make Windows Mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will continue to have those iconic devices from our deep partners, but also we'll see an emergence of a lot more of what we call white label phones, maybe operators' phone themselves, retailers' phones," Parker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said on Sunday it would update its Windows 8.1 operating system, which runs on PCs and tablets, in the coming months after research found traditional keyboard users were less satisfied with the software than previous versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We love touch, but we think we could improve the situation for all those keyboard users," Belgiore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7275 euros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Mohammad Zargham)&lt;/p&gt;

things".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in a bid to reach immigrant workers looking to
cheaply call home, Microsoft is including support for dual SIM
cards, allowing users to switch phone tariffs to make cheaper
local or international calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lion's share of Windows Phones, more than 90 percent
last year according to AdDuplex, are made by Nokia. Microsoft is
just about to close a deal to buy Nokia's handset business for
$7.2 billion. HTC, Huawei and Samsung 
also make Windows Mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will continue to have those iconic devices from our deep
partners, but also we'll see an emergence of a lot more of what
we call white label phones, maybe operators' phone themselves,
retailers' phones," Parker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said on Sunday it would update its Windows
8.1 operating system, which runs on PCs and tablets, in the
coming months after research found traditional keyboard users
were less satisfied with the software than previous versions of
Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We love touch, but we think we could improve the situation
for all those keyboard users," Belgiore said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Opposition leader Narendra Modi has widened his lead as candidate to become India's prime minister and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is likely to emerge as the single largest party in coming elections, according to a new opinion poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BJP also picked up support in Uttar Pradesh and is set to get half the seats in the heartland state which sends the largest number of lawmakers to parliament, according to the ABP News-Nielsen poll forecast, published on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results present a challenge to Rahul Gandhi, the fourth generation member of the long-ruling Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, who is leading the ruling Congress party-led coalition in national polls due by May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 57 per cent of respondents in the survey, conducted in February, picked Modi as their favorite candidate for prime minister, four points more than in the agency's January survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gandhi trailed with a rating of 18 percent, though he picked up three percentage points from January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll predicted the BJP and its allies would win 236 of 543 seats at stake in parliament's lower house, while the Congress and its allies would drop to double-digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 800 million people are eligible to vote in the world's largest democratic exercise to choose a new government. India, Asia's third largest economy, is growing at its slowest clip in a decade, choking off employment opportunities for thousands of young people who join the workforce each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rule, a party needs the support of 272 lawmakers. The BJP, even with the biggest number of seats, will have to seek out coalition partners if the poll's predictions are correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Uttar Pradesh, which accounts for 80 seats, the BJP was estimated to win 40, up five from the January poll. The Congress party was expected to win seven seats, a drop of one from last month's forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 29,000 people across the country were interviewed for the poll. Local opinion polls have had a mixed record in the past, given the country's huge and diverse electorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gandhi has struggled to draw support for the Congress party, which is mired by corruption scandals and policy paralysis. He has seemed distant at times, unsure of how to stop the slide in the 129-year-old party's fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the relatively untested Gandhi, Modi has years of experience as the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat, where he has built a reputation as an efficient, business-savvy administrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But charges that Modi was complicit in riots in Gujarat that killed at least 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, have cast a shadow over his ambitions for the top job. Critics accuse him of not having done enough to stop the violence, allegations he has strenuously denied and have never been proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ron Popeski)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details on standard Pneumovax vaccine, updates share
price, final two paragraphs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ransdell Pierson and Caroline Humer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 24 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Monday that
Prevnar 13, its blockbuster vaccine against childhood
infections, prevented pneumonia outside of hospitals in people
age 65 and older, in one of the largest drug trials ever
conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 85,000-patient study, called CAPiTA, also showed that
Prevnar 13 prevented invasive pneumococcal disease, meaning
infections of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria in the
bloodstream and other normally sterile sites in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts have predicted that success of the
trial would boost annual sales of Prevnar 13 by $1 billion or
more, as doctors steer elderly patients to the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect the U.S. and other developed markets to broadly
recommend adult use of the product," given favorable results
from the study, J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a
research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schott said he expects Prevnar 13 sales among adults of $300
million in 2015, rising to $1.5 billion in future years as it is
more widely used for that population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 300,000 adults aged 50 and older are
hospitalized every year because of pneumococcal pneumonia, a
substantial cause of illness and death, according to the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevnar 13, sold under the brand name Prevenar 13 in many
markets outside the United States, is one of Pfizer's biggest
products. The drug, and an older version of the vaccine known as
Prevnar 7, have annual sales of $4.4 billion, making them the
company's second-biggest franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, Prevnar 13 met its primary goal of
preventing a first episode of community-acquired pneumonia. It
also met a secondary goal of preventing a first episode of
invasive bloodstream infections, which are typically far more
severe than pneumonia without such bloodstream involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said data from the study, conducted in the
Netherlands, would be presented at a medical meeting in India
next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA in early 2010 approved Prevnar 13, to protect
children against additional strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae
bacteria that cause an array of diseases, including pneumonia,
ear infections and meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. health regulator in late 2011 widened the
approved use of Prevnar 13 to include adults age 50 and older,
to prevent pneumonia and invasive infections. The approval was
conditioned, however, on success of the now-completed CAPiTA
study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Favorable data from the study are expected to be added to
the package insert label of Prevnar 13, greatly boosting the
attractiveness of the vaccine to doctors with elderly patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co, said
relatively few adults have yet been vaccinated with Prevnar 13.
He predicted adult sales will rise to $1.3 billion in 2020 and
that total sales of the Prevnar franchise will rise to $6
billion that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard pneumonia vaccine, Pneumovax from Merck &amp; Co
, is approved to prevent pneumococcal disease in patients
50 years and older and children as young as 2 at risk of
pneumococcal infections. But it is not considered highly
effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 1.7 percent to $31.99 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, amid a 0.7 percent gain for the ARCA
Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European
drugmakers.

It also met a secondary goal of preventing a first episode of invasive bloodstream infections, which are typically far more severe than pneumonia without such bloodstream involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said data from the study, conducted in the Netherlands, would be presented at a medical meeting in India next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA in early 2010 approved Prevnar 13, to protect children against additional strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria that cause an array of diseases, including pneumonia, ear infections and meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. health regulator in late 2011 widened the approved use of Prevnar 13 to include adults age 50 and older, to prevent pneumonia and invasive infections. The approval was conditioned, however, on success of the now-completed CAPiTA study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Favorable data from the study are expected to be added to the package insert label of Prevnar 13, greatly boosting the attractiveness of the vaccine to doctors with elderly patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co, said relatively few adults have yet been vaccinated with Prevnar 13. He predicted adult sales will rise to $1.3 billion in 2020 and that total sales of the Prevnar franchise will rise to $6 billion that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 1.2 percent to $31.85 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a 0.7 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Caroline Humer; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Bernadette Baum and Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Announces FDA Approval to Include Radiographic Data on 
      Reduction of Progression of Structural Joint Damage for Adults with 
      Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis in Labeling for 
      XELJANZ&#174; (tofacitinib citrate)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) has approved a supplemental New Drug Application 
      (sNDA) to update the current label of XELJANZ&#174; (tofacitinib 
      citrate) 5 mg tablets to include radiographic data from two Phase 3 
      studies, ORAL Scan (A3921044) and ORAL Start (A3921069). &#8220;XELJANZ is the 
      first oral JAK inhibitor for moderately to severely active rheumatoid 
      arthritis. The reduction of radiographic progression seen in ORAL Scan 
      and ORAL Start represents a clinically meaningful outcome for patients,&#8221; 
      said Dr. Steven Romano, Global Medicines Development Lead for the Pfizer 
      Global Innovative Pharmaceutical business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to 
      severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate 
      response or intolerance to methotrexate (MTX). XELJANZ may be used as a 
      single agent or in combination with MTX or other non-biologic 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Use of XELJANZ in 
      combination with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants, such as 
      azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended. The recommended dose 
      is 5 mg twice-daily (BID).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The U.S. Prescribing Information contains a boxed warning for serious 
      infections and malignancies. Patients treated with XELJANZ are at 
      increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to 
      hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections 
      were taking concomitant immunosuppressants, such as MTX or 
      corticosteroids. Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in 
      patients treated with XELJANZ.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The updated U.S. label now includes the radiographic response data from 
      ORAL Scan (Study IV) at 6 months and ORAL Start (Study VI) at 6 and 12 
      months (see detailed study descriptions below the table). These studies 
      evaluated the effect of XELJANZ on the progression of structural joint 
      damage as measured by mean change from baseline in van der Heijde 
      modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, erosion score and 
      joint space narrowing (JSN) score. The proportion of patients with no 
      radiographic progression (mTSS change from baseline less than or equal 
      to 0) was also assessed.

      change from baseline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the placebo plus MTX group in ORAL Scan (Study IV), 74 percent of 
      patients experienced no radiographic progression at Month 6 compared to 
      84 percent of patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg BID plus MTX.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the MTX group of ORAL Start (Study VI), 55 percent of patients 
      experienced no radiographic progression at Month 6 compared to 73 
      percent of patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg BID.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is important to note that the U.S. label specifies that use of live 
      vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ. Update 
      immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to 
      initiating XELJANZ therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ORAL Start study showed that XELJANZ 5 mg BID, as a single agent, 
      was statistically significantly superior to MTX, providing a greater 
      inhibition of progression of structural joint damage, as measured by 
      mean change from baseline in mTSS at Month 6 (primary endpoint), and 
      sustained at 12 months (refer to table above). The study was conducted 
      in MTX-na&#239;ve patients with moderately to severely active RA who were 
      randomized to receive XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg BID or to MTX dose-titrated 
      over 8 weeks to 20 mg weekly. XELJANZ is not indicated for use in 
      MTX-na&#239;ve patients. The safety experience of the patients in ORAL Start 
      was consistent with the results of the five Phase 3 pivotal trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to 
      initiating XELJANZ in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; who 
      have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or an 
      opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of 
      endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions 
      that may predispose them to infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ORAL Scan study demonstrated that XELJANZ 10 mg BID provided 
      statistically significantly greater reduction of progression of 
      structural joint damage as measured by mean change from baseline in mTSS 
      compared to placebo at 6 months (primary endpoint &#8211; refer to table 
      above). Results for the 5 mg BID dose exhibited similar effects on mean 
      progression of structural damage but were not statistically significant 
      (refer to table above). The ORAL Scan study was conducted in patients 
      with moderately to severely active RA who had an inadequate response to 
      MTX. Patients were randomized to receive XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg BID or 
      placebo, and all treatments were added to background MTX. The controlled 
      period for the study ended at 6 months. The 10 mg BID dose is not 
      approved.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is important to note that the U.S. label says viral reactivation, 
      including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was 
      observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. XELJANZ should be used with 
      caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal 
      perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About XELJANZ
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) 
      inhibitor. XELJANZ is used to treat adults with moderately to severely 
      active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in people with 
        Hepatitis B or C.
      
			
        XELJANZ is not for people with severe liver problems.
      
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in children.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				XELJANZ can lower the ability of the immune system to fight 
        infections. Some people have serious infections while taking XELJANZ, 
        including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, 
        or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died 
        from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for 
        TB before starting XELJANZ, and monitor them closely for signs and 
        symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should 
        not start taking XELJANZ if they have any kind of infection unless 
        their healthcare provider tells them it is okay.
			
			
				XELJANZ may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the 
        way the immune system works. Malignancies were observed in clinical 
        studies of XELJANZ.
			
			
        Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to 
        prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain 
        white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr 
        virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
      
			
        Some people taking XELJANZ get tears in their stomach or intestines. 
        This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal 
        anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. 
        Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have 
        fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away, or a change in 
        bowel habits.
      
			
        XELJANZ can cause changes in certain lab test results including low 
        blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in 
        cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before 
        starting patients on XELJANZ and while they are taking XELJANZ, to 
        check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important 
        to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ treatment 
        because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results.
      
			
        Use of XELJANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not 
        recommended.
      
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become 
        pregnant or are pregnant.It is not known if XELJANZ will 
        harm an unborn baby. To monitor the outcomes of pregnant women exposed 
        to XELJANZ, a registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged 
        to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to register 
        themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972.
      
		
		
			
				&lt;p&gt;
          Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to 
          breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare 
          provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ or breastfeed. They 
          should not do both.
        &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
        In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the 
        liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ. Healthcare 
        providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common 
        cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, 
        sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).

			Bromium Labs Analyzes Microsoft&#8217;s EMET and Uncovers Vulnerabilities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Team of cybersecurity researchers investigate popular Microsoft 
      zero-day prevention tool to gauge level of difficulty for hackers to 
      bypass critical security protection for PCs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bromium&#174;, 
      Inc., a pioneer in trustworthy computing, today announced new 
      findings from Bromium 
      Labs that focus on the strengths and weaknesses of Microsoft 
      Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET), a free download developed 
      to enhance the security of a PC by mitigating zero-day attacks. After 
      extensive testing and analysis, Bromium Labs demonstrated the software 
      is vulnerable to the presence of custom-built exploits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;EMET is a viable personal and corporate defense add-on, but given other 
      researchers have found EMET bypasses before, we sought to understand how 
      EMET is vulnerable to the presence of novel exploits,&#8221; said Rahul 
      Kashyap, chief security architect and head of security research, 
      Bromium. &#8220;We want users to better understand the facts when making a 
      decision about which PC protections to use. We conducted this research 
      within Bromium Labs to further enhance EMET-like exploit mitigation 
      tools so we as an industry can come together to better protect against 
      future exploitation vectors.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To learn about its limitations and help security teams create a better 
      defense-in-depth strategy, Bromium Labs investigated if a more technical 
      savvy attacker would be capable of bypassing the protections offered in 
      EMET. Through an exploratory approach, Bromium Labs was able to bypass 
      all of the protections in EMET. To educate the broader security 
      community, Bromium Labs wrote a full technical whitepaper, available at labs.bromium.com 
      that specifically demonstrates:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Ways to bypass all of the protections in EMET
      
			
        How userland protections are not a sufficient means of protection 
        because there is no &#8220;higher&#8221; ground advantage as there would be from a 
        kernel or hypervisor
      
			
        Recommendations on ways to upgrade the EMET protections where possible
      
			
        Best practices and approaches for securing endpoints.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bromium Labs regularly conducts security research on a variety of 
      computer threats and protections, most commonly focusing on the 
      endpoint. During this study, Bromium Labs provided the research to 
      Microsoft before speaking publicly about bypassing the protections.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jared DeMott, principal security researcher at Bromium, will discuss 
      findings in detail at BSidesSF2014 
      on Monday, February 24 at 10 a.m. PT at the DNA Lounge, 375 Eleventh 
      Street, San Francisco, CA 94103. Tickets are free at the door and

      security methods, which rely on complex and ineffective detection 
      techniques, Bromium protects against malware from the Web, email or USB 
      devices, by automatically isolating each user-task at the endpoint in a 
      hardware-isolated micro-VM, preventing theft or damage to any enterprise 
      resource. Bromium&#8217;s technological innovations have earned the company 
      numerous industry awards including being named as a CNBC Disruptor and a

		&lt;h1&gt;Arxan Technologies Partners With IBM to Protect Mobile Apps Against Attacks&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;IBM Security Intelligence and IBM MobileFirst Validations Endorse Arxan as IBM's App Hardening and Tamper Proofing Partner&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - Feb 24, 2014) -  IBM Pulse - Arxan Technologies, the industry-leading provider of software security solutions that protect the App Economy, today announced that it has earned two validations from IBM after successfully completing the business partner validation process.&#160;Arxan's patented Guard technology can now be confidently used with the IBM&#174; Security AppScan&#174; and IBM&#174; Worklight product offerings, and is the&#160;first and only IBM partner to be validated for its app hardening and tamper proofing capabilities for the mobile enterprise. As a result, the mobile enterprise will now benefit from these differentiated solutions that extend IBM's capabilities to run-time protection and self-defense against hacking attacks and malicious exploits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to traditional app security measures such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, mobile apps also require capabilities to defend themselves "out in the wild" against hacking attacks and exploits. 78 percent of top 100 paid iOS and Android apps have been found available as hacked versions on third-party sites1. 86 percent of mobile malware were found to be legitimate apps repackaged with malicious payloads2. Gartner has recommended app developers to "harden applications against reverse-engineering and code tampering"3.&#160;In recognition of the unique risks for mobile apps, OWASP has added "Lack of Binary Protections" to its&#160;new Mobile Top Ten 2014 list of key risks4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The App Economy presents tremendous innovation and productivity potential across consumer and enterprise apps, but this growing value also attracts malicious actors to compromise apps. We are pleased to join forces with IBM to help defend their customers' mobile apps by making it easier for customers to build secure apps and keep them secure across the mobile app lifecycle," said Mike Dager, CEO, Arxan Technologies. "This partnership further demonstrates our technology's strategic relevance to IBM's customers and portfolio."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Arxan's mobile app protection technology meets a critical need for customers to seamlessly add app hardening and tamper resistance defenses in their mobile apps," said Caleb Barlow, Director of Application, Data and Mobile Security, IBM. "These new solutions complement IBM's Security and MobileFirst products and further strengthen our ability to enable customers to protect their brand, revenue, intellectual property, and data from hackers and malicious exploits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arxan's recent IBM Security and MobileFirst solution validations include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Ready for Security Intelligence: IBM Security AppScan -- software that enables organizations to assess the security of their applications and achieve regulatory compliance by identifying vulnerabilities and generating reports with remediation guidance. Arxan's embedded protection extends app security from vulnerability testing to run-time protection to both "build it secure" during development and "keep it secure" in production. With new custom rules, AppScan can now also highlight application integrity risks and thus inform required run-time protections for Arxan. 
					
				
				Ready for IBM MobileFirst: IBM Worklight -- a solution designed to provide an open, comprehensive platform to build, run and manage mobile apps -- now has added self-defense and run-time protection by using Arxan. With an easy instrumentation during the build process, Worklight users can gain comprehensive Arxan app protection for their custom code and SDK libraries and add tamper-resistant jailbreak/root detection and package integrity capabilities. In addition, customers can use the Worklight console to receive automated threat alerts from Arxan protected apps. Arxan is the first security technology that has been validated with Worklight.
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;Arxan's widely-adopted Guard technology provides durable, scalable, and broad application protection without any source code involvement. Arxan-protected applications are currently deployed on over 300 million devices. With its military-grade heritage with U.S. Department of Defense, Arxan provides the gold standard in hardening and tamper proofing apps against attacks such as malicious code modification or injection, reverse-engineering, code analysis, and other binary-level exploits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arxan's Dager continued, "In addition to these MobileFirst validations, Arxan is looking forward to continued innovation with IBM's Trusteer and Fiberlink products in the near future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prospective customers can find more information on http://www.arxan.com/solutions/app-protection-with-ibm/. Arxan is exhibiting at IBM Pulse 2014 February 24-26 at booth T-12 in the Solution Expo.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Mirna Sleiman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI Feb 24 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Aujan Coca-Cola
Beverages Company plans to spend $100 million building a
fruit-juice factory in Egypt over the next few years, a senior
executive said on Monday, despite the challenges there after
three years of political turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshal Alkadeeb, vice president of strategy and business
development, said the money would cover buying the land and
setting up the factory in Egypt, which Aujun sees as a North
Africa hub, mainly for Algeria and Libya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The plant will be commissioned between 2016 and 2017. We
just started working on it," Alkadeeb said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt's army-backed government is trying to attract foreign
money back into the country and create jobs to ease social
discontent as it manages the biggest Arab nation's difficult
transition to elections this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having spent more than $100 million in the food and beverage
sector across the Middle East, mainly in Dubai and Dammam, and
having agreed to buy a majority stake in Lebanon's National
Beverage Company, Aujun - half-owned by Coca-Cola Co -
sees the time as ripe, Alkadeeb said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, the biggest challenge for investing in Egypt
would be infrastructure. They've realised this and they working
seriously on addressing the gaps," said Alkadeeb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're talking about utilities. Water is very important and
you need to make sure you get electricity for a food factory.
Packaging and wrapping material in our industry is also a
challenge as well as the facilities that allow you to export and
re-export," he said, noting that getting raw materials into
Egypt or even sourcing it from inside is a big challenge also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Egyptian cabinet source told Reuters on Monday that a
draft investment law contains provisions to prevent third
parties from challenging contracts made between the government
and an investor, a clause is intended to reassure investors
unnerved by previous legal challenges to such deals.&lt;/p&gt;

Morgan Global High Yield and Leverged Finance Conference to be Webcast Live&lt;HOV.N&gt;</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RED BANK, N.J., Feb. 24, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:HOV), a leading national homebuilder, announced that senior management will be presenting at the J.P. Morgan Global High Yield and Leveraged Finance Conference on Tuesday, February 25, 2014 at 9:40 a.m. ET, and is providing comments on its fiscal 2014 first quarter in connection with its presentation. The meeting may include a discussion of market conditions, business outlook and comments on the Company's fiscal 2014 first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	As indicated by last week's reported declines in the NAHB Sentiment Index and U.S. housing starts, the homebuilding industry's recovery has been weaker than expected during the past few months. Similar to what other homebuilders have recently reported, Hovnanian's net contracts per community during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 have decreased from the level reported during the first quarter of fiscal 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Hovnanian expects to report increases in gross margin, backlog and revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to last year's first quarter, however the revenue increase was meaningfully lower than it had anticipated. During the first quarter, a slower sales pace, poor weather conditions and certain labor and material shortages in some markets that extended construction cycle times, among other factors, adversely impacted home deliveries. As a result of the Company's lower than expected revenue growth, the Company now expects to report a pre-tax loss for its fiscal 2014 first quarter that is slightly greater than the pre-tax loss reported for the first quarter of the previous year. Hovnanian's first quarter has always been the slowest seasonal period and the Company expects to report stronger results as the year progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The J.P. Morgan Global High Yield and Leveraged Finance Conference presentation will be webcast live through the "Investor Relations" section of Hovnanian Enterprises' website at http://www.khov.com. It is suggested that participants access the webcast event page at least five minutes before the live event. For those who are not available to listen to the live webcast, an archive of the broadcast will be available under the "Audio Archives" section of the "Investor Relations" page on the Hovnanian website at http://www.khov.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	As previously announced, Hovnanian Enterprises expects to hold its regularly scheduled fiscal 2014 first quarter financial results conference call on March 5, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI Feb 24 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Aujan Coca-Cola
Beverages Company plans to spend $100 million building a
fruit-juice factory in Egypt over the next few years, a senior
executive said on Monday, despite the challeges facing there
after three years of political turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meshal Alkadeeb, vice president of strategy and business
development, said the money would cover buying the land and
setting up the factory in Egypt, which Aujun sees as a North
Africa hub, mainly for Algeria and Libya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The plant will be commissioned between 2016 and 2017. We
just started working on it," Alkadeeb said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt's army-backed government is trying to attract foreign
money back into the country and create jobs to ease social
discontent as it manages the biggest Arab nation's difficult
transition to elections this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having spent more than $100 million in the food and beverage
sector across the Middle East, mainly in Dubai and Dammam, and
having agreed to buy a majority stake in Lebanon's National
Beverage Company, Aujun - half-owned by Coca-Cola Co -
sees the time as ripe, Alkadeeb said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, the biggest challenge for investing in Egypt
would be infrastructure. They've realised this and they working
seriously on addressing the gaps," said Alkadeeb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're talking about utilities. Water is very important and
you need to make sure you get electricity for a food factory.
Packaging and wrapping material in our industry is also a
challenge as well as the facilities that allow you to export and
re-export," he said, noting that getting raw materials into
Egypt or even sourcing it from inside is a big challenge also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Egyptian cabinet source told Reuters on Monday that a
draft investment law contains provisions to prevent third
parties from challenging contracts made between the government
and an investor, a clause is intended to reassure investors
unnerved by previous legal challenges to such deals.&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Announces Positive Top-Line Results Of Landmark 
      Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial In Adults (CAPiTA)
			Evaluating 
      Efficacy Of Prevenar 13*
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Data to Be Presented at 9th International Symposium on Pneumococci 
      and Pneumococcal Diseases (ISPPD) on March 12, 2014
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the Community-Acquired 
      Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA), the landmark study of 
      approximately 85,000 subjects evaluating the efficacy of Prevenar 13* 
      (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]) in 
      adults 65 years of age and older, achieved its primary clinical 
      objective and both secondary clinical objectives. CAPiTA is the largest 
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy trial ever 
      conducted in adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate efficacy of 
      Prevenar 13 against a first episode of vaccine-type community-acquired 
      pneumonia (CAP). The CAPiTA study also met both secondary objectives, 
      which were efficacy against (i) a first episode of 
      non-bacteremic/non-invasive vaccine-type CAP and (ii) a first episode of 
      vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vaccine-type CAP (VT-CAP) was defined as CAP caused by any S. 
      pneumoniae serotype included in the vaccine. 
      Non-bacteremic/non-invasive VT-CAP was defined as CAP in which 
      vaccine-type S. pneumoniae caused the pneumonia, but was not 
      detected concurrently in the bloodstream or any other normally sterile 
      site. Vaccine-type IPD was defined as a case in which vaccine-type S. 
      pneumoniae was present in the bloodstream or any other normally 
      sterile site, with or without pneumonia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased with the outcome of the CAPiTA study, which demonstrated 
      that Prevenar 13 can prevent vaccine-type pneumococcal 
      community-acquired pneumonia in adults,&#8221; said Dr. William Gruber, senior 
      vice president, Vaccine Clinical Research, Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pneumococcal pneumonia is a significant cause of illness and death in 
      adults around the world, and the potential to reduce the burden of this 
      disease through direct vaccination of adults represents a meaningful 
      public health benefit,&#8221; said Dr. Emilio A. Emini, senior vice president, 
      Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. &#8220;Pfizer looks forward to 
      sharing the CAPiTA data with U.S. and worldwide regulatory authorities, 
      and vaccine technical committees, to help inform decisions regarding 
      potential Prevenar 13 label and recommendation updates.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The CAPiTA data will be an important component in any consideration of 
      potential new or updated Prevenar 13 recommendations for adults. In 
      addition, other key factors will be taken into consideration, such as 
      the current burden of pneumococcal disease in adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevnar 13 was licensed by the FDA under an accelerated approval process 
      to address an unmet medical need in older adults. As a requirement of 
      the accelerated approval pathway, Pfizer conducted CAPiTA to verify 
      clinical benefit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Detailed results will be presented at the 9th International Symposium on 
      Pneumococci and Pneumococcal Diseases (ISPPD) in Hyderabad, India, on 
      March 12, 2014, during the late-breaker session from 2:30 p.m. to 4:10 
      p.m. IST/5 a.m. to 6:40 a.m. EDT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease refers to a group of illnesses caused by&#160;S. 
      pneumoniae bacteria.1 Invasive pneumococcal disease 
      occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream, or another site that is 
      normally sterile.2 Non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia occurs 
      when the bacteria cause infection in the lungs but are not detected in 
      the blood concurrently.1 In adults, pneumonia is the most 
      common presentation of pneumococcal disease.1 For every one 
      case of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, it is estimated that 
      at least three cases of non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia occur.3 
      While non-invasive forms of pneumococcal disease are typically more 
      common, the invasive types of disease are generally more severe.4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About CAPiTA
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of its regulatory commitments under the FDA&#8217;s accelerated 
      approval program, Pfizer conducted the CAPiTA study, which was designed 
      to evaluate the efficacy of Prevnar 13 in the prevention of vaccine-type 
      pneumococcal pneumonia. CAPiTA is the largest double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy trial ever conducted in adults. It 
      involved approximately 85,000 subjects aged 65 years and older. The 
      trial was conducted by Julius Clinical, a spin-off of the Julius Center 
      for Health Sciences and Primary Care, a division of the University 
      Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. Fifty-eight sentinel 
      hospitals were used for the surveillance of CAP and IPD. The safety 
      profile of Prevenar 13 observed in CAPiTA was consistent with studies 
      previously conducted in adults. The safety data will be included in the 
      presentation at ISPPD.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Prevenar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 was first introduced for use in infants and young children 
      in December 2009 in Europe and is now approved for such use in more than 
      120 countries worldwide, including the United States and Japan.
			It 
      is the most widely used pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the 
      world, and more than 640 million doses of Prevenar 7-valent/Prevenar 13 
      have been distributed worldwide. In addition, Prevenar 13 is approved 
      for use in adults 50 years of age and older in more than 90 countries, 
      and is also approved in the United States and European Union (EU) for 
      use in older children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Recently, 
      Prevenar 13 was also approved in the EU for use in adults 18 to 49 years 
      of age.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			INDICATIONS FOR PREVNAR 13&#174;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13&#174; is a vaccine approved for adults 50 years of 
        age and older for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia and 
        invasive disease caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains 
        (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). This 
        indication is based upon immune responses to the vaccine
      
			
        For children 6 weeks through 17 years of age, Prevnar 13&#174; 
        is approved for the prevention of invasive disease caused by the 13 
        vaccine strains, and for children 6 weeks through 5 years for the 
        prevention of otitis media caused by 7 of the 13 strains
      
			
        Prevnar 13&#174; is not 100% effective and will only help 
        protect against the 13 strains included in the vaccine
      
			
        Effectiveness when given less than 5 years after a pneumococcal 
        polysaccharide vaccine is not known

        Prevnar 13&#174; should not be given to anyone with a history of 
        severe allergic reaction to any component of Prevnar 13&#174; or 
        any diphtheria toxoid&#8211;containing vaccine
      
			
        Children and adults with weakened immune systems (eg, HIV infection, 
        leukemia) may have a reduced immune response
      
			
        In adults, immune responses to Prevnar 13&#174; were reduced 
        when given with injected seasonal flu vaccine
      
			
        In adults, the common side effects were pain, redness, or swelling at 
        the injection site, limitation of arm movement, fatigue, headache, 
        muscle pain, joint pain, decreased appetite, chills, or rash
      
			
        A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been observed 
        in some infants born prematurely
      
			
        The most commonly reported serious adverse events in infants and 
        toddlers were bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs) (0.9%), 
        gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine) 
        (0.9%), and pneumonia (0.9%)
      
			
        In children 6 weeks through 17 years, the most common side effects 
        were tenderness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, 
        irritability, decreased appetite, decreased or increased sleep, and 
        fever.

		&lt;h1&gt;STEALTHbits to Showcase QRadar Integration at IBM Pulse 2014&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;HAWTHORNE, NJ, and LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - Feb 24, 2014) -  STEALTHbits Technologies, Inc., leading supplier of unstructured data and Microsoft infrastructure solutions, announced today the release of a new connector for IBM Security QRadar&#174; SIEM. Unveiled at IBM Pulse2014, The Premier Cloud Conference, the new connector feeds QRadar real-time, detailed security and change event details from Active Directory (AD), Exchange, and File Systems using STEALTHbits' StealthINTERCEPT real-time change and access monitoring platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this release, the StealthINTERCEPT Windows Activity Connector for QRadar will supply QRadar with broader, deeper, more surgical visibility into the change and access events occurring within AD, Exchange, and File Systems than native log facilities can provide alone, making the industry's already leading SIEM platform even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary problem organizations face in connecting SIEM applications directly to Microsoft event logs is that there's too much data, containing too little information. Active Directory Security Logs, for example, exclude critical change details made to Group Policy Objects; settings that could have far reaching affects from security and compliance to operations. Similarly, enabling diagnostic logging on Windows File Servers typically produces extensive resource overhead, causing servers to crash and outages to occur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"StealthINTERCEPT is more than just a sound investment for QRadar customers, for anyone running Microsoft technologies... it's a must have. By injecting our interception technology directly into the OS security layer, StealthINTERCEPT is able to feed discreet and critical Active Directory security events into QRadar in real-time; you just can't get this from native logs. And since Active Directory is the hub of security in the Microsoft world, you really need this integration to get the big picture; without it, you're missing half the picture," said Kevin Foisy, Chief Software Architect, STEALTHbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The QRadar/StealthINTERCEPT integration provides:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Real-time Interception -&#160;StealthINTERCEPT's kernel-level driver technology filters out the "noise",&#160;intercepting the critical events that matter most, while also reducing the&#160;application and system overhead that results from enabling native logging&#160;facilities.
            
				Surgical Analysis and Control&#160;- StealthINTERCEPT's built-in analysis and filtration capabilities enables&#160;administrators to feed just the events they care most about into QRadar,&#160;limiting the amount of data QRadar needs to digest and correlate.
            
				Early Detection - The feed&#160;QRadar receives from StealthINTERCEPT is provided in real-time, publishing&#160;and producing alerts via QRadar in just milliseconds from the time the&#160;event occurred.
            
				Extended Monitoring Visibility - StealthINTERCEPT&#160;provides details about changes and access events that simply aren't&#160;available via native logs, such as who modified a Group Policy Object,&#160;from where, when, and what the change actually was.
            
				Faster Remediation - Before&#160;and After value capture provides the full picture of what changed and what&#160;the previous value of the change was.
            
				Enhanced Identification - Additional&#160;details of who made the change including IP Addresses enhances QRadar's&#160;correlation capabilities with other events occurring elsewhere in the&#160;environment.
			&lt;p&gt;StealthINTERCEPT is already the market visionary on Active Directory, Exchange, and File System security monitoring and protection. With the additional context StealthINTERCEPT feeds to QRadar, customers will obtain a whole new level of insight into security threats and how malicious insiders and outsiders are gaining access to sensitive data and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AVAILABILITY
				The StealthINTERCEPT Windows Activity Connector for QRadar is now available worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

				STEALTHbits Technologies specializes in the management and security of unstructured data. STEALTHbits' solutions bridge the gap between Active Directory and unstructured data repositories, providing a previously unavailable view of how access is being granted and who has access to critical unstructured data resources like File Systems and SharePoint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this enhanced visibility, organizations of any size can efficiently and confidently: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HARARE (Reuters) - Former U.S. congressman Mel Reynolds was deported from Zimbabwe on Sunday after he pleaded guilty to staying in the southern African country on an expired visa, a senior immigration official said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reynolds, 62, was arrested at a Harare hotel last week and was fined $100 by a magistrate court. But the court dismissed additional pornography charges against him on a technicality after the prosecution failed to clear the charges through the Prosecutor-General's office as required by law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We followed deported him as ordered by the court, but I am sorry that we are not in a position to discuss details of what flight or route we put him on," immigration officer Francis Mabika told Reuters. "Those are security issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Reynolds pleaded guilty to the visa charge, he had denied charges he was found with nude pictures and videos of women and men having sexual intercourse on his mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possession of pornography is illegal in Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state-owned Herald newspaper reported last Tuesday that Reynolds had run up $24,500 in unpaid hotel bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds, a former Rhodes scholar, was a fast-rising star in the U.S. Democratic party when he was forced to resign in 1995 after being convicted of sexual assault, obstruction of justice and solicitation of child pornography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years he had recast himself as a champion of U.S. investment in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Cris Chinaka; Editing by Stella Mapenzauswa)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Twitter-like Sina Weibo could be worth at least $4.3 bln&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* IPO comes as Chinese companies flock to U.S. markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Elzio Barreto and Paul Carsten&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/BEIJING, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Sina Corp has
hired Credit Suisse AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 for a U.S. initial public offering worth about $500
million of its Sina Weibo microblogging service, a source
familiar with the plans said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sina Weibo, one of several Chinese Twitter-like short
messaging blogs, plans a listing in the second quarter, added
the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the
matter. The IPO plans were initially reported by the Financial
Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IPO follows Facebook Inc's $19 billion purchase
last week of fast-growing mobile-messaging startup WhatsApp and
a surge in Internet-related equity deals and mergers and
acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sina Weibo's offering would also come as Chinese companies
flock to the U.S. IPO market in their biggest numbers since 2010
because of soaring valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sina will announce its fourth-quarter earnings after markets
close in New York on Monday. The company declined to comment on
the listing plans when contacted by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba Group Holding Ltd bought an 18 percent
stake in Sina Weibo for $586 million last April, valuing Weibo
at $3.3 billion. Since then Sina's stock price has risen by
one-third, implying the microblogging business could now be
worth at least $4.3 billion. Alibaba also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its initial deal with Weibo, Alibaba has an
option to increase its stake in Sina Weibo to 30 percent for an
unspecified amount within a certain time period, although it is
unclear whether this has passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microblogging may be on the decline in China however, as
users opt for more private mobile messaging apps over public
platforms like Sina Weibo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockbuster mobile messaging apps like Tencent Holdings
Ltd's WeChat, or Weixin in China, have become venues
of choice for users who want to express views without fear of
retribution. The government last year started clamping down on
"online rumours" which it says threaten social stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of microblog users fell 9 percent last year as
people jumped to mobile messaging apps like WeChat, according to
a January report from the official China Internet Network
Information Center which sent Sina tumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the decline in microblog users, Sina has been able
to wring money from its service. Weibo advertising revenues for
the quarter ending September 2013 grew 125 percent year-on-year
to $43.7 million, according to Sina. Non-advertising revenues
from Weibo's value-added services, such as Weibo membership fees
and games, more than doubled, rising 121 percent year on year to
$9.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank, announced thousands of job cuts on Tuesday as the mortgage lending business slows, and said it was lowering its profitability target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it expected total headcount to fall by 5,000 to 260,000 in 2014. Around 6,000 full-time and contractor jobs in JPMorgan's home loans unit and 2,000 jobs in its branch and credit-card network will be cut. At the same time, the bank expects to add 3,000 new jobs in its control function, including areas like compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the bank's annual conference with investors, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said the bank could post higher profit, possibly up to $27 billion a year, once short-term interest rates rise.

&lt;p&gt;By David Henry and Peter Rudegeair
    Feb 25 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, the largest
U.S. bank, announced thousands of job cuts on Tuesday as the
mortgage lending business slows, and said it was lowering its
profitability target.
    The company said it expected total headcount to fall by
5,000 to 260,000 in 2014. Around 6,000 full-time and contractor
jobs in JPMorgan's home loans unit and 2,000 jobs in its branch
and credit-card network will be cut. At the same time, the bank
expects to add 3,000 new jobs in its control function, including
areas like compliance.
    Speaking at the bank's annual conference with investors,
Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said the bank could post
higher profit, possibly up to $27 billion a year, once
short-term interest rates rise. The bank reported $18 billion
net income in 2013, but Lake said excluding significant and
one-time items its core performance was $23 billion.
    But because the bank cannot fund as many of its assets with
debt, a measure of the profit it generates from equity will
likely be lower. In particular, return on tangible common equity
will likely be somewhere between 15 percent and 16 percent, down
from the bank's prior estimate of 16 percent, Lake said.
    Even with this lower rate of profitability, Lake said the
company believes its shares are now trading at a 20 percent
discount to their "theoretical value." She also said the company
believes it will generate enough excess capital to operate
without an additional buffer capital over regulatory
requirements.
    Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told reporters before the
conference that the job cuts are part of the adjustments the
company has to make continually as its business changes. 
    "You're always trimming the sails. That's business," Dimon
said. "Obviously headcount is coming down in some of the
businesses. That is life."
    Shares of JPMorgan closed down 1.7 percent at $57.03 on the
New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
    
    MORE WEAKNESS IN MORTGAGE, SALES AND TRADING
    The newly announced job cuts in mortgage banking raise the
total number of mortgage cuts the company originally called for
by year-end 2014 to 17,000. Many big banks, including Wells
Fargo &amp; Co and Bank of America Corp, have been
laying off mortgage workers as higher interest rates in the
second half of 2013 made refinancing less attractive to
homeowners. 
    Mortgage lending at JPMorgan fell 8 percent in 2013 to $166
billion, but refinancing fell three times as much. 
    Weakness in that business would persist into this year.
Mortgage banking Chief Executive Kevin Watters said at the
conference the pretax income of JPMorgan's mortgage production
business would be negative in 2014. 
    Sales and trading was another business where JPMorgan
executives expected weakness in the near-term. Daniel Pinto,
co-chief executive of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, 
 said that markets revenues since the start of the year were
down 15 percent compared with the same period of 2013. 
    The first quarter is generally the strongest for banks'
sales and trading units, and executives did not attribute the
lower levels to any specific development. 
    "We don't know exactly why," Dimon said, adding that the
drop-off in activity did not worry him. 
    The job cuts in the branches and in the credit card network
were also up from the 4,000 announced in 2013. 
    Gordon Smith, the head of JPMorgan's consumer bank, said at
the conference he expected the number of employees who work in
the bank's branches will have declined 20 percent in 2015 from
2011.

      Fitch Downgrades 3 Distressed Classes of JPMCC 2005-LDP4
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded three distressed classes and affirmed 15 
      classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., 
      (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2005-LDP4. 
      A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press 
      release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades of classes B and C reflects an increased certainty of 
      losses on the now specially serviced loans, which have all transferred 
      to the special servicer over the past 12 months. Class D has been 
      downgraded to 'D' due to incurred losses. Fitch modeled losses of 7.4% 
      of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance 
      total 11.6%, including $209.3 million (7.8% of the original pool 
      balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 37 loans 
      (29.4%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes six specially serviced 
      assets (2.6%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the February 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 49.2% to $1.36 billion from $2.68 
      billion at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, eight loans (13.5% of 
      the pool) are defeased, including three (10.4%) of the top 15 loans. 
      Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes L through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the One World Trade Center 
      loan (6.3% of the pool), the largest loan in the pool. The loan is 
      secured by a 573,300 square foot (sf), 27-story class 'A' office 
      building located in Long Beach, CA. The property has experienced cash 
      flow issues due to occupancy declines. Occupancy has remained relatively 
      flat since 2010, reporting at 65% per the December 2013 rent roll, 
      compared to 70% in 2012 and 2011, and 72% in 2010. According to REIS, 
      the property is performing below the Long Beach submarket which reports 
      occupancy for class A office at 83.6%, and asking rents at $33.20psf 
      (compared to $22psf in-place). In 2013 the buildings largest tenant, the 
      United States of America (USA), had extended its leases and slightly 
      expanded its space to 78,000 SF (13.7% of the net rentable area [NRA]) 
      from 70,000 Sf (12% NRA). Weighted average rents for the government 
      leases are in line with the market, with a majority of the lease 
      expirations in 2023 (for 56,000 SF), and the remaining expirations in 
      2014 (14,000 SF) and 2028 (8,000 SF). The property has lease rollover 
      risk for approximately 24% of the building NRA expiring prior to the 
      loans August 2015 maturity date, with total reserves reported by the 
      servicer at approximately $569,000. Due to the low occupancy and slow 
      leasing, the net operating income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio has 
      remained low reported at 0.92x for year to date (YTD) June 2013, 0.87x 
      at year end (YE) December 2012 and 0.90x at YE 2011. The loan has 
      remained current since issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the Highland Landmark 
      Building loan (3.7%), which is secured by a 276,461-sf office property 
      located in Downers Grove, IL. The property has recently experienced 
      significant tenant vacancies and releasing. RR Donnelley, which 
      previously occupied 156,000-sf (56% NRA), and Havi Global which occupied 
      approximately 32,000-sf (32% NRA), both vacated at their lease 
      expirations in October 2012 and May 2013, respectively. The borrower has 
      been successful in re-leasing a majority of the vacated space to new 
      tenants, including Advocate Health Care for approximately 141,000-sf 
      (48% NRA) starting in April 2013 and expiring in 2023, and Univar Inc. 
      for approximately 38,000-sf (12.9% NRA) starting in June 2013 and 
      expiring in 2024. Both leases have significant rent abatements through 
      2015. Average in-place rents (excluding the rental abatements) have 
      declined to approximately $18 per square foot (psf), compared to $28psf 
      in 2012; REIS reports the submarket asking rents at $21.51psf. The 
      September 2013 rent roll reported total occupancy at 70.5%, compared to 
      the submarket occupancy at 78.3%. The property has reported negative NOI 
      for 2013 due to the tenant vacancies, releasing, and rental abatements 
      in place. The loan has remained current since issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is secured by a 
      133,471-sf suburban office property in Phoenix, AZ. The property has 
      experienced cash flow issues since 2011 due to occupancy declines and 
      lower rental income. Occupancy has remained relatively flat since 2011, 
      reporting at 69% in September 2013 and December 2012, and 64% in 
      December 2011. Leases for approximately 33% of the property NRA are 
      scheduled to expire in the next 12 months. Due to the low occupancy and 
      slow leasing, the NOI DSCR has remained low reporting at 0.38x for YE 
      2012 and 0.67x for YE 2011, compared to 1.11x at YE 2010 and 1.47x at 
      issuance. The loan has remained current since issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Ratings Outlooks on classes A-1A, A-4, A-SB, and A-M are Stable due 
      to sufficient credit enhancement and continued paydown. The Negative 
      Outlook on class A-J reflects performance concerns on several loans in 
      the top 15 including high property vacancies with slow leasing momentum, 
      lease rollover risks, secondary market locations, single tenant 
      exposure, and property performance below underwritten expectations.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is considering putting money into a major Japanese airport, the latest foreign investor to eye infrastructure projects as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeks to open up the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank may invest in New Kansai International Airport, a regional hub in Osaka bay and the country's fifth-largest airport by passenger traffic, once operating rights are put up for sale, said Ankur Sahu, co-head of Goldman's Asia-Pacific merchant banking division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to be Japan's biggest private infrastructure project - the rights could fetch up to 600 billion yen ($5.86 billion) - and Tokyo is keen for investors to help trim state-owned New Kansai International Airport Co's 1.2 trillion yen debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other foreign names such as U.S. property investor Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG.N) and Australian investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX) are taking stakes in Japan's infrastructure sector - marking a vote of confidence in "Abenomics", which has recently been struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abe's policies to revive the world's third-biggest economy from 15 years of deflation and unsteady growth have hit headwinds as the recovery has slowed sharply and investors fret that a burst of monetary easing and fiscal stimulus are not being followed by structural reforms to make growth sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, foreign investors are focusing on airports and solar power, but the field could widen as more areas come open - Abe's government is considering selling operational rights at other airports, highways and sewage systems. In June, Abe targeted tripling Japan's private infrastructure investment to 12 trillion yen ($120 billion) over the following decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government has the highest incentive ever to attract private money to invest in public infrastructure because there is a huge list of projects that need to be done, and the government can't afford to finance them all," said Daiju Aoki, a senior economist at UBS Securities Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure generates lower returns than investments that Goldman and Fortress have previously sought in Japan, but as the number of potential deals dwindles, they have started scouting for lower but stable long-term returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official at Aichi Prefecture Road Public Corp, owned by the prefecture, said it has been sounding out potential bidders for rights to operate local highways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie, a renowned infrastructure investor, abandoned a stake in a Japanese airport terminal building five years ago after a national controversy over whether foreigners should be allowed to own public infrastructure in Japan. Now, though, Japan appears more ready to let private investors make profits on infrastructure. Even before Abe took office, the government in 2011 revised laws on private finance initiatives, allowing private investors to control management of airports and a broader variety of public facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same year, Japan passed a law allowing private investors to buy rights to operate commercial facilities and runways at Osaka airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was once an aggressive corporate investor in Japan, ploughing into cash-strapped companies and turning them around for re-sale. The bank and other investors sold appliance maker Sanyo Electric Co to Panasonic Corp (6752.T) in 2008 and, in 2012, Goldman sold contractor Fujita Corp to homebuilder Daiwa House Industry Co (1925.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the bank has set up a firm called Japan Renewable Energy, which builds and operates solar energy platforms, its most significant investment in Japan in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the past 10 years we were active in making equity investments in Japan. We are still looking for all possible opportunities, but we have made few investments," said Sahu, who led Goldman's investments in Sanyo and Fujita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Goldman invests in Kansai Airport, it would be part of a consortium as the deal would be so big, he said. The bank would use money from the $3.1 billion GS Infrastructure Partners II fund it launched in 2010, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALTERNATIVE ENERGY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortress, which has invested mainly in distressed loans and properties in Japan, is raising 200 billion yen from Japanese investors to set up a fund for infrastructure investments in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's rapidly growing alternative energy market is attracting investors as the government encourages reliance on solar energy after shutting all the nation's 48 nuclear power plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011. Tokyo introduced generous subsidies to encourage solar investment, sparking a development rush. For example, Equis Funds Group, a Singapore-based alternative energy investment firm, plans to raise $500 million over the next year to fund solar-energy projects in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie, which in 2009 sold a 20 percent stake in Japan Airport Terminal Co (9706.T), the operator of terminal buildings at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, back to the company after its ownership triggered a national backlash over foreign ownership, last year agreed to form an infrastructure joint venture with Japanese general contractor Maeda Corp (1824.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other airports in Japan could go on the block after the government last year revised laws to allow the sale of rights to operate airports in other cities. Sendai Airport in northern Japan is expected to go up for sale this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several domestic firms, such as a financial services company Orix Corp (8591.T) and mobile operator SoftBank Corp (9984.T) are also investing in renewable energy projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 102.6750 Japanese yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

Goldman and Fortress have previously sought in Japan, but as the
number of potential deals dwindles, they have started scouting
for lower but stable long-term returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official at Aichi Prefecture Road Public Corp, owned by
the prefecture, said it has been sounding out potential bidders
for rights to operate local highways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie, a renowned infrastructure investor, abandoned a
stake in a Japanese airport terminal building five years ago
after a national controversy over whether foreigners should be
allowed to own public infrastructure in Japan. Now, though,
Japan appears more ready to let private investors make profits
on infrastructure. Even before Abe took office, the government
in 2011 revised laws on private finance initiatives, allowing
private investors to control management of airports and a
broader variety of public facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same year, Japan passed a law allowing private investors
to buy rights to operate commercial facilities and runways at
Osaka airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was once an aggressive corporate investor in Japan,
ploughing into cash-strapped companies and turning them around
for re-sale. The bank and other investors sold appliance maker
Sanyo Electric Co to Panasonic Corp in 2008 and, in
2012, Goldman sold contractor Fujita Corp to homebuilder Daiwa
House Industry Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the bank has set up a firm called Japan Renewable
Energy, which builds and operates solar energy platforms, its
most significant investment in Japan in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the past 10 years we were active in making equity
investments in Japan. We are still looking for all possible
opportunities, but we have made few investments," said Sahu, who
led Goldman's investments in Sanyo and Fujita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Goldman invests in Kansai Airport, it would be part of a
consortium as the deal would be so big, he said. The bank would
use money from the $3.1 billion GS Infrastructure Partners II
fund it launched in 2010, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALTERNATIVE ENERGY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortress, which has invested mainly in distressed loans and
properties in Japan, is raising 200 billion yen from Japanese
investors to set up a fund for infrastructure investments in
Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's rapidly growing alternative energy market is
attracting investors as the government encourages reliance on
solar energy after shutting all the nation's 48 nuclear power
plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011. Tokyo
introduced generous subsidies to encourage solar investment,
sparking a development rush. For example, Equis Funds Group, a
Singapore-based alternative energy investment firm, plans to
raise $500 million over the next year to fund solar-energy
projects in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie, which in 2009 sold a 20 percent stake in Japan
Airport Terminal Co, the operator of terminal buildings
at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, back to the company after its
ownership triggered a national backlash over foreign ownership,
last year agreed to form an infrastructure joint venture with
Japanese general contractor Maeda Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other airports in Japan could go on the block after the
government last year revised laws to allow the sale of rights to
operate airports in other cities. Sendai Airport in northern
Japan is expected to go up for sale this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several domestic firms, such as a financial services company
Orix Corp and mobile operator SoftBank Corp 
are also investing in renewable energy projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Future of Plandai Biotechnology's Products in Good Hands With Former Microsoft Executive Heading Up Global Marketing&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Feb 25, 2014) -  Today Planda&#237; Biotechnology (OTCQB: PLPL) named former Microsoft executive Jamen Shively as the company's Vice President of Global Marketing. Shively has an extensive and impressive resume in the world of business, and the company is confident he can deliver Planda&#237;'s products on the world stage. According to Planda&#237;, Shively will be responsible for building brand awareness and marketing strategy for all of the company's operations. Needless to say, they found just the right man for the future of their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since leaving Microsoft, Shively has become a marijuana entrepreneur who has the ability to command the media's attention. So, having Shively build brand awareness for the company's products, including, the Diego Pellicer&#174; medical cannabis line as well as the Phytofare&#8482; botanical extracts such as the Green Tea Catechin Complex and the Limonoid Glycoside Complex is a brilliant move by Planda&#237; executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shively co-founded Diego Pellicer Inc. in 2012, and then built the brand into the most recognized brand of cannabis in the world in less than one year. Prior to founding Diego Pellicer, Jamen was a Corporate Strategy Manager for Microsoft from 2003 to 2009, where he focused on the creation and development of new categories of software products and online services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planda&#237;'s CEO stated it is their goal to become the leading name in highly bioavailable botanical extracts for both nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications. Jamen Shively is someone who can make that a reality, and he sounds more than ready to get started. "We have a unique opportunity with Planda&#237;'s technology to fundamentally change how we address wellness, health and prevention through natural, botanical solutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shively said he's also excited about the application of Planda&#237;'s technologies to cannabis. He stated, "I believe they'll revolutionize the application of cannabis to preventive and therapeutic health, under the Diego Pellicer brand. This is the opportunity of a lifetime for me and for my colleagues at Plandai to change the world by improving the health and wellness of mankind through 100% natural plant extracts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shively's deep interest in the marijuana arena will serve Planda&#237; well, and his expertise will likely make the company a leading name in highly bioavailable botanical extracts just as the CEO expects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Stock Market Media Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMMG is a full service IR firm specializing in Research and Content Development.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co has launched Disney Movies Anywhere, a service for consumers to buy and watch Disney, Pixar and Marvel films online and store them in the cloud, in the latest bid by a Hollywood studio to encourage digital movie purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, like other Hollywood studios, is trying to boost digital sales after consumers moved away in recent years from buying DVDs, cutting a lucrative source of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The media company said in a statement it launched the new service on Tuesday, coinciding with the digital release of Disney's blockbuster animated movie "Frozen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service allows consumers to buy digital movies from a library of more than 400 titles through Apple Inc's iTunes store and the Disney Movies Anywhere website and app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchased movies can be watched on a laptop or desktop computer, or on Apple's iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, Disney said. Consumers can also view the films through the Apple TV box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service is built on Disney's proprietary digital rights locker KeyChest, rather than UltraViolet, a cloud storage service used by other major Hollywood studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The beauty of this technology is that it enables us to work with iTunes and future provider partners to ensure movie lovers have streamlined access to all of their favorite Disney titles no matter what device they are on," said Jamie Voris, Disney Studios' chief technology officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said it is in talks with other retailers about offering the service outside of iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ronald Grover and Lisa Richwine; Editing by Christopher Cushing)&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Industry's Largest Independent Testing Validates Optimal Performance and Resource Utilization for High User Count Workloads&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;ANDOVER, MA and MUNICH, GERMANY--(Marketwired - Feb 25, 2014) - Aras&#174;, the next leader in enterprise Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software, today announced the results of independent testing conducted by Logic 20/20 for the scalability of Aras Innovator 10 running Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition on HP ProLiant servers with the HP ioDrive2 Duo IO accelerator technology from Fusion-io. Results validate optimal performance and resource utilization for 500,000 named users with 125,000 concurrent users -- the largest testing conducted to date in the enterprise PLM industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logic 20/20 Scalability Benchmark Methodology and Performance Results report available at http://aras.com/plm/002298
				&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SQL Server 2012 is designed to provide the performance and scalability required by the most demanding mission-critical applications whether they are running in the data center or the Cloud," said Simon Floyd, &#8206;Director of Product Lifecycle Management Solutions at Microsoft. "Together Aras, Microsoft, HP and Fusion-io deliver predictable scalability, high user concurrency and performance required by the world's largest manufacturers to compete and innovate in a fast changing global market place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests were conducted on Aras Innovator 10 running SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition with standard Microsoft recommended settings and best practices. HP ProLiant DL980G7 and DL585G7 servers were used, and the DL980G7 was tested both with and without the HP ioDrive2 Duo IO accelerator technology from Fusion-io. Testing occurred with 500,000 named users at 25,000, 75,000 and 125,000 concurrent user loads with real-world scenarios and data structures to simulate actual usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results of the tests indicate that Aras Innovator 10 performance scales consistently and nearly linearly with hardware," said Anders Westby, Director of Cloud Services and Testing at Logic 20/20. "Testing validates that Aras Innovator 10 running on SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition can handle very high numbers of concurrent users when running on standard server configurations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logic 20/20's Performance Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Aras Innovator 10 and SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition running on standard HP server configurations showed strong performance and excellent resource utilization across all tests.
            
				During testing average CPU utilization was consistently below 25 percent and total percentage of CPU utilization never exceeded 30 percent.
            
				The average response times were fast across the different concurrent user loads tested from 25,000 to 125,000.
            
				As expected in an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload like Aras Innovator 10, the greatest constraint was in the I/O subsystem's ability to read and write to disk.
            
				The benchmark testing results validate that Aras Innovator 10 running on SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition scales nearly linearly with hardware upgrades and is architected for very high numbers of concurrent users.
            
				The performance of Aras Innovator 10 is not constrained by its architecture. The design puts the burden of work on the hardware, so it can be scaled-up and scaled-out with server hardware.
			&lt;p&gt;The Aras architecture supports scale-out on the file system and web servers with scale-up on the database by moving non-transactional data to the scale-out servers, allowing Aras Innovator 10 to handle very large levels of throughput by using frequent, short database transactions. Optimized exclusively for Microsoft SQL Server, Aras Innovator 10 is able to achieve this new level of PLM scalability because of Aras's unique technology innovation, a model-based service oriented architecture (model-based SOA). The model-based SOA is designed for scalability, flexibility and extensibility while delivering consistent performance at scale whether running applications out-of-the-box or highly customized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recognize that increasing product complexity, global design teams and outsourcing strategies are all forcing the need for greater application scalability," said Peter Schroer, President of Aras. "Our architectural approach fundamentally rethinks the platform design in order to provide greater flexibility to customize applications while at the same time enabling a new level of scalability today and into the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Logic20/20, Inc.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Feb 25 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co has
launched Disney Movies Anywhere, a service for consumers to buy
and watch Disney, Pixar and Marvel films online and store them
in the cloud, in the latest bid by a Hollywood studio to
encourage digital movie purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, like other Hollywood studios, is trying to boost
digital sales after consumers moved away in recent years from
buying DVDs, cutting a lucrative source of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The media company said in a statement it launched the new
service on Tuesday, coinciding with the digital release of
Disney's blockbuster animated movie "Frozen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service allows consumers to buy digital movies from a
library of more than 400 titles through Apple Inc's 
iTunes store and the Disney Movies Anywhere website and app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchased movies can be watched on a laptop or desktop
computer, or on Apple's iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, Disney
said. Consumers can also view the films through the Apple TV
box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service is built on Disney's proprietary digital rights
locker KeyChest, rather than UltraViolet, a cloud storage
service used by other major Hollywood studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The beauty of this technology is that it enables us to work
with iTunes and future provider partners to ensure movie lovers
have streamlined access to all of their favorite Disney titles
no matter what device they are on," said Jamie Voris, Disney
Studios' chief technology officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said it is in talks with other retailers about
offering the service outside of iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2003-PM1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2003-PM1. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 49.4% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 7.7%, including $34.6 million (3% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date. The pool is 
      concentrated with only 21 loans remaining, of which Fitch has designated 
      four loans (50%) as Fitch Loans of Concern; all are specially serviced 
      assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the February 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 90.6% to $109.1 million from $1.16 
      billion at issuance and by 83.6% from $666.8MM at the last rating 
      action. Per the servicer reporting, five loans (16.7% of the pool) are 
      defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes E through 
      NR, primarily due to the lack interest payments in connection with the 
      Palm Beach Mall loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced 
      Palm Beach Mall loan (40% of the pool). The special servicer, ORIX, 
      continues to pursue litigation with the loan sponsor, Simon Property 
      Group, in efforts to maximize the recovery. The property was sold in 
      2011 after becoming REO in 2010; proceeds of the sale ($21.8 million) 
      were used to repay advances, fund a reserve for litigation, and pay down 
      a portion of the loan balance ($5.6 million). While a successful outcome 
      of the litigation may result in some principal recovery on the loan, 
      Fitch modeled a full loss of $43.6 million due to uncertainty 
      surrounding the final outcome of the litigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is a specially-serviced 
      loan (2.8%), which is secured by a 36,200 square foot retail property 
      located in Nashville, TN. The loan, which matured in July 2013, is 
      currently being managed under a lock box. Occupancy has declined to 
      65.2% as of July 2013 from 91.0% at year-end (YE) 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is a specially-serviced 
      loan (4.5%), which is secured by mobile home community in Superior 
      Township, MI. The loan matured in May 2013 and has experienced a 
      significant decline in occupancy. As of July 2013, occupancy declined to 
      65.2% from 91.0% at YE 2012. The Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) was 
      reported at 0.99x as of first quarter March 31, 2013 compared to 2.25x 
      at YE 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating outlooks for classes D and E were revised to Outlook Stable 
      to reflect that full principal repayment is highly probable given the 
      continued amortization of the pool as well as defeasance of four loans 
      ($18.2 million) that mature in 2015. An upgrade to the classes, however, 
      is not warranted at this time due to continuing concerns with the 
      current level and risk of increasing of interest shortfalls should 
      additional loans transfer to special servicer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes and/or revises Rating Outlooks and 
      REs as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$16.4 million class D at 'BBBsf', Outlook to Stable from Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$13 million class E at 'BBsf', Outlook to Stable from Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$15.9 million class F at 'CCCsf', RE to 100% from 80%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$13 million class G at 'Csf', RE to 80% from 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$18.8 million class H at 'Csf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$15.9 million class J at 'Csf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$7.2 million class K at 'Csf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$8.7 million class L at 'Csf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$120,561 class M at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class N at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class P at 'Dsf', RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-1A, B and C certificates have paid in 
      full. Fitch does not rate the class NR certificates. Fitch previously 
      withdrew the ratings on the interest-only class X-1 and X-2 certificates.

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS (Reuters) - It's not every day that the chief executive of the largest U.S. energy company joins a lawsuit opposing a new water tower planned in his neighborhood that could support fracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Wednesday that CEO Rex Tillerson was opposed to the plan not because of fracking but because the tower would be much taller than what the town had originally proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, former Republican heavyweight Dick Armey and other residents of a ranch-filled suburb of Bartonville north of Dallas filed suit in 2012 seeking to block construction of the 160-foot-tall (49-meter-tall) water tower, arguing it would be an eyesore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in Denton County District Court, also noted that the tower could encourage the town of Bartonville to sell "water to oil and gas explorers for fracking shale formations leading to traffic with heavy trucks... creating a noise nuisance and traffic hazards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Tillerson does not object to the tower for its potential use for water and gas operations for fracking," said Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson's property is already adjacent to several oil and gas wells and fracking operations, Jeffers added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under high pressure into bedrock to allow extraction of more of oil or gas. Exxon Mobil and other energy companies say the practice is safe, but many environmental groups say it can pollute the water table and cause seismic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tower has sat unfinished for almost a year as an earlier suit between the town of Bartonville and the water supply company proceeds through the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Scott Malone and David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS Feb 26 (Reuters) - It's not every day that the chief

			Perficient Enterprise Social and Collaboration Expert to Discuss 
      Yammer Best Practices at Microsoft SharePoint Conference 2014
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft 2013 U.S. Partner of the Year Perficient to demonstrate how 
      SharePoint&#8217;s social, mobile and search capabilities deliver new ways of 
      collaborating and communicating at work
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Collaboration plays a critical role in business success. As companies 
      aim to improve productivity, the deployment of collaborative 
      technologies and enterprise social networks has become a high priority. Perficient, 
      Inc. (NASDAQ: PRFT), a leading information technology consulting 
      firm serving Global 2000 and other large enterprise customers throughout 
      North America, today announced its Microsoft social collaboration expert 
      Rich Wood will present on enterprise social network solution Yammer at 
      the Microsoft 
      SharePoint Conference 2014. The SharePoint Conference will be held 
      March 3 &#8211; 6 in Las Vegas, and is the most comprehensive event for IT 
      professionals dedicated to SharePoint and related technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since it was acquired by Microsoft in 2012, Yammer has emerged as the 
      technology giant&#8217;s direction for enterprise social networks and 
      rightfully so. It integrates with SharePoint Online, and is an 
      interactive and social communications tool that is intuitive, 
      mobile-friendly and accessible across all platforms, easy to adopt and 
      governance-ready,&#8221; said Rich 
      Wood, director of Perficient&#8217;s national Microsoft web and social 
      collaboration practice. &#8220;But what most organizations have yet to tap 
      into is Yammer&#8217;s ability to extend its features outside the company&#8217;s 
      walls to vendors, partners and even customers. Yammer is redefining the 
      traditional external network into what I call extranet 2.0.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the SharePoint Conference, Wood will address the need to engage 
      with customers, partners and vendors, and how Yammer can lead the way, 
      during the session &#8220;Yammer 
      External Networks: Engaging Customers and Partners.&#8221; Specifically, 
      Wood will demonstrate how to set up, configure and govern external 
      networks powered by Yammer. He also will discuss adoption strategies and 
      how to get the most out of the platform&#8217;s intuitive user experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Employees need to engage with one another, with partners and with 
      customers anytime, anywhere; the cloud, social and mobile come together 
      to drive this,&#8221; continued Wood. &#8220;An attractive attribute of Microsoft 
      SharePoint with Yammer integration is that it is a single solution that 
      can power a company's&#160;intranet, extranet and&#160;website. The key to its 
      success is having a proper vision and business strategy that aligns with 
      a well thought out technology roadmap. This leads to enhanced 
      collaboration and communications and ultimately will drive improved 
      business performance and growth.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - When it comes to hosting an awards show, Patton Oswalt has a few tricks up his sleeve that include keeping a celebrity-filled crowd on edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virginia-born Oswalt, 45, has forged a career in comedy, with roles in TV sitcoms "The King of Queens" and "Two and a Half Men," and films such as 2011's "Young Adult" and last year's "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his comforting, friendly and often neighborly vocal tone, Oswalt is also a regular voice actor and stand-up comedian. On Saturday, he will host the Film Independent Spirit Awards, a laid-back luncheon held in a tent on the beach in Santa Monica, California, the day before Hollywood's Oscars night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswalt spoke to Reuters on hosting duties, the industry of independent film and how to break the ice with nominees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: What's all this about you handing out live birds instead of the Spirit award bird statuettes to winners?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Oh, good lord, no. We just did that as a goof on the commercial. Why would I give a live, fragile animal to a boozy actor at a beach? That'd be terrible, no!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: The Spirit Awards are the day before the Academy Awards and a lot of those actors are going to be on edge as they are also nominated for Oscars. Are you going to put them at ease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: It'll be a combination of me being genuinely excited to be there and them being genuinely buzzed from the alcohol that they're serving that I think will relax everybody, that's what I'm hoping for at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: You're up against some tough hosting competition this year after Tina Fey and Amy Poehler slayed the crowd at the Golden Globes and Ellen DeGeneres is back for the Oscars. How are you feeling about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Really confident. Of all those people, I'm the prettiest girl. I don't really think I'm going to have any problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: You're known for often speaking your mind and calling out celebrities on Twitter. Is there anyone at the awards that you're hoping to throw a few jibes at?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Oh, yeah, there's people there. I hope they understand that it's my job to warm people up; I don't think anyone's going to take anything too personally. Oh, wait a minute. We're talking about actors. God knows what's going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: How are you planning to break the ice with the nominees?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: The most that I'd say, especially if I'm talking to someone like Robert Redford or Bruce Dern, I say "Hey, look, thank you." And they can see from my pasty (repertory)-theater skin that I'm just a guy that watched a lot of those movies and I'm just happy to get to see them in real life and thank them in person for all the amazing work they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's somebody new and upcoming, I just go, "Look at all the horrible mistakes I've made. Please don't do what I do," and then I mysteriously walk away while sipping my Scotch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Just to make them more on edge about their career?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Exactly. I want to go "Hey, one small step and this is you," and then I point to my face. And then I just burst into tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: What's the strangest thing you're going to try and do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: I'm going to go commando.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: You've had your own success in independent film such as "Young Adult," how have you seen the industry change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: It's been pretty profound. I think the main thing that has changed is that now I think indie films have to do a little less begging especially in terms of getting distribution or just getting seen. If a filmmaker is simply concerned with getting their work looked at so that they could build their career off of that, if the initial film doesn't sell to a distributor or entice a studio, they can go, "You know what, everyone's got a screen in their pocket now, and I can reach them somehow." And the good stuff does bubble up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: You were also in Ben Stiller's anticipated December film "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," which failed to score any big awards nominations. Were you disappointed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: I was just disappointed in terms of, I thought Ben Stiller did an amazing job directing it and I thought he should have gotten some recognition for that. I also thought it should have gotten way more recognition in terms of cinematography, and in terms of his writing ... this was a really good crowded year, and it really tells you something when a movie that good gets lost in the shuffle. So it's frustrating for that movie but I think it's good overall for the health of cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: What are your Oscar plans, will you be attending?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: I don't think I get to go to the Oscars yet, I'm not a member of the Academy. I'd love to be someday, fingers crossed. Oscars day is going to be pajamas, pizza, wine and a big screen TV and my Twitter feed, that's all it's going to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Eric Kelsey and Paul Simao)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Biomet Inc, the U.S. medical device maker that was taken private by a private equity consortium for $11.4 billion in 2007, has hired underwriters for an initial public offering later this year, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering could come in the first half of 2014 and raise more than $1 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomet's owners -- Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity arm, KKR &amp; Co LP (KKR.N) and TPG Capital LP -- have selected Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) to lead the IPO, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackstone and Biomet did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for TPG, KKR and the banks declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1977, and based in Warsaw, Indiana, Biomet designs, manufacturers and markets products that include dental implants and artificial hips joints. Biomet competes with Smith &amp; Nephew PLC and Stryker Corp (SYK.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomet's buyout was done at the top of the market. But since then the medical device industry was hit during the financial crisis as patients delayed surgery and joint replacements. Pricing pressure for hip and knee replacements has also impacted the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomet is one of the few remaining large companies taken over by private equity firms during the buyout boom that has not yet gone public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other large private equity-owned companies that have gone public in the past 12 months include hotel chain Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N), oil and gas company Antero Resources Corp (AR.N) and industrials supply company HD Supply Holdings Inc (HDS.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomet's sales topped $3 billion in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013, up 8 percent from the previous year. Adjusted net income was $368 million, up 46 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim in New York; Additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in Berlin; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global In-Memory Computing Market Forecasts to 
      2018 with IBM, Oracle, QlikTech, and SAP Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6cs4nz/global_inmemory) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      In-Memory Computing Market Forecasts to 2018 with IBM, Oracle, QlikTech, 
      and SAP Dominating" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global In-Memory Computing market to grow at a CAGR of 43% over the 
      period 2014-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In-memory computing supports the growth of a company and helps it gain 
      competitive advantage by streamlining business processes and improving 
      operational efficiency. In-memory computing is one of the most valuable 
      assets for SMEs as it involves storing business information in the 
      random access memory of servers rather than storing information in 
      relational databases on traditional hard disks. The declining cost of 
      random access memory and maturing software systems are making it easier 
      for SMEs to adopt in-memory computing. Hence, the increasing adoption of 
      in-memory computing by SMEs is driving the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the rapid explosion 
      of data in enterprise networks, leading to a high demand for in-memory 
      computing. With huge blocks of data being accessed and computed, the 
      demand for high-performance computing is increasing considerably.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that data security issues and lack of 
      confidence constitutes one of the major challenges in this market. 
      Concern about data security is one of the major challenges confronting 
      the market. Enterprises are always concerned about data security and 
      related issues when using in-memory computing applications. This concern 
      is greater when the tool is installed using SaaS-based solutions. During 
      the deployment of SaaS-based in-memory computing technology, the data 
      resides in the cloud servers of vendors, increasing security concerns.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds Kerry quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Feb 26 (Reuters) - The United States pledged
assistance to Georgia on Wednesday to help the former Soviet
republic with visa-free travel to the European Union, a move
that will spur its efforts to boost ties with the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry didn't elaborate on the
plan, which comes as Washington increases its support for
Georgia and Moldova, which are seeking more integration with

States to help support Georgia's Euro-Atlantic vision,
specifically to help Georgia achieve visa-free travel with the

Georgian Prime Minister Irakly Garibashvili.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerry was referring to occupied territories like Georgia's
breakaway region of South Ossetia, the center of a brief 2008
war between Russia and Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garibashvili told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that
Russian forces had resumed building a barbed wire fence on the
border of South Ossetia following the recent conclusion of the
Winter Olympics in Sochi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerry lauded Georgia's economic reforms and urged the
government to quickly implement plans to boost trade with the
United States and with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strict adherence to rule of law and steadfast commitment to
the process will encourage the confidence of investors and will
serve as a catalyst for integration with Europe," Kerry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to tensions with Russia, Kerry urged Georgia to
"look forward and leave the past in the past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garibashvili's visit to Washington comes amid political
turmoil in another former soviet state, Ukraine, which rejected
deeper ties with the EU when president Viktor Yanukovich

"zero-sum game" between Russia and the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there were fears on Wednesday that tensions with
Russia could escalate after Moscow said about 150,000 Russian
troops would take part in exercises in the Western military
district that borders Ukraine.

				Reported total revenues reached Ps. 43,240 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, an increase of 8.5% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. On a currency neutral basis and excluding the non-comparable effect of the integration of Grupo Yoli ("Yoli") in our Mexican territories, Companhia Fluminense de Refrigerantes ("Fluminense") and Spaipa S.A. Industria Brasileira de Bebidas ("Spaipa") in our Brazilian operation, total revenues grew 12.1%.
				Reported operating income reached Ps. 6,609 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, resulting in an operating margin of 15.3%.
				Reported consolidated net controlling interest income reached Ps. 3,066 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.

(BMV: KOFL) (NYSE: KOF) ("Coca-Cola FEMSA" or the "Company"), the largest franchise bottler in the world, announces results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite the many challenges that we faced during 2013, including a tough consumer environment -- especially in Brazil and Mexico -- and a volatile currency environment across our operations, our company delivered double-digit currency-neutral top-line growth. More importantly, during the year, we were pleased to integrate four Coca-Cola franchises -- Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., Grupo Yoli in Mexico, and Fluminense and Spaipa in Brazil -- reinforcing our position as the largest bottler of Coca-Cola products in the world, now serving more than 346 million consumers in 10 countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia.&#160;Our very talented management team is committed to extend the successful track record of our company through our most important asset -- our people. Our growing family of more than 120,000 employees enters 2014 fully aware of the structural changes in markets like Mexico, along with the challenges that some of our other franchises present.&#160;Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the good start of the year in the volume performance of our Brazilian franchise and by the smooth integration process of the new territories, where we are confident that we can achieve the targeted synergies efficiently and effectively. We continue to successfully adjust our Mexican operation to better serve our customers and consumers in 2014 and we have the flexibility to adapt to local market conditions in the rest of our operations," said John Santa Maria Otazua, Chief Executive Officer of the Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Leading Transplant Experts to Review Preparations for Pivotal Phase III Trial of Actinium's Iomab(TM)-B Drug Candidate&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Feb 26, 2014) -  Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCBB: ATNM) ("Actinium" or "the Company"), a biopharmaceutical Company developing innovative targeted payload immunotherapeutics for the treatment of advanced cancers, will host an advisory meeting with leading bone marrow transplant experts during the combined annual meetings of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) and the Center for International Blood  Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) in Grapevine, Texas on Saturday, March 1, 2014. The Company will present an agreement reached with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the design of a single pivotal Phase III trial for approval of Iomab&#8482;-B, Actinium's leading drug candidate. The advisory group will discuss the Iomab&#8482;-B Phase III trial design, formation of a Scientific Advisory Board for Iomab&#8482;-B and logistics of the Phase III trial.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having such a prominent group of transplant experts working with us on this trial will go a long way toward ensuring the best possible trial," said Dragan Cicic, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Actinium Pharmaceuticals. "We are not only developing a new drug but an entirely new paradigm in treatment of this patient population, and having people who in many ways define new treatment paradigms actively participate in the process is of enormous value to us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attendees of the meeting will include Richard Champlin, MD, Chair, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; Sergio Giralt, MD, Chief Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Hillard Lazarus, MD, Disease Team Leader and Director, Novel Cell Therapy, University Hospitals Case Medical Center; Peter McSweeney, MD, Clinical Director and Laboratory Medical Director, Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Colorado Blood Cancer Institute and Primary Investigator for Iomab&#8482;-B trials; and John Pagel, MD, PhD, Associate Member, Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am thrilled that we are moving closer to the final trial before potential approval for Iomab&#8482;-B," said John Pagel, MD, Primary Investigator for Iomab&#8482;-B. "This drug candidate has a potential to change the way we approach bone marrow transplants and expand their use to patients who would benefit from them the most but currently have very limited access to this lifesaving procedure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Iomab&#8482;-B&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iomab&#8482;-B will be used in preparing patients for hematopoietic stem cell transplant, commonly referred to as bone marrow transplant which is the fastest growing hospital procedure in the U.S.&#160;The Company established an agreement with the FDA that the path to a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission will include a single, pivotal Phase 3 clinical study if it is successful.&#160;The trial population in this two arm, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial will be refractory and relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients over the age of 55.&#160;The trial size was set at 150 patients with 75 patients per arm.&#160;The study design of the pivotal trial is based on results of an earlier Phase 1/2 trial in which sixty percent of the older patients with refractory and relapsed AML exhibited disease free survival estimated at six months.&#160;The primary endpoint in the pivotal Phase 3 trial is durable complete remission, defined as a complete remission lasting at least 6 months.&#160;There are currently no treatments approved by the FDA for AML in this patient population and there is no defined standard of care.&#160;Iomab&#8482;-B has completed several physician sponsored clinical trials examining its potential as a conditioning regimen prior to a bone marrow transplant in various blood cancers including the Phase 1/2 study in relapsed and/or refractory AML patients.&#160;The results of these studies in over 300 patients have demonstrated the potential of Iomab&#8482;-B to create a new treatment paradigm for bone marrow transplants by: expanding the pool to ineligible patients who do not have any viable treatment options currently; enabling a shorter and safer preparatory interval for HSCT; reducing post-transplant complications; and showing a clear survival benefit including curative potential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iomab&#8482;-B is a radioimmunoconjugate consisting of BC8, a novel murine monoclonal antibody, and iodine 131 radioisotope.&#160;BC8 has been developed by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to target CD45, a pan-leukocytic antigen widely expressed on white blood cells.&#160;This antigen makes BC8 potentially useful in targeting white blood cells in preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a number of blood cancer indications, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Hodgkin disease (HD), Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM).&#160;When labeled with radioactive isotopes, BC8 carries radioactivity directly to the site of cancerous growth and bone marrow while avoiding effects of radiation on most healthy tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Actinium Pharmaceuticals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCBB: ATNM) is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company developing innovative targeted payload immunotherapeutics for the treatment of advanced cancers.&#160;Actinium's targeted radiotherapy is based on its proprietary delivery platform for the therapeutic utilization of alpha-emitting actinium-225 and bismuth-213 and certain beta emitting radiopharmaceuticals in conjunction with monoclonal antibodies.&#160;The Company's lead radiopharmaceutical Iomab&#8482;-B will be used in preparing patients for hematopoietic stem cell transplant, commonly referred to as bone marrow transplant.&#160;The Company is conducting a single, pivotal, multicenter Phase 3 clinical study of Iomab&#8482;-B in refractory and relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients over the age of 55 with a primary endpoint of durable complete remission.&#160;The company's second program, Actimab-A, is continuing its clinical development in a Phase 1/2 trial for newly diagnosed AML patients over the age of 60 in a single-arm multicenter trial.

		&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, CA--(Marketwired - Feb 26, 2014) -  RackWare, the software provider that integrates data center and cloud resources into a scalable and intelligently managed computing environment, today announced that its RackWare Management Module (RMM) product can now be used by enterprise clients to quickly and easily extend their data centers into the cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provided by SoftLayer, an IBM Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to rapid migration of data center workloads into cloud environments such as IBM's SoftLayer, RackWare enhances enterprise data centers and cloud infrastructures by adding the ability to automatically expand resources to accommodate rapidly growing workloads, and contract resources when they are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RackWare Management Module software, coupled with cloud infrastructure like SoftLayer, creates a dynamic computing environment that adapts to changing business conditions.&#160;It provides the following features and benefits to enterprise data centers that use, or intend to use, cloud infrastructure such as IBM SoftLayer:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				On Boarding - Provides push-button, rapid migration of enterprise data center workloads into private or public clouds which allows data centers to tap a virtually unlimited number of resources quickly and easily 
					
				
				Auto Parking - Automatically shuts down cloud host resources when they are not in use, dramatically minimizing costs over time
					
				
				Auto Scaling - Provides policy-based Scale-In and Scale-Out operations on individual or groups of hosts in addition to coordinating with other infrastructure as hosts are activated or deactivated
					
				
				Cloud Bursting - During periods of time where enterprise data center loads experience peak utilization, RackWare automatically provisions data center hosts and extends them into heterogeneous private or public cloud infrastructure to enhance customer service levels.&#160;During off-peak periods, workloads in the cloud are synchronized back to the data center and the cloud resources are decommissioned to reduce costs.
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;"RackWare streamlines migration from any public or private cloud to SoftLayer.&#160;It also provides additional workload mobility and dynamic scaling capabilities on our platform," said Mac Devine, CTO of IBM's Cloud Services Division. "RackWare provides unique advantages for dynamically matching SoftLayer resources to dynamic changes in business demand, which leads to better customer service, less power consumption, and more efficient costing." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"RackWare is delighted to become part of the SoftLayer ecosystem," said Sash Sunkara, CEO of RackWare. "We believe that our software will help make IBM Cloud a compelling solution for data center workloads around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About RackWare&#160;
				RackWare brings intelligence and automation to the cloud, providing greater availability for enterprises, greater flexibility for enterprise IT users, and reduced costs for enterprise IT providers. Computing resources -- physical, virtual, and cloud machines -- can be easily and automatically scaled up or down as demand fluctuates. On average, RackWare customers realize a cost savings of 40 to 50 percent, while getting the highest performance and availability out of their cloud. RackWare was founded in 2009 and is based in Santa Clara, California.

		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Agreement with First Data&#8217;s STAR&#174; 
      Network Provides Issuers, Acquirers and Merchants an EMV Solution 
      Compliant with Debit Regulation and Supports U.S. EMV Migration
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and First Data&#8217;s STAR&#174; 
      Network announced an agreement to share Visa&#8217;s common debit 
      solution offering issuers, acquirers and merchants a streamlined and 
      cost-effective approach for debit EMV chip adoption. EMV cards contain 
      an embedded computer processor or a chip that generates a one-time code 
      for each transaction making it nearly impossible for criminals to 
      counterfeit. This feature will help protect merchants and issuers from 
      fraud losses stemming from counterfeit payment cards used at the point 
      of sale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collaboration between these two payments industry leaders on the 
      license agreement will help to enable the development of 
      regulation-compliant debit EMV solutions using a common Application 
      Identifier (AID). First Data&#8217;s STAR Network will use PIN and no CVM 
      functionality on the common AID to facilitate different types of debit 
      transactions on its network, including PIN, PINless and signature 
      cardholder verification methods. The AID will facilitate U.S. debit 
      transactions from any debit network that licenses the Visa common AID 
      solution and is enabled on a Visa card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This agreement is a significant step to accelerate EMV adoption by 
      addressing Regulation II compliance for debit EMV transactions,&#8221; said 
      Barry McCarthy, president, First Data Financial Services. &#8220;First Data&#8217;s 
      STAR Network is pleased to lead the effort by being one of the first 
      debit networks to take this step and assist issuers, acquirers, and 
      merchants with equal access to a shared EMV chip card technology. Not 
      only does it accelerate the migration to EMV adoption, but also moves 
      the industry a step closer to additional debit payment security,&#8221; 
      McCarthy added.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the addition of First Data&#8217;s STAR Network, Visa debit issuers can 
      now choose among several competing network options for their EMV chip 
      debit cards, while also reducing the complexities of chip implementation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa&#8217;s priority is to facilitate the U.S. migration to EMV technology 
      as efficiently and quickly as possible,&#8221; said Elizabeth Buse, Global 
      Executive, Solutions, Visa Inc. &#8220;Under our approach, issuers and 
      merchants will have a streamlined path to achieve the security benefits 
      of EMV while minimizing disruption to legacy systems.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The common debit solution will both support issuer choice and 
      flexibility, allowing network changes without reissuing cards and 
      merchant and acquiring routing choices without costly host systems 
      reprograming. Minimal updates are required for all when new participants 
      adopt the solution.

&lt;p&gt;* Card scheme's inter-bank fees to be capped at 0.3 percent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Deal ends EU antitrust probe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* EU's Almunia hails victory for consumers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Credit-card provider Visa
Europe will cap the transaction fees it charges, the European
Commission said on Wednesday, curbing an important money earner
for banks behind the payment scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move ends one in a series of long-running antitrust
probes by the European Commission that was triggered by
retailers' gripes about the world's biggest card payments
company by the volume of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It represents a victory for those retailers and the
Commission, which had pushed for reduced fees on credit and
debit cards, saying the annual cost to businesses across Europe
was 10 billion euros ($13.7 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement to end the dispute means Visa Europe's
inter-bank credit card fees, a cost which consumer groups say
ultimately falls on the card user, will be capped at 0.3 percent
- the same level as rival MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a setback for Visa Europe, the European licensee of
Visa Inc, owned and operated by more than 3,000 European
financial institutions. It had offered to take this step last
year after the EU competition authority began its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cap on inter-bank fees for Visa Europe's credit cards
and the commitments ensuring cross-border competition are
excellent news for European consumers, since the fees paid by
retailers end up on their bills," said EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inter-bank fees are collected and kept by banks processing
payments using cards. While the card payment companies do not
benefit directly from the charge, they fear a crackdown will
discourage lenders from issuing their cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard has said the value of cross-border card
transactions is less than 5 percent of all purchases made by
cardholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement confirms Reuters' report on Feb. 14 that
the European Commission would accept this concession from Visa
Europe to end its probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it would now be able to put the issue
behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visa Europe will continue to focus on developing and
providing payment solutions for the benefit of consumers, rather
than pursuing lengthy legal cases," Visa Europe CEO Nicolas Huss
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;intY USA pioneers new 365 resale model for partners&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;BOCA RATON, FLORIDA--(Marketwired - Feb 26, 2014) - 
				intY USA, the cloud and Software-as-a-Service specialist for the channel has signed a historic agreement with Microsoft that sees Office 365 made available in a recurring revenue resale model for the first time to its high volume strategic partners. The announcement enables selected intY USA strategic partners to resell rather than recommend Microsoft Office 365, bringing with it a host of new margin and service opportunities for these partners who are now able to directly bill all services supplied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Baldock, CEO of intY USA, explained, "To date many of our major partners struggled with the existing referral-only model for Office 365, with one sticking point being the billing relationship owned by Microsoft or the Syndication Partner making it difficult for complementary services to be provided by the channel on one bill. This agreement puts our larger channel partners firmly back in the driving seat - they become a reseller with margin and value-add as opposed to a recommender with a commission payment. Ultimately, they own that all important customer relationship."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within intY's aggregation platform, intY CASCADE, selected partners can set their own price, be in control of margin, and bundle other complementary products and value-add service functionality with Office 365, all whilst billing the customer directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will spur a further migration towards Office 365", said Baldock. "The next phase of customer adoption is highly reliant upon channel partners for migration, support and integration, the path is now clear for rapid uptake. With Office 365 being available in a resale model for intY CASCADE strategic partners, plus the guarantee of the latest Microsoft capability and service, we expect this market to accelerate at pace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;intY USA is launching to a selected number of partners across Europe and North America this week, where Office 365 will be made available to these partners via the intY CASCADE cloud marketplace. Office 365 joins over 200 products on the cloud-aggregation platform, delivering a fast and simple delivery model for partners to bundle and deliver multi-vendor solutions to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Herbert, Executive Vice President and Founder of intY USA, concluded, "This is the shape of things to come. We've been in the SaaS space since the start, and we've always believed that the right combination of Microsoft and the cloud would be a game changer for channel consumption. This is it. We're delighted to add Office 365 for resale to the CASCADE mix with this new agreement, enabling our strategic partners to build and deliver truly best of breed services to end users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About intY CASCADE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;intY CASCADE is a new class of product for delivering cloud-based applications, products and services via Systems Integrators, ISPs, Telco's and Trusted Advisors who are able to build solutions specific to the market they operate in or specific to their customers' requirements. The award-winning ecosystem has been architected from the outset to link multiple cloud computing engines and builds on intY's heritage in delivering cloud-provisioning services to the channel for over 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, many of the world's largest service providers are building on CASCADE.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ftwpmc/global_trade) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Trade Financing Market 2014-2018 with HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Mitsubishi

		&lt;p&gt;
      The banks are gradually changing and adopting a different approach. The 
      focus is shifting from a product-centric operating model to a 
      client-centric model, because this enables banks to provide clients with 
      more customized and personalized solutions and services. This helps the 
      banks to create a niche market and strengthens their relationships with 
      selected market segments. There will be similar reciprocation from the 
      trade finance vendors as they establish strong relationships with key 
      banking partners to ensure smooth supply of funding in times of 
      financial crisis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      regulatory norms brought into effect by Basel III. These regulations 
      have enforced the banks to incur of high costs to cover the risks, which 
      eventually increase the pricing for the clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges in this 
      market is the diminishing trade financing in developing countries. Due 
      to the financial meltdown, the growth in the value of trade finance has 
      remained very sluggish, particularly in developing countries.

      Visa Inc. CEO Charles Scharf&#8217;s Statement on Appointment to President&#8217;s 
      Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf today 
      released the following statement regarding his appointment by President 
      Obama to the President&#8217;s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for 
      Young Americans:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am honored to be appointed by the President and grateful for the 
      opportunity to serve on the President&#8217;s Advisory Council on Financial 
      Capability for Young Americans. As a father of two, I feel a personal 
      commitment to the issue of ensuring our nation&#8217;s children have the 
      knowledge and skills they need to be financially successful.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Building the financial capability of young Americans is critically 
      important to ensuring a vibrant, expanding economy and a financially 
      secure nation. Fueling economic growth is at the core of what Visa does 
      every day and it&#8217;s why championing greater financial literacy is in our 
      DNA. Our deep commitment to financial capability is rooted in this 
      belief. For more than 15 years we&#8217;ve been helping parents and teachers 
      bring personal finance education to millions of American students.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I look forward to working with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Education 
      Secretary Arne Duncan, Council Chair John Rogers and my colleagues on 
      the Council to achieve real progress advancing financial capability for 
      young Americans.&#8221;

			Visa&#174; Enhances Industry Fraud Detection on Prepaid Cards
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Visa Prepaid Clearinghouse Service Creates Centralized Database to 
      Better Detect and Prevent Fraud Schemes on Prepaid Cards
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today announced that it has completed technical 
      development of a new service aimed at detecting and preventing fraud 
      schemes that target the use of prepaid cards. Visa&#8217;s Prepaid 
      Clearinghouse Service (PCS) is a centralized database that allows 
      financial institutions, processors and prepaid program managers to share 
      prepaid card data such as enrollments, load funding, suspected 
      fraudulent information and previously reported fraud on existing card 
      accounts. PCS will provide critical information sharing to better 
      identify and stop fraudulent enrollments, funding, use and other fraud 
      schemes involving prepaid cards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa&#8217;s Prepaid Clearinghouse Service will deliver a comprehensive 
      compilation of prepaid account-level data from across the industry, 
      which will help reduce prepaid fraud losses for consumers, financial 
      institutions and their clients,&#8221; said Brian Triplett, SVP, head of North 
      America prepaid products. &#8220;Criminals are increasingly targeting prepaid 
      products which more and more consumers are using for every day 
      purchases. While existing laws and industry safeguards help limit most 
      consumer losses, PCS is a huge step forward for the industry towards 
      proactively preventing fraud schemes targeting prepaid cards.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Value assessments now begin with financial institutions and their 
      program managers providing PCS with information such as enrollments, 
      load funding, provisional credit requests, and fraudulent activity to 
      check the database for risky activity. This analysis will allow for 
      unique optimization as assessments are completed. Subscribing 
      participants will then receive real-time alerts to be used in their 
      fraud review decision process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By participating in Prepaid Clearinghouse Service, participants will 
      have access to a holistic view of prepaid fraud across the industry, 
      enabling them to detect and protect their customers and their portfolios 
      from fraud efficiently and effectively. Reporting information into PCS 
      will be required for all U.S. Visa-issuing financial institutions and 
      program managers, yet PCS is capable of supporting multiple 
      network-branded prepaid cards. All U.S. Visa prepaid issuing financial 
      institutions and their program managers will be required to report into 
      PCS by June 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Fraud is a constant threat for prepaid program managers, so being 
      forewarned of what attacks are happening across the industry can help 
      them prepare their defenses,&#8221; said Ben Jackson, Sr. Analyst of Mercator 
      Advisory Group's Prepaid Advisory Service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Prepaid Clearinghouse Service is modeled after Visa&#8217;s Issuers&#8217; 
      Clearinghouse Service (ICS), which was created to help reduce bankcard 
      credit and fraud losses. All Visa-issuing members submit information on 
      both fraudulent applications and consumer credit card applications for 
      use during the application and underwriting process. Even today, issuers 
      using ICS continue to show an average incremental lift of more than 
      $30:1.

			Forward Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This press release contains forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
      Forward-looking statements generally are identified by words such as 
      &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; &#8220;strategy,&#8221; &#8220;opportunities,&#8221; &#8220;continue," &#8220;can,&#8221;

      uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that are 
      difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ 
      materially and adversely from our forward-looking statements due to a 
      variety of factors, including the following: the impact of laws, 
      regulations and marketplace barriers; developments in litigation and 
      government enforcement, including those affecting interchange 
      reimbursement fees, antitrust and tax; new lawsuits, investigations or 
      proceedings, or changes to our potential exposure in connection with 
      pending lawsuits, investigations or proceedings; economic factors; 
      industry developments, such as competitive pressure, rapid technological 
      developments, and disintermediation from our payments network; system 
      developments; the loss of organizational effectiveness or key employees; 
      the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully or to effectively 
      develop new products and businesses; natural disasters, terrorist 
      attacks, military or political conflicts, and public health emergencies; 
      and various other risk factors, including those contained in our Annual 
      Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2013 and our other 
      filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not 
      place undue reliance on such statements.

			Green Mountain Coffee Roasters and The Coca-Cola Company Close on 
      Previously Announced Equity Transaction
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, 
      Inc. (GMCR) (NASDAQ: GMCR) announced today the closing of the previously 
      announced private placement of GMCR common stock to The Coca-Cola 
      Company for total gross proceeds of approximately $1.25 billion. In 
      connection with the closing, GMCR issued 16,684,139 newly issued shares 
      of common stock at a purchase price of $74.98 per share to a wholly 
      owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously announced, GMCR intends to execute a meaningful share 
      repurchase program to reduce dilution from the transaction executed 
      under GMCR&#8217;s existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization. In 
      addition, GMCR intends to use a portion of the proceeds from the new 
      equity issuance to fund anticipated capital expenditures for its Keurig 
      Cold&#8482; beverage system over the next several years.

			GMCR Forward Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Certain information in this filing constitutes "forward-looking 
      statements." Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact 
      that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They 
      often include words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," 
      "estimates," "intends," "plans," "seeks" or words of similar meaning, or 
      future or conditional verbs, such as "will," "should," "could," "may," 
      "aims," "intends," or "projects." However, the absence of these words or 
      similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not 
      forward-looking. These statements may relate to: the expected impact of 
      raw material costs and our pricing actions on our results of operations 
      and gross margins, expected trends in net sales and earnings performance 
      and other financial measures, the expected productivity and working 
      capital improvements, the success of introducing and producing new 
      product offerings, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, the 
      adequacy of internally generated funds and existing sources of 
      liquidity, such as the availability of bank financing, the expected 
      results of operations of businesses acquired by us, our ability to issue 
      debt or additional equity securities, our expectations regarding 
      purchasing shares of our common stock under the existing authorizations, 
      projections of payment of dividends, and the impact of the inquiry 
      initiated by the SEC and any related litigation or additional 
      governmental inquiry or enforcement proceedings. A forward-looking 
      statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or 
      circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. 
      Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable 
      as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue 
      reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements 
      speak only as of the date when made. We expressly disclaim any 
      obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether 
      as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, 
      forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
      our Company's historical experience and our present expectations or 
      projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited 
      to, those described in Part&#160;I, "Item&#160;1A. Risk Factors," and Part&#160;II 
      "Item&#160;7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
      Results of Operations" in our fiscal 2013 Annual Report filed on Form 
      10-K, as amended, and elsewhere in the Form 10-K and those described 
      from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission.

      Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the 
      forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) has signed a deal to supply beverages to Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) first China resort, breaking The Coca-Cola Co's (KO.N) quarter century monopoly over beverage supply to the U.S. theme park operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo and its partner in China, Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp (0322.HK), will exclusively provide beverages to the Shanghai Disney Resort, its first on mainland China which is set to open at the end of 2015, PepsiCo, Disney and Tingyi said in a joint statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has had a long-standing tie-up with Disney, while it has been at least 25 years since PepsiCo last sold its beverages through the theme park chain, a Dubai-based PepsiCo spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is only a tiny segment of China's 421 billion yuan ($68.74 billion) soft drink sector, but marks a blow for PepsiCo against Coke in the highly competitive market, where both brands are coming under increasing pressure from Chinese rivals and changing consumer tastes for local flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wonder what kind of message it sends to Coke globally. Even though the Disney park is only one small thing, China has massive room to grow for the Disney brand. Tying up this deal could mean good things going forward," said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said it currently has no plans to ink similar deals with PepsiCo to supply its other resorts, although it is "actively pursuing opportunities in a variety of different sectors," Murray King, vice president of public affairs for the Shanghai Disney Resort, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PepsiCo spokesman said he could not comment on whether PepsiCo and Disney planned other tie-ups. Disney has a further 11 theme parks and 44 resorts around the world, according to its official website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEPSI VS COKE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola edges the China market with a 15.7 percent share of China's soft drinks market in 2012, ahead of PepsiCo's 4.5 percent share by off-trade volume, according to data from Euromonitor. China's soft drinks sector is worth around 421 billion yuan ($69.12 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for healthier alternatives in food and drink, which has also hit growth for fast food chains such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola remains the soft drinks supplier for Disney resorts outside mainland China. It is the beverage provider for Disney's 11 parks in the United States, Hong Kong, France and Japan, a Singapore-based spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Coca-Cola Company and The Walt Disney Company share a long-standing partnership that dates to the first Disney television show in 1950 and the first Disneyland theme park in 1955. Today, our global partnership with Disney is as strong as ever," she added in emailed comments to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it retains the biggest market share in China, but local rivals are catching up. Pepsi's partner in the market, Taiwanese Tingyi, raised its market share from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 12.8 percent in 2012, according to Euromonitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tingyi and PepsiCo beverages will be the sole range of drinks sold at the Shanghai park, a Tingyi spokesman said. All three companies declined to put a value on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key question for Pepsi is if it can leverage its tie-up with Disney outside the limits of the resort, said Cavender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they can do more Disney-themed adverts elsewhere I can see this benefiting them a lot, and the fact Disney switched from Coke to Pepsi here could mean big things for the years ahead in other markets too," he said.

		&lt;h1&gt;Proofpoint Joins IBM Security Intelligence Partner Program&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New Device Support Module Means New Integration and Better Visibility and Management for Both Companies' Joint Customers&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SUNNYVALE, CA--(Marketwired - Feb 27, 2014) -  Proofpoint, Inc. (NASDAQ: PFPT), a leading security-as-a-service provider, today announced it has joined the International Business Machines Corporation's Ready for IBM Security Intelligence program (RFISI). Proofpoint and IBM also unveiled a new device support module (DSM) that enables information and event integration between IBM QRadar Security Intelligence Platform products and the Proofpoint Enterprise Protection and Proofpoint Enterprise Privacy offerings. The two companies' product lines complement one another and both are leaders in their respective Gartner Magic Quadrants: Secure Email Gateway for Proofpoint, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for IBM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DSM's integration capabilities enable security administrators to eliminate silos and get a more comprehensive view of their security posture from a single pane of glass, including alerts related to anomalies and outliers. They can also set policies based on data ingested from the Proofpoint products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are delighted that Proofpoint has been certified in our Ready for IBM Security Intelligence program," said Michael Loria, vice president, business development, IBM Security Systems. "Our customers are using QRadar to protect their enterprises from today's advanced threats. Email is a leading attack vector for malware targeted at high value individuals and assets, and Proofpoint is a leader in this space to fight these threats. The combination of Proofpoint and IBM QRadar delivers a powerful solution for our joint customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond providing added value to users, the new relationship strengthens ties between the two companies that date back to 2005, when IBM began reselling Proofpoint products to its strategic outsourced customers. IBM Managed Security Services Email Protection, Encryption/DLP and Targeted Attack Protection offerings are powered by Proofpoint. IBM also offers a Managed SIEM service for QRadar and other leading platforms, which furthers the synergies of this integration and partnership between the companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Joint customers of Proofpoint and IBM can now benefit from an innovative and powerful defense against inbound and outbound Email malware attacks," said David Knight, Executive Vice President and GM Information Security Products at Proofpoint. "The integration between QRadar and Proofpoint Enterprise Protection and Enterprise Privacy gives our joint customers the ability to automate remediation processes of compromised users that Proofpoint indentifies." Proofpoint believes that this new technical certification and benefit for IBM QRadar customers will boost Proofpoint's visibility and enable Proofpoint to pursue sales opportunities in IBM's large installed base of QRadar customers, particularly in the finance, healthcare, retail and utilities sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close Collaboration for Ensured Compatibility
				Proofpoint and IBM worked together closely to develop the DSM that enables the integration between their products, including the ability to ingest Proofpoint data in a widely-used syslog format. Collaborative testing of the DSM as part of the RFISI certification process ensured interoperability between the Proofpoint products involved and those of the IBM QRadar family. Specifically, the DSM supports all QRadar 7.1 and 7.2 releases, and both the virtual and physical configurations of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection and Proofpoint Enterprise Privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Proofpoint, Inc.

		&lt;h1&gt;Mirantis and IBM Set New OpenStack Benchmark, Standing Up 75,000 Live VMs in Multi-Datacenter Cloud&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Mirantis OpenStack 4.0 (Havana), Deployed on IBM SoftLayer, Shows Scale-Out Enterprise Private Cloud Is All in a Day's Work for OpenStack&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Feb 27, 2014) -  Mirantis, the pure-play OpenStack vendor, today announced dramatic new benchmark numbers for running an OpenStack cloud at scale to feed the growing appetite for demanding workloads on enterprise private cloud. The benchmark used the latest Mirantis OpenStack 4.0 (Havana) distribution running on CentOS 6.4, deployed in a high-availability configuration across distributed data centers -- from start to finish in about 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using 350 physical servers on an IBM SoftLayer bare-metal multi-datacenter cloud, Mirantis OpenStack stood up 75,000 virtual servers, provisioned in parallel streams levels ranging from 100 at a time to 500 at a time. The benchmark was designed to show how quickly and reliably OpenStack could respond to on-demand, real world workload requirements for provisioning cloud resources, achieving a sustained a rate of 9,000 new virtual servers per hour for over 8 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways: &lt;/p&gt;
			
				Enterprises considering where to run large-scale workloads can rely on OpenStack for a private cloud with up to 75,000 virtual servers.
            
				Running Mirantis OpenStack on IBM SoftLayer provides highly responsive on-demand cloud resources, provisioned at over 9,000 virtual servers per hour.
            
				Mirantis OpenStack and IBM SoftLayer enable resilient multi data center cloud deployments.
			&lt;p&gt;"We built Mirantis OpenStack for scale and performance, and this benchmark with IBM shows that OpenStack is maturing quickly as a robust private cloud alternative to any public cloud offering today," said Adrian Ionel, CEO of Mirantis.&#160;"We're pushing OpenStack to its limits in harsh conditions that mimic real world production workloads and demanding customer use cases. Our goal is to give our customers reliable and transparent performance data for OpenStack at scale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"OpenStack is experiencing explosive growth in the cloud market with more than 200 companies contributing code to the source," said Sesh Murthy, Vice President Advanced Cloud Services at IBM. "Customers embrace the proven performance and reliability of IBM Softlayer virtual and bare metal cloud servers and this new benchmark with Mirantis demonstrates just how powerful and flexible of a foundation we can provide with OpenStack for enterprise private cloud deployments at scale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed technical description of the benchmark configuration, tools and results is available at www.mirantis.com/openstackbenchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirantis designed the test to demonstrate two key parameters of OpenStack: scale and speed of startup. Initiated from cloud controllers at a San Jose-based datacenter, Mirantis OpenStack was used to drive 250 parallel request streams for starting new virtual machines, across a network, to a complex of servers running in Houston, TX, more than 1,800 miles away. During the course of 8 hours, this distributed cloud infrastructure successfully built up 75,000 virtual servers running simultaneously on a remote infrastructure of 350 physical servers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virtual servers each included 1 vCPU, 64MB RAM, 2GB storage, with a CPU overcommit rate at 1:32 and a RAM overcommit at 1:1.5. Real-life workloads generally require much less simultaneous startup, so actual boot times per virtual server could be far faster. The test delivered an average sustained rate of 250 virtual servers bootstrapped every 98.8 seconds, growing almost linearly to the full population of 75,000 servers booted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Mirantis
				Mirantis is the number one pure-play OpenStack company. Mirantis delivers all the software, services, training and support needed for running OpenStack. More customers rely on Mirantis than any other company to get to production deployment of OpenStack at scale. Among the top five companies worldwide in contributing open source software to OpenStack, Mirantis has helped build and deploy some of the largest OpenStack clouds at companies such as ATT, Cisco WebEx, Comcast, Dell, The Gap, NASA, NTT Docomo, PayPal, Red Hat, Sprint and Verizon. Mirantis is venture-backed by Dell, Intel, Red Hat, SAP and WestSummit Capital. For more information, visit www.mirantis.com or follow us on Twitter at @mirantisit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 28 (Reuters) - Commodity revenues fell nearly
40 percent at Morgan Stanley and remained flat at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc last year, according to filings from the
two biggest Wall Street commodities players that face a changing
regulatory landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's commodity net revenues decreased by 38
percent from 2012, a second straight annual drop, in what the
bank described in its annual report to Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) as "challenging market-making conditions."
Commodities net revenues fell 20 percent in 2012 over 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dwindling revenues follow tighter restrictions on banks
trading with their own money and heightened public scrutiny of
their role in the natural resources supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said its commodity net revenues for 2013 were
"essentially unchanged" from 2012. The bank had said in 2012 it
saw "significantly lower" revenues over 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank reported $902 million in revenues from
market-making activities in commodities, an 83 percent increase
from the previous year. It said those figures did not accurately
reflect how it runs its commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the major Wall Street banks provided details on its
commodities operations, but overall commodities revenues have
waned in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total commodity trading revenues on Wall Street have fallen
by about two-thirds in the last five years, with the top 10
banks notching just $4.5 billion last year, according to
London-based analytics firm Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Goldman Sachs commodity unit J. Aron alone brought
in $4.5 billion. By 2011, that had fallen to $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's revenues peaked at around $3 billion in
2008 but fell to around $1 billion by 2011, according to
Reuters' calculations. Based on that figure, revenues would have
come to around $600 million last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for both banks declined to comment on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN IT TO WIN IT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Deutsche Bank AG
 and Barclays PLC have sold or shuttered some
or all of their physical commodities operations, but Morgan and
Goldman have indicated they still see opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' chief financial officer reaffirmed in a
January earnings call the bank's intent to remain in the
commodities trading business, deeming it "too important" to
clients to exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley owns several power plants in the U.S. and
still trades power, gas and crude oil, among other commodities,
although it sold the bulk of its physical crude oil trading
operations to Russian oil giant Rosneft Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two banks may yet emerge from the U.S. regulatory
upheaval better off than their peers, who face potentially
tougher new rules, thanks to a longstanding legal exemption that
regulators say limits their ability to restrict the banks'
activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OLYMPIA, Wash. Feb 28 (Reuters) - Nearly 25 years after the
Exxon Valdez oil spill off the southern coast of Alaska, sea
otters in the most affected parts of Prince William Sound have
recovered to their pre-spill numbers, a federal report released
on Friday showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several thousand sea otters died in the aftermath of the oil
tanker running aground on Bligh Reef and leaking 42 million
liters of crude oil into the sound in March 1989, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey, which issued the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report's findings underscore the lengthy recovery times
for many species affected by oil spills, U.S. Geological Survey
research biologist Brenda Ballachey said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although recovery timelines varied widely among species,
our work shows that recovery of species vulnerable to long-term
effects of oil spills can take decades," said Ballachey, the
study's lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists assessed the otters' recovery by using aerial
surveys, measuring oil exposure as indicated through gene
expression and by evaluating the animals after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the spill, middle-aged otters died at a
higher-than-normal rate - a trend that has since reverted to the
pre-spill pattern of most otters dying either very old or very
young, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slow pace of recovery for the otters was likely due to
their ongoing exposure to oil, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sea otters were among more than 20 near-shore animal species
damaged by the spill, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Goldman Sachs Limited Maturity Obligations Fund 'AAA/V1'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned 'AAA/V1' bond fund ratings to the Goldman 
      Sachs Limited Maturity Obligations Fund (LMOF), managed by Goldman Sachs 
      Asset Management, L.P. (GSAM). The fund will commence trading on Feb. 
      28, 2014 with initial funding of $10 million of seed capital.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating assignment reflects Fitch's review of the fund's investment 
      and credit guidelines, a pro forma portfolio and GSAM's capabilities as 
      investment advisor. The 'AAA' Fund Credit Rating (FCR) indicates the 
      highest underlying credit quality (or lowest vulnerability to default). 
      The assets are expected to maintain a weighted average portfolio rating 
      of 'AAA.' Funds rated 'V1' are considered to have very low sensitivity 
      to market risk. On a relative basis, total returns and/or changes in net 
      asset value are expected to exhibit high stability, showing low relative 
      volatility across a broad range of market scenarios. These funds offer 
      very low risk exposure to interest rates, credit spreads and other risk 
      factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The fund's investment guidelines mandating overall credit quality, 
      diversification and maturity profile;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Discussions with portfolio management team about investment strategies 
      along with the composition of indicative portfolios;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Minimal exposure to interest rate and spread risk;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The capabilities and resources of GSAM as investment advisor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The main driver of the FCR is the high credit quality of the expected 
      portfolio, which will be invested largely in short-term securities rated 
      'F1' or higher. The 'AAA' FCR reflects the vulnerability to losses as a 
      result of defaults, and is based on the actual and prospective weighted 
      average credit quality of the portfolio assets. As such, the portfolio 
      is expected to maintain a weighted average rating of 'AAA', taking into 
      account certain adjustments for the reduced credit risk of high-quality, 
      short-term securities. The prospectus allows for up to 15% in 'F2' 
      exposure; however, the portfolio managers have represented that they do 
      not anticipate actively utilizing this investment bucket. If the fund 
      invests in securities that are rated 'F2' or are unrated, this could 
      likely result in negative rating pressure to the fund's credit rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The main drivers of the fund volatility rating are the stability of the 
      portfolio's market risk profile, as reflected by the short-dated nature 
      of the assets as mandated by the prospectus. The 'V1' fund volatility 
      rating reflects the fund's low market risk, available liquidity, and 
      capacity to return stable principal value to meet anticipated cash flow 
      requirements, even in adverse interest rate environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CREDIT QUALITY AND DIVERSIFICATION
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on a pro forma portfolio, the weighted average credit quality of 
      the fund, as measured by Fitch's weighted average rating factor (WARF), 
      was 0.18, which corresponds to an 'AAA' FCR as per Fitch published bond 
      fund criteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund will seek to generate current income while maintaining an 
      emphasis of preservation of capital and liquidity by investing in a 
      broad range of high quality, U.S. dollar-denominated money market and 
      other fixed income instruments, including U.S. Government Securities, 
      obligations of U.S. banks, corporate notes, commercial paper and other 
      short-term obligations of U.S. companies, states, municipalities and 
      other entities, fixed and floating rate asset backed securities and 
      repurchase agreements. The fund may also invest in U.S. dollar 
      denominated obligations issued or guaranteed by foreign banks, companies 
      and governments. Additionally, the fund may invest up to 10% in highly, 
      rated shorter dated structured finance securities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund is mandated by prospectus to invest at least 85% of its total 
      assets in securities that are rated, at the time of purchase, in the 
      highest short-term credit rating category by at least one NRSRO, 'F1' by 
      Fitch, or, if unrated, determined by the Investment Adviser to be of 
      comparable credit quality at the time of purchase. The remainder will 
      carry a minimum short-term credit rating of 'F2' by Fitch. The fund may 
      also invest up to 10% of its total assets (at the time of purchase) in 
      illiquid securities including, but not limited to, term repurchase 
      agreements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund is also required to maintain portfolio diversification. The 
      fund may not invest more than 5% in any single issuer except that the 
      fund may invest up to 25% of the value of its total assets in the 
      securities of a single issuer for up to three business days (not 
      applicable to cash and certain other investments).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MATURITY PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund will manage its market risk by maintaining a dollar-weighted 
      average portfolio maturity (WAM) that does not exceed approximately nine 
      months and a dollar-weighted average portfolio life (WAL) that does not 
      exceed approximately one year, in accordance with the fund's prospectus. 
      The fund will invest in securities that have remaining maturities of two 
      years or less at the time of purchase, with limited exceptions where a 
      security has maturity shortening features. Floating rate and variable 
      rate securities must have remaining maturities of three years or less at 
      the time of purchase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LIQUIDITY PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To limit liquidity risk, as per its stated prospectus, the fund will 
      seek to invest at least 10% of its assets in weekly liquid securities. 
      Given the short-dated nature of the portfolio duration, along with the 
      high allocation to 'AAA' securities (which receive a 0.00 spread factor 
      under Fitch's analytical framework for determining fund volatility 
      ratings), the market risk of the portfolio is viewed as consistent with 
      a 'V1' fund volatility rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INVESTMENT ADVISOR
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSAM is an affiliate of Goldman Sachs Group (rated 'A/F1' by Fitch). 
      GSAM manages assets on behalf of institutions and individuals through a 
      variety of equity, fixed income, cash management and alternative 
      investment products. Fitch views GSAM's investment advisory 
      capabilities, resource commitment, operational controls, corporate 
      governance, and compliance procedures as consistent with the rating 
      assigned to the fund.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality 
      or market risk profiles of the fund. A material decrease in portfolio 
      credit quality could result in the FCR being lowered, while a material 
      increase in portfolio duration could result in fund volatility ratings 
      being lowered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For example, Fitch utilized stress analysis to test the credit quality 
      of the indicative portfolio against the fund's prospectus for credit 
      quality. If the fund utilizes the flexibility provided in the prospectus 
      to invest in 'F2' or unrated exposure there is an appreciable decline in 
      credit quality. If the fund utilizes the full 15% 'F2' bucket the fund's 
      WARF would likely decline to a level in the 'AA' category.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects to receive bi-monthly portfolio holdings information 
      including credit quality, market value and duration of the individual 
      securities, from the fund's administrator to conduct surveillance 
      against ratings guidelines and maintain its bond fund rating.

      Fitch does not rate the $38,303,883 non-rated class or the $69,425,883 
      interest-only class X-C. Class X-B has been withdrawn from the deal 
      structure since Fitch issued its expected ratings on Feb. 11, 2014. The 
      classes above reflect the final ratings and deal structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 51 loans secured by 83 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $957.6 million as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; Redwood Commercial 
      Mortgage Corporation; Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC; and RAIT 
      Funding, LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 72.7% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis on 71.9%, and asset summary reviews on 71.9% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.16x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 100.4%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 9.1%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 6.8% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: This transaction has slightly lower leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate deals. The pool's Fitch LTV of 100.4% is 
      below the 2013 average of 101.6%. However, excluding the credit opinion 
      loan, the pool's Fitch LTV is 103.5%. The pool's Fitch DSCR of 1.16x is 
      below the 2013 average of 1.29x. The conduit DSCR is 1.15x, excluding 
      the credit opinion loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated by loan size and 
      sponsor than average transactions from 2013, as evidenced by a loan 
      concentration index (LCI) of 479 and sponsor concentration index (SCI) 
      of 479. Also the 10 largest loans represent 58.6% of the total pool 
      balance, which is higher than the average 2013 top 10 concentration of 
      54.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High Retail Concentration: The pool has an above-average concentration 
      of retail properties at 52.4%; six of the 10 largest assets are retail 
      properties. The average retail concentration in 2013 was 33.2%. The 
      largest property type is retail (52.4%), followed by multifamily (13.9%) 
      and hotel (11.9%).
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, Miami International 
      Mall (10.4%), has a Fitch rating of 'BBB-sf' on a stand-alone basis. The 
      loan is collateralized by a super-regional mall in Miami, FL. This loan 
      participation is a $100 million, controlling pari passu portion of a 
      $160 million loan.

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMBB 2014-C18 pool could withstand a 
      62.0% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 19.6% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing a $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 69.4% decline in value and 
      an approximately 35.3% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.

      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Procurement Outsourcing market to grow 
      at a CAGR of 23.14 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key 
      factors contributing to this market growth is the significant cost 
      reduction. The Global Procurement Outsourcing market has also been 
      witnessing the changing pricing models. However, the lack of domain 
      understanding could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this market space are Accenture plc, IBM 
      Corp., Xchanging plc, and Xerox Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The other vendors mentioned in the report are Procurian Inc., Cap Gemini

      Ltd., and TCS Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the IT Services team said: 
      'BPO vendors worldwide have employed various pricing models to meet the 
      requirements and changing expectations of clients. Initially, a simple 
      model that was built on simple human resources replacement was 
      practiced. This led to the widespread use of the pricing per FTE model, 
      i.e., the cost to the company per employee. Another pricing model, the T 
      and M model, which involves service providers charging for human 
      resources employed per unit of time, was considered while signing 
      contracts.'
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Feb 28 (IFR/RLPC) - JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon
delivered a confident message at the bank's global high-yield
conference this week, telling attendees it would be no more
cautious than any other Wall Street bank when it comes to
lending, according to investors present at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the bank's decision not to extend a revolving credit
facility for Freescale Semiconductor earlier this month,
a move confirmed by two market sources, appeared to send a very
different message to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was deemed an unusual decision mainly because revolvers
are usually private deals with relationship banks. By not
extending the maturity of the revolver, JP Morgan 
passed up fees, which some bankers said did not make sense as it
still had to honor the existing facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revolver got done - and at a larger size. Citigroup,
Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Morgan
Stanley all committed to the deal, which was increased by up to
USD50m to a total of up to USD450m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision demonstrates how carefully banks are
scrutinizing which loans, and how many, they will commit to -
and there is clearly a ripple effect from the leveraged lending
guidance issued about a year ago by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some reckon JP Morgan made the correct bet on Freescale,
which was taken private by sponsors Blackstone, Carlyle, TPG and
Permira in 2006 in one of the biggest leveraged buyouts of all
time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the company listed five years later, its leverage
remains high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You could say JP Morgan has been smart," said one senior
banker at a rival bank. "Maybe it made a judgment and thought
the company was not a big client, and therefore, not worth
doing. The bank's the largest underwriter of leveraged loans in
the market, so this is only natural."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freescale and its private equity owners were either not
immediately available or declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUBSTANDARD REPORT CARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rationale behind JP Morgan's decision, the sources said,
was that the loan could have been considered "substandard" - one
of the definitions that regulators have applied to "criticized"
or "non-pass" loans under their guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another category - "special mention" - is more common.
Considered less risky, those loans are also less likely to rile
regulators, bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a bit like a report card. If you're going to have bad
marks, you'd rather have more Bs than Cs," said the banker. "The
Freescale revolver, a C grade, was substandard already."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A loan may be criticized if companies are not able to
amortize or repay all of their senior debt from free cashflow or
half of their total debt in five to seven years. Leverage levels
exceeding six times debt to Ebitda after asset sales are also
viewed as problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Moody's latest report on Freescale, even after
it pays down debt with proceeds of a recent share offering,
adjusted debt to Ebitda will still remain in the low seven times
range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines aim to prevent a return to reckless
underwriting practices, but until recently the market believed
regulators would be more focused on new leveraged buyouts. In
fact, the implications of the greater scrutiny are far wider
than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The guidance does capture refinancing, though not
necessarily an amendment," said Tess Virmani, assistant general
counsel at the Loan Syndications and Trading Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the
Comptroller were either not immediately available or declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRUSTRATION BUILDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, some argued JP Morgan was being too conservative,
and said its decision was more about the bank wanting to be seen
to be toeing the line, and a desire to keep out of the headlines
after paying a USD13bn fine last year to settle multiple
government claims over dealings in mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When he was asked at the conference whether JP Morgan would
react differently because of its recent issues, Dimon said he
expected all banks to behave the same," said one investor who
attended the leveraged finance gathering in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, nonetheless, growing annoyance among bankers who
are convinced that regulators have not thought through the whole
process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have said that they don't want us to stop
lending to companies that are in trouble and need financing. But
there are lots of grey areas, and it's very frustrating," said
the banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How this will all play out remains to be seen. The
regulators publish report cards on banks' loans in what is known
as a Shared National Credits Program to help communicate what
are, and what are not, quality loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SNC last year showed criticized and classified assets
remained at elevated levels at 10% and 6.2% respectively in
2013. The volume of criticized assets increased 2.4% to
USD302bn, but as a percentage of total commitments, the
criticized asset rate fell from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One banker said it would be interesting to see the reaction
to fines doled out if banks are too reckless. Others said that
fines were unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the punishment will be fines. There are lots
of ways for regulators to turn up the heat. Just coming into the
bank to meet the risk people, and telling them they are unhappy
would be enough to get banks to stop," said a banker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
on Friday disclosed more regulatory probes into its fixed-income
trading and financial advisory businesses on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Wall Street bank said regulators are looking

as well as its financial advisory services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the prior quarter, its long list of regulatory
investigations, reviews and litigation into matters ranging from
the municipal-bond market to insider trading did not include
those terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also lowered its estimate of legal losses it may
face beyond what it has set aside to $3.6 billion from a
previous estimate of $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

      Adds Sneary, &#8220;We are also excited to be showcasing Interaction Sync&#8482;, 
      the integration we&#8217;ve packaged to specifically connect the power of the 
      data and UI tools in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013, CRM Online, or CRM 
      2011 with the interaction handling capabilities of contact center 
      platforms like Interactive 
      Intelligence&#8217;s Customer Interaction Center in a unified desktop. It 
      brings all the tools needed together in one interface to ensure maximum 
      efficiency of your customer-facing personnel. We&#8217;d love to show you how 
      it could impact your organization&#8217;s ability to deliver great customer 
      experiences, not to mention a chance to win a fabulous mobile agent tool 
      &#8211; a new Microsoft Surface.&#8221;
