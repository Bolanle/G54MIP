&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - In a sumptuous princess ceremony that shut down Disneyland, Mariah Carey and her comedian husband Nick Cannon renewed their weddings vows and celebrated the second birthday of their twins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearing matching Cinderella and Prince Charming-style costumes, and riding in a horse-drawn crystal carriage, the "We Belong Together" singer and the "American Idol" judge tweeted photos and video of the celebration on Tuesday night at the southern California theme park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On our way to renew our vows. I love you Nick Cannon shut down Disneyland," Carey tweeted. "Celebrating our anniversary and dembabies birthday (can you believe they're 2??)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Sleeping Beauty Castle as a backdrop, and in a ceremony themed "Do You Believe in Fairy Tales?," Carey, 43, and Cannon, 32, marked the fifth anniversary of their wedding with a vow renewal. That was followed by a party for some 250 guests, celebrity TV show Entertainment Tonight said in an exclusive report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entertainment Tonight said the reception in the Disney theme park's Fantasyland area was adorned with 15,000 blooms and 10,000 crystals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carey and Cannon married on April 30, 2008, and their twins Moroccan and Monroe were born on the same day in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple have renewed their vows every year, choosing the Eiffel Tower in Paris last year for their celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Jill Serjeant; editing by Chris Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 1 (Reuters) - A Toronto judge halted on Wednesday an
effort to enforce a $19 billion Ecuadorean judgment against U.S.
oil company Chevron Corp in Canada, finding that his
Ontario provincial court was the wrong place for the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is the latest skirmish in a two-decade conflict
between Chevron and residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region
over claims that Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001,
contaminated the area from 1964 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing Chevron's promise to fight the plaintiffs until "hell
freezes over, and then fight it out on the ice," Justice David
Brown of the Ontario court foresaw a "bitter, protracted" battle
that would be costly and time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While Ontario enjoys a bountiful supply of ice for part of
each year, Ontario is not the place for that fight," Brown wrote
in his ruling on Wednesday. "Ontario courts should be reluctant
to dedicate their resources to disputes where, in dollars and
cents terms, there is nothing to fight over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Lenczner, principal lawyer in Toronto for the
Ecuadorean plaintiffs, said they would definitely appeal,
arguing that a multinational company could not be immune from
enforcement in a country where it earns so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron Corp itself earns no money," he said in a
statement. "All its earnings and profits come from subsidiaries
including, importantly, Chevron Canada."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Canada's assets are worth more than $12 billion, the
plaintiffs had said, and alongside separate actions in Argentina
and Brazil, they had sought to persuade the Ontario court to
collect the damages awarded to them by the South American court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, has
steadfastly refused to pay, saying the February 2011 ruling by
the court in Lago Agrio was influenced by fraud and bribery. A
related fraud case goes to trial in New York in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the country's
courts can recognize and enforce foreign judgments in cases
where there is a "reasonable and substantial connection" between
the cause of the action and the foreign court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron called Brown's ruling a "significant setback" to the
Ecuadoreans' strategy of seeking enforcement against
subsidiaries that were not parties to the Ecuador case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The plaintiffs should be seeking enforcement in the United
States - where Chevron Corporation resides. In the U.S.,
however, they would be confronted by the fact that eight federal
courts have already found the Ecuador trial tainted by fraud,"
Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, a consulting firm whose work helped lead to the
$19 billion award against Chevron disavowed some environmental
claims used to obtain the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

Statement on Canadian Jurisdictional Decision in Ecuador Enforcement Proceeding&lt;CVX.N&gt;</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chevron Corp. Statement on Canadian Jurisdictional Decision in 
      Ecuador Enforcement Proceeding
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Ontario Superior Court of Justice has stayed (see 
      opinion here) an action initiated by a group of Ecuadorian 
      plaintiffs seeking to have a judgment of an Ecuadorian court against 
      Chevron Corp. [NYSE: CVX] recognized and enforced in Ontario. In doing 
      so, the court stated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;the plaintiffs have no hope of success in their assertion that the 
      corporate veil of Chevron Canada should be pierced and ignored so that 
      its assets become exigible to satisfy a judgment against its ultimate 
      parent.
			There is no basis in law or fact for such a claim.&#8230; 
      Ontario courts should be reluctant to dedicate their resources to 
      disputes where, in dollar and cents terms, there is nothing to fight 
      over.
			In my view, the parties should take their fight elsewhere 
      to some jurisdiction where any ultimate recognition of the Ecuadorean 
      judgment will have a practical effect.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In response, Chevron Corporation issued the following statement:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased with today&#8217;s decision from Justice Brown.&#160;The Ontario 
      Superior Court ruled that it ought not to entertain the plaintiffs&#8217; 
      claims on the evidence before the court. This is a significant setback 
      to the Ecuadorian plaintiffs&#8217; worldwide enforcement strategy given that 
      it is premised on seeking to enforce the judgment against assets of 
      Chevron Corporation subsidiaries that were not even parties to the 
      Ecuadorian litigation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The plaintiffs should be seeking enforcement in the United States &#8211; 
      where Chevron Corporation resides. In the U.S., however, they would be 
      confronted by the fact that eight federal courts have already found the 
      Ecuador trial tainted by fraud.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile, Chevron Corp. has made additional notable progress in the 
      legal proceedings in the United States exposing the fraudulent nature of 
      the plaintiffs&#8217; judgment. This evidence further demonstrates that the 
      judgment is illegitimate and should be unenforceable in any court that 
      respects the rule of law. Evidence of the plaintiffs&#8217; fraud includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A former Ecuadorian judge has admitted 
        his role in orchestrating the fraudulent judgment against Chevron and 
        a half-million-dollar bribery scheme.
      
			
        Stratus Consulting, the lead environmental consultants to the 
        Ecuadorian plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers, provided sworn declarations (here 
        and here), 
        highlighting the lack of scientific merit to the plaintiffs&#8217; damage 
        claims.
      
			
        Another of the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers&#8217; environmental consultants, Dr. 
        Charles Calmbacher, has testified 
        that plaintiffs&#8217; evidence was being falsified from the very outset of 
        the trial.
      
			
        Litigation hedge fund Burford Capital has provided a sworn 
        declaration outlining the firm&#8217;s knowledge of the plaintiffs&#8217; 
        lawyers&#8217; misconduct, testifying that the proceeding is irredeemably 
        tainted by fraud.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corp. remains committed to holding the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers 
      accountable for their misconduct and demonstrating the judgment is the 
      product of a corrupted judiciary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Note to Editors:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corp. is defending itself against false allegations that it is 
      responsible for alleged environmental and social harms in the Oriente 
      region of Ecuador. Chevron never conducted oil production operations in 
      Ecuador, and its subsidiary Texaco Petroleum Co. (&#8220;TexPet&#8221;) fully 
      remediated its share of environmental impacts arising from oil 
      production operations, before leaving Ecuador in 1992. After the 
      remediation was certified by all agencies of the Ecuadorian government 
      responsible for oversight, TexPet received a complete release from 
      Ecuador's national, provincial, and municipal governments that 
      extinguished all claims before Chevron acquired TexPet in 2001. All 
      legitimate scientific evidence exonerates Chevron and proves that the 
      remediated sites pose no significant risks to human health or the 
      environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has named Julian Salisbury to become head of its Global Special Situations Group, as current head Jason Brown retires, according to memos sent on Wednesday that were obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salisbury, a partner and managing director who now heads the group's European operation, will move from London to New York for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Special Situations Group is known on Wall Street as one of Goldman's most profitable operations. It invests the bank's own money and sometimes client money in stocks, bonds and loans to distressed companies in hopes of earning profits through a restructuring or turn-around plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the group is managed by Goldman's securities unit, profits from the business flow into the bank's Investing and Lending earnings segment, which reflects money the bank earns from investing and lending its own capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Special Situations Group - often referred to by the acronym SSG - has received more attention in recent years because of the Volcker rule, which prevents banks from trading for their own account and limits banks' investments in hedge funds and private-equity funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a final Volcker rule has not been released by regulators, Goldman has made some changes to the business to comply with what it expects the rule to say. For instance, it has scaled back short-term bets to make its investments longer-term in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Special Situations Group has been run by a succession of prominent bankers, including co-founder Mark McGoldrick, who left Goldman in 2007 to found Mount Kellett Capital Management with another former executive from the business. McGoldrick left Goldman after receiving a $70 million bonus that he thought was too small, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, who is also a partner and managing director based in Asia, took over leadership of the operation in 2011 when its previous head, Richard Ruzika, retired. Ruzika had been global head of commodities trading and a close friend of Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's tax authority faces a court challenge on Thursday over a deal with Goldman Sachs worth an estimated 10 million pounds ($15.5 million) to the U.S. bank, a case aimed at pressuring the government into tougher action against corporate tax avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge by activist group UK Uncut Legal Action stems from public anger in Britain about how big and powerful firms succeed in paying less tax than many ordinary people struggling to cope with a stagnating economy and government spending cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerns a settlement reached in 2010 between Goldman Sachs and the tax authority (HMRC), to end a long-running dispute over a now banned tax avoidance scheme involving the payment of bonuses to UK staff via an offshore tax haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Uncut Legal Action wants the High Court to declare the settlement, which allowed Goldman Sachs to pay the principal it owed but not the interest that had accrued during a five-year battle with HMRC, as unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activist group labels the settlement a "sweetheart deal", a term rejected by the tax authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk for Goldman Sachs is further damage to its image in Britain after a public outcry in January caused it to scrap plans to delay paying bonuses to its bankers to make the most of an income tax cut for high earners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In financial terms, the disputed $15 million is a drop in the ocean for a bank that paid its employees $12.9 billion in compensation and benefits last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At a time when the government is making huge, unjust cuts to public spending, the rich must pay their fair share," said Murray Worthy, director of UK Uncut Legal Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The High Court hearing into the Goldman Sachs deal is a judicial review expected to last one day. The court will reserve judgment until a later date. Goldman Sachs, which will not be an active participant in the case, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time of budget austerity, revelations about the low tax bills of companies ranging from Vodafone (VOD.L) to Starbucks (SBUX.O) have caused widespread outrage in Britain, putting pressure on the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance minister George Osborne has called aggressive tax avoidance "morally repugnant" but critics say his new General Anti-Avoidance Rule is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to comment on the case, HMRC pointed to a 2012 report by the National Audit Office (NAO) that said five big business tax settlements including the Goldman deal were "reasonable" in that HMRC may have received less if it had litigated and lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.6425 British pounds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; additional reporting by Lauren LaCapra in New York; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* High Court to examine disputed 2010 tax settlement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Activists say taxman unlawfully saved Goldman $15 million&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Corporate tax avoidance a hot issue in Britain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Estelle Shirbon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Britain's tax authority faces a
court challenge on Thursday over a deal with Goldman Sachs worth
an estimated 10 million pounds ($15.5 million) to the U.S. bank,
a case aimed at pressuring the government into tougher action
against corporate tax avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge by activist group UK Uncut Legal Action stems
from public anger in Britain about how big and powerful firms
succeed in paying less tax than many ordinary people struggling
to cope with a stagnating economy and government spending cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerns a settlement reached in 2010 between
Goldman Sachs and the tax authority (HMRC), to end a
long-running dispute over a now banned tax avoidance scheme
involving the payment of bonuses to UK staff via an offshore tax
haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Uncut Legal Action wants the High Court to declare the
settlement, which allowed Goldman Sachs to pay the principal it
owed but not the interest that had accrued during a five-year
battle with HMRC, as unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activist group labels the settlement a "sweetheart
deal", a term rejected by the tax authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk for Goldman Sachs is further damage to its image in
Britain after a public outcry in January caused it to scrap
plans to delay paying bonuses to its bankers to make the most of
an income tax cut for high earners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In financial terms, the disputed $15 million is a drop in
the ocean for a bank that paid its employees $12.9 billion in
compensation and benefits last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At a time when the government is making huge, unjust cuts
to public spending, the rich must pay their fair share," said
Murray Worthy, director of UK Uncut Legal Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The High Court hearing into the Goldman Sachs deal is a
judicial review expected to last one day. The court will reserve
judgment until a later date. Goldman Sachs, which will not be an
active participant in the case, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time of budget austerity, revelations about the low tax
bills of companies ranging from Vodafone to Starbucks
 have caused widespread outrage in Britain, putting
pressure on the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition
government to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance minister George Osborne has called aggressive tax
avoidance "morally repugnant" but critics say his new General
Anti-Avoidance Rule is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to comment on the case, HMRC pointed to a 2012 report
by the National Audit Office (NAO) that said five big business
tax settlements including the Goldman deal were "reasonable" in
that HMRC may have received less if it had litigated and lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's near 70-year-old Pegasus oil pipeline leaked a small amount of crude into a residential yard in Ripley County, Missouri on Tuesday, a month after the same pipe spewed thousands of barrels of crude in Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;

      Multigrade SAE 15W-40 and Delo Extended Life Coolant to protect its 
      engines. After a complete engine teardown and inspection of one of the 
      Cat 3516 engines following 18,600+ hours of operation, PTNNT found the 
      engine components in &#8220;pristine condition&#8221; with minimal wear.

      coolants, today released a case study highlighting the performance of 
      Delo 400 Multigrade SAE 15W-40 at the ASARCO Ray copper mine in Arizona.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ASARCO&#8217;s Ray copper mine operates a fleet of 39 haul trucks, 21 of which 
      are Liebherr T 282s. These 400-ton ultra-class trucks have 3600 horse 
      power engines and operate 22 hours a day, seven days a week, in some of 
      the South West&#8217;s harshest conditions. Given the negative financial 
      impact of equipment complications, ASARCO has implemented a preventative 
      maintenance program that includes the use of Delo 400 Multigrade SAE 
      15W-40 diesel engine oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After inspecting one of the facility&#8217;s 20V MTU 4000 engines that had 
      delivered 21,900 hours of service with 500 hour drain intervals, the 
      engine components were found to be in &#8220;excellent conditions.&#8221; The 
      combination of the MTU engine, with good maintenance practices, and the 
      use of Delo 400 Multigrade allowed ASARCO to increase engine life and 
      achieve significant cost savings per engine per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Walter Energy Announces First Quarter 2013 
      Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company Reports 9% Increase in Met Coal Sales Volumes Compared to 
      the Fourth Quarter of 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Adjusted EBITDA Improves to $32.0 Million
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Improved Operating Performance Reflects a 12% Sequential Increase 
      in Met Coal Production Volumes and a 12% Reduction in Met Coal Cash Cost 
      of Sales per Ton
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Recent Debt Offering Enhances Liquidity and Extends Debt Maturities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE:WLT) (TSX:WLT), a leading, publicly traded 
      &#8220;pure-play&#8221; producer of metallurgical (met) coal for the global steel 
      industry, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 
      2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenues were $491 million in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of 
      3% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Revenues declined from $632 million 
      in the first quarter of 2012, due to industry-wide lower metallurgical 
      coal prices. The Company reported a net loss of $49.4 million, or a 
      $0.79 loss per diluted share in the first quarter, compared to a net 
      loss of $71.0 million, or a $1.13 loss per diluted share in the fourth 
      quarter 2012 and compared to net income of $40.6 million, or $0.65 per 
      diluted share in the first quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first quarter of 2013 loss includes charges of $4.9 million, net of 
      tax, or $0.08 per share related to curtailing production at the Willow 
      Creek mine and $4.4 million, net of tax, or $0.07 per share primarily 
      related to proxy contest expenses. Excluding these charges and 
      adjustments described in the Company&#8217;s &#8220;Reconciliation of Non-GAAP 
      Financial Measures,&#8221; the first quarter 2013 adjusted net loss was $40.1 
      million, or a $0.64 loss per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA was 
      $32.0 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the first quarter, we made continued progress on our key strategic 
      initiatives, most notably on our aggressive cost reduction efforts,&#8221; 
      said Walt Scheller, Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;While we have seen 
      stronger demand in 2013, met coal pricing has improved only marginally, 
      and the recovery in the global economy and metallurgical coal markets 
      remains uncertain. We remain focused on operating safely, further 
      reducing costs, carefully managing capital spending, improving liquidity 
      and reducing our debt levels as we position the Company to benefit when 
      markets recover.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Metallurgical Sales Volume and Pricing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First quarter of 2013 met coal sales volume, including both hard coking 
      coal (HCC) and low-volatility (low-vol) PCI, was 2.8 million metric tons 
      (MMTs), an increase of 17% and 9%, respectively, compared to first 
      quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2012. HCC sales volume was 2.4 
      MMTs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 1.9 MMTs and 2.0 MMTs in 
      the first quarter of 2012 and fourth quarter of 2012, respectively. 
      Low-vol PCI sales volume was 0.4 MMTs compared to 0.5 MMTs in both the 
      prior year comparable period and the fourth quarter of 2012. In the 
      first quarter of 2013, met coal sales tonnage was approximately 88% of 
      total coal sales volume.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Overall in the first quarter, pricing strengthened. Average realized met 
      coal pricing improved 2% as compared to the fourth quarter 2012. The 
      average first quarter 2013 selling price of HCC (primarily low-vol and 
      mid-vol) was $154 per metric ton (MT), which was slightly higher than 
      the fourth quarter&#8217;s average price of $152 per MT and significantly less 
      than first quarter 2012 average price of $225 per MT. The average 
      selling price for low-vol PCI was $139 per MT as compared to $128 per MT 
      in the prior quarter and $188 per MT in the prior year comparable 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Metallurgical Coal Production
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Met coal production was 2.8 MMTs in the first quarter of 2013, comprised 
      of 2.3 MMTs of HCC and 0.5 MMTs of low-vol PCI. Met coal production 
      increased 12% from the 2.5 MMTs produced in the fourth quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First quarter 2013 met coal production in the Company&#8217;s U.S. Operations 
      segment increased to 1.7 MMTs compared to 1.5 MMTs in the fourth quarter 
      2012, despite the impact of two longwall moves during the quarter. Our 
      Canadian and U.K. Operations segment increased met coal production to 
      1.0 MMTs compared to 0.9 MMTs in the fourth quarter 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Metallurgical Coal Cash Cost of Sales
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consolidated cash cost of sales for HCC was $120 per MT in the first 
      quarter compared to $124 per MT in the fourth quarter of 2012. In the 
      U.S. Operations segment, the cash cost of sales for HCC decreased to 
      $110 per MT in the first quarter, from $118 per MT in the fourth quarter 
      of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cash cost of sales for low-vol PCI at the Company&#8217;s Brule mine was $122 
      per MT in the first quarter of 2013, compared with $165 and $159 in the 
      fourth quarter 2012 and first quarter 2012, respectively. The 
      substantial improvement in costs primarily reflects cost reduction 
      initiatives including the conversion of the mine from 
      contractor-operated to owner-operated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Willow Creek mine reduced its costs in the first quarter as a result 
      of improved productivity, lower spending and lower LCM charges. Cost of 
      sales per ton declined by 51% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 and 
      65% compared to the first quarter of 2012. However, the mine&#8217;s cost 
      structure remains high, and due to the current weak met coal pricing 
      environment the Company has previously announced that it would curtail 
      production at Willow Creek. The Company expects that the ongoing costs 
      at the mine will not be significant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Thermal Coal Sales and Production
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sales of thermal coal totaled approximately 0.4 MMT in the first quarter 
      2013, a decline of approximately 42% from fourth quarter 2012. Thermal 
      coal production was also lower in the first quarter, down 20%, from the 
      fourth quarter, primarily due to difficult mining conditions at the 
      Company&#8217;s North River mine. These conditions and the related reduced 
      production resulted in an increase to cash cost of sales of 
      approximately $37 per MT during first quarter 2013 compared to the 
      fourth quarter of 2012. As previously announced, the Company expects to 
      close this mine earlier than previously planned and anticipates this 
      closure to occur before year-end. The Company expects that the 
      performance of the mine will return to more normal levels for the 
      remainder of its life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Other Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses totaled $30.7 
      million in the first quarter 2013. Despite the inclusion of $6.8 million 
      in pre-tax expenses primarily related to the proxy contest, SGA for the 
      quarter was only slightly higher than fourth quarter 2012 SGA of $28.9 
      million and was down 15% from the first quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interest expense for the first quarter 2013 totaled $52.6 million 
      compared to $49.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Both periods 
      included accelerated amortization of debt expense totaling approximately 
      $6.0 million related to the prepayment of term debt using the proceeds 
      from the fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013 debt 
      offerings. Cash interest totaled $40 million in the first quarter, 
      compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Restructuring charges in the first quarter totaled $7.4 million and 
      relate to the previously announced curtailment of operations at Willow 
      Creek in the Canadian and U.K. Operations segment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capital Expenditures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walter Energy continues to focus on managing capital spending carefully. 
      The Company&#8217;s capital expenditures were $34 million for the first 
      quarter of 2013, a decrease of 43% and 72% from fourth quarter of 2012 
      and first quarter of 2012, respectively. For the full year 2013, the 
      Company has lowered its capital spending estimate to approximately $170 
      million from the original estimate of $220 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Liquidity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the end of the first quarter of 2013, available liquidity was $560 
      million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $236 million plus

			Safety and Stewardship Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walter Energy&#8217;s emphasis on safety continues to show results as the 
      majority of locations are achieving lower total reportable injury rates. 
      The Company&#8217;s reportable injury rate in the Canadian and U.K. Operations 
      segment has decreased 80% compared to the first quarter of 2012. 
      Company-wide, the total of all injuries (Reportable and Non-reportable) 
      was down 27.3% in the first quarter of 2013 versus the same period in 
      2012, with Reportable injuries down 34.8% for the quarter. The Total 
      Reportable Incident Rate was down 10% in the first quarter of 2013 
      compared with the first quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While the Company does not provide earnings guidance, it does provide 
      directional commentary and observations on key areas of the business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sales price per ton for met coal is expected to be slightly higher in 
      the second quarter compared with the first quarter, with met coal sales 
      volumes expected to be in line with the first quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company expects to lower its per ton met coal cost of production and 
      cost of sales in the second quarter of 2013 by more than 5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Overall earnings, adjusted EBITDA and cash flows are expected to 
      significantly improve in the second quarter compared to the first 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Use of Non-GAAP Measures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This release contains the use of certain U.S. non-GAAP (Generally 
      Accepted Accounting Principles) measures. These non-GAAP measures are 
      provided as supplemental information for financial measures prepared in 
      accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures 
      provide additional insights into the performance of the Company, and 
      they reflect how management analyzes Company performance and compares 
      that performance against other companies. These non GAAP measures may 
      not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other 
      entities. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is provided in 
      the financial section of this release.

      or steel demand; prolonged or dramatic shortages or difficulties in coal 
      production; our customer&#8217;s refusal to honor or renew contracts; our 
      ability to collect payments from our customers; inherent risks in coal 
      mining such as weather patterns and conditions affecting production, 
      geological conditions, equipment failure and other operational risks 
      associated with mining; title defects preventing us from (or resulting 
      in additional costs for) mining our mineral interests; concentration of 
      our mining operations in limited number of areas; a significant 
      reduction of, or loss of purchases by, our largest customers; 
      unavailability of cost-effective transportation for our coal; 
      availability, performance and costs of railroad, barge, truck and other 
      transportation; disruptions or delays at the port facilities we use; 
      risks associated with our reclamation and mine closure obligations, 
      including failure to obtain or renew surety bonds; significant increase 
      in competitive pressures and foreign currency fluctuations; significant 
      cost increases and delays in the delivery of raw materials, mining 
      equipment and purchased components; availability of adequate skilled 
      employees and other labor relations matters; inaccuracies in our 
      estimates of our coal reserves; estimates concerning economically 
      recoverable coal reserves; greater than anticipated costs incurred for 
      compliance with environmental liabilities or limitations on our 
      abilities to produce or sell coal; our ability to attract and retain key 
      personnel; future regulations that increase our costs or limit our 
      ability to produce coal; new laws and regulations to reduce greenhouse 
      gas emissions that impact the demand for our coal reserves; adverse 
      rulings in current or future litigation; inability to access needed 
      capital; events beyond our control may result in an event of default 
      under one or more of our debt instruments; availability of licenses, 
      permits, and other authorizations may be subject to challenges; risks 
      associated with our reclamation and mine closure obligations; failure to 
      meet project development and expansion targets; risks associated with 
      operating in foreign jurisdictions; risks related to our indebtedness 
      and our ability to generate cash for our financial obligations; 
      downgrade in our credit rating; our ability to identify suitable 
      acquisition candidates to promote growth; our ability to successfully 
      integrate acquisitions; our exposure to indemnification obligations; 
      volatility in the price of our common stock; our ability to pay regular 
      dividends to stockholders; costs related to our postretirement benefit 
      obligations and workers&#8217; compensation obligations; our exposure to 
      litigation; and other risks and uncertainties including those described 
      in our filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements made by us in 
      this release, or elsewhere, speak only as of the date on which the 
      statements were made. You are advised to read the risk factors in our 
      most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings 
      with the SEC, which are available on our website at www.walterenergy.com 
      and on the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov. 
      New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is 
      impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us or 
      our anticipated results. We have no duty to, and do not intend to, 
      update or revise the forward-looking statements in this release, except 
      as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties,

          Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton is based on reported Cost of 
          Sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel 
          and other similar production and sales cost items but excludes 
          depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash 
          Cost of Production per Ton is based on period costs of mining and 
          includes items such as manpower, fuel and other similar production 
          items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement 
          benefits. Average Cash Cost per Ton are non-GAAP financial measures 
          which are not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted 
          Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental 
          to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures 
          calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe Average Cash Cost per 
          Ton are useful measures of performance and we believe it aids some 
          investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to 
          help analyze our current and future potential performance. Average 
          Cash Cost of Sales per Ton may not be comparable to similarly titled 
          measures used by other companies.

          During the third quarter of 2012, in our Canadian and U.K. 
          operations certain metrics around tons included in production were 
          realigned to align with how we account for production in the U.S. 
          operations. Historically, the Canadian and U.K. operations were not 
          recording tons produced until they were deemed finished goods. We 
          revised this methodology to include all tons mined, no matter if in 
          process or finished, as produced based on a clean coal tonnage 
          equivalent. Our Form 8-K filed on November 5, 2012, includes a 
          reconciliation of production statistics previously presented as 
          compared with the realigned methodology from the Western Coal 
          acquisition date of April 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012.

          EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, 
          interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and depletion 
          expense. EBITDA is a financial measure which is not calculated in 
          conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) 
          and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or 
          superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. 
          We believe that EBITDA is a useful measure as some investors and 
          analysts use EBITDA to compare us against other companies and to 
          help analyze our ability to satisfy principal and interest 
          obligations and capital expenditure needs. EBITDA may not be 
          comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

            Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude 
            restructuring charges, proxy contest expenses and other 
            miscellaneous items. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial 
            performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded 
            from Adjusted EBITDA are significant to a reader in understanding 
            and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA 
            should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to 
            net income, income from operations, cash flows from operations or 
            as a measure of our profitability, liquidity or performance under 
            generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that Adjusted 
            EBITDA presents a useful measure of our ability to incur and 
            service debt based on ongoing operations. Furthermore, analogous 
            measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate our operating 
            performance. Investors should be aware that our presentation of 
            Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures

&lt;p&gt;(Adds information about the group and executives, adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
has named Julian Salisbury to become head of its Global Special
Situations Group, as current head Jason Brown retires, according
to memos sent on Wednesday that were obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salisbury, a partner and managing director who now heads the
group's European operation, will move from London to New York
for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Special Situations Group is known on Wall Street
as one of Goldman's most profitable operations. It invests the
bank's own money and sometimes client money in stocks, bonds and
loans to distressed companies in hopes of earning profits
through a restructuring or turn-around plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the group is managed by Goldman's securities unit,
profits from the business flow into the bank's Investing and
Lending earnings segment, which reflects money the bank earns
from investing and lending its own capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Special Situations Group - often referred to by
the acronym SSG - has received more attention in recent years
because of the Volcker rule, which prevents banks from trading
for their own account and limits banks' investments in hedge
funds and private-equity funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a final Volcker rule has not been released by
regulators, Goldman has made some changes to the business to
comply with what it expects the rule to say. For instance, it
has scaled back short-term bets to make its investments
longer-term in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Special Situations Group has been run by a
succession of prominent bankers, including co-founder Mark
McGoldrick, who left Goldman in 2007 to found Mount Kellett
Capital Management with another former executive from the
business. McGoldrick left Goldman after receiving a $70 million
bonus that he thought was too small, the Wall Street Journal
reported at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, who is also a partner and managing director based in
Asia, took over leadership of the operation in 2011 when its
previous head, Richard Ruzika, retired. Ruzika had been global
head of commodities trading and a close friend of Goldman Chief
Executive Lloyd Blankfein. He died from a stroke a few months
after leaving the bank in May 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one memo, Isabelle Ealet and Pablo Salame, who are
co-heads of Goldman's broader securities business, said Brown
had been instrumental in realigning the Global Special
Situations Group's investment approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salisbury has been head of the European Special Situations
Group and a member of the SSG Global Investment Committee since
2009. Before that he worked in Moscow, expanding business in
Russia and the former Soviet Union. He was a founding member of
the European division of SSG in 2003 and before that was a
distressed debt trader and an accountant at KPMG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was named managing director in 2005 and partner in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman confirmed the content of the memos but
declined further comment.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES May 1 (Reuters) - In a sumptuous princess
ceremony that shut down Disneyland,  Mariah Carey and her
comedian husband Nick Cannon renewed their weddings vows and
celebrated the second birthday of their twins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearing matching Cinderella and Prince Charming-style
costumes, and riding in a horse-drawn crystal carriage, the "We
Belong Together" singer and the "American Idol" judge tweeted
photos and video of the celebration on Tuesday night at the
southern California theme park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On our way to renew our vows. I love you Nick Cannon shut
down Disneyland," Carey tweeted. "Celebrating our anniversary
and dembabies birthday (can you believe they're 2??)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Sleeping Beauty Castle as a backdrop, and in a
ceremony themed "Do You Believe in Fairy Tales?," Carey, 43, and
Cannon, 32, marked the fifth anniversary of their wedding with a
vow renewal. That was followed by a party for some 250 guests,
celebrity TV show Entertainment Tonight said in an exclusive
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entertainment Tonight said the reception in the Disney theme
park's Fantasyland area was adorned with 15,000 blooms and
10,000 crystals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carey and Cannon married on April 30, 2008, and their twins
Moroccan and Monroe were born on the same day in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple have renewed their vows every year, choosing the
Eiffel Tower in Paris last year for their celebration.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's near 70-year-old Pegasus oil pipeline spilled a small amount of crude on Tuesday into a residential yard in Ripley County, Missouri, a month after the same pipe spewed thousands of barrels of crude in Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resident notified the company of the spill after spotting a patch of oil and dead vegetation seven miles south of Doniphan in the southeast of the state, Exxon and state officials said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one barrel of crude leaked and the cleanup is "close to completion", an Exxon spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's spill occurred 200 miles north of Mayflower, Arkansas, where about 5,000 barrels of crude spilled from the Pegasus pipe into a residential area on March 29, prompting a giant clean-up operation that is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mayflower spill stoked a fractious national debate about the effect of shipping increasing amounts of tarry Canadian crude across the United States, including through residential areas and in aging pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pegasus line, which can carry more than 90,000 barrels a day of crude from Illinois to Texas, was built in the late 1940s. It was shut after the Arkansas spill and was not in operation when the Missouri spill occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has not offered a timeline for when Pegasus will restart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The release occurred from the installation of a guide wire for a power line pipe that was installed approximately 30 years ago," a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources said on Wednesday. "The guide wire was located almost directly on top of the pipeline and has worn down over the years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exxon spokeswoman said the cause was under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Edward McAllister and Robert Gibbons in New York; Additional reporting by Arpan Varghese in Bangalore; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil confirmed on
Wednesday that an oil spill occurred Tuesday on its Pegasus
crude pipeline in Ripley County, Missouri, the same line that
ruptured thousands of barrels of oil into an Arkansas
neighborhood at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokeswoman said a resident notified the company of
oil staining on the surface near the pipeline on Tuesday. The
cleanup of the one-barrel leak was near completion, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pipeline was already out of service following a spill in
Mayflower, Arkansas, on March 29, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 1 (Reuters) - An Exxon Mobil Corp oil pipeline

Ripley County, Missouri, on Tuesday, a state official confirmed
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon reported the incident to the Missouri Department of
Natural Resources late on Tuesday afternoon, said department

time of the leak, and had been since Easter weekend at the end
of March, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Pegasus oil pipeline, which runs through Missouri,
was shut on March 29 after a large leak in a residential area in
Arkansas, nearly 200 miles south of Tuesday's spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was as yet unclear whether Tuesday's leak was from the
Pegasus line and Exxon was not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, AK, May 1, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Polar Petroleum Corp. ((OTCBB:POLR) herein after "Polar Petroleum", "Polar" and/or "the Company") is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. David T. Gross to the Company's Advisory Board as Head of Alaskan Exploration. Mr. Gross's 30 years of industry and regional experience will be of great benefit to Polar Petroleum as the Company continues to advance its plans for the exploration, development and production of oil and gas on its North Slope assets in Alaska. [Full profile for Mr. Gross appears further below.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Polar Petroleum's President  CEO, Daniel Walker, commented: "As a newer player in Alaska, we're fortunate to have access to the decades of background that David Gross brings to the table, both in terms of industry know-how and connections. Working together, we will focus on the common goal of building shareholder value by determining and realizing the maximum potential of our Alaskan assets and opportunities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	DAVID T. GROSS &#8211; HEAD OF ALASKAN EXPLORATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	David Gross represents a 30-year career as a geologist and a current focus on the North Slope of Alaska doing geologic analyses and petroleum prospect evaluations, most recently in the Hemi Springs-South Prudhoe area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mr. Gross began his career at Chevron, USA, working on development geology and exploring Louisiana's outer continental shelf and slope. During this time, he mapped and evaluated 2 newly opened deep-water areas, resulting in Chevron being among the first companies to acquire deep water leasehold positions that later were sites of Lower Tertiary oil discoveries (Perdido Fold Belt).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In 1990, Mr. Gross was assigned to the Cook Inlet of Alaska as its Exploration Area Geologist. After evaluating and thinning Chevron's existing leasehold, he developed and had drilled an exploration prospect on the Kustatan Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	After he left Chevron in 1992, Mr. Gross became a consulting geologist. In the Cook Inlet, he played a key role in the development of the Sterling Gas Field; the sale of the leasehold over the future Redoubt Shoal Field; the development of the Catcher's Mitt prospect; the acquisition of PERL leasehold ORR royalties in 2009; and the sale of the entire Donkel/Cade Cook Inlet leasehold to Apache in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mr. Gross received his degrees from the University of Iowa where he specialized in carbonate geology: B.S. 1980 (Major: Geology) and M.S. 1982 (Geology with Thesis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			The Law Firm of Wohl  Fruchter Commences 
      Investigation into the Acquisition of Ebix, Inc. by Goldman Sachs  Co.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The law firm of Wohl  Fruchter LLP is investigating the proposed 
      acquisition of Ebix, Inc. (Ebix) (Nasdaq: EBIX) by an affiliate of 
      Goldman Sachs  Co. (Goldman Sachs).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ebix is a leading provider of software and e-commerce services to the 
      insurance industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On May 1, 2013, Ebix announced that, acting on the recommendation of a 
      special committee, it had agreed to be acquired by an affiliate of 
      Goldman Sachs for $20/share in cash. The acquisition price is a premium 
      of less than 8% over the closing price of EBIX stock on April 30, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, Robin Raina, Ebix&#8217;s Chairman and CEO, and the Rennes 
      Foundation, a large existing shareholder, will continue to be meaningful 
      equity investors in Ebix. Combined, Raina and the Rennes Foundation 
      currently hold approximately 19% of EBIX shares. Both have entered into 
      agreements to vote in favor of the transaction. Rolf Herter, a member of 
      Ebix&#8217;s Board of Directors, is also a director of the Rennes Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wohl  Fruchter&#8217;s investigation concerns the potential unfairness of the 
      consideration being provided to Ebix shareholders, and whether approval 
      of the merger was improperly motivated by conflicts of interest, 
      including Raina&#8217;s and the Rennes Foundation&#8217;s ongoing post-acquisition 
      equity interest in the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Ebix Shareholder Alert: Briscoe Law Firm and Powers Taylor, LLP 
      Investigate Sale to Goldman Sachs Affiliate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Former United States Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Willie 
      Briscoe and the securities litigation firm of Powers 
      Taylor, LLP are investigating the sale of Ebix, Inc. (&#8220;Ebix&#8221;) 
      (Nasdaq: EBIX) to an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs  Co. for shareholders. 
      Under the terms of the proposed sale valued at approximately $820 
      million (including the assumption of debt), Ebix shareholders will only 
      receive $20 for each share of Ebix stock owned, well below at least one 
      analyst&#8217;s estimate of $24.00 per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you are an affected investor, and you want to learn more about the 
      lawsuit or join the action, please contact Willie Briscoe at The Briscoe

      There is no cost or fee to you.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Ebix sale investigation centers on whether Ebix&#8217;s shareholders are 
      receiving adequate compensation for their shares in the proposed deal, 
      whether the transaction undervalues Ebix&#8217;s stock, and whether Ebix&#8217;s 
      board attempted to obtain the highest share price for all shareholders 
      prior to agreeing to the deal. Notably, at least one analyst with Yahoo! 
      Finance has estimated that the true inherent value of Ebix stock could 
      be as high as $24.00 per share. Moreover, Ebix&#8217;s 52-week high is $24.90, 
      well above the proposed sale price. According to shareholder rights 
      attorney Willie Briscoe, &#8220;Due to the size of the deal, analysts&#8217; 
      estimates, the lack of a significant premium and other factors, we 
      believe this transaction may undervalue Ebix&#8217;s stock. Our proposed 
      lawsuit will seek to obtain the highest share price for all 
      shareholders.&#8221;

Enters Into Merger Agreement to be Acquired by an Affiliate of Goldman Sachs for $20 Per Share in Cash&lt;EBIX.O&gt;</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA, May 1, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ebix, Inc., (Nasdaq:EBIX), a leading international supplier of On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the insurance industry, today announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs  Co. ("Goldman Sachs") in a transaction valued at approximately $820 million, including the assumption of any outstanding debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Under the terms of the agreement, Ebix shareholders will receive $20.00 per share in cash. This represents a premium of approximately 18% over Ebix's average daily closing price over the preceding 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"After considering a number of potential alternatives, the Ebix board, acting on the recommendation of a special committee comprised entirely of independent directors, unanimously approved this transaction, which provides significant and immediate value to shareholders," said Robin Raina, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ebix.&#160;"With our market-leading servicing platforms and talented team of insurance and technology professionals, Ebix will be well-positioned as a private company to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives and pursue growth opportunities around the world."&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We have great respect for Ebix and its strong commitment to providing customers with the highest quality of software and E-commerce services in the insurance industry," said Sumit Rajpal, Managing Director, Goldman Sachs. "We look forward to working with the Company and helping it maximize its growth potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The board of directors of Ebix, on the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of independent directors of the board, has approved the merger agreement and has resolved to recommend that Ebix shareholders approve the transaction.&#160;Robin Raina and the Rennes Fondation, which together own approximately 19% of the outstanding common shares, have entered into separate voting agreements under which they have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to vote their respective shares in favor of the proposed transaction.&#160;Robin Raina and the Rennes Fondation will continue to be meaningful equity investors in Ebix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The merger agreement contains a "go-shop" provision under which Ebix may solicit alternative proposals from third parties during the next 45 calendar days on customary terms and conditions for transactions of this nature.&#160;Ebix's special committee, with the assistance of its advisors, will actively solicit acquisition proposals during this period.&#160;There can be no assurances that this process will result in any alternative transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The proposed transaction is subject to antitrust approvals, shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions.&#160;The transaction, which is not conditioned upon financing, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013. At that time, Ebix will become a private company and its shares will no longer be listed on any public exchange.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ebix will be submitting a current report on Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") containing a summary of terms and conditions of the proposed transaction and merger agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Morgan Stanley  Co. LLC acted as financial advisor to the special committee of the board of Ebix and has provided a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction.&#160;Alston  Bird LLP and Richards, Layton  Finger, P.A. acted as legal advisors to the special committee.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Goldman, Sachs  Co. and Credit Suisse AG acted as financial advisors to Goldman Sachs and have provided debt financing commitments for the transaction.&#160;Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP acted as legal advisor to Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;

			Leading provider of capital and risk management solutions to the 
      global insurance market
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global Atlantic Financial Group, a global financial services holding 
      company, announced today that it has completed its separation from The 
      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS). After a successful private 
      placement, Global Atlantic has $1.75 billion of equity and a global 
      shareholder base of over 1,000 investors, including Goldman Sachs. 
      Formerly the Goldman Sachs Reinsurance Group, Global Atlantic has more 
      than $15 billion in assets and approximately 200 employees with offices 
      in New York, Massachusetts, Bermuda and London.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global Atlantic operates through two segments: a U.S.-focused life and 
      annuity reinsurance segment, including the Commonwealth Annuity and Life 
      Insurance Company, and a global property and casualty reinsurance 
      segment operating in London and Bermuda under the Ariel Re brand. The 
      management team that has built and run the business since inception will 
      continue to lead Global Atlantic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Allan S. Levine, Chairman and CEO of Global Atlantic commented, &#8220;We are 
      pleased to have successfully completed the transaction and believe that 
      our new structure and diversified investor base position us well to 
      continue to build our business and serve our clients effectively in a 
      very dynamic market environment. We are pleased that Goldman Sachs will 
      retain a minority stake and, along with our other lead investors, be a 
      key partner in the next phase of our company&#8217;s growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global Atlantic was founded in 2004 at Goldman Sachs and entered the 
      Life and Annuity market by acquiring Commonwealth Annuity and Life 
      Insurance Company (formerly Allmerica Financial) in 2005. The business 
      has successfully grown since then through a series of reinsurance 
      transactions and acquisitions of U.S. life insurance companies. Today, 
      the Global Atlantic Life business is recognized for its innovative 
      insurance, reinsurance and strategic solutions to the life and annuity 
      industry. In 2005, Global Atlantic entered the Property  Casualty 
      business and has since grown this platform with the launch of a Lloyds 
      of London insurance syndicate in 2008 and, the acquisition of the 
      Bermuda-based operations of Ariel Re in 2012. Today the Property  
      Casualty business provides a broad range of solutions to clients for 
      losses caused by natural disasters and other catastrophic events.

      nurturing, and preserving America's diverse culinary heritage and 
      future. A cookbook author and teacher with an encyclopedic knowledge

      cuisine. He helped educate and mentor generations of professional chefs 
      and food enthusiasts, instilling in them the value of wholesome,

			Portland General Electric Announces Solid First Quarter Earnings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR)
			today reported net 
      income of $49 million, or 65 cents per share, for the first quarter of 
      2013. Net income and earnings per share were unchanged from the first 
      quarter of 2012 as lower power costs and decreased storm restoration 
      costs offset a decline in retail energy deliveries. In addition, the 
      impact from an increase in PGE&#8217;s effective tax rate was largely offset 
      by lower interest expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We delivered solid financial results in the first quarter through 
      strong power supply operations and operational excellence,&#8221; said Jim 
      Piro, president and chief executive officer. &#8220;We&#8217;re making excellent 
      progress on our strategic initiatives in 2013, including starting 
      construction on Port Westward 2 and working through the negotiations for 
      selecting the energy, renewable, and seasonal capacity resources from

        General Rate Case&#8212;PGE filed a 2014 General Rate Case in mid-February 
        and the case is currently in the discovery phase. Settlement 
        conferences are scheduled for the end of May and Public Utility 
        Commission of Oregon staff and intervener opening testimony is 
        scheduled to be filed in mid-June. The target date for the Commission 
        decision is mid-December 2013.
      
			
        Request for proposals&#8212;PGE is continuing negotiations with top 
        performing bidders for energy and renewables resources. The final 
        short lists include a mix of power purchase agreements and 
        PGE-ownership options. Final resource selections are expected by 
        mid-2013. In addition, PGE is in the process of negotiating power 
        purchase agreements for seasonal peaking capacity.

			First quarter operating results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues decreased $6 million, or 1 percent, to $473 million in 
      the first quarter of 2013 from $479 million in the first quarter of 2012 
      due to the net effect of the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        $13 million decrease in average retail price primarily driven by lower 
        forecasted power costs as established in the 2013 annual power cost 
        update tariff; and
      
			
        $6 million decrease related to lower volume of retail energy sold and 
        delivered, with total volume down approximately 1 percent from the 
        first quarter of 2012 largely as a result of 2013 having one less day 
        in the quarter due to the leap year in 2012 and the impact of 
        relatively warmer weather during the first quarter of 2013. 
        Residential and commercial volumes were down 1 percent and 3 percent, 
        respectively, which were partially offset by a 2 percent increase in 
        industrial volumes; partially offset by
      
			
        $5 million increase related to the decoupling mechanism, with a $4 
        million potential recovery recorded in the first quarter of 2013 
        compared with a $1 million potential refund recorded in the first 
        quarter of 2012;
      
			
        $3 million increase related to the Company&#8217;s PCAM, as a potential 
        refund was recorded in the first quarter of 2012 related to the 2011 
        PCAM, with no comparable refund recorded in the first quarter of 2013; 
        and
      
			
        $6 million, or 60 percent, increase in wholesale revenues consisting 
        of a 39 percent increase in the volume sold and a 12 percent increase 
        in the average price of wholesale power.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Purchased power and fuel expense decreased $3 million, or 2 percent, to 
      $192 million in the first quarter of 2013 from $195 million in the first 
      quarter of 2012, largely due to a 2 percent decrease in the average 
      variable power cost, with total system load comparable to the first 
      quarter of 2012. The decrease is primarily due to more generation from 
      lower-cost coal-fired resources, partially offset by an increase in the 
      average cost of purchased power and a decrease in energy received from 
      hydro resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Production and distribution expense decreased $2 million, or 4 percent, 
      in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the first quarter of 2012, 
      primarily due to lower delivery system costs resulting from higher storm 
      restoration costs incurred during the first quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interest expense decreased $3 million, or 11 percent, primarily due to a 
      $100 million decrease in the average balance of long-term debt 
      outstanding during the first quarter of 2013 compared with the first 
      quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Income taxes increased $2 million, or 13 percent, in the first quarter 
      of 2013 compared with the first quarter of 2012, reflecting an increase 
      in the company&#8217;s effective tax rate to 26.2 percent from 23.4 percent. 
      The increase was primarily due to a reduction of production tax credits 
      (PTC) resulting from lower forecasted wind generation for 2013 compared 
      to 2012, partially offset by an increase in the PTC rate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			2013 earnings guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE is reaffirming full-year 2013 earnings guidance of $1.85 to $2 per 
      diluted share. Guidance is based on the following assumptions:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Load growth toward the lower end of the 0.5 percent to 1 percent range 
        over weather-adjusted 2012;
      
			
        Hydro conditions slightly below normal, expected wind conditions, and 
        power plants achieving their targeted availability factors;
      
			
        Operating and maintenance costs between $440 million to $460 million;
      
			
        Depreciation expense between $240 million and $250 million;
      
			
        Capital expenditures between $505 million and $525 million, which does 
        not include any potential expenditures related to the energy and 
        renewable resources RFPs; and
      
			
        Port Westward Unit 2 AFUDC (debt and equity) between $5 million and $6 
        million.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's phone chief hates to call the new Nokia Lumia 521 cheap, but the lower-priced smartphone launching in the United States is the company's boldest move yet to win mass market share from leaders Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company has so far focused on putting its Windows Phone software into expensive, high-end devices - chiefly from Nokia and HTC Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new model will go on sale at Walmart later this month at an unsubsidized price under $150, relatively cheap for a new phone running up-to-date software without a long-term contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is an opportunity for us to offer a very high quality device in the mainstream," said Terry Myerson, head of the Windows Phone unit, at Microsoft's campus near Seattle last week. "That's where we've made progress in the last couple of months and it's a strategy we'll continue to explore in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia Lumia 521 went on sale on the Home Shopping Network (HSN) last week, where it has already sold out. The 4G phone, sold overseas as the Nokia 520, is essentially a mid-range phone with some high-end features, such as four-inch touch screen, five megapixel camera and high-definition video display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week the phone will go on sale at less than $150 at Walmart, along with T-Mobile US Inc's $30 per month unlimited data and text plan, which works out much cheaper over the long run than heavily subsidized iPhones and upscale Android devices that generally come with pricy long-term contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early popularity of the Lumia 521 on HSN is a minor boost for Microsoft, whose mobile plans have stuttered and stumbled since Apple's iPhone destroyed its early dominance in the smartphone market in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completely redesigning its software, Microsoft-powered phones now have 3.2 percent of the U.S. smartphone market, compared to 39 percent for Apple and 52 percent for Google Inc's Android system, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, which now only makes smartphones running Windows, sold 5.6 million of its Lumia handsets in the first quarter, up 27 percent from the previous quarter, although that is still dwarfed by 37 million iPhone sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not detail overall Windows phone sales or financials, but did say last quarter that phone-related revenue rose by $259 million, which includes licensing revenue from Android phones, which use some technology patented by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows phones tend to fare better overseas, where they have as much as 20 percent share in some markets such as Mexico and Poland, and almost 7 percent in Britain, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is partly because the role of powerful carriers such as AT Inc and Verizon Wireless, which dominate U.S. phone retail, is less pronounced in overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AT and Verizon have been great partners," said Myerson. "But where the market dynamics are different, and where the operators play a different role, we have done better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy up-front subsidies from AT and Verizon, in return for long-term service contracts, mean U.S. customers can afford the best hardware from Apple and Samsung. Even though Windows phones are also subsidized, Myerson admits it has been hard to break that lock on the home market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (subsidization) is a compelling business model for them. If you are Samsung, Apple, AT or Verizon, it's where everything's working, you are growing share, you are growing profits," said Myerson. "If you are an incumbent with a successful business model, you're not going to be jumping to throw it out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a challenger to those incumbents, Myerson says Microsoft has to differentiate on more than just price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After introducing "killer hardware", he says the next task for Windows phones is to leverage Microsoft's Office and Xbox products to make a genuinely new phone experience, whether as a work tool or advanced toy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we've come near to the full potential," he said. "Those are our two dimensions here, Office and Xbox. We want to bring to life getting work done and bring to life that serious fun, here on this thing in your pocket. That's going to develop over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myerson played down reports that Microsoft was working on a phone of its own, to follow up on its Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nokia's doing a great job," he said. "They really are receiving all of our go-to-market energy right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company has so far focused on putting its Windows Phone software into expensive, high-end devices - chiefly from Nokia and HTC Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new model will go on sale at Walmart later this month at an unsubsidized price under $150, relatively cheap for a new phone running up-to-date software without a long-term contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is an opportunity for us to offer a very high quality device in the mainstream," said Terry Myerson, head of the Windows Phone unit, at Microsoft's campus near Seattle last week. "That's where we've made progress in the last couple of months and it's a strategy we'll continue to explore in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia Lumia 521 went on sale on the Home Shopping Network (HSN) last week, where it has already sold out. The 4G phone, sold overseas as the Nokia 520, is essentially a mid-range phone with some high-end features, such as four-inch touch screen, five megapixel camera and high-definition video display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week the phone will go on sale at less than $150 at Walmart, along with T-Mobile US Inc's $30 per month unlimited data and text plan, which works out much cheaper over the long run than heavily subsidized iPhones and upscale Android devices that generally come with pricy long-term contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early popularity of the Lumia 521 on HSN is a minor boost for Microsoft, whose mobile plans have stuttered and stumbled since Apple's iPhone destroyed its early dominance in the smartphone market in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completely redesigning its software, Microsoft-powered phones now have 3.2 percent of the U.S. smartphone market, compared to 39 percent for Apple and 52 percent for Google Inc's Android system, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, which now only makes smartphones running Windows, sold 5.6 million of its Lumia handsets in the first quarter, up 27 percent from the previous quarter, although that is still dwarfed by 37 million iPhone sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not detail overall Windows phone sales or financials, but did say last quarter that phone-related revenue rose by $259 million, which includes licensing revenue from Android phones, which use some technology patented by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows phones tend to fare better overseas, where they have as much as 20 percent share in some markets such as Mexico and Poland, and almost 7 percent in Britain, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is partly because the role of powerful carriers such as AT Inc and Verizon Wireless, which dominate U.S. phone retail, is less pronounced in overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AT and Verizon have been great partners," said Myerson. "But where the market dynamics are different, and where the operators play a different role, we have done better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy up-front subsidies from AT and Verizon, in return for long-term service contracts, mean U.S. customers can afford the best hardware from Apple and Samsung. Even though Windows phones are also subsidized, Myerson admits it has been hard to break that lock on the home market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (subsidization) is a compelling business model for them. If you are Samsung, Apple, AT or Verizon, it's where everything's working, you are growing share, you are growing profits," said Myerson. "If you are an incumbent with a successful business model, you're not going to be jumping to throw it out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a challenger to those incumbents, Myerson says Microsoft has to differentiate on more than just price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After introducing "killer hardware", he says the next task for Windows phones is to leverage Microsoft's Office and Xbox products to make a genuinely new phone experience, whether as a work tool or advanced toy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we've come near to the full potential," he said. "Those are our two dimensions here, Office and Xbox. We want to bring to life getting work done and bring to life that serious fun, here on this thing in your pocket. That's going to develop over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myerson played down reports that Microsoft was working on a phone of its own, to follow up on its Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nokia's doing a great job," he said. "They really are receiving all of our go-to-market energy right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2001-A
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed four classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corporation, commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2001-A. A detailed list of rating actions follows at 
      the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are based on the expected losses of the one real estate 
      owned (REO) asset remaining in the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 54.1% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 24.1%, including losses already 
      incurred. The pool has experienced $16.7 million (14.7% of the original 
      pool balance) in realized losses to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the April 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 82.5% to $19.9 million from $113.8 million 
      at issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes D 
      through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The REO asset is collateralized by a 795,500 square foot (SF) retail 
      center in Maple Heights, OH, a suburb of Cleveland. The property was 
      foreclosed upon in October 2011. The special servicer reports that they 
      are in negotiations with a potential buyer and are moving forward with a 
      sale contract. The special servicer also reports that the property is 
      cash flowing and that the occupancy and debt service coverage ratio 
      (DSCR) was 62% and 1.03 times (x), respectively, as year-end 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATINGS SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook on the 'BB' rated class D will remain Negative and 
      may be subject to downgrades should realized losses exceed Fitch's 
      expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes and assigns Recovery Estimates (REs) 
      as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.9 million class D at 'BBsf'; Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$3.4 million class E at 'Csf'; RE 95%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.1 million class F at 'Csf'; RE 50% ;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.5 million class G at 'Dsf'; RE 0% .
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-1, A-2, B and C certificates have paid in full. Fitch does 
      not rate the class NR certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the rating 
      on the interest-only class X certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Rolling Educational Tool to Visit New Brunswick and Newfoundland for 
      the First Time
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Canada Limited, the Canadian distributor and seller of the Delo&#174; 
      brand of technologically advanced engine oils, lubricants and coolants, 
      today announced that its Delo Truck will be heading to Canada for the 
      first time this year. The Truck will make 11 appearances &#8211; supporting 
      Chevron lubricant marketers and their customers&#8217; locations &#8211; in Ontario, 
      Quebec, New Brunswick and Newfoundland over a three week period starting 
      May 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Delo Truck is an educational tool that engages customers and 
      initiates dialog on a number of key market issues,&#8221; said Deanna Eckford, 
      area business manager, Chevron Lubricants Canada. &#8220;Chevron is revisiting 
      Eastern Canada this month, with stops in New Brunswick and Newfoundland 
      for the first time, to further its commitment to customers and marketers 
      in the Canadian region. The Delo Truck will visit Western Canada this 
      September. Ultimately, the Delo Truck is designed to help our customers 
      understand the importance of premium performance heavy-duty engine oils, 
      lubricants and coolants. Through these visits, we believe customers will 
      walk away with knowledge to improve revenues through minimized costs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Truck, a rolling ambassador for the Delo brand, was launched in 
      August of 2011. In exhibit mode, the Delo Truck is 6.8 meters wide and 
      has learning stations designed to educate customers and the general 
      public on key market issues, Delo technology and the importance of 
      premium performance heavy-duty engine oils, lubricants and coolants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The centerpiece of the Delo Truck is its 19 learning stations &#8211; most 
      with interactive displays. Along with detailed information on the Delo 
      product family and the brand&#8217;s history, visitors can explore various 
      market topics, including maximizing drain intervals, debunking the 
      semi-synthetic myth and interpreting evolving OEM drain recommendations. 
      Various engine parts are also on display. Included in the display are 
      parts from a 2.4 million kilometer engine teardown that demonstrates the 
      long term durability and an 110,000 km drain interval performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Canada, the company supplies its Delo branded lubricants, coolants 
      and services through Chevron 1st Source Marketers and through 
      most major OE Dealers. There are ten Chevron 1st 
      Source marketers in Canada &#8211; these marketers demonstrate the highest 
      levels of performance and customer satisfaction &#8211; in the country. For a 
      full list of Chevron marketers, please visit www.chevrondelo.com.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG May 3 (Reuters) - Five former proprietary trading
desk bankers at J.P. Morgan in Singapore have started a new
firm, linking up with one of Canada's largest mutual funds to
launch the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhimant Shah, 41, the former head of proprietary trading at
J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co in Singapore, told Reuters that
the plan is to launch two funds investing in credit markets. The
funds will also bet on foreign exchange, equity indices and
interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators have effectively ended the traditional
practice of banks trading their own money through prop desks,
prompting hordes of traders to strike out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the J.P. Morgan Singapore spin-out unique is the
support it is getting from Canada's Mackenzie Investments, the
$64 billion money manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional Western asset managers such as Aberdeen Asset
Management plc and BlackRock Inc, in their
efforts to expand in Asia, have followed the standard path of
launching mutual funds and other products familiar to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackenzie, by contrast, is hooking up with the prop team to
plant the Canadian group's flag in Asia, a strategy that comes
with heftier risks and rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were looking for a strong and stable institutional
backing," said Shah, who is leading the spin-out, which will
remain based in Singapore and be named Mackenzie Investments
Pte. Ltd. "And Mackenzie was looking to foray into the Asia
credit space along with its strong macro capabilities so as to
potentially build an absolute returns platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackenzie's funds will not be available to retail investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah did not disclose the initial investments in the funds
but people with direct knowledge of the plan said Mackenzie's
backing includes a $100 million start-up capital for a long only
fixed income fund, and $20 million for a long/short hedge fund
that will combine credit and macro strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CREDIT AND MACRO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macro hedge funds focus on major economic trends and events
and place bets anywhere they see value, including stocks, bonds,
currencies, commodities, and derivatives markets. Such funds
collected a net $18 billion last year, according to data from
Eurekahedge, the most by any hedge fund category in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit and macro hedge funds in Asia such as Double Haven,
Dymon Asia Macro and Fortress Asia Macro have raised hundreds of
millions of dollars from investors in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with interest rates at record lows and yields falling,
investors are wary of taking a directional view on credit at
these levels and are layering it with other asset classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As of now, no doubt, things are very tight overall in the
credit markets," said Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's why we have a mix of credit and macro strategies.
This is how we will look to manage the downside more proactively
as opposed to just running it as a pure long credit strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit funds have benefited from a worldwide low-growth
environment. The Eurekahedge Asia fixed income index rose 12
percent in 2012, outperforming a 10 percent rise in the regional
long/short equity hedge funds and 4 percent gain in macro funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah is joined by former colleague Vasanth Arunagiri, who
invested in the credit market at JPMorgan in Singapore, and 
Rahul Sinha, an Asian macro trader at the Wall Street bank.
Carmine Di Conno and Alex Tesei, who traded global macro at the
bank, are other team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 2 (IFR) - Mexican media giant Televisa began meeting US
investors this week to pitch its first international bond in
four years, offering a peso-denominated deal aimed at both the
domestic and foreign markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest media company in the Spanish-speaking world,
Group Televisa is pitching a Ps6.5 billion (US$536m) 30-year
bond this time round, unlike its last dollar offering in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is hoping to get both local and
international accounts interested in the deal, which is being
led by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers have long been trying to tempt Televisa - which has
a stake in US Spanish-language network Univision - to come back
to market, but the company has insisted on a deal in pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of bankers have been pitching them, but they only
wanted to see peso-denominated debt," one debt capital markets
banker told IFR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have been looking to do a peso-denominated deal for
many years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa came to market in 2007 with a euro-peso deal aimed
at the foreign market, selling a Ps4.5bn 30-year that priced at
par to yield 8.49% - or 67 basis points (bp) over Mexican
domestic government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those bonds are now trading at around 6.50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT EASY TO DO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latin American issuers of debt often have difficulties
coming up with a deal that is large and liquid enough to appeal
to local and international accounts alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it wasn't until last year that wireless giant
America Movil helped create the regulatory framework
that allowed its bonds to trade both in Mexico and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helped pave the way for Televisa. But even so, the bona
fide blue-chip, a Spanish-language media powerhouse with
Baa1/BBB+/BBB+ credit ratings, is sill expected to have to pay a
so-called "liquidity premium" - that is, pay more in interest -
to lure investors into buying the new bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At around just US$500m in size - and with the long 30-year
maturity - the new issue will not be as readily liquid as
investors would like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the deal will be less liquid than December's issue from
America Movil, which returns to the market almost quarterly to
top up liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they are going to do a one-off trade, the bigger
question is, aside from the (tenor), how much are they going to
pay for illiquidity?" one banker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that the America Movil deal, at just a 10-year
maturity, was "very much the sweet spot for investors" as well
as being appealing to local pension funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issuing at the longer 30-year maturity could cost Televisa
an estimated additional 80 basis points (bp) in interest, or
coupon, over the cost of a 10-year bond, bankers and analysts
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is derived from the fact that there is an 85bp
differential in spread between government bonds, known as
Mbonos, maturing in 2022 (4.50%) and 2042 (5.35%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa last came to the local market to issue debt in
October 2010 - and that was the first time in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other related fixed-income quotations, stories and

      Research and Markets: Emerging Opportunities in Israel's Cards and 
      Payments Industry: Dominated by Isracard, Leumi Card and Visa Cal
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/rpqc2z/emerging) 
      has announced the addition of the "Emerging 
      Opportunities in Israel's Cards and Payments Industry: Market Size, 
      Trends and Drivers, Strategies, Products and Competitive Landscape" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Israel, the cards industry is dominated by three companies: Isracard, 
      which belongs to Bank Hapoalim; Leumi Card, which belongs to Bank Leumi; 
      and Visa Cal, which belongs to Discount Bank. Currently there are five 
      foreign banks in Israel: Citigroup, HSBC Holding, Barclays Bank, BNP 
      Paribas and State Bank of India. During the review period, the overall 
      cards industry registered a nominal CAGR of 6.55%, from 7.0 million in 
      2008 to 9.0 million in 2012. Israel's banking system is open to foreign 
      investment, and the government actively encourages and supports the 
      inflow of foreign capital. In terms of card volume, the credit cards 
      category held the highest industry share of 60.5% in 2012, followed by 
      debit cards with 29.1% and prepaid cards with 10.4%. Over the forecast 
      period, the credit cards category is expected to register a CAGR of 
      3.65%, rising from 6.0 million cards in 2013 to 6.6 million in 2017. The 
      prepaid cards category is expected to post the highest growth with a 
      CAGR of 5.05%, rising from 997,100 cards in 2013 to 1.2 million in 2017.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Israel's economy recorded stable growth in 2012 at an annual rate of 
      2.9%, in comparison with 4.7% growth in 2011. The slow growth in GDP was 
      mainly due to a decline in exports and low domestic consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - In terms of card volume, the credit cards category held the highest 
      industry share of 60.5% in 2012, followed by debit cards with 29.1% and 
      prepaid cards with 10.4%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Two key trends in Israel's credit card category are the issuance of 
      non-bank credit cards by credit card companies, usually linked to 
      customer clubs or consumer or other entities, and the expansion of the 
      range of services offered by credit card companies in the area of credit 
      and financing to cardholders and merchants, including through the 
      issuance of revolving credit cards which allow cardholders to determine 
      debit amounts and dates according to their needs and ability to pay.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - In Israel, the cards industry is dominated by three companies: 
      Isracard, which belongs to Bank Hapoalim; Leumi Card, which belongs to 
      Bank Leumi; and Visa Cal, which belongs to Discount Bank. Currently 
      there are five foreign banks in Israel: Citigroup, HSBC Holding, 
      Barclays Bank, BNP Paribas and State Bank of India.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's tax authority approved a deal with Goldman Sachs partly because the U.S. bank was threatening to pull out of a new tax code, which would have embarrassed the government, a court heard on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activist group UK Uncut Legal Action has asked the High Court to declare that the 2010 settlement between Goldman and the tax authority (HMRC), worth up to 20 million pounds ($30 million) to the U.S. bank, was unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do say that this was a sweetheart deal which let Goldman Sachs off interest in circumstances which involved a package deal," Ingrid Simler, a lawyer for the group, told the court, adding that the case caused "grave public disquiet".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action stems from public anger in Britain about how firms ranging from Vodafone to Starbucks succeed in paying less tax than many ordinary people hit by a stagnating economy and government spending cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to Goldman Sachs is further damage to its image in Britain after a public outcry in January caused it to scrap plans to delay paying bankers' bonuses to make the most of an income tax cut for high earners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In financial terms, the disputed $30 million is a drop in the ocean for a bank that paid its employees $12.9 billion in compensation and benefits last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerns a deal agreed orally by then HMRC boss Dave Hartnett and Goldman Sachs executives in November 2010 to end a long-running dispute over a now-banned tax avoidance scheme involving the payment of bonuses to UK staff via an offshore tax haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks that had been using the scheme settled with HMRC in 2005, but Goldman Sachs resisted paying what HMRC said it owed for a further five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simler told the court that Hartnett wrongly agreed that Goldman Sachs should pay the principal it owed but not the interest that had accrued during those five years, even though there was no reason for making that concession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"OFF THE DEEP END"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax authority's High Risk Corporate Programme Board rejected the deal, infuriating Goldman Sachs which "went off the deep end", according to an email from Hartnett read out in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank threatened to withdraw from a new code of practice aimed at reducing tax avoidance by banks which had been announced by finance minister George Osborne the previous week, according to Hartnett's written witness statement to the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was concerned that withdrawal would have embarrassed the Chancellor," Hartnett said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an internal email dated December 7, 2010, Hartnett cited the risk of "major embarrassment" to himself, HMRC and Osborne. He eventually approved the deal despite board opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case shows what is going on behind closed doors and the headline-grabbing announcements - tax avoidance as usual, sweetheart deals to avoid red faces of ministers and giving in to threats from big business," UK Uncut Legal Action said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hartnett's witness statement said the overall settlement "was a very good one for HMRC and for taxpayers generally".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feared that re-opening the settlement may have had a significant financial cost to HMRC," he wrote, saying that Goldman had made it clear it considered the November oral agreement binding and would fight any attempt to go back on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Eadie, a lawyer representing HMRC, told the court that fear of embarrassment had been "at the bottom of the scale" of the factors taken into consideration in approving the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eadie also pointed to a report by the National Audit Office published in June last year, which found that five settlements between HMRC and big firms, including the Goldman deal, were reasonable because HMRC may have received less if it had litigated and lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Andrew Nicol reserved his judgment to a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lauren LaCapra in New York and Tom Bergin in London; Editing by Helen Massy-Beresford and Michael Roddy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's tax authority approved a deal with Goldman Sachs partly because the U.S. bank was threatening to pull out of a new tax code, which would have embarrassed the government, a court heard on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activist group UK Uncut Legal Action has asked the High Court to declare that the 2010 settlement between Goldman and the tax authority (HMRC), worth up to 20 million pounds ($30 million) to the U.S. bank, was unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do say that this was a sweetheart deal which let Goldman Sachs off interest in circumstances which involved a package deal," Ingrid Simler, a lawyer for the group, told the court, adding that the case caused "grave public disquiet".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action stems from public anger in Britain about how firms ranging from Vodafone to Starbucks succeed in paying less tax than many ordinary people hit by a stagnating economy and government spending cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to Goldman Sachs is further damage to its image in Britain after a public outcry in January caused it to scrap plans to delay paying bankers' bonuses to make the most of an income tax cut for high earners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In financial terms, the disputed $30 million is a drop in the ocean for a bank that paid its employees $12.9 billion in compensation and benefits last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerns a deal agreed orally by then HMRC boss Dave Hartnett and Goldman Sachs executives in November 2010 to end a long-running dispute over a now-banned tax avoidance scheme involving the payment of bonuses to UK staff via an offshore tax haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks that had been using the scheme settled with HMRC in 2005, but Goldman Sachs resisted paying what HMRC said it owed for a further five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simler told the court that Hartnett wrongly agreed that Goldman Sachs should pay the principal it owed but not the interest that had accrued during those five years, even though there was no reason for making that concession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"OFF THE DEEP END"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax authority's High Risk Corporate Program Board rejected the deal, infuriating Goldman Sachs which "went off the deep end", according to an email from Hartnett read out in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank threatened to withdraw from a new code of practice aimed at reducing tax avoidance by banks which had been announced by finance minister George Osborne the previous week, according to Hartnett's written witness statement to the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was concerned that withdrawal would have embarrassed the Chancellor," Hartnett said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an internal email dated December 7, 2010, Hartnett cited the risk of "major embarrassment" to himself, HMRC and Osborne. He eventually approved the deal despite board opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case shows what is going on behind closed doors and the headline-grabbing announcements - tax avoidance as usual, sweetheart deals to avoid red faces of ministers and giving in to threats from big business," UK Uncut Legal Action said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hartnett's witness statement said the overall settlement "was a very good one for HMRC and for taxpayers generally".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feared that re-opening the settlement may have had a significant financial cost to HMRC," he wrote, saying that Goldman had made it clear it considered the November oral agreement binding and would fight any attempt to go back on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Eadie, a lawyer representing HMRC, told the court that fear of embarrassment had been "at the bottom of the scale" of the factors taken into consideration in approving the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eadie also pointed to a report by the National Audit Office published in June last year, which found that five settlements between HMRC and big firms, including the Goldman deal, were reasonable because HMRC may have received less if it had litigated and lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Andrew Nicol reserved his judgment to a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lauren LaCapra in New York and Tom Bergin in London; Editing by Helen Massy-Beresford and Michael Roddy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Anti-avoidance group says deal was unlawful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Taxman says agreed settlement for good reasons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Corporate tax avoidance is hot issue in Britain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Estelle Shirbon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Britain's tax authority approved a
deal with Goldman Sachs partly because the U.S. bank was
threatening to pull out of a new tax code, which would have
embarrassed the government, a court heard on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist group UK Uncut Legal Action has asked the High
Court to declare that the 2010 settlement between Goldman and
the tax authority (HMRC), worth up to 20 million pounds ($30
million) to the U.S. bank, was unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do say that this was a sweetheart deal which let Goldman
Sachs off interest in circumstances which involved a package
deal," Ingrid Simler, a lawyer for the group, told the court,
adding that the case caused "grave public disquiet".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action stems from public anger in Britain about how
firms ranging from Vodafone to Starbucks succeed in paying less
tax than many ordinary people hit by a stagnating economy and
government spending cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to Goldman Sachs is further damage to its image in
Britain after a public outcry in January caused it to scrap
plans to delay paying bankers' bonuses to make the most of an
income tax cut for high earners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In financial terms, the disputed $30 million is a drop in
the ocean for a bank that paid its employees $12.9 billion in
compensation and benefits last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerns a deal agreed orally by then HMRC boss
Dave Hartnett and Goldman Sachs executives in November 2010 to
end a long-running dispute over a now-banned tax avoidance
scheme involving the payment of bonuses to UK staff via an
offshore tax haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks that had been using the scheme settled with HMRC
in 2005, but Goldman Sachs resisted paying what HMRC said it
owed for a further five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simler told the court that Hartnett wrongly agreed that
Goldman Sachs should pay the principal it owed but not the
interest that had accrued during those five years, even though
there was no reason for making that concession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"OFF THE DEEP END"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax authority's High Risk Corporate Programme Board
rejected the deal, infuriating Goldman Sachs which "went off the
deep end", according to an email from Hartnett read out in
court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank threatened to withdraw from a new code of practice
aimed at reducing tax avoidance by banks which had been
announced by finance minister George Osborne the previous week,
according to Hartnett's written witness statement to the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was concerned that withdrawal would have embarrassed the
Chancellor," Hartnett said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an internal email dated Dec. 7, 2010, Hartnett cited the
risk of "major embarrassment" to himself, HMRC and Osborne. He
eventually approved the deal despite board opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case shows what is going on behind closed doors and

to threats from big business," UK Uncut Legal Action said in a
news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hartnett's witness statement said the overall settlement
"was a very good one for HMRC and for taxpayers generally".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feared that re-opening the settlement may have had a
significant financial cost to HMRC," he wrote, saying that
Goldman had made it clear it considered the November oral
agreement binding and would fight any attempt to go back on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Eadie, a lawyer representing HMRC, told the court that
fear of embarrassment had been "at the bottom of the scale" of
the factors taken into consideration in approving the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eadie also pointed to a report by the National Audit Office
published in June last year, which found that five settlements
between HMRC and big firms, including the Goldman deal, were
reasonable because HMRC may have received less if it had
litigated and lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Andrew Nicol reserved his judgment to a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4311Z Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4311Z 'AA/F1', Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --DRIVERs, Series 4311Z 'AA', Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4311Z 
      PUTTERs and DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to 
      The Regents of the University of California Limited Project Revenue 
      Bonds 2012 Series G (rated 'AA', Stable Outlook) that have been 
      deposited in the series 4311Z trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4311Z PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (rated 
      'A+/F1', Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4311Z 
      PUTTERs will expire on May 1, 2014, the expiration date of the liquidity 
      facility, unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bond deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

      Possible Breaches of Fiduciary Duty by the Board of Ebix, Inc. in 
      Connection with the Sale of the Company to a Goldman, Sachs  Co. 
      Affiliate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Levi  Korsinsky is investigating the Board of Directors of Ebix, Inc. 
      (&#8220;Ebix&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (Nasdaq: EBIX) for possible breaches of 
      fiduciary duty and other violations of state law in connection with the

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the transaction, Ebix shareholders will receive $20 
      for each share of Ebix stock they own. The transaction has a total 
      approximate value of $820 million, including the assumption of debt. The 
      investigation concerns whether the Ebix Board of Directors breached 
      their fiduciary duties to stockholders by failing to adequately shop the 
      Company before agreeing to enter into the transaction, and whether 
      Goldman, Sachs  Co. is underpaying for Ebix stock, thus unlawfully 
      harming Ebix stockholders.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's tax authority approved a deal with Goldman Sachs partly because the U.S. bank was threatening to pull out of a new tax framework, which would have embarrassed the government, a court heard on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activist group UK Uncut Legal Action has asked the High Court to declare that the 2010 settlement between Goldman and the tax authority (HMRC), worth up to 20 million pounds ($30 million) to the U.S. bank, was unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action stems from public anger in Britain about how big firms succeed in paying less tax than many ordinary people hit by a stagnating economy and government spending cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to Goldman Sachs is further damage to its image in Britain after a public outcry in January caused it to scrap plans to delay paying bankers' bonuses to make the most of an income tax cut for high earners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In financial terms, the disputed $30 million is a drop in the ocean for a bank that paid its employees $12.9 billion in compensation and benefits last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerns a deal agreed by then HMRC boss Dave Hartnett and Goldman Sachs in November 2010 to end a long-running dispute over a now-banned tax avoidance scheme involving the payment of bonuses to UK staff via an offshore tax haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks that had been using the scheme settled with HMRC in 2005, but Goldman Sachs resisted paying what HMRC said it owed for a further five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingrid Simler, a lawyer representing UK Uncut Legal Action, told the High Court that Hartnett wrongly agreed that Goldman Sachs should pay the principal it owed but not the interest that had accrued during those five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"OFF THE DEEP END"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax authority's High Risk Corporate Programme Board rejected the deal, infuriating Goldman Sachs which "went off the deep end", according to an email from Hartnett read out in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank threatened to withdraw from a new code of practice aimed at reducing tax avoidance by banks which had been announced by finance minister George Osborne the previous week, according to Hartnett's written witness statement to the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was concerned that withdrawal would have embarrassed the Chancellor," Hartnett said in the statement, a copy of which was circulated by UK Uncut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an internal email dated December 7, 2010, Hartnett cited the risk of "major embarrassment" to himself, HMRC and Osborne. He eventually approved the deal despite board opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case shows what is going on behind closed doors and the headline-grabbing announcements - tax avoidance as usual, sweetheart deals to avoid red faces of ministers and giving in to threats from big business," UK Uncut Legal Action said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury, HMRC and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Eadie, a lawyer representing HMRC, told the court it was wrong to suggest there had been a "cosy back-room deal".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed to a report by the National Audit Office published in June last year, which found that five settlements between HMRC and big firms, including the Goldman deal, were reasonable because HMRC may have received less if it had litigated and lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eadie said that details of the agreement were protected by taxpayer confidentiality but that those who were in possession of the full facts had determined that the deal represented good value for taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court will reserve its judgment to a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lauren LaCapra in New York; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Helen Massy-Beresford)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ITT Exelis (NYSE: 
      XLS) has been awarded a contract by NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
      (JPL), Pasadena, Calif., to provide specialized antennas for the 
      Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere  Climate-2 (COSMIC-2) 
      program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By analyzing GPS signals altered by atmospheric conditions, COSMIC-2 
      satellites will provide insights that advance the study of meteorology, 
      ionospheric&#160;research,&#160;climatology and&#160;space weather. Under the 
      agreement, Exelis will provide JPL with 25 high-accuracy multiband 
      Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antennas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our antennas will ensure the satellites in the COSMIC-2 constellation 
      receive signals clearly and effectively across multiple signal bands 
      from GPS satellites,&#8221; said Paul Eyring, senior director of programs for 
      antennas, sensors and microelectronics for Exelis Electronic Systems. 
      &#8220;These antennas offer the next-generation sensor system performance that 
      will help advance this important field of scientific research.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 is a joint program sponsored by the U.S. National 
      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Taiwan&#8217;s National 
      Space Organization. The program&#8217;s planned constellation of 12 satellites 
      will support a variety of atmospheric and ionospheric observation 
      missions, providing a range of real-time atmospheric and space weather 
      data. Each satellite will include two Exelis GNSS antennas.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 2 (Reuters) - JP Morgan and Greenhill
 have been appointed to advise GlaxoSmithKline on
the sale of its soft drinks brands Lucozade and Ribena, which
analysts believe will fetch more than 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Britain's biggest drugmaker said on Thursday
the two firms had been selected following keen interest from
many banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of Lucozade and Ribena - which are big sellers in
Britain but lack global reach - is expected to attract interest
from drinks companies and private equity houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's Suntory Holdings has been tipped as a
possible buyer, along with private equity firms such as
Blackstone, BC Partners, PAI, Lion Capital, Bain Capital,
CVC Capital Partners and KKR. All have declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucozade and Ribena together bring in nearly 600 million
pounds a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming potential buyers are prepared to pay two times
sales, that would point to a valuation of some 1.2 billion
pounds. Analysts at Deutsche Bank, however, believe the two
brands should bring in more than 1.5 billion pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSK announced its intention to sell the products last week,
following a strategic review of options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The lawyer who has been defending controversial plaintiffs attorney Steven Donzinger in a lawsuit by Chevron Corp (CVX.N), filed a motion on Friday to withdraw as counsel, citing Donzinger's inability to pay his legal bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney John Keker has been representing Donziger since 2011 in a case brought by Chevron alleging that Donzinger fabricated a long-running lawsuit alleging Chevron polluted an Ecuadorian rainforest. Keker asked to withdraw as Donzinger's attorney in an 11-page motion that blamed New York federal court Judge Lewis Kaplan for Donzinger's financial predicament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keker's request to drop out of the case comes as Chevron aggressively pushes to overturn a $19 billion judgment that it polluted the rainforest. In its lawsuit against Donziger, Chevron claimed he used fraudulent tactics such as coordinating the ghost writing of an environmental report that was held up as independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keker said Donziger owes him and his San Francisco law firm, Keker &amp; Van Nest, $1.4 million in unpaid fees. He said Kaplan allowed Chevron to conduct what he called a prolonged and expensive litigation process with "dozens of fact depositions ... from Park Avenue to Peru," which caused Donzinger's bills to pile up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keker said he filed a request in March that Kaplan better manage the trial to control legal costs, but Kaplan never responded. Keker characterized the court as a hostile environment for Donziger and his defense lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron's litigation tactics, which this court has endorsed and encouraged throughout these proceedings &#8230; have made the costs of this litigation unsustainable to Donziger," said Keker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More significantly, to even stay alive in this case &#8230; will cost another six to ten million dollars in attorney time and costs.

He said Chevron has filed papers indicating it has roughly 2,000 legal personnel and 60 law firms working to evade compliance with the Ecuador court judgment, including 114 lawyers at Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher, the primary Chevron law firm handling the New York case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Donziger said that he works out of his two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan with a non-legal assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said the company's conduct in trial has been "proportionate to the magnitude of the fraud that's been committed against our company and our shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, said Keker's move did not surprise him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No reputable person, organization, or government would want to be associated with this scheme," he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Kaplan was unavailable for comment on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Casey Sullivan.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The regulator of U.S. power markets appears likely to pursue manipulation charges against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), analysts said, after a New York Times report on the agency's document that seemed to lay out its case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times said on Friday it reviewed a confidential, 70-page government document that the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sent to JPMorgan in March, which alleged the bank manipulated the power market in California and Michigan in 2010 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC investigators found JPMorgan devised "manipulative schemes" that transformed "money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers," the Times reported, citing the document. It said the bank has until mid-May to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been clear since last summer that FERC was pursuing a deep enquiry on JPMorgan's trading activities, the latest in a string of FERC investigations that have rattled the U.S. power market and - in the case of rival bank Barclays Plc (BARC.L) - concluded with $470 million in proposed penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC has not moved to publicly charge JPMorgan, but experts said that now seemed likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FERC staff would not have gone to the trouble of putting together a 70-page document without a case. If they have gotten this far they will likely pursue it," said Susan Court, a former senior lawyer at FERC who is principal of SJC Energy Consultants LLC in Arlington, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document also criticized Blythe Masters, JPMorgan's head of global commodities and former chief financial officer, saying she "falsely" denied under oath that she was aware of schemes carried out by a group of energy traders in Houston, according to the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter," JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli said. "We intend to vigorously defend the firm and the employees in this matter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YEAR-LONG SAGA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document cited by the Times came after a months-long inquiry into the bank's trading in power markets, one of several high-profile investigations since FERC's enforcement powers were expanded in 2005 following the Enron scandal a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We cannot, and do not, speculate as to any investigations, as they are all non-public. We do not speculate as to whether investigations are taking place, nor do we speculate as to whether or when the Commission will take any action," FERC spokeswoman Mary O'Driscoll said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC last summer subpoenaed JPMorgan to produce 25 internal emails - some between Blythe Masters and the bank's head of principal commodity investments Francis Dunleavy - as part an ongoing investigation focused on bidding practices that may have raised electricity prices by about $73 million in California and the Midwest power markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC normally does not disclose investigations but chose to subpoena JPMorgan after the bank claimed the emails were protected by attorney client privilege.

To date, FERC has not issued a final order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need more information about the JPMorgan and Barclays cases to know whether there are Hunter questions.

Brian Hunter, a natural gas trader for the now closed Amaranth
Advisors hedge fund, who was fined $30 million by FERC for
alleged manipulation of gas prices in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court ruled that FERC acted outside of its

Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has jurisdiction over

      As indicted in the study, the thrombotic drugs segment is currently 
      small, but holds great growth potential in the future. The launch and 
      development of new products, incorporated with innovative technologies, 
      will drive the growth as manufacturers look for ways to differentiate 
      themselves from their competitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This study is intended to provide industry leaders with a competitive 
      benchmarking of the world's top five cardiovascular drugs companies. The 
      study provides up-to-date information on the market share, profit 
      margins, capabilities, and strategies of the leaders. It is designed to 
      provide executives with strategically significant competitor 
      information, data analysis and insight, critical to the development and 
      implementation of an effective marketing and sales plan.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Investigators from the agency that regulates power markets have found a unit of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) manipulated trading in the California and Michigan electricity markets, the New York Times reported, in what would be the latest government crackdown on trading abuses in the markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said it reviewed a confidential, 70-page government document that was sent to JPMorgan in March and that also criticized Blythe Masters, the bank's current head of global commodities and former chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan denied their employees did anything wrong related to the California and Michigan electricity trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times, citing the document, said investigators from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) found JPMorgan devised "manipulative schemes" that transformed "money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document came after a months-long inquiry into the bank's trading in power markets, one of several high-profile FERC investigations since its enforcement powers were expanded following the Enron scandal a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, it proposed a record $470 million penalty on Barclays PLC (BARC.L) for trading activity in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document also found Masters "falsely" denied under oath whether she was aware of schemes carried out by a group of energy traders in Houston, but did not elaborate, according to The Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter. We intend to vigorously defend the firm and the employees in this matter," JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said FERC gave JPMorgan until mid-May to respond to the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document appeared to be the strongest sign yet that FERC staff is set to push ahead with a formal action on the trading activity, which the Times said took place in 2010 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, FERC imposed a temporary ban on JPMorgan's physical power trading for failing to disclose information to the FERC and the California ISO, the operator of the state's power grid, in a market manipulation investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban prevented the bank from trading power at market- based rates for six months starting April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC Commissioner Cheryl LaFleur dissented in that November vote, saying the agency should include penalties for any failure to disclose information as part of the market manipulation case if the agency decided to pursue that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC officials were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BARCLAYS DENIAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to pursue a penalty or disgorgement of profits, FERC staff typically issues a public show-cause order, which has not yet occurred in the JPMorgan case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2012, FERC issued a show-cause order to a unit of Barclays Plc (BARC.L) that alleged traders at the British bank manipulated the California power market from late 2006 to 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays has disputed the FERC allegations and said it will defend itself in court if FERC issues a final order seeking to impose the fine. To date, FERC has not issued a final order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2012, FERC issued a show cause order against a unit of Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) that alleged the German bank manipulated the California power market from January to March 2010.

&lt;p&gt;May 3 (Reuters) - Investigators from the U.S. agency that
regulates power markets have found a unit of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 manipulated trading in the California and Michigan
electricity markets, the New York Times reported, in what would
be the latest government crackdown on trading abuses in the
markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said it reviewed a confidential, 70-page
government document that was sent to JPMorgan in March and that
also criticized Blythe Masters, the bank's current head of
global commodities and former chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan denied their employees did anything wrong related
to the California and Michigan electricity trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times, citing the document, said investigators from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) found JPMorgan
devised "manipulative schemes" that transformed "money-losing
power plants into powerful profit centers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document came after a months-long inquiry into the
bank's trading in power markets, one of several high-profile
FERC investigations since its enforcement powers were expanded
following the Enron scandal a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, it proposed a record $470 million penalty on
Barclays PLC for trading activity in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document also found Masters "falsely" denied under oath

staff is set to push ahead with a formal action on the trading
activity, which the Times said took place in 2010 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, FERC imposed a temporary ban on JPMorgan's
physical power trading for failing to disclose information to
the FERC and the California ISO, the operator of the state's
power grid, in a market manipulation investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban prevented the bank from trading power at market-
based rates for six months starting April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC Commissioner Cheryl LaFleur dissented in that November
vote, saying the agency should include penalties for any failure
to disclose information as part of the market manipulation case
if the agency decided to pursue that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC officials were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BARCLAYS DENIAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to pursue a penalty or disgorgement of profits,
FERC staff typically issues a public show-cause order, which has
not yet occurred in the JPMorgan case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2012, FERC issued a show-cause order to a unit of
Barclays Plc that alleged traders at the British bank
manipulated the California power market from late 2006 to 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays has disputed the FERC allegations and said it will

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 3 (Reuters) - U.S. government investigators have found
that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co had manipulated trading in the
California and Michigan electricity markets, the New York Times
reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said it had reviewed a confidential, 70-page
government document that was sent to JPMorgan in March and which
also took aim at Blythe Masters, the bank's current head of
global commodities and former chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times, citing the document, said investigators
from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) had found
that JPMorgan devised "manipulative schemes" that transformed
"money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulatory document also says Masters had "falsely"
denied under oath her awareness of schemes carried out by a
group of energy traders in Houston, the newspaper said, without
elaborating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear whether the FERC will take
action against JPMorgan based on the investigators' findings,
the New York Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We intend to vigorously defend the firm and the employees
in this matter," the newspaper quoted JPMorgan spokeswoman
Kristin Lemkau as saying. "We strongly dispute that Blythe
Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this
matter," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, FERC imposed a temporary ban on JPMorgan's
physical power trading for failing to disclose information in a
market manipulation investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) shareholders should vote against the re-election of three board members because they failed to properly oversee risk-taking that led to $6.2 billion of losses on the so-called "London Whale" trades, an influential proxy advisory firm said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
shareholders should vote against the re-election of three board
members because they failed to properly oversee risk-taking that
led to $6.2 billion of losses on the so-called "London Whale"

should not be re-elected at the company's annual meeting this

reduce Dimon's power at JPMorgan, the biggest bank based in the
United States, as some stockholders push for more supervision of
the outspoken executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement from JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau on
Saturday said: "The company strongly endorses the re-election of
its current directors and disagrees with ISS's position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISS also renewed its recommendation from a year ago that CEO
and Chairman of the Board Jamie Dimon give up one of those two
titles. ISS said investigations of the derivatives loss, which
surfaced right before last year's shareholder meeting, showed
that JPMorgan executives need more independent oversight and
that the company is too big and too complex for one person to be
able to do both jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders will meet on May 21 in Tampa, Florida. They

sanctions from regulators, over poor risk management have piled
up since the "London Whale" losses surfaced at the bank, which
has $2.39 trillion in assets, the most of any U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trading debacle has picked up the same "London Whale"
nickname that hedge funds gave to a JPMorgan trader for the
outsized derivatives bets he placed for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISS recommendations on the re-election of directors shows
the shareholder debate over governance of the company is
broadening beyond Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three directors who ISS singled out for replacement were
members of the board's risk policy committee in December 2010
when the committee was shown a presentation by management that
highlighted large profits from trading strategies in the firm's
Chief Investment Office, where the derivative losses later
occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presentation said the CIO strategies had contributed
$2.8 billion of "economic value" since inception, with an
average annualized return of 100 percent, according to a report 
released earlier this year by the board on its review of the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISS said the large profits showed that the CIO had changed
from a unit that hedged risks to "what was essentially a
proprietary trading desk" and should have prompted the committee
to act against the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company statement added: "While the company has
acknowledged a number of mistakes relating to its losses in CIO,
an independent review committee of the board determined that
those mistakes were not attributable to the risk committee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its proxy statement for the coming meeting, the board
said that the actions taken by the company after the "London
Whale" debacle show it to be strong and independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the loss, the board added a member to the risk policy
committee - new director Timothy Flynn, a retired chairman of
auditor KPMG International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISS, which researches proxy issues and makes voting
recommendations to institutional investors, praised the company
for putting Flynn on the panel and recommended that shareholders
re-elect him as well as seven other directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, ISS recommended that all director candidates
nominated by the board be elected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory firm said the JPMorgan board needs
"refreshment" and the panel should search "for seasoned
directors with financial and risk expertise" to replace Cote,
Crown and Futter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cote is chief executive and board chairman of technology and
aerospace company Honeywell International Inc ; Crown is
president of investment firm Henry Crown and Co, and Futter is
president of the American Museum of Natural History.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's statement on Saturday also said: "The members
of the board's risk committee have a diversity and breadth of
experiences that have served the company well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISS said it had discussed the board's independence and the
qualifications of the risk policy committee members with the

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) Jamie Dimon may be losing ground in his fight to keep the title of chairman, as some major investors push for more oversight of the chief executive after the "London whale" trading losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the largest U.S. bank's annual meeting in two weeks, shareholders will be able to vote on a non-binding proposal to separate the chairman and CEO roles. Two of the bank's top 10 shareholders told Reuters they are considering voting in favor of the proposal, a reversal of their position last year, because of the disastrous bets on credit derivatives that cost the bank more than $6 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal is only a non-binding recommendation and it is not clear what the board will do if it passes. ISS Proxy Advisory Services, the leading proxy advisory firm, on Friday recommended investors support the proposal and also said they should vote against the re-election of three directors who they said had failed in their oversight of the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment for this story. The bank's board has said it opposes the shareholder proposal and that the company's handling of the trading loss shows its current governance works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's directors are leading an aggressive campaign to persuade shareholders to vote against it, one of the investors said. It is not clear how much investor support there is for the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two JPMorgan investors, who were not authorized to speak on the record, said that however the vote shakes out, they plan to continue to push the bank's directors behind the scenes to take at least some power from Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One investor said they will likely encourage the bank to give more authority to its lead independent director, former ExxonMobil Chief Executive Lee Raymond. At JPMorgan, the lead director is currently known as the "presiding director," a role that includes approving board agendas and schedules and leading meetings of independent directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second investor said they would not be satisfied with anything less than a separation of the two roles because being a chairman is a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the vote is Dimon's reputation as the best manager on Wall Street. The 57-year-old executive is still viewed by many shareholders as a shrewd leader and they want him to continue to run the bank, albeit with some oversight. Some investors fear that Dimon will leave if he loses the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's difficulties began last year, when news emerged of the London Whale trades. The bank has since had a series of run-ins with regulators over issues ranging from money laundering controls to allegations of power market manipulation. JPMorgan's growing array of problems has overshadowed last year's record profits in the minds of many investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORY PROBLEMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As investors ponder whether Dimon can provide enough oversight to a bank with nearly $2.4 trillion of assets, their doubts could give momentum to an idea held by a small but growing minority of U.S. lawmakers and regulators that the biggest banks are too big to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote also comes amid a broader debate in corporate America over whether the head of a company should also lead the directors that oversee the company. In the United Kingdom, the two roles are typically separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Independence is the cornerstone of accountability," said Joe Dear, chief investment officer at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns JPMorgan shares. "As a principle, CalPERS believes boards should be chaired by an independent director, and we support the separation of the CEO and chair roles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear declined to comment specifically on JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholder proposal was sponsored by the American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees, New York City and state of Connecticut employee retirement plans and the United Kingdom's Hermes Fund Managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last year's meeting, the AFSCME was the sole sponsor of the proposal, and it won 40 percent of investors' votes, relatively high for a measure that the board had opposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's vote happened only five days after the company first acknowledged its bad bets on credit derivatives. Since then, shareholders have learned much more about the company's failed risk controls and the trouble it has had with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISS, which is also known as Institutional Shareholder Services, had supported last year's proposal, but this year added a two-page analysis that concluded the London Whale loss had displayed the board's lack of independence from Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second proxy advisory firm, Glass, Lewis &amp; Co, endorsed last year's proposal but has yet to announce its recommendation for this year's vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has had other problems recently. U.S. government investigators have found that a JPMorgan unit manipulated trading in the California and Michigan electricity markets, the New York Times reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the bank's main regulators, is also considering censuring the bank for failing to conduct adequate due diligence and report suspicions about Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff, Reuters first reported last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his annual letter to shareholders, Dimon said executives throughout the bank are putting other projects on hold or scaling them back, so they can focus on the bank's regulatory obligations. Dozens of these projects are on the back burner now, a source familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nadia Damouni and David Henry; Editing by Dan Wilchins and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's Jamie Dimon
may be losing ground in his fight to keep the title of chairman,
as some major investors push for more oversight of the chief
executive after the "London whale" trading losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the largest U.S. bank's annual meeting in two weeks,
shareholders will be able to vote on a non-binding proposal to
separate the chairman and CEO roles. Two of the bank's top 10
shareholders told Reuters they are considering voting in favor
of the proposal, a reversal of their position last year, because
of the disastrous bets on credit derivatives that cost the bank
more than $6 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal is only a non-binding recommendation and it is
not clear what the board will do if it passes. ISS Proxy
Advisory Services, the leading proxy advisory firm, on Friday
recommended investors support the proposal and also said they
should vote against the re-election of three directors who they
said had failed in their oversight of the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment for this story. The bank's
board has said it opposes the shareholder proposal and that the
company's handling of the trading loss shows its current
governance works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's directors are leading an aggressive campaign to
persuade shareholders to vote against it, one of the investors
said. It is not clear how much investor support there is for the
proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two JPMorgan investors, who were not authorized to speak
on the record, said that however the vote shakes out, they plan
to continue to push the bank's directors behind the scenes to
take at least some power from Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One investor said they will likely encourage the bank to
give more authority to its lead independent director, former
ExxonMobil Chief Executive Lee Raymond. At JPMorgan, the lead
director is currently known as the "presiding director," a role
that includes approving board agendas and schedules and leading
meetings of independent directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second investor said they would not be satisfied with
anything less than a separation of the two roles because being a
chairman is a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the vote is Dimon's reputation as the best
manager on Wall Street. The 57-year-old executive is still
viewed by many shareholders as a shrewd leader and they want him
to continue to run the bank, albeit with some oversight. Some
investors fear that Dimon will leave if he loses the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's difficulties began last year, when news emerged of
the London Whale trades. The bank has since had a series of
run-ins with regulators over issues ranging from money
laundering controls to allegations of power market manipulation.
JPMorgan's growing array of problems has overshadowed last
year's record profits in the minds of many investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORY PROBLEMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As investors ponder whether Dimon can provide enough
oversight to a bank with nearly $2.4 trillion of assets, their
doubts could give momentum to an idea held by a small but
growing minority of U.S. lawmakers and regulators that the
biggest banks are too big to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote also comes amid a broader debate in corporate
America over whether the head of a company should also lead the
directors that oversee the company. In the United Kingdom, the
two roles are typically separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Independence is the cornerstone of accountability," said
Joe Dear, chief investment officer at the California Public
Employees' Retirement System, which owns JPMorgan shares. "As a
principle, CalPERS believes boards should be chaired by an
independent director, and we support the separation of the CEO
and chair roles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear declined to comment specifically on JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholder proposal was sponsored by the American
Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees, New York City
and state of Connecticut employee retirement plans and the
United Kingdom's Hermes Fund Managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last year's meeting, the AFSCME was the sole sponsor of
the proposal, and it won 40 percent of investors' votes,
relatively high for a measure that the board had opposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's vote happened only five days after the company
first acknowledged its bad bets on credit derivatives. Since
then, shareholders have learned much more about the company's
failed risk controls and the trouble it has had with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISS, which is also known as Institutional Shareholder
Services, had supported last year's proposal, but this year
added a two-page analysis that concluded the London Whale loss
had displayed the board's lack of independence from Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second proxy advisory firm, Glass, Lewis &amp; Co, endorsed
last year's proposal but has yet to announce its recommendation
for this year's vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has had other problems recently. U.S. government
investigators have found that a JPMorgan unit manipulated
trading in the California and Michigan electricity markets, the
New York Times reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the
bank's main regulators, is also considering censuring the bank
for failing to conduct adequate due diligence and report
suspicions about Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff, Reuters first
reported last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his annual letter to shareholders, Dimon said executives
throughout the bank are putting other projects on hold or
scaling them back, so they can focus on the bank's regulatory
obligations. Dozens of these projects are on the back burner
now, a source familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 6 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has yet to
convince three of its largest shareholders to support the
company in an upcoming vote on whether Jamie Dimon should retain
both his CEO and Chairman titles, the Wall Street Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors are pushing for a separation in Dimon's roles
and seeking more oversight due to the "London Whale" trading
losses. Votes on the non-binding recommendation will be tallied
on May 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investors, BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group Inc and
Fidelity Investments - which together control 12 percent of the
shares - are still on the fence, the Journal said quoting people
close to the firms. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the bank's top 10 shareholders have told Reuters that
they will consider voting in favor of the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's $6.2 billion loss stemmed from bets by
London-based Chief Investment Office trader Bruno Iksil on an
index for credit default swaps. His outsized positions earned
him the nickname "London Whale" from hedge fund traders taking
the other sides of his positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three investors and JPMorgan were not immediately for
comment outside U.S. business hours. The bank's board has said
it opposes the shareholder proposal and that the company's
handling of the trading loss shows its current governance works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The lawyer who has been defending controversial plaintiffs attorney Steven Donziger in a lawsuit by Chevron Corp (CVX.N), filed a motion on Friday to withdraw as counsel, citing Donziger's inability to pay his legal bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney John Keker has been representing Donziger since 2011 in a case brought by Chevron alleging that Donziger fabricated a long-running lawsuit alleging Chevron polluted an Ecuadorian rainforest. Keker asked to withdraw as Donziger's attorney in an 11-page motion that blamed New York federal court Judge Lewis Kaplan for Donziger's financial predicament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keker's request to drop out of the case comes as Chevron aggressively pushes to overturn a $19 billion judgment that it polluted the rainforest. In its lawsuit against Donziger, Chevron claimed he used fraudulent tactics such as coordinating the ghost writing of an environmental report that was held up as independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keker said Donziger owes him and his San Francisco law firm, Keker &amp; Van Nest, $1.4 million in unpaid fees. He said Kaplan allowed Chevron to conduct what he called a prolonged and expensive litigation process with "dozens of fact depositions ... from Park Avenue to Peru," which caused Donziger's bills to pile up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keker said he filed a request in March that Kaplan better manage the trial to control legal costs, but Kaplan never responded. Keker characterized the court as a hostile environment for Donziger and his defense lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron's litigation tactics, which this court has endorsed and encouraged throughout these proceedings &#8230; have made the costs of this litigation unsustainable to Donziger," said Keker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More significantly, to even stay alive in this case &#8230; will cost another six to ten million dollars in attorney time and costs. With revenues in the billions of dollars, Chevron can afford to litigate this case &#8216;until hell freezes over.' But Donziger can't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, Donziger will represent himself in the Chevron case, Keker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger issued a news release on Friday addressing Keker's withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he will try to find the resources to rehire his counsel or to find substitute counsel, but he was not hopeful. He said Chevron has filed papers indicating it has roughly 2,000 legal personnel and 60 law firms working to evade compliance with the Ecuador court judgment, including 114 lawyers at Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher, the primary Chevron law firm handling the New York case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Donziger said that he works out of his two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan with a non-legal assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said the company's conduct in trial has been "proportionate to the magnitude of the fraud that's been committed against our company and our shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, said Keker's move did not surprise him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No reputable person, organization, or government would want to be associated with this scheme," he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Kaplan was unavailable for comment on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This version of the May 3 story corrects the spelling to Donziger throughout instead of Donzinger.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Casey Sullivan.

			Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer Announce Publication of ARISTOTLE 
      Subanalysis in Circulation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Subgroup analysis demonstrates that the treatment effects of Eliquis&#174; 
        (apixaban) vs. warfarin, across a broad range of warfarin control, are 
        consistent with primary results of ARISTOTLE
			
			
				ARISTOTLE studied Eliquis vs. warfarin for the reduction of the 
        risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular 
        atrial fibrillation
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer 
      Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that results from a prespecified 
      subanalysis of the ARISTOTLE trial were published in Circulation, 
      the peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association. Results 
      from this subanalysis showed that the reductions in stroke or systemic 
      embolism, number of major bleeding events and mortality demonstrated 
      with Eliquis&#174; (apixaban) compared to warfarin in the 
      ARISTOTLE trial were consistent across subgroups defined based on levels 
      of International Normalized Ratio (INR) control in patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Concerning the quality of warfarin treatment, there is a large 
      variation in time in therapeutic range among different countries and 
      centers, which affects outcomes. This subanalysis was conducted to 
      determine whether the treatment effects of apixaban were similar in 
      centers and patients with high quality warfarin care,&#8221; said study lead 
      author Dr. Lars Wallentin of Uppsala University in Uppsala, Sweden. 
      &#8220;These additional analyses supported that the primary results of 
      ARISTOTLE were consistent across a broad range of quality of warfarin 
      management.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Variations in time in therapeutic range (TTR) can affect outcomes for 
      atrial fibrillation patients being treated with Vitamin K antagonists 
      such as warfarin for stroke prevention, leading to an increased risk of 
      stroke when INR levels are below, or bleeding when INR levels are above, 
      the therapeutic range. For patients in the ARISTOTLE trial, the quality 
      of warfarin management was defined by TTR, with a target INR of 2.0 &#8211; 
      3.0. In the ARISTOTLE trial, patients in the warfarin group had an INR 
      in the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) for a median of 66.0% of the time. 
      For context, the median time for INR in the therapeutic range varies 
      across the globe. In clinical practice settings in the United States, it 
      is approximately 57-59%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ARISTOTLE trial randomized 18,201 patients from 1,034 clinical 
      centers in 39 countries. In this subanalysis, for each patient, a center 
      average TTR (cTTR) was estimated using a linear mixed model based on the 
      real TTRs in warfarin treated patients with a fixed effect for country 
      and random effect for center. Study centers were placed into one of four 
      similarly sized quartile groups based on cTTR (60.5%; 60.6%-66.3%; 
      66.4%-71.1%; and&#160;&#160;71.2%). The rates of stroke or systemic embolism, 
      major bleeding and mortality were consistently lower with Eliquis 
      than warfarin across the cTTR quartiles. Similar results were seen when 
      an individual TTR (iTTR), predicted using a model including patient 
      characteristics, was examined in a post-hoc analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While demonstrating consistency across a broad range of warfarin 
      control, results of this subanalysis suggest a trend toward reduction of 
      the treatment effects at centers and in patients with predicted 
      excellent INR control. In these centers, interaction tests are less 
      reliable because of low numbers of events, and thereby lack statistical 
      power.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on the results of the subanalysis, the benefits of Eliquis 
      compared with warfarin for stroke or systemic embolism, bleeding, and 
      mortality appear similar across the range of centers&#8217; and patients&#8217; 
      quality of INR control.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About ARISTOTLE Trial Design
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ARISTOTLE study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety 
      of Eliquis versus warfarin for the prevention of stroke or 
      systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In 
      ARISTOTLE, 18,201 patients were randomized (9,120 patients to Eliquis 
      and 9,081 to warfarin). ARISTOTLE was an active-controlled, randomized, 
      double-blind, multi-national trial in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation or atrial flutter, and at least one additional risk factor 
      for stroke. Patients were randomized to treatment with Eliquis 5 
      mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients, 
      representing 4.7 percent of all patients) or warfarin (target INR range 
      2.0-3.0), and followed for a median of 1.8 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Atrial Fibrillation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia (irregular 
      heart beat). It is estimated that more than 5.8 million Americans and 6 
      million individuals in Europe have atrial fibrillation. Nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation, or NVAF, is the most common type of atrial 
      fibrillation. The lifetime risk of developing atrial fibrillation is 
      estimated to be approximately 25 percent for individuals 40 years of age 
      or older. One of the most serious medical concerns for individuals with 
      atrial fibrillation is the increased risk of stroke, which is five times 
      higher in people with atrial fibrillation than those without atrial 
      fibrillation. In fact, 15 percent of all strokes are attributable to 
      atrial fibrillation in the U.S. Additionally, strokes due to atrial 
      fibrillation are more burdensome than strokes due to other causes. 
      Atrial fibrillation-related strokes are more severe than other strokes, 
      with an associated 30-day mortality of 24 percent and a 50 percent 
      likelihood of death within one year in patients who are not treated with 
      an antithrombotic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Eliquis&#174;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Eliquis&#174; (apixaban) is an oral direct Factor Xa 
      inhibitor. By inhibiting Factor Xa, a key blood clotting protein, Eliquis 
      prevents thrombin generation and blood clot formation. Eliquis is 
      approved to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients 
      with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the United States, European 
      Union, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Columbia, Russia, Israel and 
      Australia. Eliquis is approved for prevention of venous 
      thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone 
      elective hip or knee replacement surgery in a total of 17 regions: 
      Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, European Union (which 
      includes 27 member states plus Iceland and Norway), Hong Kong, India, 
      Indonesia, Israel, Peru, Russia, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand, 
      Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ELIQUIS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BOXED WARNING: DISCONTINUING ELIQUIS IN PATIENTS WITHOUT ADEQUATE 
      CONTINUOUS ANTICOAGULATION INCREASES RISK OF STROKE.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discontinuing ELIQUIS places patients at an increased risk of 
      thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed following 
      discontinuation of ELIQUIS in clinical trials in patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS must be 
      discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding, coverage 
      with another anticoagulant should be strongly considered.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CONTRAINDICATIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Active pathological bleeding
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ELIQUIS (apixaban) (i.e., 
      anaphylactic reactions)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Increased Risk of Stroke with Discontinuation of ELIQUIS: Discontinuing 
      ELIQUIS in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases 
      the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed 
      during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in 
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. If ELIQUIS must be 
      discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding, consider 
      coverage with another anticoagulant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bleeding Risk: ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can 
      cause serious, potentially fatal bleeding. Concomitant use of drugs 
      affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding including aspirin 
      and other anti-platelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, 
      thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs. Patients should be made 
      aware of signs or symptoms of blood loss and instructed to immediately 
      report to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active 
      pathological hemorrhage. There is no established way to reverse the 
      anticoagulant effect of apixaban, which can be expected to persist for 
      about 24 hours after the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). A 
      specific antidote for ELIQUIS is not available. Because of high plasma 
      protein binding, apixaban is not expected to be dialyzable. Protamine 
      sulfate and vitamin K would not be expected to affect the anticoagulant 
      activity of apixaban. There is no experience with antifibrinolytic 
      agents (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid) in individuals receiving 
      apixaban. There is neither scientific rationale for reversal nor 
      experience with systemic hemostatics (desmopressin and aprotinin) in 
      individuals receiving apixaban. Use of procoagulant reversal agents such 
      as prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex 
      concentrate, or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered but has not 
      been evaluated in clinical studies. Activated charcoal reduces 
      absorption of apixaban thereby lowering apixaban plasma concentrations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Prosthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS has 
      not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is not 
      recommended in these patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ADVERSE REACTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with ELIQUIS 
      (apixaban) were related to bleeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DISCONTINUATIONS FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective 
      surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of 
      unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. ELIQUIS should be 
      discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive 
      procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be 
      noncritical in location and easily controlled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Strong Dual Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inhibitors of CYP3A4 
      and P-gp increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of 
      bleeding. Decrease the dose of ELIQUIS to 2.5 mg twice daily when 
      coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 
      P-gp, (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, or clarithromycin). 
      In patients already taking ELIQUIS at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, 
      avoid coadministration with strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Strong Dual Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inducers of CYP3A4 and 
      P-gp decrease exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of stroke. 
      Avoid concomitant use of ELIQUIS with strong dual inducers of CYP3A4 and 
      P-gp (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John&#8217;s wort) because 
      such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of 
      antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID 
      use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled 
      clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute coronary syndrome 
      patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and 
      clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with 
      apixaban compared to placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			PREGNANCY CATEGORY B
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELIQUIS in pregnant 
      women. Treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during 
      pregnancy and delivery. ELIQUIS should be used during pregnancy only if 
      the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and 
      fetus.

&lt;p&gt;(In May 3 story, corrects spelling to Donziger throughout
instead of Donzinger)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Casey Sullivan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 3 (Reuters) - The lawyer who has been defending
controversial plaintiffs attorney Steven Donziger in a lawsuit
by Chevron Corp, filed a motion on Friday to withdraw as
counsel, citing Donziger's inability to pay his legal bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney John Keker has been representing Donziger since
2011 in a case brought by Chevron alleging that Donziger
fabricated a long-running lawsuit alleging Chevron polluted an
Ecuadorian rainforest. Keker asked to withdraw as Donziger's
attorney in an 11-page motion that blamed New York federal court
Judge Lewis Kaplan for Donziger's financial predicament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keker's request to drop out of the case comes as Chevron 
aggressively pushes to overturn a $19 billion judgment that it
polluted the rainforest. In its lawsuit against Donziger,
Chevron claimed he used fraudulent tactics such as coordinating
the ghost writing of an environmental report that was held up as
independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keker said Donziger owes him and his San Francisco law firm,
Keker &amp; Van Nest, $1.4 million in unpaid fees. He said Kaplan 
allowed Chevron to conduct what he called a prolonged and
expensive litigation process with "dozens of fact depositions
... from Park Avenue to Peru," which caused Donziger's bills to
pile up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keker said he filed a request in March that Kaplan better
manage the trial to control legal costs, but Kaplan never
responded. Keker characterized the court as a hostile
environment for Donziger and his defense lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron's litigation tactics, which this court has endorsed
and encouraged throughout these proceedings  have made the
costs of this litigation unsustainable to Donziger," said Keker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More significantly, to even stay alive in this case  will
cost another six to ten million dollars in attorney time and
costs. With revenues in the billions of dollars, Chevron can
afford to litigate this case 'until hell freezes over.' But
Donziger can't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, Donziger will represent himself in the
Chevron case, Keker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger issued a news release on Friday addressing Keker's
withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he will try to find the resources to rehire his
counsel or to find substitute counsel, but he was not hopeful.
He said Chevron has filed papers indicating it has roughly 2,000
legal personnel and 60 law firms working to evade compliance
with the Ecuador court judgment, including 114 lawyers at Gibson
Dunn &amp; Crutcher, the primary Chevron law firm handling the New
York case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Donziger said that he works out of his
two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan with a non-legal assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said the company's conduct in trial has
been "proportionate to the magnitude of the fraud that's been
committed against our company and our shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, said Keker's move did
not surprise him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No reputable person, organization, or government would want
to be associated with this scheme," he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Kaplan was unavailable for comment on Friday.

			New York Parents Charge Pfizer Actively Concealed True Risks Of Birth 
      Defects To Infants From Zoloft When Prescribed To Mothers During 
      Pregnancy
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Wendy 
      R. Fleishman, a personal injury lawyer at the national plaintiffs' 
      law firm Lieff Cabraser Heimann  Bernstein, LLP, and co-counsel Jack 
      Meyerson and Debora O'Neill of Meyerson  O'Neill of Philadelphia, 
      announced that Kori and Jami Wolcott, residents of Rochester, New York, 
      filed a lawsuit against pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE), 
      for the permanent and devastating injuries their minor son suffered from 
      birth defects allegedly caused by Zoloft, an antidepressant prescription 
      drug manufactured and sold by Pfizer, Inc. that was prescribed to the 
      mother during her pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kori Wolcott's physician prescribed the Zoloft during her pregnancy. In 
      March 2003, the Wolcott's son, C.W., was born with multiple congenital 
      birth defects and malformations, including severe aortic valve stenosis, 
      which is an aortic valve disorder consisting of a narrowing of the aorta 
      causing obstruction of blood flow from leaving the heart to the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Complications of the disease include shortness of breath, fainting, 
      chest pain, and potentially fatal heart failure. In August 2003, baby 
      C.W. underwent surgery to enlarge his narrowed heart valve.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite the surgery, C.W.'s aortic valve stenosis is a permanent 
      condition with which he will struggle for the rest of his life. C.W.'s 
      heart has and must be continually monitored by specialists. He is at an 
      increased risk for future heart problems requiring surgery such as valve 
      replacement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      When taken by pregnant women, Zoloft and its generic version Sertraline 
      can enter the fetal bloodstream. Doctors have prescribed Zoloft to women 
      of childbearing age, as well as women already pregnant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The lawsuit, filed last week in New York state court, charges that 
      Pfizer knew or should have known that Zoloft was linked to serious birth 
      defects, including heart malformations, cranial defects, and abdominal 
      defects, and should have fully informed doctors and the public of these 
      risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We intend to prove that Pfizer knew of the risk of dangerous birth 
      defects associated with Zoloft and other antidepressant prescription 
      drugs when used during pregnancy both from preclinical studies and 
      subsequent published studies," stated Ms. Fleishman. "Yet, Pfizer took 
      no action to properly study the risk of birth defects linked to Zoloft. 
      Instead, the complaint charges, Pfizer concealed, suppressed, 
      downplayed, and failed to disclose these dangers."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint seeks to recover damages for the medical and other 
      expenses related to the treatment for C.W.'s birth defects, disorders, 
      and related illnesses. "As early as the 1990's, scientific studies began 
      to show a relationship between use of antidepressants during pregnancy 
      and serious birth defects," stated Ms. O'Neill. "Despite this medical 
      research, the complaint alleges, Pfizer failed, and continues to fail, 
      to warn that Zoloft increased the likelihood of serious birth defects."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "To this day, Pfizer still has not provided an adequate warning on the 
      Zoloft label to physicians, the medical community, and the public about 
      the increased risk of birth defects associated with Zoloft use during 
      pregnancy," added Ms. Fleishman.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA, May 6, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 1 1 Internet, Inc., www.1and1.com, a global leader among Web hosting providers, today becomes one of the first providers globally to offer a business-class email package based on Microsoft Exchange 2013. The specifications have been designed to help SMBs drive most value from email communication.&#160; Priced at $9.99/month per account, the new 1 1 Microsoft Exchange delivers 25GB capacity, the latest version of Outlook 2013, fully featured remote access to emails, mobile synchronization, as well as 1 1's industry-leading levels of uptime, security, anti-spam and anti-virus protection. &#160;
			
	Email volumes worldwide continue to increase as more public and private sector organizations switch from offline to online correspondence.&#160; As a result, consumer expectations have also risen around how timely and professional small businesses handle emails.&#160; With this in mind, 1 1's most recent hosted email package offers the very latest features for accessing, processing and archiving emails swiftly both in a desktop and mobile environment.&#160; &#160;
			
	The new 1 1 Microsoft Exchange package builds upon 1 1's previous popular version with new functionalities across important areas of use.&#160; Priced at $9.99/month per account, users receive 25 GB mailbox quota, customizable email via one free domain name, better team working with sharable contacts, calendars and tasks, synchronized mobile email via Outlook Web Access (OWA) with touch optimization for tablets and smartphone devices, and offline access to email messages using OWA caching.&#160; The new version offers excellent integration of other MS Office applications and a highly intuitive user-interface. &#160;
			
	All email data is stored in 1 1's own highly secure data center, and users benefit from 1 1's expert levels of uptime, security, anti-spam and anti-virus protection.&#160; 1 1's global backbone ensures that Microsoft Exchange packages offer high speed and robustness in sending and receiving business emails. 1 1 Microsoft Exchange uses a 'cloud-based' model meaning that users can scale their mailboxes up or down on a monthly basis with no lengthy contract, allowing them to adapt their requirements to workload or organizational needs, and only pay for what they need. &#160;
			
	While most companies today realize the value of business email, research shows that many SMBs are still using outdated email clients, and on-premise solutions at more risk to data loss.&#160; 1 1 advises all types of business to examine how their daily use of email is developing in relation to their business needs, and whether greater efficiency could help improve their bottom line.&#160; Many US companies could benefit from hosted email packages capable of enhancing email accessibility, email handling, and the level of security available to them. &#160;
			
	Since 2000, 1 1 has been at the forefront of promoting and driving the use of Web-based technologies for US small businesses.&#160; Having managed many thousands of Microsoft Exchange email packages, 1 1 leverages its global scale to deliver a high quality service to its customers.&#160; The company currently holds almost 12 million customer contracts worldwide and manages over 11 million domain names. &#160;

      interests in office buildings in the metropolitan Washington, DC area, 
      including property management companies ("the detailed agreements"). 
      The detailed agreements are subject to the satisfaction of certain 
      conditions precedent, including obtaining required consents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CARR will be engaged, directly and indirectly, in investment in rental 
      property, including management and maintenance of office buildings it 
      owns in the metropolitan Washington, DC area, as well as in acquisition 
      and development of land for rent in that area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CARR will have a full internal management staff with many years' 
      experience in the Washington, DC real estate market; it's President and 
      Chief Business Executive would be Mr. Oliver Carr III, who has been at 
      the helm of CP for the past decade. Upon closing, Mr. Nathan Hetz, 
      company&#8217;s CEO, will be appointed as the chairman of the board of CARR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upon closing of the transaction, the Company will hold an approximately 
      50% interest in CARR, identical to the holding stake of SSPF, in 
      exchange for investment of USD 300 million (NIS 1.1 billion), which has 
      been determined based on CARR shareholders' equity upon its 
      incorporation ("the investment").
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upon signing the detailed agreements, the Company deposited USD 10 
      million in escrow. The detailed agreements include provisions with 
      regard to this deposit and as to a mutually agreed payment (breakup 
      cost) should the transaction not be completed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Business environment:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Washington, DC office property market has been one of the most 
      stable in the USA since the early 1980s. The geography of the 
      metropolitan Washington, DC market includes the District of Columbia, 
      northern Virginia and southern Maryland ("the market").
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on a review dated April 2013, prepared by Jones Lang LaSalle, as 
      of March 2013, total office rental space in the Washington, DC area was 
      30 million m2 - being the second largest office property 
      market in North America. The vacancy rate in this market was 15.5% 
      (compared to 17% for the entire American office property market).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The volume of construction starts for office space in this market is at 
      2% of current rental property area. Total transactions in this office 
      property market in 2012 (purchase / sale of office space) amounted to 
      USD 5 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of March 2013, the average annual rental price in this market was USD 
      36 per square foot (compared to USD 29 per square foot in the entire 
      American office market). About 23% of total rented office space in this 
      market is rented to federal government agencies. The unemployment rate 
      in Washington, DC is the lowest of 40 major US cities - at 5.8% as of 
      March 2013 (compared to 7.7% on average for the USA).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			3.
			Data highlights:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pursuant to the detailed agreements, upon closing of the transaction 
      CARR would own, in whole or in part, 20 office buildings with total 
      rentable space of 350 thousand m2 ,valued at USD 1.1 billion 
      which CARR's share is 230 thousand m2 and USD 714 million, 
      respectively. These properties are leased to hundreds of tenants for 
      various terms, which in 2012 yielded net operating income (NOI) 
      amounting to USD 68 million which CARR's share in the NOI is USD 45 
      million. As of the end of 2012, the vacancy rate is 15.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, upon the closing date CARR would own 2 office buildings 
      that are under construction, with total rental space of 32 thousand m2, 
      valued USD 150 million. CARR would also own 2 plots of land to be 
      developed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Below are highlights of CARR's financial information from its pro-forma 
      financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012, prepared in 
      conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 
      including provisions of IAS 40, whereby rental property is stated at 
      fair value. Moreover, these financial statements were prepared under the 
      assumption that CARR would be incorporated in 2012.

			Company projections and intentions 
      with regard to the transaction:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on CARR's business plan, its strategy and shareholders' equity 
      (pro-forma) after the aforementioned investment by the Company, the 
      parties expect that the initial capitalization of CARR is sufficient to 
      permit CARR to achieve in coming years, through acquisition and 
      development of additional real estate, assets valued of approximately 
      USD 1.5 billion, by focusing on the office space sector in the 
      metropolitan Washington, DC area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is anticipated that CARR will be a Real Estate Investment Trust 
      (REIT). The Company expects an average annual dividend yield of 6% 
      throughout the first coming years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company intends to finance the investment in CARR, amounting to USD 
      300 million (NIS 1.1 billion) from its own resources, by partial 
      utilization of long-term bank borrowing facilities available to the 
      Company and by rising of equity / debt as needed. For information about 
      the Company's borrowing facilities, see the Company's 2012 annual report 
      published on March 18, 2013 (reference no. 2013-01-008017).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The parties expect the transaction closing, (which is subject to 
      customary adjustments and closing conditions, including obtaining 
      multiple approvals from third parties, such as joint venture partners, 
      banks and ground lessors) to take place in the third quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The information in this immediate report with regard to projected future 
      assets of CARR, obtaining financing sources for increasing CARR assets, 
      dividend yield, closing date of the transaction and likelihood of 
      obtaining all approvals for closing of this transaction, constitutes 
      forward-looking information as defined in Section 32a of the Securities 
      Act, 1968 and its materialization is uncertain and is outside of the 
      Company's control.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company will report any developments with regard to the 
      aforementioned transaction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nadia Damouni and David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's Jamie Dimon
may be losing ground in his fight to keep the title of chairman,
as some major investors push for more oversight of the chief
executive after the "London whale" trading losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the largest U.S. bank's annual meeting in two weeks,
shareholders will be able to vote on a non-binding proposal to
separate the chairman and CEO roles. Two of the bank's top 10
shareholders told Reuters they are considering voting in favor
of the proposal, a reversal of their position last year, because
of the disastrous bets on credit derivatives that cost the bank
more than $6 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal is only a non-binding recommendation and it is
not clear what the board will do if it passes. ISS Proxy
Advisory Services, the leading proxy advisory firm, on Friday
recommended investors support the proposal and also said they
should vote against the re-election of three directors who they
said had failed in their oversight of the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment for this story. The bank's
board has said it opposes the shareholder proposal and that the
company's handling of the trading loss shows its current
governance works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's directors are leading an aggressive campaign to
persuade shareholders to vote against it, one of the investors
said. It is not clear how much investor support there is for the
proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two JPMorgan investors, who were not authorized to speak
on the record, said that however the vote shakes out, they plan
to continue to push the bank's directors behind the scenes to
take at least some power from Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One investor said they will likely encourage the bank to
give more authority to its lead independent director, former
ExxonMobil Chief Executive Lee Raymond. At JPMorgan, the lead
director is currently known as the "presiding director," a role
that includes approving board agendas and schedules and leading
meetings of independent directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second investor said they would not be satisfied with
anything less than a separation of the two roles because being a
chairman is a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the vote is Dimon's reputation as the best
manager on Wall Street. The 57-year-old executive is still
viewed by many shareholders as a shrewd leader and they want him
to continue to run the bank, albeit with some oversight. Some
investors fear that Dimon will leave if he loses the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's difficulties began last year, when news emerged of
the London Whale trades. The bank has since had a series of
run-ins with regulators over issues ranging from money
laundering controls to allegations of power market manipulation.
JPMorgan's growing array of problems has overshadowed last
year's record profits in the minds of many investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORY PROBLEMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As investors ponder whether Dimon can provide enough
oversight to a bank with nearly $2.4 trillion of assets, their
doubts could give momentum to an idea held by a small but
growing minority of U.S. lawmakers and regulators that the
biggest banks are too big to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote also comes amid a broader debate in corporate
America over whether the head of a company should also lead the
directors that oversee the company. In the United Kingdom, the
two roles are typically separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Independence is the cornerstone of accountability," said
Joe Dear, chief investment officer at the California Public
Employees' Retirement System, which owns JPMorgan shares. "As a
principle, CalPERS believes boards should be chaired by an
independent director, and we support the separation of the CEO
and chair roles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear declined to comment specifically on JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholder proposal was sponsored by the American
Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees, New York City
and state of Connecticut employee retirement plans and the
United Kingdom's Hermes Fund Managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last year's meeting, the AFSCME was the sole sponsor of
the proposal, and it won 40 percent of investors' votes,
relatively high for a measure that the board had opposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's vote happened only five days after the company
first acknowledged its bad bets on credit derivatives. Since
then, shareholders have learned much more about the company's
failed risk controls and the trouble it has had with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISS, which is also known as Institutional Shareholder
Services, had supported last year's proposal, but this year
added a two-page analysis that concluded the London Whale loss
had displayed the board's lack of independence from Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second proxy advisory firm, Glass, Lewis &amp; Co, endorsed
last year's proposal but has yet to announce its recommendation
for this year's vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has had other problems recently. U.S. government
investigators have found that a JPMorgan unit manipulated
trading in the California and Michigan electricity markets, the
New York Times reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the
bank's main regulators, is also considering censuring the bank
for failing to conduct adequate due diligence and report
suspicions about Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff, Reuters first
reported last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his annual letter to shareholders, Dimon said executives
throughout the bank are putting other projects on hold or
scaling them back, so they can focus on the bank's regulatory
obligations. Dozens of these projects are on the back burner
now, a source familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Media giant Walt Disney Co reported a 32 percent increase in profit that beat Wall Street expectations, boosted by higher spending and attendance at U.S. theme parks, and the movie box office success of "Oz the Great and Powerful."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the company that operates cable networks, theme parks and a movie studio increased 10 percent to $10.6 billion. At the parks division, revenue gained 14 percent and operating income climbed 73 percent as resorts in Florida and California attracted more visitors and guests spent more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Bob Iger said Disney parks drew more visitors thanks to investments in new attractions such as Cars Land at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, and the expansion of Fantasyland at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The product that we recently put online really worked, like California Adventure and Fantasyland, and the product we had online for years and years in many respects looked better to consumers," Iger told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit rose 8 percent at the media networks unit, the company's largest division, helped by higher advertising and fees from cable operators at sports network ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those strong performances helped offset a poor showing by the broadcasting division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating income declined by 40 percent at the broadcasting unit, as the ABC television network brought in less advertising revenue amid a ratings slump and higher programming costs. Iger said he wanted a stronger primetime lineup at the channel, with more shows produced by ABC rather than other studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could use a few more hits, and certainly a few more hits that we own," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, net income increased 32 percent from a year earlier to $1.5 billion for January through March, Disney said on Tuesday.

This year, the "Wizard of Oz" prequel lifted second-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio also is looking at a big third quarter with current blockbuster "Iron Man 3," a Marvel superhero sequel that has grossed $711 million around the world since its release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is working on sequels to the "Star Wars" franchise after last year's $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm. The company is also developing "Star Wars" properties for television and parks, Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interactive gaming division recorded a loss of $54 million. Iger had set a goal of turning the unit profitable in 2013.

California Adventure and Fantasyland, and the product we had
online for years and years in many respects looked better to
consumers," Iger told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit rose 8 percent at the media networks unit, the

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on
Tuesday it is starting a $4 billion project to develop the Julia
oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial production is expected to begin in 2016 at 34,000
barrels per day, the company said. The field is estimated to
hold an estimated 6 billion barrels of oil and comprises five
leases in the ultra-deepwater Walker Ridge area of the Gulf of

Julia. Statoil ASA holds the other 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia is one of a string of potentially huge discoveries in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP Plc, Chevron Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc
 are all developing possible large fields in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A judge on Tuesday ruled that Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) chief executive must testify in the U.S. oil company's fraud case against Ecuadoreans seeking to collect on a $19 billion judgment against Chevron related to rainforest pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Watson, who became CEO of Chevron in 2010 and had helped integrate Texaco after Chevron's 2001 purchase of the company gave it ownership of the long-running Ecuador case, could give his deposition before an end-of-May deadline for evidence-gathering ahead of the October fraud trial in New York, a spokesman for the Ecuadoreans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be sure, the rancorous history of this litigation lends credibility to Chevron's concern that the deposition has been noticed for purposes of harassment," James Francis, a magistrate judge in federal court in Manhattan, wrote in his ruling. "On the other hand, there is little doubt that Mr. Watson has relevant knowledge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond his monitoring of the litigation in the three years since he became CEO, Watson's experience leading the integration of Chevron-Texaco likely gave him personal knowledge of the issues underlying the Ecuador trial, Francis wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is far from a trivial case," he added. "Enough is at stake to justify the deposition of an apex witness like Mr. Watson."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in a statement that it "will of course comply with all orders of the court as it participates in the discovery process that continues to expose the plaintiffs' lawyers' fraud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean plaintiffs won the $19 billion-dollar judgment in their own country in 2011, after having first brought the case in New York court in 1993 before it moved to South America about a decade later. The environmental damage was supposedly caused by Texaco when it operated in Ecuador from 1964 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says the Ecuador ruling is based on tainted evidence and therefore unenforceable. The Ecuadoreans have yet to collect on the award and are trying to enforce the judgment in countries where Chevron operates. Their action in Canada was halted by a judge there last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis also ruled that depositions could be taken from Edward Scott, general counsel of Chevron's global upstream and gas group, and Kroll Inc, an investigative and risk management company that Chevron retained in connection with the various related litigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capital cost for the project, which is expected to begin oil production 
      in 2016, is estimated to be more than $4 billion. The field was

      of resource in place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The development of Julia will provide a new source of domestic energy 
      and well-paying jobs over the next several years,&#8221; said Neil W. Duffin,

      as Julia will contribute to U.S. energy security for many years to come.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The initial development phase is being designed for daily production of 
      34,000 barrels of oil and includes six wells with subsea tie-backs to 
      the Jack  St. Malo production facility operated by Chevron U.S.A. Inc.

			Cable Networks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Cable Networks increased $224 million to $1.7 
      billion for the quarter due to growth at ESPN. Higher operating income 
      at ESPN was due to increased affiliate revenues and, to a lesser extent, 
      higher advertising revenues, partially offset by increased programming 
      and production costs. Increased affiliate revenues at ESPN were 
      primarily due to contractual rate increases, a reduction in revenue 
      deferrals as a result of changes in provisions related to annual 
      programming commitments in certain affiliate contracts and international 
      subscriber growth. During the quarter, ESPN deferred $120 million of 
      revenue compared to $190 million in the prior-year quarter. Growth in 
      ESPN advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in units sold 
      and higher rates, partially offset by lower ratings in certain of our 
      programming. The increase in programming costs was driven by contractual 
      rate increases for college sports.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Broadcasting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Broadcasting decreased $91 million to $138 million 
      for the quarter due to higher primetime programming costs and a decrease 
      in advertising revenue at the ABC Television Network, partially offset 
      by an increase in advertising revenue at the owned television stations. 
      Higher primetime programming costs were driven by increased production 
      cost write-offs and higher cost acquired programming. The decrease in 
      network advertising revenue was primarily due to lower ratings, 
      partially offset by higher rates and increased online advertising.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parks and Resorts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 14% to $3.3 billion 
      and segment operating income increased 73% to $383 million. Results for 
      the quarter were driven by increases at our domestic operations and, to 
      a lesser extent, at our international operations. Results at both our 
      domestic and international parks and resorts reflected a favorable 
      impact due to a shift in the timing of the New Year's and Easter 
      holidays relative to our fiscal periods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher operating income at our domestic operations was primarily due to 
      increased guest spending and attendance at both Walt Disney World Resort 
      and Disneyland Resort, the addition of the Disney Fantasy cruise 
      ship, which launched in March 2012, and higher occupied room nights at 
      the Walt Disney World Resort. These increases were partially offset by 
      increased costs. Increased guest spending was due to higher average 
      ticket prices, food, beverage and merchandise spending and daily hotel 
      room rates. Higher costs were driven by new guest offerings, including 
      investments in systems infrastructure at Walt Disney World Resort and 
      resort expansion at Disneyland Resort, as well as labor and other cost 
      inflation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher operating income from our international operations reflected 
      higher guest spending at Disneyland Paris and increased attendance at 
      Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by the absence of business 
      interruption insurance proceeds related to Tokyo Disney Resort, which 
      were collected in the prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Studio Entertainment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Studio Entertainment revenues increased 13% to $1.3 billion and segment 
      operating income increased $202 million to $118 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher operating income for the quarter was driven by lower film 
      impairments, due to the write-down on John Carter in the prior 
      year, and an increase in worldwide theatrical distribution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide theatrical distribution results reflected the strong 
      performance of Oz The Great And Powerful and Wreck-it Ralph 
      in the current quarter compared to John Carter in the prior-year 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumer Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer Products revenues increased 12% to $763 million and segment 
      operating income increased 35% to $200 million. Higher operating income 
      was primarily due to increases at Merchandise Licensing and at our 
      retail business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase at Merchandise Licensing was driven by the performance of 
      Disney Channel, Mickey and Minnie, and Marvel properties, partially 
      offset by lower revenue from sales of Cars merchandise. Merchandise 
      Licensing growth also benefited from a licensee audit settlement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At our retail business, higher operating income was driven by higher 
      comparable store sales in North America and Japan and higher online 
      sales in North America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Interactive
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive revenues for the quarter increased 8% to $194 million and 
      segment operating results improved by $16 million to a loss of $54 
      million. Higher operating results were due to growth at our Japan mobile 
      business from a licensing agreement that started in February 2012 and 
      lower acquisition accounting expense at our social games business.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased $9 million to $129 
      million for the quarter. The increase was driven by the timing of 
      allocations to the operating segments and higher charitable 
      contributions.

      The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the quarter was 
      primarily due to favorable tax adjustments related to pre-tax earnings 
      in prior years. These favorable tax adjustments reduced the effective 
      income tax rate by 4.5 percentage points.

			Noncontrolling Interests

      Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $25

      Capital expenditures decreased from $2.1 billion to $1.1 billion driven 
      by a decrease at Parks and Resorts due to the final progress payment in 
      the prior-year period for the Disney Fantasy cruise ship. 
      The decrease in Parks and Resorts spending also reflected significant 
      spending in the prior-year period for the expansion of Disney California 
      Adventure and for the construction of Disney's Art of Animation Resort. 
      These decreases were partially offset by higher spending in the current 
      year for Shanghai Disney Resort.

			Non-GAAP Financial Measures

		&lt;p&gt;
      This earnings release presents EPS excluding the impact of certain 
      items, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income, all of 
      which are important financial measures for the Company but are not 
      financial measures defined by GAAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP 
      financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of EPS, 
      cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. EPS 
      excluding certain items, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating 
      income as we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly 
      titled measures reported by other companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EPS excluding certain items &#8211; The Company 
      uses EPS excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the 
      Company&#8217;s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the 
      comparability of results from period to period. The Company believes 
      that information about EPS exclusive of these impacts is useful to 
      investors, particularly where the impact of the excluded items is 
      significant in relation to reported earnings, because the measure allows 
      for comparability between periods of the operating performance of the 
      Company&#8217;s business and allows investors to evaluate the impact of these 
      items separately from the impact of the operations of the business.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      items:

			Free cash flow &#8211; The Company uses free cash 
      flow (cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and 
      other property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its 
      operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than 
      capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free 
      cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash 
      available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments 
      and pay dividends or repurchase shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Aggregate segment operating income &#8211; The 
      Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on 
      segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment 
      operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses 
      separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that 
      information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors 
      by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the 
      Company&#8217;s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors 
      that affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both 
      operations and the other factors that affect reported results.

      Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or

        technological developments.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Such developments&#160;may affect travel and leisure businesses generally and 
      may, among other things, affect:

      $377.2 million for the first quarter of 2012. The results for the first 
      quarter of 2013 included $0.3 million of after-tax losses ($0.5 million 
      on a pre-tax basis) due to mark-to-market adjustments on commodity 
      hedges and a $0.4 million decrease to tax expense due to certain 
      favorable tax items associated with the American Taxpayer Relief Act 
      (H.R.8) enacted on January 2, 2013 and other income tax changes. The 
      results for the first quarter of 2012 included a $0.9 million increase 
      in income tax expense due to the recording of valuation allowance for 
      certain deferred tax assets and other income tax changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $4.7 million in the first 
      quarter of 2013, or comparable basic net income per share of $.51, 
      versus $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2012, or comparable basic 
      net income per share of $.60.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following table reconciles reported GAAP net income and basic net 
      income per share to comparable net income and basic net income per share 
      for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012:

			(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow 
      investors to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business 
      trends for the first quarters of 2013 and 2012. Management uses this 
      information to review results excluding items that are not necessarily 
      indicative of ongoing results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, &#8220;Our announcement on 
      April 16th of our signing of a Letter of Intent with The 
      Coca-Cola Company was a very significant event for the Company. We have 
      been focused on growing our business in many ways over the years, and 
      this opportunity with The Coca-Cola Company provides for growth in 
      contiguous territories, allowing us to leverage our current 
      infrastructure and operational capabilities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hank Flint, President and COO, added, &#8220;The first quarter was challenging 
      with a cautious consumer impacted by higher taxes and fuel prices as 
      well as cooler than average weather across most of our franchise 
      territory. We were pleased that even in a tough operating environment, 
      we were able to grow revenue and continue to diligently manage our 
      operating expenses. With the seasonal nature of our business, our focus 
      will be on our peak revenue months in the second and third quarters and 
      creating value for our customers, consumers and shareholders.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Cautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Included in this news release and other information that we make 
      publicly available from time to time are forward-looking management 
      comments and other statements that reflect management&#8217;s current outlook 
      for future periods.
			These statements include, among others, 
      statements regarding the challenges we face in 2013: moving forward on 
      the proposed territory growth transactions that are described in the 
      Letter of Intent dated April 15, 2013 with The Coca-Cola Company that we 
      believe provide us with the opportunity for growth in contiguous 
      territories that will allow us to leverage our current infrastructure 
      and operational capabilities; the diligent management of our operating 
      expenses; the focus on our peak revenue months and the continuation of 
      creating value for our customer, consumers and
			shareholders.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			These statements and expectations are based on currently available 
      competitive, financial and economic data along with our operating plans 
      and are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause 
      anticipated events not to occur or actual results to differ materially 
      from historical or anticipated results.
			Among the events or 
      uncertainties which could adversely affect future periods are: lower 
      than expected selling pricing resulting from increased marketplace 
      competition; changes in how significant customers market or promote our 
      products; changes in our top customer relationships; changes in public 
      and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages; unfavorable 
      changes in the general economy; miscalculation of our need for 
      infrastructure investment; our inability to meet requirements under 
      beverage agreements; material changes in the performance requirements 
      for marketing funding support or our inability to meet such 
      requirements; decreases from historic levels of marketing funding 
      support; changes in
			The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s and other beverage 
      companies&#8217; levels of advertising, marketing and spending on brand 
      innovation; the inability of our aluminum can or plastic bottle 
      suppliers to meet our purchase requirements; our inability to offset 
      higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased 
      bottle/can sales volume or reduced expenses; sustained increases in fuel 
      costs or our inability to secure adequate supplies of fuel; sustained 
      increases in workers&#8217; compensation, employment practices and vehicle 
      accident claims costs; sustained increases in the cost of employee 
      benefits; product liability claims or product recalls; technology 
      failures; changes in interest rates; the impact of debt levels on 
      operating flexibility and access to capital and credit markets; adverse 
      changes in our credit rating (whether as a result of our operations or 
      prospects or as a result of those of The Coca-Cola Company or other 
      bottlers in the Coca-Cola system); changes in legal contingencies; 
      legislative changes affecting our distribution and packaging; adoption 
      of significant product labeling or warning requirements; additional 
      taxes resulting from tax audits; natural disasters and unfavorable 
      weather; global climate change or legal or regulatory responses to such 
      change; issues surrounding labor relations; bottler system disputes; our 
      use of estimates and assumptions; changes in accounting standards; 
      impact of obesity and health concerns on product demand; public policy 
      challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools; the impact of 
      volatility in the financial markets on access to the credit markets; the 
      impact of acquisitions of bottlers by their franchisors; and the 
      concentration of our capital stock ownership.
			The forward-looking 
      statements in this news release should be read in conjunction with the 
      more detailed descriptions of the above factors located in our Annual 
      Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2012 under Part I, 
      Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; as well as those additional factors we may 
      describe from time to time in other filings with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission.

&lt;p&gt;Two banking sources said that Al Helaissi would become the deputy central bank governor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of Al Helaissi, who is also JPMorgan Chase's regional corporate banking head, is the latest move by Saudi Arabia to tap senior executives from leading global financial institutions to run its key state entities.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
must face fraud claims brought by CIFG Assurance North America
 over insurance it provided for $275 million in
mortgage-backed securities, a New York state appeals court ruled

&lt;p&gt;CIFG claimed in a 2011 lawsuit that the investment bank
fraudulently induced it to provide insurance for a portfolio of
more than 6,000 subprime residential mortgages by concealing the
shoddy quality of the loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial judge in Manhattan threw out that claim last year,
ruling that CIFG would have uncovered the alleged
misrepresentations had it performed proper due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York State Supreme Court's Appellate Division, First
Department, reversed on Tuesday, finding that CIFG had done
enough by having an outside consultant analyze the loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a question of fact as to whether plaintiff
reasonably relied on defendants' representations," a five-judge
panel wrote in a unanimous decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman, declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling also revived fraud claims against M Bank Corp
, one of several originators that sold the loans to
Goldman. An M Bank spokesman did not immediately respond to a

and MBIA Inc, have also filed lawsuits claiming banks
misled them into insuring toxic mortgage-backed securities
before the housing market meltdown by concealing major risk in
the underlying loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's ruling also let stand breach of contract claims
against Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIFG is seeking compensation for claims as well as buy-backs
of defective loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very pleased with the decision, and we look forward

			Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer Announce Publication of ARISTOTLE 
      Subanalysis in Circulation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Subgroup analysis demonstrates that the treatment effects of Eliquis&#174; 
        (apixaban) vs. warfarin, across a broad range of warfarin control, are 
        consistent with primary results of ARISTOTLE
			
			
				ARISTOTLE studied Eliquis vs. warfarin for the reduction of the 
        risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular 
        atrial fibrillation
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer 
      Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that results from a prespecified 
      subanalysis of the ARISTOTLE trial were published in Circulation, 
      the peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association. Results 
      from this subanalysis showed that the reductions in stroke or systemic 
      embolism, number of major bleeding events and mortality demonstrated 
      with Eliquis&#174; (apixaban) compared to warfarin in the 
      ARISTOTLE trial were consistent across subgroups defined based on levels 
      of International Normalized Ratio (INR) control in patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Concerning the quality of warfarin treatment, there is a large 
      variation in time in therapeutic range among different countries and 
      centers, which affects outcomes. This subanalysis was conducted to 
      determine whether the treatment effects of apixaban were similar in 
      centers and patients with high quality warfarin care,&#8221; said study lead 
      author Dr. Lars Wallentin of Uppsala University in Uppsala, Sweden. 
      &#8220;These additional analyses supported that the primary results of 
      ARISTOTLE were consistent across a broad range of quality of warfarin 
      management.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Variations in time in therapeutic range (TTR) can affect outcomes for 
      atrial fibrillation patients being treated with Vitamin K antagonists 
      such as warfarin for stroke prevention, leading to an increased risk of 
      stroke when INR levels are below, or bleeding when INR levels are above, 
      the therapeutic range. For patients in the ARISTOTLE trial, the quality 
      of warfarin management was defined by TTR, with a target INR of 2.0 &#8211; 
      3.0. In the ARISTOTLE trial, patients in the warfarin group had an INR 
      in the therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) for a median of 66.0% of the time. 
      For context, the median time for INR in the therapeutic range varies 
      across the globe. In clinical practice settings in the United States, it 
      is approximately 57-59%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ARISTOTLE trial randomized 18,201 patients from 1,034 clinical 
      centers in 39 countries. In this subanalysis, for each patient, a center 
      average TTR (cTTR) was estimated using a linear mixed model based on the 
      real TTRs in warfarin treated patients with a fixed effect for country 
      and random effect for center. Study centers were placed into one of four 
      similarly sized quartile groups based on cTTR (60.5%; 60.6%-66.3%; 
      66.4%-71.1%; and&#160;&#160;71.2%). The rates of stroke or systemic embolism, 
      major bleeding and mortality were consistently lower with Eliquis 
      than warfarin across the cTTR quartiles. Similar results were seen when 
      an individual TTR (iTTR), predicted using a model including patient 
      characteristics, was examined in a post-hoc analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While demonstrating consistency across a broad range of warfarin 
      control, results of this subanalysis suggest a trend toward reduction of 
      the treatment effects at centers and in patients with predicted 
      excellent INR control. In these centers, interaction tests are less 
      reliable because of low numbers of events, and thereby lack statistical 
      power.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on the results of the subanalysis, the benefits of Eliquis 
      compared with warfarin for stroke or systemic embolism, bleeding, and 
      mortality appear similar across the range of centers&#8217; and patients&#8217; 
      quality of INR control.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About ARISTOTLE Trial Design
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ARISTOTLE study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety 
      of Eliquis versus warfarin for the prevention of stroke or 
      systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In 
      ARISTOTLE, 18,201 patients were randomized (9,120 patients to Eliquis 
      and 9,081 to warfarin). ARISTOTLE was an active-controlled, randomized, 
      double-blind, multi-national trial in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation or atrial flutter, and at least one additional risk factor 
      for stroke. Patients were randomized to treatment with Eliquis 5 
      mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients, 
      representing 4.7 percent of all patients) or warfarin (target INR range 
      2.0-3.0), and followed for a median of 1.8 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Atrial Fibrillation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia (irregular 
      heart beat). It is estimated that more than 5.8 million Americans and 6 
      million individuals in Europe have atrial fibrillation. Nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation, or NVAF, is the most common type of atrial 
      fibrillation. The lifetime risk of developing atrial fibrillation is 
      estimated to be approximately 25 percent for individuals 40 years of age 
      or older. One of the most serious medical concerns for individuals with 
      atrial fibrillation is the increased risk of stroke, which is five times 
      higher in people with atrial fibrillation than those without atrial 
      fibrillation. In fact, 15 percent of all strokes are attributable to 
      atrial fibrillation in the U.S. Additionally, strokes due to atrial 
      fibrillation are more burdensome than strokes due to other causes. 
      Atrial fibrillation-related strokes are more severe than other strokes, 
      with an associated 30-day mortality of 24 percent and a 50 percent 
      likelihood of death within one year in patients who are not treated with 
      an antithrombotic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Eliquis&#174;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Eliquis&#174; (apixaban) is an oral direct Factor Xa 
      inhibitor. By inhibiting Factor Xa, a key blood clotting protein, Eliquis 
      prevents thrombin generation and blood clot formation. Eliquis is 
      approved to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients 
      with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the United States, European 
      Union, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Columbia, Russia, Israel and 
      Australia. Eliquis is approved for prevention of venous 
      thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone 
      elective hip or knee replacement surgery in a total of 17 regions: 
      Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, European Union (which 
      includes 27 member states plus Iceland and Norway), Hong Kong, India, 
      Indonesia, Israel, Peru, Russia, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand, 
      Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

			IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ELIQUIS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BOXED WARNING: DISCONTINUING ELIQUIS IN PATIENTS WITHOUT ADEQUATE 
      CONTINUOUS ANTICOAGULATION INCREASES RISK OF STROKE.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discontinuing ELIQUIS places patients at an increased risk of 
      thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed following 
      discontinuation of ELIQUIS in clinical trials in patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS must be 
      discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding, coverage 
      with another anticoagulant should be strongly considered.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CONTRAINDICATIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Active pathological bleeding
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ELIQUIS (apixaban) (i.e., 
      anaphylactic reactions)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Increased Risk of Stroke with Discontinuation of ELIQUIS: Discontinuing 
      ELIQUIS in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases 
      the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed 
      during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in 
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. If ELIQUIS must be 
      discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding, consider 
      coverage with another anticoagulant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bleeding Risk: ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can 
      cause serious, potentially fatal bleeding. Concomitant use of drugs 
      affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding including aspirin 
      and other anti-platelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, 
      thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs. Patients should be made 
      aware of signs or symptoms of blood loss and instructed to immediately 
      report to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active 
      pathological hemorrhage. There is no established way to reverse the 
      anticoagulant effect of apixaban, which can be expected to persist for 
      about 24 hours after the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). A 
      specific antidote for ELIQUIS is not available. Because of high plasma 
      protein binding, apixaban is not expected to be dialyzable. Protamine 
      sulfate and vitamin K would not be expected to affect the anticoagulant 
      activity of apixaban. There is no experience with antifibrinolytic 
      agents (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid) in individuals receiving 
      apixaban. There is neither scientific rationale for reversal nor 
      experience with systemic hemostatics (desmopressin and aprotinin) in 
      individuals receiving apixaban. Use of procoagulant reversal agents such 
      as prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex 
      concentrate, or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered but has not 
      been evaluated in clinical studies. Activated charcoal reduces 
      absorption of apixaban thereby lowering apixaban plasma concentrations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Prosthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS has 
      not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is not 
      recommended in these patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ADVERSE REACTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with ELIQUIS 
      (apixaban) were related to bleeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DISCONTINUATIONS FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective 
      surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of 
      unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. ELIQUIS should be 
      discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive 
      procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be 
      noncritical in location and easily controlled.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DRUG INTERACTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Strong Dual Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inhibitors of CYP3A4 
      and P-gp increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of 
      bleeding. Decrease the dose of ELIQUIS to 2.5 mg twice daily when 
      coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 
      P-gp, (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, or clarithromycin). 
      In patients already taking ELIQUIS at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, 
      avoid coadministration with strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Strong Dual Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inducers of CYP3A4 and 
      P-gp decrease exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of stroke. 
      Avoid concomitant use of ELIQUIS with strong dual inducers of CYP3A4 and 
      P-gp (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John&#8217;s wort) because 
      such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of 
      antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID 
      use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled 
      clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute coronary syndrome 
      patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and 
      clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with 
      apixaban compared to placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			PREGNANCY CATEGORY B
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELIQUIS in pregnant 
      women. Treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during 
      pregnancy and delivery. ELIQUIS should be used during pregnancy only if 
      the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and 
      fetus.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A second proxy advisory firm has said that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) should have an independent board chairman over its chief executive officer as well as some new directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis &amp; Co said in a report on Tuesday that shareholders should vote for a non-binding proposal calling for a chairman who is independent of the chief executive.

Futter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate over whether Dimon and other JPMorgan directors provide enough oversight to an institution with nearly $2.4 trillion of assets is adding attention to arguments by lawmakers and regulators over whether the biggest banks are too big to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest bank in the United States by assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;* Glass Lewis calls for votes against six directors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Proxy adviser is second firm to call for changes in board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Investors push for more oversight of CEO Jamie Dimon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - A second proxy advisory firm has
said that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co should have an independent
board chairman over its chief executive officer as well as some
new directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis &amp; Co said in a report on Tuesday that
shareholders should vote for a non-binding proposal calling for
a chairman who is independent of the chief executive. Jamie
Dimon now holds both positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm also recommended against re-electing six of the 11
directors on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report follows similar advice last week from ISS Proxy
Advisor Services ahead of the bank's annual meeting on May 21.
Both firms said the company's $6.2 billion "London Whale"
trading loss showed that the board failed in its oversight of
executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the bank's top 10 shareholders have told Reuters that
they may vote for the reform proposal after previously siding
with the board and management last year against a similar
resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman said over the weekend that the
company disagreed with ISS's views. The board has said it
opposes the proposal for an independent chairman and that the
company's handling of the trading loss shows its current
governance works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports from the advisory firms add to pressure on Dimon
and the board that has been building since the London Whale loss
surfaced a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Institutional money managers use reports from advisory firms
when they decide how to vote on proxy issues on behalf of their
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fund managers said privately last week that even if the
resolution for an independent chairman fails they will push the
company behind closed doors for more oversight of Dimon and
other managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both advisory firms last year endorsed the similar
resolution for an independent chairman. That resolution received
40 percent of the vote, or about five percentage points more
than similar proposals at other companies that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firms' new reports go further, by spelling out
governance problems revealed by investigations into the Whale
debacle and by calling for new directors to revitalize the
board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis recommended votes against three more of the
directors nominated by the board than did ISS. The three are
James A. Bell, Crandall C. Bowles and Laban P. Jackson and are

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp extended the revenue guarantee it provides to Yahoo Inc in the companies' underperforming search partnership, Yahoo said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

			The Coca-Cola Company Commits $2 Billion to Support Planting of 
      25,000 Acres of New Orange Groves in Florida
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cutrale Citrus Juices and Peace River Citrus Products to plant 12,500 
      acres each
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The future of Florida orange juice is looking brighter today. Coca-Cola 
      is supporting the state&#8217;s largest citrus planting in 25 years with a 
      commitment to purchase approximately $2 billion of oranges produced by 
      the new groves. Partnering with Cutrale Citrus Juices and Peace River 
      Citrus Products, Coca-Cola&#8217;s investment will enable the growers to plant 
      25,000 acres of orange trees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through this collaboration Coca-Cola will procure all of the fruit 
      produced by these trees over the next 20 years. According to a 25-year 
      study conducted by the Florida Department of Citrus, this initiative 
      will add more than 4,100 direct and indirect jobs to the state economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Citrus is synonymous with Florida, but the industry has faced many 
      challenges in recent years, particularly the growing threat of citrus 
      greening,&#8221; said Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam. &#8220;With 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s generous investment towards supporting 25,000 acres of new 
      orange groves in Central Florida, the citrus industry and our state&#8217;s 
      entire economy will benefit.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has played an active role in the Florida citrus industry since 
      purchasing Minute Maid&#174; in 1960. Today, the Company operates 26 
      facilities in Florida, employing 6,100 associates. Over the last five 
      years, The Coca-Cola Company has invested more than $400 million in its 
      operations throughout the state. Most recently, the Auburndale facility, 
      which produces Simply&#174; juices, underwent a significant expansion. Adding 
      a new production line and increased warehouse space, this multi-million 
      dollar project created 129 new jobs, bringing the total number of 
      facility employees to more than 500.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Coca-Cola Company is proud to be part of this investment in Florida 
      and its citrus industry. A thriving Florida citrus industry is critical 
      to helping us build our Simply and Minute Maid juice brands,&#8221; said Steve 
      Cahillane, President, Coca-Cola Americas. &#8220;Through viable partnerships 
      and meaningful investment with Cutrale and Peace River, we together will 
      foster sustainable, responsible growth in Florida. This is good news for 
      the state&#8217;s citrus industry, our business and the communities we serve.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company is the leading marketer of fruit juices and drinks 
      in the United States and globally. In the U.S., the Minute Maid and 
      Simply brands offer more than 100 different varieties, including 
      low-calorie options. In partnership with Cutrale Citrus Juices, 
      Coca-Cola purchases nearly a third of all Florida oranges grown by more 
      than 400 local growers. The Company continues to expand its juice 
      offerings, in both the Minute Maid and Simply brand portfolios, to 
      provide people with great-tasting, high quality juices and juice drinks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola&#8217;s commitment to purchase all of the fruit from the new groves 
      enables us to play a role in helping restore Florida&#8217;s citrus industry 
      with the largest planting of orange trees in 25 years,&#8221; said Jose Luis 
      Cutrale, Chief Executive Officer of Cutrale Citrus Juices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sustainable Agriculture
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company encourages its partners to use sustainable, 
      responsible agricultural management practices. Initiatives that reduce 
      the amount of pesticides and fertilizers and the volume of water used to 
      grow crops limit the impact on local communities. For this citrus 
      planting project, Cutrale and Peace River will implement agricultural 
      practices that lessen the use of local water resources. For example, 
      they will capture and reuse rainwater for irrigation. Peace River will 
      also utilize a high-efficiency, micro-jet irrigation system that 
      requires 50 percent less groundwater. Cutrale will employ water 
      efficiency methods and help control water use through a soil moisture 
      monitoring process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Water is one of our most precious natural resources and we are 
      committed to leveraging technology to help us implement sustainable 
      agricultural practices throughout our groves,&#8221; said Bill Becker, 
      President of Peace River Citrus Products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2010, The Coca-Cola Company and Cutrale Citrus Juices pledged $1.5 
      million each to the University of Florida&#8217;s Citrus Research and 
      Development Foundation. This grant furthers critical research to help 
      address Huanglongbing disease, commonly known as citrus greening.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 7 (Reuters) - A second proxy advisory firm has
said that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co should have an independent
board chairman over its chief executive officer and should have
some new directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis &amp; Co said in a report on Tuesday that
shareholders should vote for a non-binding proposal calling for
a chairman who is independent of the chief executive. Jamie
Dimon now holds both positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis also recommended against re-electing six of the
11 directors on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report follows similar advice last week from ISS Proxy
Advisor Services ahead of the bank's annual meeting on May 21.
Both firms said the company's $6.2 billion "London Whale"
trading loss showed that the board failed in its oversight of
executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman said over the weekend that the
company disagreed with ISS's views. The board has said it
opposes the proposal for an independent chairman and that the
company's handling of the trading loss shows its current
governance works.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      OncoSec Medical Inc. is&#160;a biopharmaceutical company&#160;developing its 
      advanced-stage ImmunoPulse DNA-based immunotherapy and NeoPulse therapy 
      to treat solid tumor cancers.&#160;ImmunoPulse and NeoPulse therapies&#160;address 
      an unmet medical need&#160;and&#160;represent&#160;a potential solution, for less 
      invasive and less expensive therapies that are able to minimize 
      detrimental effects resulting from currently available cancer treatments 
      such as surgery, systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy and other 
      treatment alternatives. OncoSec Medical's core technology is based upon 
      its proprietary&#160;use of an&#160;electroporation platform to&#160;dramatically 
      enhance&#160;the&#160;delivery and uptake of a locally delivered DNA-based 
      immunocytokine (ImmunoPulse) or chemotherapeutic agent&#160;(NeoPulse). 
      Treatment of&#160;various solid cancers&#160;using these powerful&#160;and 
      targeted&#160;anti-cancer agents&#160;has demonstrated&#160;selective destruction of 
      cancerous cells&#160;while sparing healthy normal tissues during early and 
      late stage clinical trials. OncoSec's clinical programs include three 
      Phase II clinical trials for ImmunoPulse targeting lethal skin cancers.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) has yet to convince three of its largest shareholders to support the company in an upcoming vote on whether Jamie Dimon should retain both his CEO and Chairman titles, the Wall Street Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors are pushing for a separation in Dimon's roles and seeking more oversight due to the "London Whale" trading losses. Votes on the non-binding recommendation will be tallied on May 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investors, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Vanguard Group Inc and Fidelity Investments - which together control 12 percent of the shares - are still on the fence, the Journal said quoting people close to the firms. (r.reuters.com/kek87t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the bank's top 10 shareholders have told Reuters that they will consider voting in favor of the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's $6.2 billion loss stemmed from bets by London-based Chief Investment Office trader Bruno Iksil on an index for credit default swaps. His outsized positions earned him the nickname "London Whale" from hedge fund traders taking the other sides of his positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three investors and JPMorgan were not immediately for comment outside U.S. business hours. The bank's board has said it opposes the shareholder proposal and that the company's handling of the trading loss shows its current governance works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Pallavi Ail in Bangalore; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, the 
      primary assets of which four loans secured by 82 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate pooled principal balance of $505,000,000 as of the 
      cutoff date. The loans were originated by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National 
      Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Low Trust-Level Leverage: The weighted average pooled Fitch's stressed 
      LTV and DSCR are 69.90% and 1.44x, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concentrated by Loan and Property Type: The pool is secured by only four 
      loans, two of which are hotels (64.2%). The remaining two loans are a 
      portfolio secured by office properties and retail bank branches and an 
      office property. The largest loan in the pool is the Eagle Hospitality 
      Portfolio (52.5%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All Loans Have Additional Debt In Place: 100% of the loans have 
      additional debt in the form mezzanine debt and/or a B-note (BBD1). The 
      Fitch LTV and DSCR on the fully leveraged debt stack are 111.4% and 
      0.93x, respectively. The positions are fully subordinated and subject to 
      standard intercreditor agreements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMCC 2013-FL3 pool could withstand a 59% 
      decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 40.6% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing a $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 71.8% decline in value and 
      an approximately 57.9% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.

&lt;p&gt;May 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co said the
company and some of its personnel face a possible enforcement
action by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over bidding
practices in certain markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Foreign workers could gain visas for year-round work in U.S. meat processing plants under a proposal by the meat industry and the meatpackers union for immigration reform designed to create a steady supply of workers for slaughterhouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal, expected to be part of the Senate immigration bill, would help assure a stable workforce, said industry and union officials on Wednesday. The Senate Judiciary Committee was to begin debate on the bill on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate estimate of how many jobs might be filled by foreign workers. Around 480,000 people work at 6,300 meat and poultry plants nationwide, according to a trade group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of decades, meat packers have moved plants away from cities such as Chicago, and have drawn foreign-born workers, especially Hispanics, to rural communities. Industry officials say it is hard to recruit enough workers. They would prefer three-year visas that can be renewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are not seasonal jobs. Many of these jobs take a lot of training to do the job properly," said Barry Carpenter of the Food Manufacturers Immigration Coalition of livestock producers and processors. "There's a big safety-training factor as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial version of the Senate immigration bill included a provision for meatpacking and seafood workers. The language was revised in recent days but would remain part of the bill, said Carpenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jill Cashen of the United Food and Commercial Workers said the union and industry "have some over-lapping goals," especially on workplace stability, that led to the alliance on immigration reform. A large portion of beef and pork plants are unionized while poultry plants, concentrated in the southern United States, often are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to the eight senators who took the lead on immigration reform, the industry and union asked for more flexibility in verifying that applicants can work legally. The letter suggested deletion of a special allocation of visas proposed for meat and seafood workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. meat companies are Tyson Foods, JBS and Cargill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Charles Abbott; editing by Ros Krasny)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Gynecology Partnering Terms and Agreements - 2013 
      Report Features Players Pfizer, Bayer and Abbott
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4lbs5w/gynecology) 
      has announced the addition of the "Gynecology 
      Partnering Terms and Agreements" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Gynecology Partnering Terms and Agreements report provides 
      comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the gynecology 
      partnering deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading 
      healthcare companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why 
      companies enter gynecology partnering deals. The majority of deals are 
      discovery or development stage whereby the licensee obtains a right or 
      an option right to license the licensors gynecology technology. These 
      deals tend to be multicomponent, starting with collaborative RD, and 
      commercialization of outcomes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated 
      deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in 
      terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. 
      Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments 
      clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are 
      triggered - contract documents provide this insight where press releases 
      do not.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report contains over 500 links to online copies of actual 
      gynecology deals and contract documents as submitted to the Securities 
      Exchange Commission by companies and their partners. Contract documents 
      provide the answers to numerous questions about a prospective partner's 
      flexibility on a wide range of important issues, many of which will have 
      a significant impact on each party's ability to derive value from the 
      deal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The initial chapters of this report provide an orientation of gynecology 
      dealmaking and business activities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO, May 8, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Shareholders Foundation, Inc. announces that an investor who holds Ebix Inc. (EBIX) shares filed a lawsuit to stop the proposed takeover of Ebix Inc. by an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs  Co. for $20.00 per EBIX share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Investors who purchased shares of Ebix Inc. (EBIX) prior to May 1, 2013 and currently hold any of those EBIX shares, have certain options and should contact the Shareholders Foundation, Inc. at mail@shareholdersfoundation.com or call +1 (858) 779-1554.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On May 1, 2013, Ebix, Inc. announced that it has entered into a merger agreement to be acquired by an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs&#160; Co. Under the terms of the agreement, Ebix shareholders will receive $20.00 per share in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	However, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to EBIX stockholders by agreeing to sell the company too cheaply via an unfair process to Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Indeed, shares of Ebix Inc. traded as high as $24.62 per share as recently as September 2012 and at least one analyst has set the high target price at $24.00 per share. In addition, Ebix's financial performance improved recently. For instance, Ebix reported that its annual Total Revenue rose from $97.69 million in 2009 to $199.37 million in 2012 and that its respective Net Income increased from $38.82 million to $70.57 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, the plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to preclusive deal protection devices such as a $27 million termination fee provision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Those who currently are investors in Ebix Inc. (EBIX) shares and purchased a substantial amount of EBIX shares before the announcement have certain options and should contact the Shareholders Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO, Calif., May 8, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - One of the World's Largest Radiology Groups Selects Visage 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Visage Imaging, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pro Medicus Ltd. (ASX: PME), announced today that they have signed a five-year agreement with vRad (Virtual Radiologic), one of the world's largest radiology groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	vRad, whose more than 400 radiologists read 7 million radiology studies annually, will implement the Visage 7 Enterprise Imaging Platform as a central component of its technology platform focused on delivering a real-time, 'read anywhere, read anytime' environment. This will enable vRad to dynamically orchestrate when and by whom studies are read from anywhere within their owned partner radiology groups (hospitals and offsite), as well as their vast teleradiology network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We performed an extensive analysis of the market before making our decision," said Jordan Halter, vRad's Vice President of Business and Clinical Strategy. "Visage 7's speed and clinical depth immediately impressed us and we couldn't be more excited. Visage is a key component of our technology platform and will enable us to rapidly stream even the largest radiology cases, to the most appropriate radiologist for interpretation, while also providing the most comprehensive clinical tools available." The first phase of Visage implementations are planned for Diagnostic Imaging, Inc. (DII) and the New York Radiology Alliance (NYRA), both part of the vRad Alliance Network. Mr. Halter added, "I've been fortunate to be in Medical Imaging and Medical Informatics for many of the formative years and there is no doubt that the Visage viewer and architecture provides tremendous advantages and flexibility for those looking to thrive in a consolidating market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. Sam Hupert, Chief Executive Officer, Visage Imaging and Pro Medicus said, "We are extremely pleased to be part of this key initiative. vRad is leveraging the unique strengths of Visage 7 enabling their technology platform to meet the dynamic needs of integrated hospital-based and remote reading requirements. It is a platform for the future, one that has unparalleled scalability, clinical depth and speed, all of which are critical especially in the highly competitive North American radiology market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Commenting on the commercial aspects of the deal, Dr. Hupert said, "This is a key milestone for us. The first phase of the rollout is material in its own right yet represents a relatively small percentage of vRad's overall volume, so there is potential for very significant upside in this contract. A deal of this magnitude, with such a large and prominent client, helps put us firmly on the map in the US market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MetroStar Systems Launches eBriefing Solution for Microsoft 
      SharePoint, Windows 8 Tablet, and iPad
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Now, briefing books are easy to generate, organize, and deliver 
      anytime, anywhere in a secure environment on Windows 8 tablets and Apple 
      iOS mobile devices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Also supports government green initiatives by reducing use of paper, 
      printers, ink, and other resources to create briefing books
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ordinary briefing book has been a mainstay in government circles for 
      decades, if not centuries. For example, when a legislator travels to 
      meet a foreign dignitary, an official needs an intelligence briefing on 
      an overseas situation, or an agency needs to update its operating 
      procedures, teams of staffers spring into action to pull together the 
      best data and publish a briefing book on the subject.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It&#8217;s a process that can take days or weeks, requiring staffers to do the 
      heavy lifting of researching the matter, writing the chapters, and then 
      physically binding their hard work into huge, paper-intensive copies of 
      briefing books that the end-user must lug from place to place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      But that&#8217;s changing. Like all executives, government leaders are 
      demanding access to information anytime, anywhere on smart phones and 
      tablets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today one of the leading federal government IT consulting companies, MetroStar 
      Systems, Inc., announces the release of eBriefing&#8482;, 
      the first and only electronic briefing book designed for the needs of 
      government and enterprise. Based on the Microsoft SharePoint 
      collaboration platform, eBriefing transforms the manual process of 
      creating briefing books into a collaborative, digital process. It 
      eliminates the need for paper materials and print handling costs by 
      allowing a completely paperless process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MetroStar developed eBriefing as a direct response to a government 
      client challenge on how to securely provide and access real-time 
      information on the go. The eBriefing Builder app and Reader app enable 
      staffers to collaborate electronically and offer up-to-date information 
      for better decision making. The Builder app is compatible with 
      SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013, and allows users to securely build, 
      organize and publish eBriefing books. The Reader app allows users to 
      read and interact with eBriefing books on a Windows 8 tablet, desktop, 
      or iPad.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Benefits that eBriefing brings government and enterprise workers include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Mobility &#8211; Take eBriefing books anywhere and read books offline
      
			
				Security &#8211; Information never leaves your environment
      
			
				Real-time information &#8211; Work across agency lines in real-time 
        for better decisions and outcomes
      
			
				Time and cost savings &#8211; Through elimination of the labor to 
        assemble, print, and package physical briefing books
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Government entities are leaving no stone unturned in their quest to 
      automate and streamline time-consuming paper processes,&#8221; says Ali Reza 
      Manouchehri, co-founder and chief executive officer of MetroStar 
      Systems. &#8220;In this regard, eBriefing is a valuable tool to reduce manual 
      labor, conserve resources, and improve efficiency. The pilot programs we 
      have launched are demonstrating 100 percent return on investment in less 
      than two years.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MetroStar has already launched eBriefing pilot programs with the U.S. 
      Marine Corps and the American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The eBriefing solution will be showcased at upcoming government 
      conferences including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The American Council for Technology (ACT) - Industry Advisory Council 
        (IAC)&#8217;s 2013

			General Electric&#8217;s Global VAT/GST Director Delivers Keynote at Vertex 
      Exchange Europe 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Record number of attendees also hear from Bill Dodwell, head of 
      Deloitte&#8217;s Tax Policy Group
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Two of the most prominent thought leaders in global corporate tax 
      headlined this year&#8217;s Vertex Exchange Europe 2013 Conference on 24-25 
      April at the Waldorf 
      Hilton Hotel in London, United Kingdom.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This year&#8217;s conference, the annual premier event for European business 
      tax technology professionals, featured Chris Needham, currently the 
      Global VAT/GST director for General Electric Corporation and one of International 
      Tax Review&#8217;s &#8220;50 Biggest Influences in International Tax.&#8221; Needham 
      discussed the shifting global landscape for international tax, including 
      regulatory trends, corporate tax operations, and the evolution of 
      international tax.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Needham has spent the last 18 years developing GE&#8217;s in-house Global 
      VAT/GST team that now has more than 80 team members. He began his career 
      as the VAT Inspector for HM Customs and Excise in the UK, and also spent 
      seven years with PwC and established the firm&#8217;s first European VAT desk 
      in New York in 1994.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to bring Chris Needham&#8217;s unique and influential 
      perspective to this year&#8217;s Exchange Europe,&#8221; said Jeff Westphal, Chief 
      Executive Officer of Vertex Inc. &#8220;He offered tax and technology 
      professionals attending this year&#8217;s conference access to insights about 
      the current international tax landscape, as well as direction on how 
      global multinationals are responding to shifts in corporate tax 
      internally and externally.&#8221;

      Tax Policy Group, specialising in international corporate taxation. As 
      part of Deloitte&#8217;s tax leadership team, Dodwell is responsible for 
      shaping all aspects of the firm&#8217;s tax policy, managing tax knowledge, 
      training and Deloitte&#8217;s compliance with the tax disclosure rules. 
      Additionally, he chairs the Chartered Institute of Taxation&#8217;s (CIOT) 
      Technical Committee and was appointed to the interim Advisory Panel on 
      the General Anti-Abuse Rule. Bill represented Deloitte before the Public 
      Accounts Committee, in their enquiry into the role of the Big 4 in 
      giving tax advice and is frequently sought for his expertise by tax and 
      business media.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company today announces four global business commitments 
      to further contribute to healthier, happier, and more active 
      communities. These commitments, which apply to the more than 200 
      countries where we do business, are to:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			1)
			Offer low- or no- calorie beverage options in every market
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

			Provide transparent nutrition information, featuring 
      calories on the front of all of our packages

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Obesity is today&#8217;s most challenging health issue, affecting nearly 
      every family and community across the globe. It is a global societal 
      problem which will take all of us working together and doing our part,&#8221; 
      said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola 
      Company. &#8220;We are committed to being part of the solution, working 
      closely with partners from business, government and civil society. 
      Today&#8217;s announcement is another step forward on our journey, as we take 
      action with scale and reach across every country and continent where we 
      operate.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Muhtar Kent will make the global announcement today in commemoration of 
      the 127th anniversary of Coca-Cola. He will be joined by 
      Georgia Governor Nathan Deal and City of Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed to 
      kick off a series of programs designed to help get Georgians moving. 
      Today&#8217;s announcement in Georgia builds on recent partnerships the 
      Company has undertaken in Chicago, San Antonio and other cities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Already, The Coca-Cola Company has taken a number of important steps,

      sizes with our expansion of mini-cans in the United States, Australia,

      hundreds of active, healthy living programs in more than 115 countries 
      reaching millions of people, and is putting calories on the front of 
      nearly all our beverages worldwide. And, we will continue to do even 
      more.

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects headline and first paragraph saying Chevron itself
would appeal)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Fergus Jensen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA May 8 (Reuters) - Oil firm Chevron on
Wednesday criticised the sentencing of one of its Indonesian
subcontractors to five years in jail for breaching environmental
laws, citing irregularities in the investigation and trial. A
lawyer representing the subcontractor said he would file an
appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The panel of judges has not made a fair and objective
review of the facts of the bioremediation project which have
been presented during the trial," Chevron spokesman Kurt
Glaubitz said in a statement sent to Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Indonesia's Attorney General's Office said it was
also not satisfied because "the verdict was different to the
indictment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the court verdict last night, the prosecution finds it
necessary to file an appeal," Untung Setia, a spokesman for the
Attorney General's Office told Reuters, declining to comment
further. "We'll see what happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has faced mounting complaints from resource
companies and investors over regulatory uncertainty,
particularly after a court decision to dismantle its oil and gas
regulator late last year, throwing into question whether it will
be able to reverse declining output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Indonesia's largest oil producer, says the Green
Planet case sets a bad precedent by undermining terms in its
production-sharing contract and is among issues that could lead
to a reduction of its investment in Southeast Asia's largest
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has attracted substantial investment because of
its fast-growing economy and political stability but
institutional graft and rampant petty corruption, including in
its courts, are obstacles for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three more similar verdicts are scheduled to be heard this
week and next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jakarta Corruption Court handed down its verdict on
Tuesday night after an eight-hour hearing in a courtroom full of
Chevron supporters hoping charges against Ricksy Prematuri, the
manager of Green Planet, one of the subcontractors appointed to
carry out Chevron's bioremediation work, would be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prematuri is among seven people the attorney general's
office said took money for the project in a cost-recovery
process for work that was allegedly not completed in accordance
with environmental regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the issues questioned was whether Chevron's
contractors had a government permit to carry out the
bioremediation work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no proof that the project was fictive, just
allegations of an administrative breach where their permit had
not been extended," Chevron defence attorney Dasril said
referring to the verdict, adding that the company's permit
request had been ignored by the environment ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dasril said the company had obtained permission to carry out
its bioremediation project while the permit extension was being
processed. "This was stipulated in a letter from the deputy
environment minister."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says it has been concerned about irregularities in
the legal process since the attorney general's investigation
started in October 2011 and during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the defence team was given only four days during the
trial, but prosecutors were allowed four months to call many
witnesses, including one expert who it says had a conflict of
interest. It also said four of the accused were detained for 62
days before formal charges were lodged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas production has become politically sensitive in
Indonesia, with calls to nationalise company assets such as the
Mahakam block operated by Total, complaints about the
slow startup of the Cepu field run by ExxonMobil, and
warnings from President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono not to be too
greedy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Oslo, 8 May 2013) EVRY has entered into a technology partnership with Microsoft as part of the development of its new state-of-the-art operating platform - Future Proof. Through this agreement, EVRY will offer its customers an innovative and forward-looking solution, while at the same time the company lays the foundation for a significant reduction in operating costs. &#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market demands variable access to processing capacity that reflects fluctuations in the volume of activity in users' own businesses. This means that customers expect complete flexibility so that they always have access to the processing capacity that they need - and when they need it. EVRY will now offer this flexibility through its new Future Proof operating services organisation, using technology from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation and competitiveness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVRY has accordingly selected Microsoft's platform (Cloud OS) with Windows Server 2012, Hyper-V and System Center 2012 as part of the company's technological foundation for its Future Proof program. In addition to software from Microsoft, EVRY has entered into agreements with hardware vendors to ensure that purchases of new infrastructure can take place "on demand" in response to the company's capacity requirements from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Using technology from Microsoft , EVRY will build standardised platforms that combine automation with flexibility. This will play a central role in developing a competitive operating services organisation that delivers services with high standards of reliability and satisfies the market's demands for service quality. With Cloud OS, EVRY will have one of the most innovative and state-of-the-art platforms in the market, and we will be able to offer customers new solutions while at the same time reducing our operating costs. This will deliver greater competitiveness and a speedier transition to cloud services", explains H&#229;vard Larsen, EVP Nordic Operations of EVRY. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"EVRY's ambition is to build the best and most industrialised IT operations centre ever seen in Norway. We therefore welcome EVRY's decision to use our solutions and platforms to achieve this ambitious target, and see this as an important endorsement for Microsoft", comments Hege Skryseth, Managing Director of Microsoft Norway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well suited for flexible ways of working&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Server 2012 with Hyper-V and System Center 2012 form the core of Cloud OS. This platform addresses technology and IT trends that will change our daily life in the years ahead, including new expectations and requirements for more flexible ways of working. Today's employees expect to have access to data, services and apps wherever they are and whenever they wish. They also expect to be able to work from their personal PC, tablet PC or smart phone. In response to these trends, Microsoft's platform makes it possible to develop solutions that are independent of platforms, locations, and devices, while at the same time offering simplified administration and ensuring security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forward-looking and industrialised operations centre will deliver major benefits for both EVRY and the company's customers. Consolidation and streamlined administration will allow significant cost savings, while at the same time simplified operations and administration will release time and resources for greater innovation and value creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice of Microsoft's platform is in addition to the vBlock solution from Cisco, VMware and EMC, which are already installed. There are accordingly now two technological cornerstones for EVRY's new operations concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact names&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H&#229;vard Larsen, EVP Nordic Operations, EVRY.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO &#8211; Israel is home to a vibrant startup ecosystem stocked with technical talent, entrepreneurial spirit, and venture capital. For these reasons, Microsoft chose Israel as the location of its first ever startup accelerator program which started last year and just graduated its second class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I visited Microsoft&#8217;s office in San Francisco yesterday to meet with some of these startups and learn more about the program and its progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Also, so I could tell my Bubby I met some nice Israelis.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanan Levy is the accelerator director in Israel. He measures the program&#8217;s success based on how many startups get funding within a year, the average amount raised, and how many members of the current class refer startups to the next class. By these standards, Microsoft&#8217;s program is doing well. The second class graduated two weeks ago and 10 of the 13 companies have already raised funds. The average raise of the first class is around $900,000 and the number of applications has tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a new model for Microsoft to operate an accelerator fully owned and run by Microsoft,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We make sure the companies have a big vision, the entrepreneurs can execute, that a strong tech person is part of the core team, and that the participants are coachable and open-minded. Many startups get involved with what they think is a pain point, but it isn&#8217;t really.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program lasts for four months where the startups get out and talk to customers, iterate and develop the product, interact with mentors, and hone their pitch. At the end of it all, they come to the U.S. for marketing, fundraising, and publicity. While Israel has an active startup scene, a strong presence in the U.S. market is still important for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitchenbug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitchenbug wants to tell the true story behind food. The startup uses natural language processing to analyze recipes and generate full nutritional data, as well as helpful clues to understanding what that data means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the health impact of a dish is not as simple as checking calorie, fat and sugar content. A number of other factors are at play and people without extensive knowledge of nutrition may not be aware of the consequences of certain meals. Kitchenbug addresses this issue by attaching green or red icons to each dish that say things like &#8220;not very heart healthy&#8221; or &#8220;good for feeling full&#8221; or &#8220;bad choice for weight loss.&#8221; That way, instead of parsing through various dishes and nutrition resources, you can instantly know if a recipe is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders have known each other for 25 years and live close together in Israel. COO Dror Daliot said that they used to be &#8220;chin-up champions&#8221; who were fit, slim, and strong, and then &#8220;life happened.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I love my daughters but they are terrible for my diet,&#8221; he said during a demo. &#8220;Pancake mornings and evening pizzas are not the healthiest.&#160; At a BBQ, I looked at my friends and our crumbling frames and said &#8216;guys, we have to do something about this.&#8217; We decided to develop technology that takes any online recipe from any website and instantly provides dietary information you need.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;60 percent of the Western world is overweight and 25 percent is obese, with weight-related diseases and allergies on the rise. According to Daliot, recipes are the second biggest search category on the web with 2 billion searches a month, and almost 50 percent of Americans search for info about health food. The Kitchenbug founders are not alone in their efforts to prepare healthy, home-cooked meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitchenbug has a bookmarking button that collect recipes into an online recipe box. Clicking into an ingredient will yield a description and serving sizes can be easily adapted. The app is social so people can share recipes, follow others, and discover new recipes. The company launched a WordPress plugin in January for food bloggers and over 2,500 recipes have been published so far, receiving 40 million views in 100 days. In the pipeline for Kitchenbug are icons and filters for ideological, allergy, and religious constraints. The data is based on nutritional information from the USDA database, as well as food manufacturers and brands, Wikipedia, and FDA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has raised $650,000 to date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Entrepreneur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Updates with details of suspect's activities, court
appearance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Mark Hosenball and Bernard Vaughan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on
Thursday announced visa fraud charges against a Tunisian man who
prosecutors said had met with a key figure in an alleged plot to
blow up a railroad line in Canada that carries Amtrak trains
between Toronto and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter filed in federal court in New York, prosecutors
said the man, Ahmed Abassi, 26, who had lived in Canada, was
recorded by a U.S. undercover agent discussing various "proposed
terrorist plots" with Chiheb Esseghaier, another Tunisian
suspect. Esseghaier is now being held by Canadian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the plots that Abassi allegedly discussed was
"contaminating the air or water with bacteria in order to kill
up to 100,000 people," prosecutors said in the letter. But they
said that Esseghaier was "dismissive" of that plan and that no
steps were ever taken to carry it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Canadian authorities said last month that they had
arrested Esseghaier, 30, a doctoral student in nanotechnology at
an institute near Montreal, with plotting to derail a train. A
second man, Raed Jaser, faces Canadian charges in the same plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities said that in interviews with investigators,
Abassi acknowledged that he and Esseghaier had discussed both
poisoning a water supply and derailing a passenger train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a secret arraignment on May 2, Abassi pleaded not guilty
to filling out false immigration documents, according to a newly
unsealed transcript of the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abassi, wearing a jail jumpsuit, appeared on Thursday
afternoon at a hearing in federal court in Manhattan. Standing
more than 6-feet tall with a light beard, short black hair and
wire-frame glasses, he leaned close to an Arabic interpreter
throughout the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Cronan, an assistant U.S. Attorney, said evidence would
include "many, many hours" of recorded conversations with an
undercover FBI agent, as well as statements Abassi made after
being read his Miranda rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Discovery will be voluminous," Cronan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of their arrests, Canadian authorities said that
Esseghaier and Jaser had received "direction and guidance" in
the plot from "al Qaeda elements in Iran."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported last month that investigators believe that
Esseghaier traveled to Iran within the past two years, though
they have not said why he went there or who he might have met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AL QAEDA FIGURES IN IRAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. national security sources close to the investigation
said that they believe one or more of the plotters were in
contact with a network of low- to middle-level al Qaeda fixers
and "facilitators" based in the town of Zahedan, close to Iran's
borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan, that moves money and
fighters through Iran to support its activities in South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian police say there is no sign of Iranian government
involvement with the suspects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the letter filed Thursday, U.S. prosecutors said
that the American undercover agent had recorded discussions
between Abassi and Esseghaier in which Abassi allegedly
"discussed his desire to engage in terrorist acts against
targets in the United States and other countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also said that he had been recorded discussing his
desire to provide support and funding to militant groups,
including the al Nusrah front, an Islamist group the U.S. says
is a front for al Qaeda in Iraq and which is one of the most
powerful rebel factions fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Abassi admitted he may have been
responsible for radicalizing Esseghaier, and that he came to the
United States in mid-March, where he remained until his arrest
on April 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their letter, prosecutors said investigators had briefly
questioned Abassi under a "public safety" procedure that allows
interrogation of suspects for intelligence purposes without
advising them of Miranda rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Abassi, before having a lawyer, on several occasions was
advised of, and voluntarily waived his rights while being
questioned almost every day by a New York-based Joint Terrorism
Task Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said:
"Through our efforts, we assured that at no time did this
individual pose an imminent threat to public safety in Canada."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors added that Abassi had told the undercover
officer about a number of people known to him and his associates
who he said he thought would be "willing to engage in
terrorism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. law enforcement official said that the investigation
was continuing and that other possible persons of interest were
being looked at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities said Abassi was under surveillance from
the outset of his U.S. stay, and that he maintained regular
contact during that time with what authorities described as an
"FBI undercover officer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Thursday's hearing in New York, Judge Miriam Cedarbaum
set June 11 for the next court date. She told Cronan that all of
Abassi's statements "should be promptly produced" to his lawyer,
Sabrina Shroff.

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on November 14 sanctioned the U.S. bank's energy trading unit for failing to disclose information during an investigation of potential power market manipulation in California and Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six month trading ban started on April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC has not accused the bank of any market manipulation and does not disclose investigations, but it is still likely looking into the case, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the disclosure last week of a 70-page government document that alleged wrongdoing by the bank, however, energy analysts said it is more likely than not that FERC will charge the bank with manipulating the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 30, JPMorgan filed its plan with FERC on how it would comply with the six-month ban.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Shares in Barnes &amp; Noble Inc soared 22 percent on Thursday after a report that Microsoft Corp is considering an offer to acquire the tablet and e-book business of B's Nook Media unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology website TechCrunch reported that Microsoft, which already owns a 17 percent stake in Nook Media, was proposing a $1 billion offer to buy all of Nook's digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also suggested that Nook would stop selling Android-based tablets entirely by the end of fiscal 2014 in favor of distributing content via other publishers' platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the documents cited by TechCrunch confirmed their authenticity. The source said the documents dated from March, suggesting that any deal - if one is even pending - was not imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear from the TechCrunch story whether Microsoft had formally made an offer to B or whether B had replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B and Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acquired its stake in the Nook Media unit a little more than a year ago in a deal that valued the entire unit at $1.7 billion. In December the British publisher Pearson Plc bought a stake in the unit at a $1.8 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nook Media sales have disappointed since. Revenue dropped 26 percent in the most recent holiday quarter as Nook sold fewer digital readers and tablets and had to cut prices. Just this week B slashed the price of its best tablet by one-third as a special promotion for Mother's Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear why Microsoft would want to buy Nook's digital assets, unless it wished to make a preemptive strike against Google and shift Nook away from the Android platform. There is already a Nook app for Windows 8 devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's recent acquisitions - such as online chat service Skype and business networking site Yammer - have not been content-focused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays analyst Alan Rifkin, in a note to clients on Thursday, said a lower valuation for the Nook Media unit was appropriate and that $1 billion was even higher than he had modeled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B shares rose 22 percent to $21.70 in afternoon trading. The stock last traded at those levels a year ago, around the time of the Microsoft investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is heavily shorted, with almost 36 percent of its float sold short as of April 15. Short sellers borrow stocks and sell them, betting the price will fall. Where short interest is high, that can exacerbate a rally, as people rush in to cover their positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse, in a note to clients, said the suggested terms of the Microsoft offer implied that Barnes &amp; Noble was worth about $27 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COLLEGE BOOKSTORE CHAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nook Media also includes a college bookstore chain, but the TechCrunch report suggested the Microsoft offer would include only the e-book, digital reader and tablet assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft carves the college bookstore chain out of the Nook Media unit, and B takes back those stores, Credit Suisse said the valuation of B could rise even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the college bookstore chain has provided B with much needed cash, sales have been weak. In the first three quarters of the fiscal year, sales fell 0.3 percent, while operating profit fell 7 percent to $115.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The college textbook business is undergoing a transformation with the shift to digital, as publishers move away from large, heavy books that last for years to multiple packages with smaller bites of content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like News Corp and Apple have started to make plays on the digital textbook market as that shift accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COULD SPEED OTHER SALES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, B Chairman Leonard Riggio said he wanted to buy the company's chain of nearly 700 namesake bookstores. Selling off Nook could simplify that process, especially if it reunited Riggio with the college bookstore business, which he sold to B in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B first indicated it might spin off the Nook business in early 2012. The retailer has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the unprofitable unit, trying to make its devices competitive against devices from Amazon, Apple and Google, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest IDC market share data for tablets, released earlier this month, leaves B out of the industry's top five vendors, suggesting its share of the global market is negligible. Microsoft's new Surface tablets - the first of which hit the market last October - have only a 1.8 percent share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B has typically launched a new edition of the Nook every year. But this year it simply updated its high-definition tablets by adding Google's app store, which a number of analysts saw as an easy way for the company to launch a "new" Nook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One uncertainty in any Microsoft bid is how Liberty Media would respond. It holds preferred shares in B that, if converted, would represent 17 percent of the company. Liberty was not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst following Barnes &amp; Noble said a Microsoft deal, if it happens, would be dramatic but not necessarily surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We must be careful here because details are lacking, but with devices phasing out, we see sale of the digital assets as an effective sale of the entire Nook business, unless co-ownership or leasing of digital content is arranged," Stifel analyst David Schick said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Phil Wahba and Ben Berkowitz; Additional reporting by Liana B.

      Research and Markets: Top Five Polyethylene Companies: 2013 Report 
      Features Players Exxon Mobil Corporation and Sinopec Corporation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/j5cz9v/top_five) 
      has announced the addition of the "Top 
      Five Polyethylene Companies: Performance, Strategies and Competitive 
      Analysis" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The global polyethylene industry is forecast to reach US $148 billion by 
      2017, with a CAGR of 3.5% over the next five years. The growing industry 
      is fragmented. To gain and sustain market share, the key companies in 
      this industry are innovating and embracing a broad product portfolio 
      strategy based on the requirements of different applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report briefly discusses the subject companies, their geographic 
      footprints, financial metrics, market performance, marketing and 
      corporate strategies and a SWOT analysis of each player.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The&#160;report highlights the key challenges faced by the industry. The 
      industry has been affected by the continuous shutdown of plants, project 
      delays, and particularly, derivative capacity to control supply and 
      demand imbalance in different regions because of the economic recession. 
      Despite the challenges, the industry benefits from several key business 
      drivers. Strong financial performance with increases in total revenues 
      compared to previous years, even after divestures and the economic 
      crisis, strengthen the industry. Strategic alliances with the feedstock 
      and raw material suppliers help meet the continuous manufacturing and 
      processing demand. Operating much like joint ventures, these 
      relationships helped improve the market condition for manufacturers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report briefly describes the top five global polyethylene companies:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Dow Chemical
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Exxon Mobil Corporation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - LyondellBasell
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - SABIC
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Sinopec Corporation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A combination of factors, such as rising income and increased consumer 
      spending capabilities seems to influence market dynamics highly. The 
      industry has recovered from the global recessionary condition and is 
      again in the growing phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This report will save hundreds of hours of your own personal research 
      time and will significantly benefit you in expanding your business 
      opportunities in global polyethylene companies industry. In today's 
      chaotic economy, you need every advantage that you can find to keep 
      ahead in your business.

&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft may bid $1 bln for digital assets-TechCrunch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Neither company commenting on report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Analysts say price may be a little high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Fate of college bookstores up in the air

 (Adds date of documents, possible reasons for deal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Phil Wahba and Ben Berkowitz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Barnes &amp; Noble Inc 
soared 22 percent on Thursday after a report that Microsoft Corp
 is considering an offer to acquire the tablet and
e-book business of B's Nook Media unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology website TechCrunch reported that Microsoft,
which already owns a 17 percent stake in Nook Media, was
proposing a $1 billion offer to buy all of Nook's digital
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also suggested that Nook would stop selling
Android-based tablets entirely by the end of fiscal 2014 in
favor of distributing content via other publishers' platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the documents cited by TechCrunch
confirmed their authenticity. The source said the documents
dated from March, suggesting that any deal - if one is even
pending - was not imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear from the TechCrunch story whether Microsoft
had formally made an offer to B or whether B had replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B and Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acquired its stake in the Nook Media unit a little
more than a year ago in a deal that valued the entire unit at
$1.7 billion. In December the British publisher Pearson Plc
 bought a stake in the unit at a $1.8 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nook Media sales have disappointed since. Revenue
dropped 26 percent in the most recent holiday quarter as Nook
sold fewer digital readers and tablets and had to cut prices.
Just this week B slashed the price of its best tablet by
one-third as a special promotion for Mother's Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear why Microsoft would want to buy
Nook's digital assets, unless it wished to make a preemptive
strike against Google and shift Nook away from the
Android platform. There is already a Nook app for Windows 8
devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's recent acquisitions - such as online chat
service Skype and business networking site Yammer - have not
been content-focused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays analyst Alan Rifkin, in a note to clients on
Thursday, said a lower valuation for the Nook Media unit was
appropriate and that $1 billion was even higher than he had
modeled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B shares rose 22 percent to $21.70 in afternoon trading.
The stock last traded at those levels a year ago, around the
time of the Microsoft investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is heavily shorted, with almost 36 percent of its
float sold short as of April 15. Short sellers borrow stocks and
sell them, betting the price will fall. Where short interest is
high, that can exacerbate a rally, as people rush in to cover
their positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse, in a note to clients, said the suggested
terms of the Microsoft offer implied that Barnes &amp; Noble was
worth about $27 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COLLEGE BOOKSTORE CHAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nook Media also includes a college bookstore chain, but the
TechCrunch report suggested the Microsoft offer would include
only the e-book, digital reader and tablet assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft carves the college bookstore chain out of the
Nook Media unit, and B takes back those stores, Credit Suisse
said the valuation of B could rise even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the college bookstore chain has provided B with much
needed cash, sales have been weak. In the first three quarters
of the fiscal year, sales fell 0.3 percent, while operating
profit fell 7 percent to $115.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The college textbook business is undergoing a transformation
with the shift to digital, as publishers move away from large,
heavy books that last for years to multiple packages with
smaller bites of content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like News Corp and Apple have
started to make plays on the digital textbook market as that
shift accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COULD SPEED OTHER SALES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, B Chairman Leonard Riggio said he
wanted to buy the company's chain of nearly 700 namesake
bookstores. Selling off Nook could simplify that process,
especially if it reunited Riggio with the college bookstore
business, which he sold to B in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B first indicated it might spin off the Nook business in
early 2012. The retailer has spent hundreds of millions of
dollars on the unprofitable unit, trying to make its devices
competitive against devices from Amazon, Apple and
Google, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest IDC market share data for tablets, released
earlier this month, leaves B out of the industry's top five
vendors, suggesting its share of the global market is
negligible. Microsoft's new Surface tablets - the first of which
hit the market last October - have only a 1.8 percent share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B has typically launched a new edition of the Nook every
year. But this year it simply updated its high-definition
tablets by adding Google's app store, which a number of analysts
saw as an easy way for the company to launch a "new" Nook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One uncertainty in any Microsoft bid is how Liberty Media
 would respond. It holds preferred shares in B that,
if converted, would represent 17 percent of the company. Liberty
was not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst following Barnes &amp; Noble said a Microsoft deal,
if it happens, would be dramatic but not necessarily surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We must be careful here because details are lacking, but
with devices phasing out, we see sale of the digital assets as
an effective sale of the entire Nook business, unless
co-ownership or leasing of digital content is arranged," Stifel
analyst David Schick said in a research note.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has slashed its capital pledges to investment funds by nearly half since the Volcker rule was signed into law in 2010, as it prepares its principal investment business for restrictions on investing its own money, according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank has reduced future commitments to hedge funds and funds that invest in private equity, credit and real estate, by $5.8 billion since June 2010, the last period before the Volcker rule was included in the Dodd-Frank financial reform act. That represents a reduction of 48 percent, according to data in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule - which has not yet been finalized or implemented - will prevent banks from investing more than 3 percent of Tier 1 capital in hedge funds or private equity funds, or from contributing more than 3 percent of capital from those funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's existing hedge fund and private-equity fund holdings represented 14 percent of its Tier 1 capital as of March 31, according to its most recent filing on Thursday. Including future private-equity fund commitments, that ratio goes up to 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear how the Volcker rule will treat credit funds or real-estate funds, or how much time banks will get to come into compliance with the law. Regulators are expected to release a final rule by the end of this year, after reviewing hundreds of letters from industry groups and the public about a proposal they released in October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been actively reducing some fund interests with an eye toward Volcker compliance. For instance, the bank said it has redeemed $1.32 billion worth of hedge fund interests since March 2012, including $260 million in the first quarter. It has also been structuring investments in different ways to avoid breaching the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman can reduce most hedge fund interest by up to 25 percent each quarter, its other funds have longer investment horizons. Goldman expects all the assets in its existing funds to be liquidated over the next seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Goldman had $15.6 billion worth of investments in hedge funds, and funds that invest in credit, private equity and real estate as of March 31. The bank had pledged an additional $6.2 billion in future commitments to those funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares with $15.4 billion worth of investments and $12 billion in unfunded commitments as of June 30, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's existing fund assets have risen since the passage of Dodd-Frank only because of big gains in the value of its real-estate holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those funds' investments have ranged from Seattle office buildings to Caribbean hotels. Some suffered stinging losses during the financial crisis as properties bought at the top of the real estate bubble lost value. But since mid-2010, those real-estate funds have more than doubled in value, booking $1.1 billion in gains. Goldman has reduced future commitments to real-estate funds by $1.5 billion over that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lauren Tara LaCapra; editing by Gunna Dickson)&lt;/p&gt;

percent of Tier 1 capital in hedge funds or private equity
funds, or from contributing more than 3 percent of capital from
those funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's existing hedge fund and private-equity fund
holdings represented 14 percent of its Tier 1 capital as of
March 31, according to its most recent filing on Thursday.
Including future private-equity fund commitments, that ratio
goes up to 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear how the Volcker rule will treat credit funds
or real-estate funds, or how much time banks will get to come
into compliance with the law. Regulators are expected to release
a final rule by the end of this year, after reviewing hundreds
of letters from industry groups and the public about a proposal
they released in October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been actively reducing some fund interests with
an eye toward Volcker compliance. For instance, the bank said it
has redeemed $1.32 billion worth of hedge fund interests since
March 2012, including $260 million in the first quarter. It has
also been structuring investments in different ways to avoid
breaching the rule. [ID:nL1N0BWJTO ID:nL1N0AUFOS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman can reduce most hedge fund interest by up to
25 percent each quarter, its other funds have longer investment
horizons. Goldman expects all the assets in its existing funds
to be liquidated over the next seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Goldman had $15.6 billion worth of investments in
hedge funds, and funds that invest in credit, private equity and
real estate as of March 31. The bank had pledged an additional
$6.2 billion in future commitments to those funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares with $15.4 billion worth of investments and
$12 billion in unfunded commitments as of June 30, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's existing fund assets have risen since the passage
of Dodd-Frank only because of big gains in the value of its
real-estate holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those funds' investments have ranged from Seattle office
buildings to Caribbean hotels. Some suffered stinging losses
during the financial crisis as properties bought at the top of
the real estate bubble lost value. But since mid-2010, those
real-estate funds have more than doubled in value, booking $1.1
billion in gains. Goldman has reduced future commitments to
real-estate funds by $1.5 billion over that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			BossLaser.com Announces Solution to Compatibility Problem with 
      Microsoft Windows
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BossLaser.com CEO Dan Fox announced the new Boss Direct Drive 
      (BDD) which allows laser machine operators in the United States to 
      significantly improve the usability of Chinese engraving machines.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			According to Fox, &#8220;Until Boss Direct Drive (Boss DD) laser machine 
      operators were left to figure out how to learn and understand Chinese 
      laser interface software.
			Chinese software for laser 
      machines can make it difficult for operators
			to migrate a 
      file, and then design print from their favorite graphics program.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;The task is made difficult since foreign software often conflicts 
      with certain Windows operating systems.
			As a result help 
      forums are filled with confused and stressed out laser machine owners 
      who simply just want to get their design to &#8216;print&#8217; to their laser.
			Boss Direct Drive (Boss DD) now offers a solution,&#8221; said Fox.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Boss Direct Drive (Boss DD) driver is compatible with Windows 7 
      and 8 32/64 bit, XP and 2000 operating systems.
			Additionally, 
      it is compatible with many of the popular graphics programs like Corel 
      Draw, Photoshop, AutoCAD,
			AcceliCAD ,
			DolphinCAD,
			Corel Paint, Microsoft Word, etc.
			The job is designed 
      and simply printed to the USB 2.0 high speed port for the BOSS USB 
      controller.
			Once set and initialized, Boss DD hides in the 
      background just like a printer driver would operate.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fox elaborated, &#8220;The combination of the Boss DD driver and USB 
      micro laser control card work to manage the appropriate Engrave (Raster) 
      and Cut (Vector) signals from the graphics program once the job is 
      printed to the driver.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;With the preset information for resolution and acceleration 
      within each of the axes, as well as the color based settings for power, 
      speed, and frequency,
			Boss DD prepares and processes the 
      job. There is nothing like it in the marketplace.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Design your job in one of the popular, off-the-shelf applications 
      like Corel Draw, AutoCAD, Adobe Illustrator, and others then simply 
      print, sit back, and watch as Boss DD quickly sends the job to the laser 
      machine equipped with the Boss DD control card.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BossLaser.com offers hobbyists, businesses and educational 
      institutions quality CO2 laser cutter and engraver systems. Boss Laser&#8217;s 
      latest laser engraving machines provide the technology to easily cut, 
      engrave, mark, or etch an ever growing list of materials. Contact them

&lt;p&gt;May 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Barnes &amp; Noble Inc rose
27 percent in premarket trading on Thursday after a report that
its partner Microsoft Corp is considering an offer to
acquire all of Nook Media's digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already owns a substantial stake in the business,
but the technology industry website TechCrunch reported the
company was proposing a $1 billion offer to buy the rest of
Nook's digital assets. Nook Media also includes the college
bookstore chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear from the TechCrunch story whether Microsoft
has formally made that offer to Barnes &amp; Noble's board, or
whether Barnes &amp; Noble has replied. Barnes &amp; Noble declined to
comment and Microsoft was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the bookselling chain rose to $22.50 in premarket
trading from a $17.77 close on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nook business has struggled in the face of heavy
competition from Amazon.com Inc and other players in
the tablet market. Just this week, the company slashed the price
of its top-end Nook tablet by one-third as a special Mother's
Day promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUCHAREST May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron 
said on Thursday it plans to start exploration for shale gas in
Romania, where the government has sounded increasingly amenable
to allowing mining by fracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates
Romania and neighbouring Bulgaria and Hungary could have 538
billion cubic metres of shale gas between them, slightly more
than Europe's annual consumption and enough to cover Romania's 
for almost 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron will conduct a 2D geophysical study near the Black
Sea and plans to drill exploratory shale wells further north in
Vaslui county, spokeswoman Sally Jones said. The company did not
give a specific date for starting work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The exploration phase has a multi-year timeframe. The
results of the exploration stage will determine, in cooperation
with the Romanian government, the commencement of any potential
exploitation activities," Jones said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has rights to explore for shale in three blocks of
670,000 acres (270,000 hectares) near the Black Sea, and has
also bought the concession in Vaslui for an undisclosed amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extraction of shale gas requires hydraulic fracturing,
or fracking, a method that involves injecting water and
chemicals at high pressure into underground rock formations.
Experts say that if it is done according to best practice it is
environmentally safe, but the technology still provokes public
concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially opposed to shale gas, the leftist coalition
government of Victor Ponta has shifted its stance since gaining
power in 2012 and now supports exploration, in pursuit for
energy independence for Romania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has stopped short of approving exploitation of shale
wells and thousands protested against shale gas exploration
across Romania last month, asking the government to ban drilling
due to environment concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To reach exploitation we need to see if we have this
resource and where we have it," Environment Minister Rovana
Plumb said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From the point of view of the environment ministry there is
no environmental risk in terms of exploration as the hydraulic
fracturing technology is not being used."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romania is already the least dependent on Russian gas among
its central and eastern European neighbours due to its
conventional reserves and imports only about a quarter if what
it uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering $1 billion for Nook Media LLC, the tablet and digital media business started by Barnes &amp; Noble and other investors, according to a report in TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft already owns a piece of Nook, having invested $300 million into the business in April 2012.&#160;According to the report, Microsoft would buy the digital operation, which includes e-books, movies, TV, comics, apps, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interesting wrinkle is that Nook is built on Android &#8212; which Microsoft makes money charging licenses for &#8211; and just opened up its business to Google, signing an agreement with Google to get Google Play and inviting the entire Google mobile stack &#8212; Gmail, Chrome, YouTube, and Google Maps &#8212; onto the platform. In addition, Nook offers apps on mobile platforms that compete with Microsoft: Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which would put Microsoft in the awkward position of owning an Android-based tablet that, while not extremely successful, has sold more devices than Microsoft has sold of its own Windows 8-based tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About ten million Nook devices have been sold to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nook may be phasing out hardware and moving simply to delivering content via apps on other company&#8217;s hardware platforms as both revenue and device sales have slowed&#160;in recent quarters. In which case, Microsoft would be buying digital content and licenses to digital content that could be valuable assets for both Windows 8-based tablets and its Xbox living-room-entertainment-hub ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that&#8217;s worth a billion dollars, however, is anyone&#8217;s guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means that the bigger question is whether buying a declining device and content distributor from an ailing company that is failing to successfully compete with Amazon is a smart business idea.&#160;With Nook division revenue declining more than $100 million in 2013 and a projected loss of $360 million, it could just be the case of Microsoft adopting yet another expensive albatross for its cash cow office, operating system, and business software divisions to support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Gadgets, Media, Mobile&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has hired Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) senior equity analyst Tom Ernst as a managing director to co-head its software banking team, a company spokesman said late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst will be based in San Francisco starting early July and will lead the division with Ward Waltemath, the spokesman said, confirming a Reuters report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ernst, who has covered the software industry for 14 years, said on his LinkedIn profile that he would join the investment bank as global co-head of Software Investment banking in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ernst had worked at Deutsche Bank for 9 years, his LinkedIn profile showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ernst joins Goldman Sachs after the bank's technology group has lost a number of key bankers in recent months, including former Internet and new media chief Scott Stanford and software chief Ned Segal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nicola Leske in New York; additional reporting by Olivia Oran; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two ranking JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) directors issued a letter to shareholders on Friday arguing against recommendations by proxy advisory firms to split the duties of Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and vote against some directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board is unanimous in its view that it is best for Dimon to hold both roles and the current governance structure "is working effectively," according to the letter signed by presiding director Lee Raymond and William Weldon, who is chairman of the corporate governance and nominating committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter warned that a vote against current directors or to split the CEO and chairman roles "could be disruptive to the company and is not in shareholders' best interests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter is a direct response to reports in the past seven days from advisory firms Institutional Investors Services and Glass Lewis &amp; Co. The firms concluded that investigations of the bank's $6.2 billion loss on the "London Whale" derivatives trades showed the board had failed in its oversight of JPMorgan executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident is cited in policy debates in Washington as evidence big banks need to be broken up or required to hold much more capital for the safety of the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both advisory firms recommended JPMorgan shareholders vote against re-election of three board members who served on the board's risk policy committee when the losses occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory firms generally take the view that having a board chairman who is separate from the CEO in a company leads to better oversight. They said the London Whale episode showed that JPMorgan was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board letter on Friday said the firms "and others have incorrectly and unfairly characterized management's mistakes as a failure by the risk policy committee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter was issued ahead of the bank's annual meeting on May 21 when shareholders will vote on the board's recommendation that all 11 directors be re-elected for another year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ballot also includes a non-binding resolution proposed by some shareholders that calls on the board to have a chairman who is independent from the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote on splitting the roles has come to be seen as a referendum on Dimon, 57, who was widely praised for leading the bank profitably and safely through the financial crisis and then saw that reputation tarnished by the trading debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven-page letter came one year to the day after the company announced it was losing billions of dollars on the trades. Dimon had previously dismissed news reports of possible losses as a "tempest in a teapot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter said the advisory firms focused "too narrowly" on the losses and a broader view of the company's performance shows Dimon and all of the board members should be supported in the voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported record earnings and scored well on measures of profitability, including 15 percent returns on tangible common equity, every year for the last three years, the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We highlight the performance of the Company not to diminish the events of last year or the lessons learned from them, but to provide important context," the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter defended by name the three directors on the risk policy committee who ISS said should not be re-elected. It said the three directors--David Cote, who is also chairman and CEO of Honeywell International Inc, (HON.N) James Crown, who is president of private investment firm Henry Crown and Company, and Ellen Futter, who is president of the American Museum of Natural History--had worked diligently and have "accomplished backgrounds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter said there was no reason that the trio should have seen that a trading strategy which had successfully hedged the bank's credit risk had turned into a losing bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The directors said it depends on the situation whether it is best to have one person or two as chief executive and chairman. They noted that the board had split the roles when Dimon first became CEO and when his predecessor, William Harrison, first became CEO under another chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By David Henry in New York; writing by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;May 10 (Reuters) - U.S. federal energy regulators on Friday
granted a rehearing request for a unit of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
Inc on how the bank will comply with a six-month ban on
physical power trading at market-based rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision Friday follows the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission's (FERC) decision on Thursday to give
itself more time to decide the bank's rehearing request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its decision on Friday, FERC said the bank should
submit another compliance filing that caps its offers to supply
energy and other services at cost in markets outside of
California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC however rejected the bank's proposal to add 10 percent
to its offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulator said by supplying power and other services at
cost, JPMorgan should avoid losing money on its sales, while
also preventing the bank's units from displacing more cost
effective resources, which was a concern for the operators of
the PJM and Midcontinent power grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PJM operates the power grid serving more than 60 million in
13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states and the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) operates the
power grid in 11 Midwest states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC sanctioned the U.S. bank's energy trading unit on Nov.
14 for failing to disclose information during an investigation
of potential power market manipulation in California and
Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That six month trading ban started on April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC has not accused the bank of market manipulation but
JPMorgan this week notified its shareholders in a regulatory
filing that the agency may take action against the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has denied that it manipulated the power markets,
and vows to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan sold the rights to market electricity

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Scott DiSavino&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 10 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has sold the
rights to market electricity from three power plants in
California, reducing the bank's presence in a state where it is
being probed for allegations of manipulating prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal energy regulators may take enforcement action against
JPMorgan, the bank said in a regulatory filing this week. The
bank has denied the allegations that it manipulated power prices
in California and Michigan, and vows to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman at JPMorgan said the company declined to
comment on the sale of the power marketing rights to Southern
California Edison, a regional power company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California utility regulators on Thursday approved the plan
to transfer so-called tolling agreements of the three power
plants, which can produce enough power for about 3 million
homes, to Southern California Edison (SCE) from Oct. 1, 2013 to
May 31, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCE, a unit of Edison International, serves about
4.9 million customers in southern and central California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tolling agreements usually allow companies like JPMorgan to
purchase gas and sell the power produced from the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three plants are owned and operated by units of U.S.
power company AES Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale included tolling agreements for 3,690 megawatts
(MW) at Units 1-6 at the Alamitos plant (1,950 MW), Units 1 and
2 at Huntington Beach (430 MW) and Units 5-8 at Redondo Beach
(1,310 MW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which does not list the power plants it operates
in the United States, declined to comment on whether they will
own other tolling agreements at power plants in California after
this sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Public Utilities Commission and SCE did not
disclose the cost of the contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN ONOFRE OUTAGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shutdown of a nuclear power plant in California has also
put JPMorgan into a dispute with California over a key component
of the state's plan to keep the lights on this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two reactors at SCE's 2,150-MW San Onofre nuclear power
plant shut in January 2012 due to problems with their new steam
generators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help maintain the reliability of the power grid should
both reactors remain shut over the summer, the California
Independent System Operator (ISO) entered into an agreement with
AES to convert Huntington Beach Units 3 and 4 into so-called
synchronous condensers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synchronous condensers provide voltage support to help move
power around the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California ISO operates the power grid in most of
California and part of Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement with AES however was contingent upon the
consent of JPMorgan, which has a tolling agreement for
Huntington Beach 3 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has claimed consent rights with respect to
Huntington Beach 3 and 4 even though the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) in January said the bank does not
have the contractual right to prevent AES from building the
synchronous condenser units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sought review of the FERC order in February but
agreed to transfer its alleged consent rights with respect to
Huntington Beach 3 and 4 to SCE as part of the sale approved on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Directors warn shareholders not to vote against board, CEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Seven-page letter defends directors on risk policy panel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Directors say company results transcend "London Whale"
loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Two ranking JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 directors issued a letter to shareholders on Friday
arguing against recommendations by proxy advisory firms to split
the duties of Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and vote against some
directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board is unanimous in its view that it is best for Dimon
to hold both roles and the current governance structure "is
working effectively," according to the letter signed by
presiding director Lee Raymond and William Weldon, who is
chairman of the corporate governance and nominating committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter warned that a vote against current directors or
to split the CEO and chairman roles "could be disruptive to the
company and is not in shareholders' best interests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter is a direct response to reports in the past seven
days from advisory firms Institutional Investors Services and
Glass Lewis &amp; Co. The firms concluded that investigations of the
bank's $6.2 billion loss on the "London Whale" derivatives
trades showed the board had failed in its oversight of JPMorgan
executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident is cited in policy debates in Washington as
evidence big banks need to be broken up or required to hold much
more capital for the safety of the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both advisory firms recommended JPMorgan shareholders vote
against re-election of three board members who served on the
board's risk policy committee when the losses occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory firms generally take the view that having a
board chairman who is separate from the CEO in a company leads
to better oversight. They said the London Whale episode showed
that JPMorgan was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board letter on Friday said the firms "and others have
incorrectly and unfairly characterized management's mistakes as
a failure by the risk policy committee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter was issued ahead of the bank's annual meeting on
May 21 when shareholders will vote on the board's recommendation
that all 11 directors be re-elected for another year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ballot also includes a non-binding resolution proposed
by some shareholders that calls on the board to have a chairman
who is independent from the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote on splitting the roles has come to be seen as a
referendum on Dimon, 57, who was widely praised for leading the
bank profitably and safely through the financial crisis and then
saw that reputation tarnished by the trading debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven-page letter came one year to the day after the
company announced it was losing billions of dollars on the
trades. Dimon had previously dismissed news reports of possible
losses as a "tempest in a teapot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter said the advisory firms focused "too narrowly" on
the losses and a broader view of the company's performance shows
Dimon and all of the board members should be supported in the
voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported record earnings and scored well on
measures of profitability, including 15 percent returns on
tangible common equity, every year for the last three years, the
letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We highlight the performance of the Company not to diminish
the events of last year or the lessons learned from them, but to
provide important context," the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter defended by name the three directors on the risk
policy committee who ISS said should not be re-elected. It said
the three directors--David Cote, who is also chairman and CEO of
Honeywell International Inc, James Crown, who is
president of private investment firm Henry Crown and Company,
and Ellen Futter, who is president of the American Museum of
Natural History--had worked diligently and have "accomplished
backgrounds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter said there was no reason that the trio should
have seen that a trading strategy which had successfully hedged
the bank's credit risk had turned into a losing bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The directors said it depends on the situation whether it is
best to have one person or two as chief executive and chairman.
They noted that the board had split the roles when Dimon first
became CEO and when his predecessor, William Harrison, first
became CEO under another chairman.&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2011-C4
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed seven classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. 2011-C4 (JPMCC 2011-C4) commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at 
      the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are due to stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral since issuance. As of the April 2013 distribution date, the 
      pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 2.1% to $1.42 
      billion from $1.45 billion at issuance. There are currently no 
      delinquent or specially serviced loans. Forty of the remaining 42 loans 
      (89.3% of the pool) reported full or at least partial year 2012 
      financials. Based on full year or annualized financial statements, the 
      pool's overall net operating income (NOI) improved approximately 10% 
      since issuance. However, the improvement reflects using annualized 
      estimates and is not directly comparable to issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest loan of the pool (13.6%) is secured by a 993,356 square foot 
      (sf) office building located in downtown Houston, TX. The property, Two 
      Allen Center, is located within the four-office tower Allen Center 
      development with two attached parking garages. The largest tenant, Devon 
      Energy Production Company (rated 'BBB+' by Fitch), occupies 65% of the 
      net rentable area (NRA) and has a lease expiration of January 2020. As 
      of the March 2013, the occupancy was 95.1% compared to 97.1% at 
      issuance. Servicer reported year-end 2012 debt service coverage ratio 
      (DSCR) was 1.89 times (x).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest loan is secured by a 1.15 million sf (972,484 SF 
      owned) regional mall located in Jersey City, NJ. The mall is anchored by 
      Macy's, JC Penny (non-collateral), Sears and Kohl's. Major tenants 
      include AMC Lowes Theatre, Pay Half and Forever 21. As of year-end 2012, 
      the occupancy and DSCR was 97.6% and 1.82x, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest loan is secured by nine manufactured housing 
      communities and two recreational vehicle resorts, with a total of 
      4,027-pads, located across six states. Total occupancy of the portfolio 
      increased to approximately 85% as of year-end 2012 from 79% as of 
      year-end 2011. Servicer reported year-end 2012 DSCR was 1.54x compared 
      to 1.47x at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All classes maintain Stable Rating Outlooks. Due to the recent issuance 
      of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics. Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in 
      the 'J.P Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2011-C4' (May 
      17, 2011) report, available at www.fitchratings.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$47.9 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$336.4 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      *Notional amount and interest only.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 10 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has sold the
rights to market electricity from three power plants in Southern
California to a regional power company, reducing the bank's
presence in the state as it comes under regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal energy regulators may take enforcement action
against JPMorgan over allegations that it manipulated power
prices in California and Michigan, which the bank denies and
vows to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman at JPMorgan said the company declined to
comment on the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California utility regulators on Thursday approved the plan
to transfer the management of the three power plants, which can
produce enough power for about three million homes, to Southern
California Edison (SCE) from October 1, 2013 to May 31, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCE is a unit of Edison International serving about
4.9 million customers in Southern and Central California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural gas-fired plants are owned and operated by units
of U.S. power company AES Corp and managed by JPMorgan
under so-called tolling agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tolling agreements usually allow companies like JPMorgan to
purchase gas and sell the power produced from the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale included the management 3,690 megawatts (MW) at
Units 1-6 at the Alamitos plant (1,950 MW), Units 1 and 2 at
Huntington Beach (430 MW) and Units 5-8 at Redondo Beach (1,310
MW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Public Utilities Commission and SCE did not
disclose the cost of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global IT Asset Management Software Market 
      2012-2016 with Hewlett-Packard Co., and IBM Corp Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/s36g6w/global_it_asset) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      IT Asset Management Software Market 2012-2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global IT Asset Management Software 
      market to grow at a CAGR of 9.4 percent over the period 2012-2016. One 
      of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increased 
      need for ITAM cost reduction. The Global IT Asset Management Software 
      market has also been witnessing the emergence of cloud computing. 
      However, the high deployment cost could pose a challenge to the growth 
      of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this market space are BMC Software Inc., CA 
      Technologies Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., and IBM Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendor mentioned in the report is Novo Solutions Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Enterprise 
      Computing team said: ''The emergence of cloud-based solutions has 
      enabled organizations to increase their efficiency and reduce the cost 
      of deploying valuable IT infrastructure. However, many organizations are 
      still analyzing the feasibility of such cloud computing solutions and 
      their relevance to their IT operations. The cloud-based model for ITAM 
      offers a pay-per-use model, which provides cost-effective accessibility 
      and a paradigm whereby the ITAM software can be accessed at any time and 
      in any place by multiple users. Hence, the Global ITAM market is 
      witnessing a trend where many vendors in the market have begun to offer 
      their solutions through the cloud-based model to expand their services 
      and enter new markets. Although many enterprises have an increased 
      understanding of the benefits of cloud-based ITAM solutions, a number of 
      concerns and risks, particularly with regard to data sharing and 
      security, are affecting the steady adoption of such solutions.''

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 10 (Reuters) - U.S. prime money market funds
slightly increased their holdings of euro zone bank debt in
April after Cyprus received a bailout to manage its bank
problems, according to a report by JPMorgan Securities released
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report showed the funds raised their ownership of euro
zone securities by $3 billion to $206 billion last month, led by
modest pickups in German and French bank debt that included
commercial paper, repurchase agreements and time deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, these funds slashed their holdings in euro zone
bank debt by $44 billion, which was the largest monthly decline
since last June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renewed purchases in euro zone paper in April brought prime
funds' exposure to the region up by $4 billion since end of
December 2012, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO &#8211; Israel is home to a vibrant startup ecosystem stocked with technical talent, entrepreneurial spirit, and venture capital. For these reasons, Microsoft chose Israel as the location of its first ever startup accelerator program which started last year and just graduated its second class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I visited Microsoft&#8217;s office in San Francisco yesterday to meet with some of these startups and learn more about the program and its progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Also, so I could tell my Bubby I met some nice Israelis.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanan Levy is the accelerator director in Israel. He measures the program&#8217;s success based on how many startups get funding within a year, the average amount raised, and how many members of the current class refer startups to the next class. By these standards, Microsoft&#8217;s program is doing well. The second class graduated two weeks ago and 10 of the 13 companies have already raised funds. The average raise of the first class is around $900,000 and the number of applications has tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a new model for Microsoft to operate an accelerator fully owned and run by Microsoft,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We make sure the companies have a big vision, the entrepreneurs can execute, that a strong tech person is part of the core team, and that the participants are coachable and open-minded. Many startups get involved with what they think is a pain point, but it isn&#8217;t really.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program lasts for four months where the startups get out and talk to customers, iterate and develop the product, interact with mentors, and hone their pitch. At the end of it all, they come to the U.S. for marketing, fundraising, and publicity. While Israel has an active startup scene, a strong presence in the U.S. market is still important for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitchenbug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitchenbug wants to tell the true story behind food. The startup uses natural language processing to analyze recipes and generate full nutritional data, as well as helpful clues to understanding what that data means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the health impact of a dish is not as simple as checking calorie, fat and sugar content. A number of other factors are at play and people without extensive knowledge of nutrition may not be aware of the consequences of certain meals. Kitchenbug addresses this issue by attaching green or red icons to each dish that say things like &#8220;not very heart healthy&#8221; or &#8220;good for feeling full&#8221; or &#8220;bad choice for weight loss.&#8221; That way, instead of parsing through various dishes and nutrition resources, you can instantly know if a recipe is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders have known each other for 25 years and live close together in Israel. COO Dror Daliot said that they used to be &#8220;chin-up champions&#8221; who were fit, slim, and strong, and then &#8220;life happened.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I love my daughters but they are terrible for my diet,&#8221; he said during a demo. &#8220;Pancake mornings and evening pizzas are not the healthiest.&#160; At a BBQ, I looked at my friends and our crumbling frames and said &#8216;guys, we have to do something about this.&#8217; We decided to develop technology that takes any online recipe from any website and instantly provides dietary information you need.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;60 percent of the Western world is overweight and 25 percent is obese, with weight-related diseases and allergies on the rise. According to Daliot, recipes are the second biggest search category on the web with 2 billion searches a month, and almost 50 percent of Americans search for info about health food. The Kitchenbug founders are not alone in their efforts to prepare healthy, home-cooked meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitchenbug has a bookmarking button that collect recipes into an online recipe box. Clicking into an ingredient will yield a description and serving sizes can be easily adapted. The app is social so people can share recipes, follow others, and discover new recipes. The company launched a WordPress plugin in January for food bloggers and over 2,500 recipes have been published so far, receiving 40 million views in 100 days. In the pipeline for Kitchenbug are icons and filters for ideological, allergy, and religious constraints. The data is based on nutritional information from the USDA database, as well as food manufacturers and brands, Wikipedia, and FDA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has raised $650,000 to date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Entrepreneur&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms JPM 1998-C6; Outlook Revised
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed three classes of JP Morgan Commercial 
      Mortgage Finance Corp. (JPM) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 1998-C6. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations reflect sufficient credit enhancement in light of the 
      high concentration and adverse selection of the remaining pool. In 
      addition, the seven remaining non-specially serviced loans' performance 
      has been stable since Fitch's last rating action. Fitch modeled losses 
      of 50.4% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool 
      balance total 4.4%, including losses already incurred. The pool has 
      experienced $17.6 million (2.2% of the original pool balance) in 
      realized losses to date. Fitch has designated two loans (67.9%) as Fitch 
      Loans of Concern, including the largest loan in the pool (66.7%) which 
      is the only loan in special servicing as of the April 2013 remittance 
      report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the April 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 95.8% to $33.2 million from $796.4 million 
      at issuance. The pool has become extremely concentrated with only eight 
      of the original 91 loans remaining. There are no defeased loans. 
      Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes G through H.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Negative Outlook on class F reflects the extreme concentration and 
      adverse selection of the remaining pool, as well as the potential for 
      further losses on the specially serviced loan. Class F may be subject to 
      further downgrade if expected losses increase on the specially serviced 
      loans or additional loans default. In addition, the distressed class G 
      may be subject to further rating actions as losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The specially serviced asset, The Court at Deptford (66.7% of the pool), 
      is a 361,000 square foot (sf) retail center in Deptford, NJ. The 
      property has experienced cash flow issues from occupancy declines. The 
      property was previously anchored by a Sam's Club (33% of the property's 
      net rentable area (NRA)), Sports Authority (11% NRA) and Circuit City 
      (9% NRA); all three had subsequently vacated at or prior to the 
      individual lease expirations between 2008 and 2010. Occupancy as of 
      March 2012 reported at 35%, with the three anchor spaces still vacant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan transferred to special servicing in February 2009 for imminent 
      default. A receiver was appointed in April 2010, and the asset has been 
      REO since May 2012. The servicer continues to pursue leasing efforts, 
      and evaluate strategic marketing and disposition scenarios for the asset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes and Rating Outlooks as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11 million class F at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$19.9 million class G at 'Csf'; RE 25%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.4 million class H at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A1, A2, A3, B, C, D and E certificates have paid in full. 
      Fitch does not rate the class NR certificates, which has been reduced to 
      zero due to realized losses. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the 
      interest-only class X certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 10 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil and Qatar
Petroleum announced an agreement on Thursday to ship liquefied
natural gas to Britain from their proposed export plant in the
United States, offering another supply stream to the island
nation as domestic output dwindles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, the companies would send up to 15.6 million
tonnes of LNG each year to their South Hook terminal in Wales
from the Golden Pass plant in Texas, pending U.S. government
approval to build the plant and export LNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes at the end of a torrid winter in
Britain which saw natural gas stocks fall to dangerously low
levels, causing major price spikes and calls for a more robust
supply system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain has a number of LNG import terminals, but a lack of
firm, long term supply deals makes it vulnerable to sudden
shortages when shippers in the Middle East divert cargoes to
higher paying markets in Asia, especially in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Hook terminal was underused during winter despite
higher demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a drilling boom in the United States has pushed
production to record highs and pulled prices to decade lows,
prompting a string of export project proposals. Golden Pass was
originally built in 2010 to import LNG, but like a number of
other terminals is now filing to export after sitting idle for
nearly three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Export approval relies largely on the outcome of a political
debate in the United States about exporting its abundant
resources overseas that opponents say would push fuel costs
higher at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said it could not decide whether to pursue regulatory approval for Pain Therapeutics Inc's painkiller Remoxy, for which the United States Food and Drug Administration sought additional studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pain Therapeutics fell 46 percent before the bell. Shares of Durect Corp, which provided the technology used in Remoxy, fell about 38 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a regulatory filing Pfizer -- which has marketing rights to the drug -- said that the FDA required additional clinical studies to be conducted for Remoxy, to address concerns raised in its June 2011 rejection letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said its response to the FDA's latest rejection letter in June 2011 would not be submitted to the regulator before mid-2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durect said Pfizer needs to conduct two studies, a study to show Remoxy is bioequivalent to its original formulation and an abuse potential study with the modified version of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it appeared there was a "regulatory pathway forward" for the drug, which it discussed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in a meeting on March 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Pfizer executive Alan Litwack said in a letter to Pain Therapeutics Chief Executive Remi Barbier that "no final decision has been made at this time" on whether to take Remoxy to commercial development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abuse-resistant painkiller has been rejected twice by the FDA due to concerns about its chemical make-up and production process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares were down slightly before the bells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pain Therapeutics and Durect Corp rose more than 40 percent last week after Pfizer said it was in talks with the FDA to find a way forward for Remoxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durect's technology was used to design Remoxy as a gel capsule so that it couldn't be abused by crushing it for snorting or dissolving it for injecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain Therapeutics and King Pharmaceuticals Inc first filed a marketing approval application for Remoxy in 2008. The FDA rejected it, and requested additional non-clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King, which was later acquired by Pfizer, resubmitted the application in December 2010. The FDA rejected the application in June 2011, saying that certain lots of Remoxy showed inconsistent release performance during testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Vrinda Manocha in Bangalore; Editing by Joyjeet Das)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 10 (Reuters) - A British pension fund adviser has joined
the calls for Jamie Dimon, chief executive and chairman of the
board of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, to surrender the
chairmanship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIRC, or Pension &amp; Investment Research Consultants, an
adviser to funds on shareholder issues, recommended in a report
that investors vote against re-electing Dimon and five other
JPMorgan directors at the bank's annual meeting on May 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adviser also said shareholders should vote in favor of a
resolution calling on the board to have a chairman who is
independent from company executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two biggest proxy advisers based in the United States,
Institutional Investor Services and Glass Lewis &amp; Co, have also
said the bank should have an independent board chairman and some
new directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firms said that investigations into JPMorgan's $6.2
billion "London Whale" trading loss show the board needs
leadership and improved oversight of management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firms' recommendations and the upcoming meeting have put
a spotlight on Dimon, 57, who has been widely praised for
leading the bank profitably and safely through the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not known how many JPMorgan shares are held by British
pension funds that use PIRC, said a spokesman for the adviser. 
PIRC has estimated that it advises funds with combined assets of
more than 1.5 trillion pounds ($2.3 trillion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan board said in the company's proxy statement
that its response to the derivatives losses demonstrated the
strength of its governance. The company has tightened risk
controls, and the board cut Dimon's pay for 2012 in half to
$11.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board counts 10 directors other than Dimon as
independent from management. PIRC said it disagrees because five
of those directors have been on the board for more than nine
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has the second-largest stock market value of U.S.
banks, with a market capitalization of $185 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 10 (Reuters) - Pain Therapeutics Inc said
Pfizer Inc, its marketing partner for painkiller Remoxy,
was yet to decide on continuing to seek regulatory approval for
the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pain Therapeutics fell 20 percent in light trading
before the bell. Shares of Durect Corp, which provided
the technology used in Remoxy, fell about 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it appeared there was a "regulatory pathway
forward" for the drug, which it discussed with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration in a meeting on March 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Pfizer executive Alan Litwack said in a letter to
Pain Therapeutics Chief Executive Remi Barbier that "no final
decision has been made at this time" on whether to take Remoxy
to commercial development. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abuse-resistant painkiller has been rejected twice by
the FDA due to concerns about its chemical make-up and
production process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said its response to the FDA's latest rejection
letter in June 2011 would not be submitted to the regulator
before mid-2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares were down slightly before the bells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pain Therapeutics and Durect Corp rose
more than 40 percent last week after Pfizer said it was in talks
with the FDA to find a way forward for Remoxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durect's technology was used to design Remoxy as a gel
capsule so that it couldn't be abused by crushing it for
snorting or dissolving it for injecting.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Biotie announces start of clinical study with nepicastat (SYN117) in cocaine dependence&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Biotie Therapies today announced the start of a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating nepicastat (SYN117) in cocaine dependence. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the US National Institutes of Health is funding the conduct of the study under a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) signed in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled 11-week trial and is expected to enroll about 180 treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent subjects. The study will be conducted at approximately 12 US clinics specializing in the treatment of drug dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to take approximately two years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;ABOUT NEPICASTAT (SYN117)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nepicastat is an orally administered, potent and selective inhibitor of the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) which converts dopamine into norepinephrine. Like many other addictions, cocaine dependence is driven by dysregulation in the dopamine-reward system. Inhibition of DBH by nepicastat increases levels of dopamine, which may reduce craving for cocaine, and reduces the levels of norepinephrine, which may decrease the pleasurable responses to cocaine and the potential for stress-induced relapse following withdrawal. Biotie has previously conducted a placebo-controlled Phase 2a study in non-treatment seeking cocaine addicts. The study showed that nepicastat had a favourable safety profile and was well tolerated when administered with cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nepicastat has also been evaluated as a potential treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In December 2012, Biotie announced top-line data from an investigator-initiated Phase 2 study in PTSD. In this study, nepicastat was generally well tolerated but was not effective in relieving PTSD-associated symptoms when compared to placebo. Biotie is evaluating data from this study in further detail and will then decide on next steps with nepicastat in PTSD&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Biotie holds full rights to nepicastat and will be able to use data from studies conducted with NIDA to support future potential regulatory submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;ABOUT BIOTIE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 12 (Reuters) - Pioneering journalist Barbara Walters,
the first woman to co-anchor a U.S. evening news program, plans
to announce her retirement on "The View" on Monday, the host
network ABC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an entertainment blog posting on Sunday, the network said
Walters, 83, would announce on Monday on "The View," the
all-women talk show she created in 1997, that she would retire
from television journalism next summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until then, she will continue to anchor and report for ABC
News, appear on 'The View,' and anchor specials throughout the
year," the blog stated, noting that Walters would remain an
executive producer of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am very happy with my decision and look forward to a
wonderful and special year ahead both on 'The View' and with ABC
News," the blog quoted her as saying. "I created 'The View' and
am delighted it will last beyond my leaving it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC sources said in March that, after more than five decades
as a prominent figure on U.S. television, Walters planned to
retire in May 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters had open heart surgery in 2010. She fainted, hit her
head and suffered a concussion in January, and was then
diagnosed with chicken pox, causing her to miss more than a
month of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is best known as one of the top interviewers on U.S.
television, counting an array of world leaders as subjects,
including Cuba's Fidel Castro, Britain's Margaret Thatcher,
Saddam Hussein of Iraq and every U.S. president since Richard
Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters got her start in television journalism in 1961 as a
writer on NBC's "Today," a show she would later become the first
woman to co-host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1976, she became the first woman to co-anchor a television
evening news broadcast on any U.S. network for "ABC Evening
News." Walters has also worked as a producer and host of the ABC
news magazine "20/20" and as a correspondent for ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC is a unit of Walt Disney Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, May 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed
Australia-based 
Coca-Cola Amatil's (CCL) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR)
and senior 
unsecured rating at 'BBB+' and its Short-Term IDR at 'F2'. The
Outlook is 
Stable.
Key Rating Drivers
Major bottler of Coca-Cola: CCL's 'BBB+' rating benefits from a
one-notch uplift 
from its standalone rating of 'BBB' reflecting its close
strategic ties to 
global soft drink giant, The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC, A+/
Stable). TCCC is CCL's 
main shareholder  with  a  29.3%  share. TCCC nominates two of
CCL's nine board 
members.  CCL  is  one  of  TCCC's  top five Coca-Cola 
bottlers,  and  also  
provides  TCCC  with access to over 285 million consumers in the
Asia-Pacific 
region.
High entry barriers: CCL's stand-alone rating is supported by
the competitive 
advantage and barriers to entry offered by its exclusive
contract to bottle and 
distribute Coca-Cola across Australia and New Zealand as well as
by CCL's well 
entrenched and leading market position. 
Dominant and increasing soft-drink market share: CCL has a
77%-78% share in 
Australia's 2,500kl non-alcoholic beverage market. ASAI (brands
such as Pepsi 
and Schweppes), CCL's largest competitor, has a market share of
around 15%-20% 
with the balance being mostly private labelled (supermarket
chain) goods. CCL 
has managed to protect its market share while increasing its
unit prices over 
the last five years.
Driver of supermarket traffic: Studies conducted by CCL indicate
that between 
10% and 20% of Australian shoppers were prepared to switch
retailers to buy 
cheaper Coca-Cola  -  a  claim  reinforced  by  the  fact  that 
Coca-Cola  has  
been  the  top  product  overall  in supermarket trolleys for
the last 15 years. 
Heavy reliance on supermarket distribution channel: Reliance on
and 
concentration of the Australian supermarket distribution channel
is a material 
weakness in CCL's operating risk profile. Half of CCL's
Australian beverage EBIT 
is generated via the supermarket channel. This amounts to 35% of
the group's 
EBIT. Woolworths and Coles represent about 80% of supermarket
sales in Australia 
and these two businesses are unilaterally driving price
deflation across the 
majority of their supplier's product lines. 
Sensitivity of volumes to weather: CCL's soft drink sales are
exposed to 
weather-related risks. The majority of CCL's Australian soft
drink sales occur 
in the midst of the Australian summer which coincides with the
peak retail 
months of November to January. Bad weather over this period has
been blamed for 
annualised falls in volume of up to 2%.
Poor execution of diversification strategy: CCL has attempted to
diversify its 
earnings base both geographically and by product line but most
of these attempts 
have been poorly executed. Of CCL's EBIT 70% is still generated
from Australian 
soft drink sales. Sequential write-downs in the inventory of the
food business 
(SPC Ardmona) over the last two years and continued price
deflation driven by 
the Australian grocery retail channel provide little prospect of
a future 
turn-around of this business. 
Moreover, prospects for a re-entry into the beer market in FY14
are lacklustre 
at best, with the JV with Casella and the distribution of the
little known 
Rekoderlig facing the well-entrenched domestic beer portfolios
of the Fosters 
group and Lion Nathan (a subsidiary of the Kirin group).   
Rating Sensitivity
Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating
action include:
-Diminishing of CCL's strategic or operational significance to
TCCC
-Adjusted  net  debt/ FFO(funds flow from operations)  rising 
above  3.5x  
(2.72x in FY12 and expected to peak at 2.5x over FY13-FY16) or
funds from 
operations (FFO) interest cover declining below 4x (6.43x in
FY12 and expected 
to trough at 6.8x over FY13-FY16 ), on a sustained basis
Positive rating action is not envisaged over the rating horizon
owing to an 
inherent lack of diversification stemming from its strategic
imperative to 
remain a major bottler of Coca-Cola in Australasia.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney's ABC network will become the first broadcast network to stream its shows live online through an ongoing service, starting with viewers of its TV stations in New York and Philadelphia on May 14 and expanding to its other stations by the end of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote its WATCH ABC service, through the end of June Disney is allowing all viewers of its WABC station in New York and WPVI station in Philadelphia to watch live ABC programs online or on mobile devices by downloading the WATCH ABC app, Disney said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app will initially allow users to be able to watch the service on Apple's iPad and iPhone and on the Kindle Fire device, and later this summer on Samsung Galaxy devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other networks are expected to follow Disney, as traditional broadcasters scramble to keep viewers watching its programs instead of drifting off to Netflix and other online services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, CBS made an investment in Syncbak, a technology company that works with local TV stations to stream programming to consumers over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting on July 1, Disney will only provide its WATCH ABC service to subscribers of cable, satellite and other TV subscription services that have agreements with ABC to offer the service to their subscribers in New York and Philadelphia. Subscribers must provide an authentication code to be granted access to the shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this summer, Disney said it will expand use of its WATCH ABC service to authenticated subscribers that receive its TV stations in Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Houston, Raleigh-Durham and Fresno, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company signed an agreement with Hearst Television to offer the service as well to Hearst's 13 ABC affiliates, including Boston, Pittsburgh and Kansas City. The stations will offer the service "in the coming months," the two companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users of WATCH ABC will be able to access programs on demand as well as watch live programs, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney already offers similar services to subscribers of three of its Disney Channel outlets - WATCH Disney Channel, WATCH Disney XD and WATCH Disney Junior - and through its WATCH ESPN service for several of the sports channel outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A rift emerged between U.S. business groups and organized labor over a high-skilled worker program in the Senate immigration bill, as the tech industry and other firms on Monday pushed to make it easier for companies to hire people from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the eve of a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a broad coalition of business groups wrote to the panel urging changes to the visa program known as H-1B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bipartisan Senate immigration bill would raise the cap on the number of high-skilled workers to at least 110,000 from a current limit of 65,000. In future years, the cap could rise as high as 180,000 depending on labor-market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the letter signed by the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and major technology lobbying organizations, the groups welcomed the increase in the size of the high-skilled worker program and but said they wanted some changes to some of the program requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes, the letter said, would help avoid, "unintended consequences," that could run counter to the goal of encouraging innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah has proposed several amendments to the high-skilled visa program, including a softening of the requirements designed to ensure that Americans get the first crack at a high-skilled job. Many business groups have consulted with Hatch and support his proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business groups say they have no problem with the goal of hiring American workers but contend that some view the recruitment procedures as burdensome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AFL-CIO labor organization disagreed. "The idea that you're going to change the bill to deny American tech workers a shot at the jobs of the future - that's not good politics, that's not good policy and it isn't going to pass," said Jeff Hauser, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our view is that technology workers in America who have invested in the skills of the future -- as the tech industry wants them to do - they deserve a fair shot at the jobs of the future," Hauser added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Costa, an analyst with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, also criticized the proposed amendments, saying that the requirements on high-skilled visas "don't seem to be very onerous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweeping immigration bill, written by the bipartisan "Gang of Eight" senators, would tighten border security, provide a 13-year path to citizenship for most of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country and revamp visa programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday will debate amendments to the bill on H-1B visas, which allow non-U.S. citizens with advanced skills and degrees in specialty occupations to work in the country for up to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIRST OFFER TO AMERICAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate bill would require employers that want to use the high-skilled worker visa program to first advertise the job on a government-run website and offer it to any qualified American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Hatch's amendments would loosen these provisions and only require employers to take good-faith steps to recruit Americans. And only "H-1B dependent" companies, which hire a large number of foreign workers, would be required to first offer the job to an American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate bill would also require companies to pledge not to replace American workers with foreigners for 90 days before and after the companies apply for work visas. Hatch would require that employers not intentionally displace U.S. workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though business and labor are at odds over some provisions in the high-skilled visa program, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO have a deal over separate provisions in the bill concerning low-skilled workers. The "W-visa" program would allow a certain number of people to work in the country temporarily as janitors, hotel workers and in other low-skill jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill would put strict limits on the number of construction workers who could obtain these visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While joining tech companies and other groups in pushing for changes to the high-skilled worker program, the Chamber of Commerce declined to throw its support behind efforts from the construction industry to expand the low-skill worker program. In its own letter to the Judiciary Committee, the Chamber urged that the "sound structure" in W-visa program be retained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An amendment from Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah would double the number of visas for low-skilled workers to 400,000 from 200,000. If approved, that amendment could imperil the bill's chances by upsetting the balance the Senate authors sought to achieve among business, labor and other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoff Burr of the Associated Builders and Contractors, which represents the construction industry, said that while his group backs Lee's amendment, the votes aren't available at the Judiciary Committee to expand the low-skilled worker program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business groups hope that if the immigration bill passes the Democratic-led Senate, the call to increase the size of the low-skill visa program might find favor in the Republican-led House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Philip Barbara)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) shareholders should vote against the Wall Street bank's executive compensation proposal because the board has "failed to link pay with performance," proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said in a report on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders should also vote against director James Johnson, Glass Lewis said, because of his position as chair of the compensation committee and prior roles at public companies that suffered financial issues and scandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its criticism of Goldman's pay packages, Glass Lewis said the company sets short-term compensation on a "purely discretionary basis" that is not in shareholders' best interest. The Federal Reserve has been pushing Wall Street banks to use more formulaic metrics in determining executive compensation, Reuters reported in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe shareholders benefit when incentive awards are determined on the basis of metrics with pre-established goals and are thus demonstrably linked to the performance of the company, aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders," Glass Lewis said. "In this case, shareholders should be seriously concerned with the Company's failure to implement a formula-based short-term incentive plan with objective metrics and goals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CEO (Goldman Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein) was paid moderately more than the median CEO compensation of these peer companies. Overall, the Company paid more than its peers, but performed moderately worse than its peers," the advisory firm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis advises institutional investors how to cast votes during proxy season. Its report comes about a week before JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) closely watched and contentious shareholder vote on whether to split Jamie Dimon's roles of chairman and CEO. Goldman negotiated a deal with an activist union group to avoid having a similar proposal on its proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis's analysis of Goldman's compensation noted a recent increase in director compensation, and what it characterized as a lack of disclosure about Goldman-managed funds that executives invest in alongside clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of senior Goldman executives received $128 million in distributions from those funds last year, up from $97 million in 2011, according to Goldman's proxy. In some cases their compensation for performance was much less than those distributions. For instance, Blankfein was awarded $21 million for his work in 2012, compared with $31.2 million he received from the internal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman employees can usually invest in the funds - which range from private-equity investments to real estate - once they are named partners of the firm. Glass Lewis said Goldman should better identify the funds that insiders have significant interests in, so that shareholders can judge whether those interests conflict with overall performance of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In regards to Johnson, Glass Lewis cited several incidents that brought into question his corporate governance credentials, and his leadership of the compensation committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson had been CEO and chairman of Fannie Mae in the 1990s, when the company failed to recognize $200 million in expenses. That boosted Fannie's profits in a way that allowed executives to meet targets for maximum bonus payouts, including $1.9 million that Johnson received, Glass Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson also participated in Countrywide Financial's "VIP" mortgage program that gave favorable loan terms to Washington insiders, and was a director of two companies whose CEOs illegally backdated stock options, Glass Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe shareholders would be better served by a director above reproach who will not subject the company to further criticism," Glass Lewis concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Gary Hill and Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

For these reasons, Microsoft chose Israel as the location of its first ever startup accelerator program which started last year and just graduated its second class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I visited Microsoft&#8217;s office in San Francisco yesterday to meet with some of these startups and learn more about the program and its progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Also, so I could tell my Bubby I met some nice Israelis.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanan Lavy is the accelerator director in Israel. He measures the program&#8217;s success based on how many startups get funding within a year, the average amount raised, and how many members of the current class refer startups to the next class. By these standards, Microsoft&#8217;s program is doing well. The second class graduated two weeks ago and 10 of the 13 companies have already raised funds. The average raise of the first class is around $900,000 and the number of applications has tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a new model for Microsoft to operate an accelerator fully owned and run by Microsoft,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We make sure the companies have a big vision, the entrepreneurs can execute, that a strong tech person is part of the core team, and that the participants are coachable and open-minded. Many startups get involved with what they think is a pain point, but it isn&#8217;t really.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program lasts for four months where the startups get out and talk to customers, iterate and develop the product, interact with mentors, and hone their pitch. At the end of it all, they come to the U.S. for marketing, fundraising, and publicity. While Israel has an active startup scene, a strong presence in the U.S. market is still important for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitchenbug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitchenbug wants to tell the true story behind food. The startup uses natural language processing to analyze recipes and generate full nutritional data, as well as helpful clues to understanding what that data means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the health impact of a dish is not as simple as checking calorie, fat and sugar content. A number of other factors are at play and people without extensive knowledge of nutrition may not be aware of the consequences of certain meals. Kitchenbug addresses this issue by attaching green or red icons to each dish that say things like &#8220;not very heart healthy&#8221; or &#8220;good for feeling full&#8221; or &#8220;bad choice for weight loss.&#8221; That way, instead of parsing through various dishes and nutrition resources, you can instantly know if a recipe is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders have known each other for 25 years and live close together in Israel. COO Dror Daliot said that they used to be &#8220;chin-up champions&#8221; who were fit, slim, and strong, and then &#8220;life happened.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I love my daughters but they are terrible for my diet,&#8221; he said during a demo. &#8220;Pancake mornings and evening pizzas are not the healthiest.&#160; At a BBQ, I looked at my friends and our crumbling frames and said &#8216;guys, we have to do something about this.&#8217; We decided to develop technology that takes any online recipe from any website and instantly provides dietary information you need.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;60 percent of the Western world is overweight and 25 percent is obese, with weight-related diseases and allergies on the rise. According to Daliot, recipes are the second biggest search category on the web with 2 billion searches a month, and almost 50 percent of Americans search for info about health food. The Kitchenbug founders are not alone in their efforts to prepare healthy, home-cooked meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitchenbug has a bookmarking button that collect recipes into an online recipe box. Clicking into an ingredient will yield a description and serving sizes can be easily adapted. The app is social so people can share recipes, follow others, and discover new recipes. The company launched a WordPress plugin in January for food bloggers and over 2,500 recipes have been published so far, receiving 40 million views in 100 days. In the pipeline for Kitchenbug are icons and filters for ideological, allergy, and religious constraints. The data is based on nutritional information from the USDA database, as well as food manufacturers and brands, Wikipedia, and FDA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has raised $650,000 to date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Entrepreneur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Trailblazing broadcast journalist Barbara Walters, known for her interviews with world leaders and celebrities and the first woman to co-anchor a U.S. evening news program, said on Monday she will retire in the summer of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

			JPMorgan Chase Publishes 2012 Corporate Responsibility Report, Global 
      Strength, Local Impact
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) today released its 2012 Corporate 
      Responsibility summary report, titled Global 
      Strength, Local Impact. The report highlights the many ways the 
      firm leveraged its strength and global reach, expertise and resources to 
      make a positive impact in communities around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global Strength, Local Impact underscores the firm's efforts to 
      help grow the economy &#8211; investing in workforce training, economic 
      development and infrastructure, and continuing to connect economic 
      leaders through its Global Cities Initiative, strengthen the communities 
      in which it operates, honor military and veterans and promote 
      environmental sustainability with clients as well as in its own 
      operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "At JPMorgan Chase, we believe that we have a unique and fundamental 
      corporate responsibility to help our clients and communities navigate a 
      complex global economy and address their economic and social 
      challenges," said Peter Scher, Executive Vice President and Head of 
      Corporate Responsibility at JPMorgan Chase. "This is at the core of our 
      values and central to how we do business. We are proud of the ways in 
      which we bring all our assets to bear to help our economy continue to 
      rebuild and improve the lives of people in our communities."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report also features an exclusive dialogue between the company's 
      Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and Mark Tercek, President and CEO of The 
      Nature Conservancy. They address issues ranging from the financial 
      industry's role in society to the firm's risk management, as well as 
      environmental and social practices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2012, JPMorgan Chase increased its lending to small businesses by 18% 
      over 2011, earning the position as #1 Small Business Administration 
      lender for the third year in a row and receiving recognition from 
      organizations like the Export-Import Bank of the United States, whose 
      Chairman and President Fred Hochberg said, "J.P. Morgan has done an 
      effective job of reaching small and medium-sized businesses. They're a 
      great partner in ensuring that American exporters have access to the 
      financing they need to grow their companies and succeed in the 
      international market."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The firm also provided $6 billion to low- and moderate-income 
      individuals or communities through its community development lending and 
      investing and received recognition from Terry Simonette, President  CEO 
      of NCB Capital Impact: "JPMorgan Chase has demonstrated its ability to 
      harness these resources collectively, rather than approach circumstances 
      in low-income communities with a banking approach driven solely by 
      volume and visibility of deals."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase also introduced Chase Liquid&#174;, a general 
      purpose reloadable card that is a low-cost alternative to traditional 
      checking accounts and designed to bring underserved customers into the 
      traditional banking system. It has been received positively, earning 
      recognition from consumer advocacy groups like National Council of La 
      Raza, whose Economic Policy Director, Janis Bowdler, said that Liquid 
      strikes the balance between its "business interests and the needs of 
      underserved consumers by creating products and delivery channels that 
      foster long-term relationships" and that the bank "has been able to 
      reach Hispanic customers that previously had been skeptical or 
      intimidated by mainstream banks."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other highlights include how JPMorgan Chase:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        provided credit and raised capital of over $1.8 trillion for clients 
        worldwide;
      
			
        donated more than $190 million to nonprofit organizations;
      
			
        worked to improve the lives of underserved people around the globe by 
        growing the amount of capital we committed to impact investments to 
        nearly $50 million; and
      
			
        continued to work with coalition firms to grow the 100,000 Jobs 
        Mission to 91 companies that hired more than 51,000 American veterans 
        in just under two years. JPMorgan Chase alone hired nearly 5,000 
        veterans by the end of the year.

		&lt;p&gt;Vantiv to Bring Next Generation Point-of-Sale Redemption Technology to the U.S. Market with Visa Offers Platform&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Platform Better Connects Cardholders and Merchants of All Sizes and Enhances Their Capabilities to Increase Loyalty by Delivering Customized Sales Offers to Individual Cardholders&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI, May 13, 2013 -
			Vantiv, Inc. (NYSE: VNTV), a leading provider of payment processing services and related technology solutions for merchants and financial institutions of all sizes, announced today that it is bringing the next generation of point-of-sale redemption technology to cardholders and merchants of all sizes with the innovative Visa Offers platform. Vantiv is the first U.S. acquirer to announce their intent to offer this technology to clients across the country, which will help drive additional value at the point-of-sale. Vantiv's strong execution capabilities and agile ability to deploy new technologies across the payments value chain continues to enable Vantiv to offer its clients the latest innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Vantiv's single-integrated processing platform, combined with Visa Offers, provides a powerful new way to enhance the connection between cardholders and merchants," said Donald Boeding, president of merchant services at Vantiv. "Now by making this unique platform available to our merchants, we can help clients drive even more loyalty for their brand by enabling them to deliver customized sale offers directly to consumers enrolled in Visa Offers programs, including during their shopping experience. Visa Offers is just the latest example of our commitment to providing new payment technologies that help drive sales volume, reduce costs and innovate the way our clients serve customers."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;With Visa Offers, the Visa card consumers already use for convenient purchases, can now deliver personalized deals from top brands right to an enrolled individual's mobile phone or email. &#160; This platform enables clients to identify and send customized, targeted offers to consumers - with their consent - in a way that leverages their purchase location and interests based on purchase behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"The days of consumers walking around with a wallet stuffed with coupons are officially over," said Darren Parslow, global head of processing. "Visa's new point-of-sale redemption technology provides financial institutions and retailers of all sizes access to a robust offer redemption infrastructure that allows them to compete more effectively for a larger share of the consumer wallet."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The redemption platform helps clients manage promotions across all sales locations by using a single, consistent redemption process and it provides them the ability to track and measure program success with a consolidated reporting tool.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the Visa POS Offers Redemption Platform provides real time ticket reduction as part of the offer redemption during the authorization process, delivering an alternative option to the need for statement credits or paper coupons. This functionality streamlines the checkout process by enabling instant redemption of rewards and has the potential to drive incremental transaction volume. Once the reduced transaction amount has been approved by the card issuer, consumers are immediately notified of their savings via receipt printout and SMS text, or email message.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Vantiv serves more than 1,300 financial institutions and nearly 400,000 merchant locations across the country. &#160;The Company is the No. 1 PIN Debit processor and third largest overall acquirer in the United States by total number of transactions1.&lt;/p&gt;

      Visa Adds New Capabilities to its Innovative Offers Platform
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Allows issuers and retailers of all sizes to deliver customized 
      offers and a more seamless checkout experience.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today announced a processing enhancement for Visa 
      Offers, a solution that enables Visa issuers, acquirers and merchants of 
      all sizes to deliver targeted rewards to Visa cardholders. The enhanced 
      service has the potential to eliminate paper coupons, allowing 
      consumers, who opt in, to earn points and discounts as well as redeem 
      special offers instantly at checkout by simply using their enrolled Visa 
      card. The platform supports Visa&#8217;s commitment to offer solutions for 
      retailer and financial institution clients of any size that allows them 
      to deliver customized and differentiated benefits to Visa cardholders at 
      the point-of-sale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa&#8217;s payments processing network, VisaNet, enables the efficient 
      delivery of these offers that can enhance the consumer checkout 
      experience, increase merchant sales and strengthen issuer relationships. 
      The new capabilities include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Fully Customizable Offer ContentRetailers and financial 
        institutions can deliver offers that are tailored to individual 
        customers, through email, web and mobile. For example, a clothing 
        retailer could deliver a personalized text message or email to 
        customers who have opted in to the program while they are shopping 
        nearby.
      
			
				Real-Time Offer Relevancy The platform also provides 
        retailers and issuers data insights and analytics to measure the 
        point-of-sale redemption rate, allowing them to create customized and 
        more relevant offers.
      
			
				Consumer Loyalty QualificationThrough the enhancement of 
        the Visa Offers platform, retailers and issuers can use real-time 
        messaging capabilities to identify and uniquely reward loyal customers.
      
		
		
			
				Multiple Redemption Options Enhancements to the Visa 
        Offers platform include support for real-time redemption of offers and 
        rewards at the point-of-sale. This complements the existing statement 
        credit capability.
      
			
				Support for Multiple Offers Programs The Visa Offers 
        platform supports both Visa-specific and third-party offer programs to 
        help drive incremental purchases and a faster, more seamless checkout 
        experience for consumers, who provide their consent.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Smarter commerce means having the right offer, delivered to the right 
      customer at the right time,&#8221; said Jim McCarthy, global head of Products, 
      Visa Inc. &#8220;Visa&#8217;s new real-time point-of-sale redemption platform is a 
      great example of Visa&#8217;s ability to apply its processing and technology 
      expertise to simplify the use of offers and discounts, bringing benefits 
      to merchants, acquirers, issuers and consumers. This enhancement to 
      Visa&#8217;s processing platform is emblematic of our strategy to facilitate 
      our clients differentiating benefits for their customers at the 
      point-of-sale.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa has established agreements to source discounts from leading 
      retailers and can manage the Visa Offers platform on behalf of 
      retailers, acquirers, and issuers, from enrollment to offer delivery to 
      redemption options.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;From hardware designs to software enhancements, it has never been more 
      important for the payments industry to find meaningful ways to enhance 
      the consumer experience,&#8221; said Nick Holland, senior payments analyst, 
      Javelin Strategy  Research. &#8220;Visa has a long history of delivering 
      payment tools that transform the ways consumers shop, and Visa&#8217;s new 
      offers redemption platform is another innovative example of making the 
      payment process more efficient for banks, merchants and consumers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - After 18 years as a banker at firms such as Citigroup and Nomura, Shaheryar Chishty took a different direction in late 2011, starting an investment firm that, among other things, helped guide Chinese and South Korean money into Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Pakistan is probably not the first place the average investor would choose to park cash, Chishty's timing was spot on. The country's stock market surged 49 percent last year to become one of the five best performing markets in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victory by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in Pakistan's general election lifted the stock market to an all-time high on Monday, in a sign that investors, which include Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Mark Mobius of Templeton, are betting on the prospect of further market gains through a stable government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not under-estimating the challenges, but we have one party with a simple majority," Chishty, the Pakistan-origin chief executive of Asiapak Investments Ltd, told Reuters in an interview in Hong Kong on Monday. "A lot of the market's rise happened despite the previous government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risks, especially violence by Islamic militant groups, remain constant, yet Pakistan's market is up another 21 percent this year, behind only Japan and the Philippines as Asia's top gainers, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan's uncertain security environment and a deteriorating economy have failed to keep emerging market fund guru Mobius and Goldman Sachs Asset Management out of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobius invested 4.6 percent of his $18.5 billion Templeton Asian Growth Fund's assets in Pakistani shares as of the end of March, more than his exposure to shares in Hong Kong, Singapore or Taiwan, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pakistan is not a small country and it is strategically significant.

He has suggested he would be willing to implement politically sensitive reforms to secure an IMF lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ishaq Dar, set to be the new finance minister, has said he plans to lean on provincial governments to collect agricultural taxes, a policy that could set him on a collision course with some of the wealthy supporters of Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chishty, of Asiapak, pointed out that two of Pakistan's main problems are its poor tax collection and lagging energy sector. But he said the country's market has a strong downside protection from the support it receives from the United States and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, the world's sixth most populous country with nearly 200 million people, shares some of the same qualities that have made some emerging Asian countries the darling of global investors: a rising middle class, which in turn has created a boom in consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer stocks in Pakistan, as a result, have become relatively expensive, though on the whole, the market remains cheap. It trades at 7 times 12-month forward earnings, or 41 percent below the average for the Asia-Pacific region, according to data from StarMine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market run came in part from a rule last year allowing so-called black money to be invested into the economy, which critics said was an endorsement of money laundering and supporters said was a smart way to expand the tax base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That rule is set to expire in July next year, with investors waiting anxiously to see if Sharif will extend the deadline, to allow more money to flow into the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT THE BOTTOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One persistent worry is the weak currency. The Pakistani rupee has fallen about 10 percent against the dollar since last year, depressing returns for foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is volatility, to which Pakistan is especially susceptible given its small market size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan's Karachi 100 Index has a market capitalization of $46 billion, making it smaller than the market value of Singapore Telecommunications (STEL.SI). Oil and Gas Development Co Ltd (OGDC.KA), one of the top ten holdings of the Mobius Asia fund, accounts for 20 percent of the entire market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs N-11 Equity Fund held shares such as Oil and Gas Development and MCB Bank Ltd (MCB.KA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total size of Pakistan's equity funds tracked by Lipper is around $1 billion in assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Yaqoob, chief investment officer of Pakistan's AKD Investment Management Ltd., is among those managing money inside the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Golden Arrow Selected Stocks Fund returned 105 percent to rank among the world's top-5 equity mutual funds last year and gained 30 percent up to the end of April this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaqoob oversees 3.2 billion Pakistani rupees ($32.51 million) and has invested in companies such as TRG Pakistan Ltd (TRGP.KA), Kohinoor Energy Ltd (KOHN.KA) and ENGRO Corporation Ltd (EGCH.KA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaqoob sees plenty of obstacles, but also an upside, given the country's political and economic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are already at the bottom of everything," said Yaqoob, 30. "Things can't get any worse than this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michael Flaherty and Umesh Desai; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani)&lt;/p&gt;

without which government finances could hit the wall in the next
six months or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moody's this week said the new government faced many hurdles
and retained the negative outlook on its Caa1 rating, just three
steps above default and seven below investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rating agency said the government faces challenges such
as energy shortages, external liquidity vulnerability, and forex
reserves which have halved to $6.7 billion in the last one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, Pakistan sovereign bonds due in 2036  PK024962741=
are yielding 11 percent, down from 12.2 percent a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW ECONOMIC TEAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billionaire businessman Sharif, almost certain to be sworn
in as prime minister for the third time, has said fixing the
economy is his top priority. He has suggested he would be
willing to implement politically sensitive reforms to secure an
IMF lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ishaq Dar, set to be the new finance minister, has said he
plans to lean on provincial governments to collect agricultural
taxes, a policy that could set him on a collision course with
some of the wealthy supporters of Sharif's Pakistan Muslim
League.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chishty, of Asiapak, pointed out that two of Pakistan's main
problems are its poor tax collection and lagging energy sector.
But he said the country's market has a strong downside
protection from the support it receives from the United States
and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, the world's sixth most populous country with
nearly 200 million people, shares some of the same qualities
that have made some emerging Asian countries the darling of
global investors: a rising middle class, which in turn has
created a boom in consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer stocks in Pakistan, as a result, have become
relatively expensive, though on the whole, the market remains
cheap. It trades at 7 times 12-month forward earnings, or 41
percent below the average for the Asia-Pacific region, according
to data from StarMine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market run came in part from a rule last year allowing
so-called black money to be invested into the economy, which
critics said was an endorsement of money laundering and
supporters said was a smart way to expand the tax base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That rule is set to expire in July next year, with investors
waiting anxiously to see if Sharif will extend the deadline, to
allow more money to flow into the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT THE BOTTOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One persistent worry is the weak currency. The Pakistani
rupee has fallen about 10 percent against the dollar
since last year, depressing returns for foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is volatility, to which Pakistan is especially
susceptible given its small market size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan's Karachi 100 Index has a market capitalisation of
$46 billion, making it smaller than the market value of
Singapore Telecommunications. Oil and Gas Development
Co Ltd, one of the top ten holdings of the Mobius Asia
fund, accounts for 20 percent of the entire market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs N-11 Equity Fund held shares such as Oil and
Gas Development and MCB Bank Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total size of Pakistan's equity funds tracked by Lipper
is around $1 billion in assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Yaqoob, chief investment officer of Pakistan's AKD
Investment Management Ltd., is among those managing money inside
the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Golden Arrow Selected Stocks Fund returned 105 percent
to rank among the world's top-5 equity mutual funds last year
and gained 30 percent up to the end of April this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaqoob oversees 3.2 billion Pakistani rupees ($32.51
million) and has invested in companies such as TRG Pakistan Ltd
, Kohinoor Energy Ltd and ENGRO Corporation
Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaqoob sees plenty of obstacles, but also an upside, given
the country's political and economic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are already at the bottom of everything," said Yaqoob,
30. "Things can't get any worse than this."

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO May 14 (Reuters) - Oil companies OGX
 and Exxon Mobil Corp won Brazilian deepwater
oil and natural gas exploration blocks in a frontier region of
Brazil's Potiguar Basin at an auction on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX agreed to pay 20 million reais ($10 million) for the
rights to the PN-M-475 block and the OGX and Exxon Mobil
consortium agreed to pay 81.9 million reais for PN-M-762. The
blocks are located southeast of the city of Fortaleza in
Brazil's northeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many geologists believe that the deeper water offshore areas
in Potiguar and other northern coastal regions of Brazil may
contain oil structures similar to those in West African
countries such as Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Energy cooperation with Iraqi Kurds hot topic in U.S.
visit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Partnership between Exxon, KRG to be discussed with Obama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANKARA May 14 (Reuters) - A Turkish firm is partnering with
the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Exxon Mobil 
to carry out oil exploration in northern Iraq, Turkey's prime
minister said on Tuesday, taking Turkey's cooperation with Iraqi
Kurds on energy one step further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil is at the heart of the fight between the Arab-led
central government in Baghdad and the ethnic Kurdish-run
northern enclave as they dispute control over oilfields and
territory and the sharing of crude oil revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, a global oil company based in Texas, was the first to
sign up for exploration deals with the KRG. Others including
Chevron, Total and Russia's Gazprom Neft
 have followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said an agreement was in place
for a Turkish company to become a partner with Exxon and the KRG
and that details would be clearer after his U.S. visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our oil company already has an agreement with Exxon Mobil
in place ... This is a step with the KRG on exploration work,"
Erdogan told reporters at Ankara airport before heading to the
United States for an official visit. He is due to meet U.S.
President Barack Obama on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, resource-hungry Turkey has been a customer and a
transportation outlet for oil exports from the Kurdish region.
With this agreement, the Turks would play an active role in
exploiting Iraqi Kurdistan's rich hydrocarbon resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad says it alone has the authority to control exports
from Iraq and that deals between oil companies and the KRG are
illegal. Leaders of the autonomous Kurdish region say their
right to control oil resources is enshrined in Iraq's federal
constitution, drawn up following the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkish industry sources said the likely partner is Turkish
Petroleum International Company (TPIC), an arm of state-run
Turkish Petroleum (TPAO). A spokesman for the company could not
immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington, wary of the divisions between Baghdad and the
Kurdish region, has urged passage of a long-delayed national oil
law to resolve the standoff, which has intensified since the
last U.S. troops left in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will develop our steps after this visit," Erdogan said,
referring to the plans for northern Iraq, without specifying
what the agreement would involve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Turkish company will take equity stakes in a partnership
with Exxon and KRG and would become part of the
production-sharing agreement, an Ankara-based energy source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another energy official in Ankara said any contracts would
be in the form of commercial agreements signed between
companies, not an agreement between governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his U.S. visit, Erdogan will seek Obama's support for
further energy deals that Turkish companies are hoping to strike
in northern Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa Inc. (V.N), has offered to cap its inter-bank credit card fees at the same level as rival MasterCard (MA.N) to end a European Union antitrust investigation and stave off a possible fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe, owned and operated by more than 3,700 European member banks, came under fire last year when the European Commission said its fees harmed competition between banks and led to higher consumer prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its credit and debit cards account for about 41 percent of all payment cards issued in Europe, making it the largest card network in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the proposed cut meant Visa Europe would charge 0.3 percent of the value of each transaction - about 40-60 percent lower than at present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer, which would be valid for four years, is for cross-border and domestic fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But retail lobby EuroCommerce called for the Commission as the EU's competition regulator across the 27-nation bloc, to take bolder action on card charges, especially in local markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cutting its fees, Visa Europe also offered to reform its rules to make it easier for businesses to seek better cross-border deals from competing banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe's chief executive, Peter Ayliffe, called for a level playing field for old and new competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EuroCommerce, whose 1997 complaint triggered an antitrust investigation into MasterCard which subsequently capped its fees in 2009, said more should be done, especially in local markets where it said fees remain disproportionately high in several countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we really need now is to see a regulation from the Commission which goes further and which tackles interchange fees at national level.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds reaction from Visa Europe, EuroCommerce, BEUC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS May 14 (Reuters) - Visa Europe, the European
licensee of Visa Inc., has offered to cap its inter-bank
credit card fees at the same level as rival MasterCard to
end a European Union antitrust investigation and stave off a
possible fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe, owned and operated by more than 3,700 European
member banks, came under fire last year when the European
Commission said its fees harmed competition between banks and
led to higher consumer prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its credit and debit cards account for about 41 percent of
all payment cards issued in Europe, making it the largest card
network in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the
proposed cut meant Visa Europe would charge 0.3 percent of the
value of each transaction - about 40-60 percent lower than at
present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer, which would be valid for four years, is for
cross-border and domestic fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But retail lobby EuroCommerce called for the Commission as
the EU's competition regulator across the 27-nation bloc, to
take bolder action on card charges, especially in local markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cutting its fees, Visa Europe also offered to
reform its rules to make it easier for businesses to seek better
cross-border deals from competing banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe's chief executive, Peter Ayliffe, called for a
level playing field for old and new competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EuroCommerce, whose 1997 complaint triggered an antitrust
investigation into MasterCard which subsequently capped its fees
in 2009, said more should be done, especially in local markets
where it said fees remain disproportionately high in several
countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we really need now is to see a regulation from the
Commission which goes further and which tackles interchange fees
at national level. Only then will merchants and consumers see
the benefits of lower costs," EuroCommerce adviser Ruth Milligan
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EuroCommerce members include French supermarkets chain
Carrefour, Swedish furniture group IKEA, British
supermarkets group Tesco and Spanish clothing retailer
Inditex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer group BEUC called on EU regulators not to be
distracted by Visa Europe's offer but to continue efforts to
regulate inter-bank card fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any reduction of MIFs (multilateral interchange fees) is a
welcome step but it should not be used as a smokescreen to avoid
legislative action by the European Commission to finally
regulate these fees," said BEUC Director General Monique Goyens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal Market Commissioner Michel Barnier is due to
present legislation regulating card fees in the second quarter
of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU antitrust authority said those interested in the
matter will be able to comment soon on Visa Europe's proposal
before it decides whether to accept the offer.

			Coca-Cola Increases Local Sustainability Efforts with Expanded 
      Recycle  Win Program and Innovative Green Initiative at Charlotte Motor 
      Speedway
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Award winning program returns to Charlotte / Mecklenburg
			
			
				Over $33,000 in Harris Teeter Gift Cards used as incentives to 
        recycle
			
			
				Recycle  Win expanded to include Concord, Kannapolis  Harrisburg
			
			
				Race fans rewarded with Speedway Bucks for recycling at CMS 
        campgrounds
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Recycle  Win, the nationally recognized 
      sustainability initiative which began in Charlotte in 2009, is back and 
      has been expanded beyond Mecklenburg County into Cabarrus County. 
      Coca-Cola Consolidated, Harris Teeter, the city of Charlotte, 
      Mecklenburg County, Concord, Kannapolis and Harrisburg have joined 
      forces to promote recycling by offering consumers the reward of a $50 
      Harris Teeter gift card for recycling properly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To implement and promote Recycle  Win, Coca-Cola has invested over 
      $250,000 in the program, which includes a direct mail educational packet 
      to all single-family households in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County 
      (excluding Cornelius), Concord, Kannapolis and Harrisburg the week of 
      June 17. The educational packet contains images highlighting which 
      materials SHOULD go in your recycling bin as well as a &#8220;Give it Back&#8221; 
      sticker, which residents must place on their bin to opt in for a chance 
      to win a $50 Harris Teeter gift card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Race fans staying at one of seven designated campgrounds at Charlotte 
      Motor Speedway can also get in on the &#8220;get rewarded for recycling&#8221; 
      action this year by placing aluminum cans and plastic bottles in blue 
      recycling bags provided at campground check in. Fans &#8220;caught&#8221; by the 
      Coca-Cola Recycling Patrol doing this good deed will be rewarded with 
      $25 in Speedway Bucks good at any CMS concession stand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re always looking for effective and creative programs to reduce 
      waste, save energy and recycle,&#8221; said Marcus Smith, president and 
      general manager of Charlotte Motor Speedway. &#8220;For 2013, we&#8217;re 
      challenging our fans to join us as we try to collect more than 7,000 
      pounds of recyclable materials through our campground efforts. Many 
      thanks to our partners at Coca-Cola in helping us reduce our 
      environmental track-print through this creative recycling initiative.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Recycling is not only good for the environment, but it is good for our 
      communities&#8217; budget. Recycling extends the life of landfills and saves 
      tax dollars now and for years to come,&#8221; said Concord Mayor Scott 
      Padgett. &#8220;The partnership with Coca-Cola provides an opportunity to 
      bring together a public/private partnership that supports our efforts to 
      promote recycling with this unique education program.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola is proud to once again sponsor the Recycle  Win initiative,&#8221; 
      said Lauren Steele, senior vice president, corporate affairs, Coca-Cola 
      Bottling Co. Consolidated. &#8220;The Coca-Cola Company believes it is 
      essential to continue educating everyone on the importance of recycling 
      and recycling properly. We also believe that recycling should be a 
      rewarding experience, and what better way to encourage people to recycle 
      than by giving them an opportunity to be a winner!&#8221; Steele, a long-time 
      proponent of recycling added, &#8220;Recycle  Win enhances Metrolina&#8217;s 
      reputation as a leader in this country&#8217;s sustainability efforts.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Recycle  Win Recycling Patrol will be visiting area 
      neighborhoods starting the week of June 17th and plans to award a total 
      of 676 $50 Harris Teeter Gift Cards throughout the six-month program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Harris Teeter is excited to team up with Coca-Cola again to promote 
      recycling in the communities we serve,&#8221; said Catherine Becker, Harris 
      Teeter communication manager. &#8220;Environmental stewardship is an important 
      factor in Harris Teeter&#8217;s daily operations; our hope is that, for 
      customers who participate in Recycle  Win to earn $50 Harris Teeter 
      gift cards, recycling will become a part of their daily routine as well.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAYTON, Ohio, May 14, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MacAulay-Brown, Inc.(MacB), a
leading National Security company providing innovative engineering
and technical solutions to Defense, Intelligence, Homeland Security
and Federal agencies, announced today that in partnership with IBM
(NYSE: IBM), it will introduce an
innovative new approach to Multi-level Security (MLS) at the Joint
Warfighting Conference (JWC). The event
will be held at the Virginia Beach Convention Center, Virginia
Beach, Va., May 14-16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warfighter success is increasingly dependent on access to
critical information that cuts across multiple security domains.
The current approach lacks a comprehensive and integrated
architecture that directly impacts mission success. In recent
years, the military has called for a new solution as outlined in
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's 
Joint Vision 2020. The new MLS Single Security Architecture
provides a deeper layer of network trust across multiple security
domains, increasing secure collaboration throughout the military
and its coalition partners. By utilizing IBM's zEnterprise&#174;System,
a leading platform for secure data serving, and the only commercial
server to achieve Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level 5+
security classification, users now have the ability to run multiple
applications that contain confidential data on a single mainframe
with security and privacy features to help protect data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In almost every area, the military has transformed its
warfighting capability to support the increased demand for
information sharing and collaboration," said Mark Sinclair, Vice
President of MacB's Warfighter Support Division, Mission Systems
Group (MSG). "One of the exceptions is in the area of Multi-level
security, which continues to rely on a multi-layered architecture.
The single-layer solution that we are working on with IBM ensures
that access to time sensitive information is granted or restricted
based on appropriate security clearance and need to know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacB also announced today that it has published a 
White Paper that addresses the benefits, issues and technology
solutions associated with a well developed and deployed MLS
solution. The paper, entitled "Joint Warfighting Capability: A
Fresh Look at Multi-level Security (MLS)," was authored by industry
veterans David "Doc" Robinson, Systems Engineering and Operations
Manager at MacB, Christopher "Jake" Jacobson, PhD, Chief
Technologist, IBM Systems and Technology Group, U.S. Federal and
Edward "Victor" Ballanco, President of EMB Information Technology
Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the new MacB-IBM MLS approach at JWC, please

      PMI reaffirmed its 2013 full-year reported diluted EPS forecast of April 
      18, 2013, to be in a range of $5.55 to $5.65, versus $5.17 in 2012. 
      Excluding an unfavorable currency impact, at then prevailing exchange 
      rates, of approximately $0.19 for the full-year 2013, reported diluted 
      earnings per share are projected to increase by approximately 10% to 12% 
      versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.22 in 2012, unchanged 
      from the constant-currency earnings per share forecast disclosed on 
      February 20, 2013. The $0.19 in unfavorable currency for the full-year 
      2013, based on then prevailing exchange rates, represents an increase of 
      $0.13 compared to the $0.06 of full-year unfavorable currency impact 
      previously disclosed on February 20, 2013. This forecast includes a 
      one-year gross productivity and cost savings target for 2013 of 
      approximately $300 million and a share repurchase target for 2013 of 
      $6.0 billion. The bulk of PMI&#8217;s earnings per share growth is expected to 
      occur in the latter part of the year, and the company anticipates a 
      particularly strong fourth quarter. 2012 adjusted diluted EPS are 
      calculated as reported diluted EPS of $5.17, plus a $0.02 per share 
      charge related to discrete tax items and a $0.03 per share charge 
      related to asset impairment and exit costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This 2013 guidance excludes the impact of potential future acquisitions, 
      unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, changes in 
      currency exchange rates and any unusual events.

      PMI&#8217;s business risks include: significant increases in cigarette-related 
      taxes; the imposition of discriminatory excise tax structures; 
      fluctuations in customer inventory levels due to increases in product 
      taxes and prices; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions, 
      often with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco 
      products; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and 
      exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco 
      use; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country 
      economic, regulatory and political developments; changes in adult smoker

      also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to

      PMI reaffirmed its 2013 full-year reported diluted EPS forecast of April 
      18, 2013, to be in a range of $5.55 to $5.65, versus $5.17 in 2012. 
      Excluding an unfavorable currency impact, at then prevailing exchange 
      rates, of approximately $0.19 for the full-year 2013, reported diluted 
      earnings per share are projected to increase by approximately 10% to 12% 
      versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.22 in 2012, unchanged 
      from the constant-currency earnings per share forecast disclosed on 
      February 20, 2013. The $0.19 in unfavorable currency for the full-year 
      2013, based on then prevailing exchange rates, represents an increase of 
      $0.13 compared to the $0.06 of full-year unfavorable currency impact 
      previously disclosed on February 20, 2013. This forecast includes a 
      one-year gross productivity and cost savings target for 2013 of 
      approximately $300 million and a share repurchase target for 2013 of 
      $6.0 billion. The bulk of PMI&#8217;s earnings per share growth is expected to 
      occur in the latter part of the year, and the company anticipates a 
      particularly strong fourth quarter. 2012 adjusted diluted EPS are 
      calculated as reported diluted EPS of $5.17, plus a $0.02 per share 
      charge related to discrete tax items and a $0.03 per share charge 
      related to asset impairment and exit costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This 2013 guidance excludes the impact of potential future acquisitions, 
      unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, changes in 
      currency exchange rates and any unusual events.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa Inc. (V.N), has offered to cap its inter-bank credit card fees at 0.3 percent of transaction value for four years, the same level as the rival MasterCard (MA.N) network, to end a European Union competition investigation and stave off a possible fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the proposed reduction meant fees levied by Visa Europe, which is owned and operated by more than 3,700 European member banks, would be about 40-60 percent lower than at present. The offer is for cross-border and domestic fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe came under fire in July last year when the regulator said its fees harmed competition between banks and led to higher consumer prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its credit and debit cards account for about 41 percent of all payment cards issued in Europe, making it the largest card network in the 27-country European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cutting its fees, Visa Europe also offered to reform its rules, making it easier for businesses to seek better cross-border deals from competing banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU antitrust authority said those interested in the matter will be able to comment soon on Visa Europe's proposal before it decides whether to accept the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, Europe's second biggest credit and debit card network operator, capped its fees in 2009 in response to an EU investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS May 14 (Reuters) - Visa Europe, the European
licensee of Visa Inc., has offered to halve its inter-bank
credit card fees to 0.3 percent for four years to end a European
Union antitrust investigation and stave off a possible fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that
the proposed cut meant Visa Europe's fees would be on the same
level as rival MasterCard, and about 40-60 percent lower
than at present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU antitrust authority said those interested in the
matter will be able to comment soon on Visa Europe's offer,
which came after the Commission told the company that its
cross-border credit card fees harm competition between banks and
lead to higher consumer prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co must pay more than
$2.5 million to an investor who alleged the firm recommended an
unsuitable investment in a private equity fund, a securities
arbitration panel has ruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investor, Tracy Landow, filed the case against Goldman
Sachs, a unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, and her broker
in 2011, according to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
arbitration panel ruling. Landow also alleged the firm made
unauthorized trades in her account, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A FINRA arbitration panel found Goldman, but not the broker,
liable and ordered the firm to pay Landow $1.6 million and
roughly $1 million in interest, and other fees, according to a
ruling. The facts surrounding the case are unclear. The FINRA
panel, as is customary, did not include reasons for its
decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined comment. The firm
initially asked for Landow's case to be dismissed, according to
the ruling. Arbitrators, however, granted Goldman's request to
erase, or expunge, any disclosures about the case from the
broker's record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case stems from Landow's investment in the Goldman Sachs
Special Opportunities Fund 2006. Landow requested that Goldman
rescind the $2.3 million investment and pay her expert fees,
according to the FINRA panel ruling dated May 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the three arbitrators who heard the case disagreed,
in part with the ruling because she believed the investment was
suitable, according to a written statement the arbitrator
provided in the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissents by arbitrators can sometimes give the losing party
fodder for trying to reverse rulings against them in court, say
lawyers. Arbitration rulings are typically binding. But courts
can overturn arbitration awards in rare instances, such as when
arbitrators exceed their authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Landow did not immediately return a call
requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;

			Visa Cuts Europe&#8217;s Swipe Fees But Continues to Stiff U.S. Merchants  
      Consumers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			U.S. Has Highest Credit Card Swipe Fees in World
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa has offered to reduce its credit card swipe fees on certain 
      transactions in Europe, the European Commission&#160;announced 
      yesterday. But, the company continues to stiff U.S. merchants with 
      soaring fees that have tripled during the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. merchants and consumers pay the highest fees in the world to credit 
      card companies and banks to swipe their cards because of unfair 
      price-fixing within the industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The European Union has been fighting Visa and MasterCard for years over 
      exorbitant swipe fees that ultimately lead to higher consumer prices. 
      The EU, for instance, brought antitrust charges against Visa Europe in 
      April 2009, and, one year ago, the EU&#8217;s second highest court upheld a 
      European Commission finding that MasterCard&#8217;s cross-border interchange 
      fees ran afoul of EU competition rules.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here at home, U.S. merchants and consumers are struggling under the 
      weight of swipe fees up to ten times higher than what Visa Europe is 
      proposing for European transactions. Credit card swipe fees in the U.S. 
      are up to 4 percent of the transaction value, while the new Visa rate in 
      the EU will be 0.3 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These sky-high swipe fees mean higher prices on virtually everything in 
      the U.S., even if you pay by cash or check. If U.S. credit card swipe 
      fees were the same as the EU rates, Americans would save $40 billion 
      annually.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;European regulators are holding Visa&#8217;s feet to the fire for their 
      outrageous swipe fees &#8211; even though the fees in Europe are a tiny 
      fraction of what they are in the United States,&#8221; said Doug Kantor, 
      counsel of the Merchants Payments Coalition. &#8220;There is no reason for 
      rates to be as high as they are. This should be a wake-up call that 
      credit card swipe fee reform is long overdue here.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
			The Merchants Payments Coalition (MPC) - UnfairCreditCardFees.com 
      - is a group of retailers, supermarkets, drug stores, convenience 
      stores, fuel stations, on-line merchants and other businesses who are 
      fighting against unfair credit card fees and fighting for a more 
      competitive and transparent card system that works better for consumers 
      and merchants alike. The coalition&#8217;s member associations collectively 
      represent about 2.7 million stores with approximately 50 million 
      employees.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 15 (Reuters) - The Portuguese government and JP
Morgan Chase &amp; Co are attempting to resolve a tussle
over potentially costly derivative contracts sold by the U.S.
investment bank to state-owned companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One source familiar with the situation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said talks had begun after both sides
threatened legal action over a series of complex hedging
products described as "toxic" by Lisbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No further information was immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The row between JP Morgan and Lisbon, which is trying to
stem potential losses of up to 3.0 billion euros ($4.0
billion)from complex hedging products sold to companies such as
the Lisbon and Porto Metro, echoes similar battles in countries
such as Italy as bank clients say they were missold products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan launched a London lawsuit as a "protective measure"
after Portugal's cash-strapped government vowed on April 26 to
challenge in court swap contracts with JP Morgan and the local
unit of Spain's Santander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metro firms, alongside other publicly-owned entities, signed
derivative contracts between 2003 and 2010 with banks such as
Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, BBVA

against any rise in Euribor-based interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rates slumped in the past few years, leaving those
companies on the wrong side of the bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Maria Luiz Albuquerque said last month
the government had managed to renegotiate swap contracts
containing "highly speculative elements" with some banks,
cutting by 20 percent potential liabilities from swaps that
could total 3 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Santander did not respond to phone messages or
email.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      A United States senator, a lieutenant governor and a military hero will 
      lead race fans in the commencement of the nation&#8217;s largest Memorial Day 
      celebration as they serve as race officials for the 2013 Coca-Cola 600. 
      Sgt. Aaron Causey will be Grand Marshal; U.S. Sen. Tim Scott will serve 
      as Honorary Starter and Tennessee&#8217;s Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey will serve as 
      Honorary Race Director for the 54th running of NASCAR&#8217;s only 
      600-mile race at the famed Charlotte Motor Speedway on Sunday, May 26.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is our pleasure to welcome these distinguished elected officials, as 
      well as a military hero to the 2013 Coca-Cola 600,&#8221; said Lauren C. 
      Steele, senior vice president, corporate affairs, Coca-Cola 
      Consolidated. &#8220;It is exciting to have these state leaders to recognize 
      America&#8217;s servicemen and women at the largest Memorial Day celebration 
      in the country. We are honored to have a true American hero announce 
      those famous words: &#8216;Gentlemen, Start Your Engines!&#8217;&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As race officials, Scott and Ramsey will be honored at a pre-race event, 
      attend the official drivers meeting, address the crowd of more than 
      140,000 fans, participate in the pre-race spectacular and present the 
      trophy to the winning driver in Victory Lane. As Grand Marshal, Causey 
      will give the race command, while Scott will wave the green flag over 
      the 43-car field to start NASCAR&#8217;s most challenging race. As Honorary 
      Race Director, Ramsey will ride in an official pace car.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Causey graduated from EOD school at Eglin Air Force Base in August 2001 
      and was then stationed in Aviano, Italy. He served in Iraq in 2004 along 
      with many other international missions during his years in Aviano. In 
      2006, he left the Air Force to continue working in EOD, transferring to 
      the Army. He deployed to Iraq 2006-08 out of Fort Stewart, Ga., then was 
      stationed in Mannheim, Germany 2008-10. Later in 2010, he was stationed 
      at Fort Drum, NY and deployed to Afghanistan in March 2011. On Sept. 7, 
      2011, he was performing dismounted operations in an attempt to disarm a 
      suspected IED when one detonated under him. He ultimately lost both legs 
      above the knees, two fingers, suffered broken arms and hand injuries, 
      shrapnel wounds over most of his upper body, loss of tissue, and 
      multiple other serious injuries. He lives with his wife of three years, 
      Kat. After recovery is complete, they intend to stay in the DC-metro 
      area and build a new life together.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Scott is a U.S. senator representing the great state of South Carolina. 
      His goal is simple: to positively affect the lives of the American 
      people. That path has taken him from a successful small businessman, to 
      being elected to Charleston County Council, the South Carolina State 
      House, the U.S. House of Representatives, and now the U.S Senate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ramsey is serving his fourth term as Lt. Governor of Tennessee. A small 
      businessman himself, he has become a leading voice for economic growth 
      in his state and region. He and his wife, Sindy, live in Blountville.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Continuing its tradition as the biggest Memorial Day Weekend celebration 
      in America, the Coca-Cola 600 pre-race show will pay tribute to veterans 
      and active duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces. The Welcome Home Our 
      Troops Coca-Cola 600 pre-race show will also include a performance of &#8220;I 
      Will Give My All&#8221; by country music artist Jamie Tate and the 82nd 
      Airborne All-American&#160;Chorus, a bagpipe performance of &#8220;Amazing Grace&#8221; 
      by the Charlotte Fire Department Pipe Band and &#8220;Taps&#8221; played by a Fort 
      Bragg bugler. There will also be a 21-gun salute from the Fort Bragg 
      Firing Squad.

			About Carly Rae Jepsen
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Canadian singer/songwriter and breakout pop sensation Carly 
      Rae Jepsen has taken America by storm after bursting onto the scene 
      in the U.S. with her hit single, &#8220;Call Me Maybe.&#8221; Unforgettably catchy, 
      the hit song, which she co-wrote, quickly rose to the No. 1 spot on the 
      Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it remained for nine consecutive weeks. 
      Certified quintuple-platinum in Jepsen&#8217;s native Canada, the track is 
      also an international sensation, climbing to No. 1 on the iTunes Singles 
      charts in more than 47 countries, while the official video has more than 
      400 million YouTube views and the song has sold more than 10 million 
      singles worldwide to date. Follow-up platinum single &#8220;Good Time,&#8221; a duet 
      with Owl City, climbed to No. 3 on the pop chart, while the video has 
      racked up more than 84 million YouTube views. Jepsen released her debut 
      album, &#8220;Kiss,&#8221; on September 18 via 604 Records/Schoolboy

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Italian jockey Frankie Dettori has revealed he took cocaine before a positive dope test in France last September that brought him a six months ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Channel Four television to be broadcast on Thursday, the British-based jockey - one of the biggest names in flat racing - was asked why he took cocaine and in what circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things were going bad, I was depressed and I guess a moment of weakness and I fell for it and I've only got myself to blame. I can't blame anybody else," he said in a preview released by the broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dettori, who won all seven races in a single afternoon at Ascot in 1996, said he was so ashamed and embarrassed when the news broke that he hid in his house for a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The paparazzi outside. The embarrassment of telling the children, you know. You know they still go to school, they might get bullied and so it was a very, very difficult time," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interview was Dettori's first since he was suspended from December 19 by the French racing authority France Galop after the positive test for a previously unidentified substance at Longchamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban expires on May 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm very ashamed and embarrassed, and paid a big price for it, you know. I spent six months not doing the thing that I love, racing," said Dettori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dettori will return as a freelance rider after it was announced in October that he would no longer be a retained jockey for Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin operation after an 18-year association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Justin Palmer)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sallie Krawcheck has agreed to buy 85 
      Broads
			from founder, entrepreneur and former Goldman 
      Sachs executive Janet Hanson.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Founded in 1997, 85 Broads is a global membership community of 
      more than 30,000 women. The founding members of 85 Broads, led by 
      Hanson, were women who worked for Goldman Sachs at 85 Broad Street, the 
      investment banking firm&#8217;s former NYC headquarters. Over the past decade 
      under Hanson&#8217;s leadership, 85 Broads expanded its paid membership 
      to include female entrepreneurs and executives from diverse industries 
      and backgrounds, many of whom are trailblazers in their fields. Members 
      also include alumnae and students of some of the world&#8217;s leading 
      colleges, universities and graduate schools. 85 Broads&#8217; members 
      represent 130 countries in more than 40 regional chapters and campus 
      clubs around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Krawcheck said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a pleasure to become a part of 85 Broads. The 
      energy, expertise and accomplishments of the members have amazed me. 
      Janet&#8217;s leadership and vision has built 85 Broads into a vibrant 
      global community of high-achieving women who are defining success on 
      their own terms throughout every stage of their lives and careers. Our 
      members are bold, active participants in the economy, and they represent 
      the changing face and shape of business around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Research shows that it is good business to invest in women. It creates 
      jobs, improves business results, enhances financial stewardship and is 
      one of the keys to global economic prosperity. I look forward to working 
      with 85 Broads&#8217; members to expand our mission of empowering women 
      around the world - as women invest in themselves and each other through 
      the network. I believe we&#8217;re at a tipping point of women&#8217;s engagement in 
      the economy, and our community&#8217;s ability to play an important role in 
      that is exciting, as we move from advocacy of women to the smart 
      business of real investment in women.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Janet Hanson, who will keep an ownership stake in 85 Broads and 
      become Chairman Emeritus, as well as an advisor to Krawcheck, said, &#8220;I&#8217;m 
      extraordinarily proud of the network, our members and all that we&#8217;ve 
      achieved in the last 15 years. The contributions women are making to the 
      global economy is changing rapidly, and the potential for our members to 
      lead that change is tremendous.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Sallie&#8217;s decision to become the next steward of 85 Broads is exciting 
      to me because she is passionate about the role women are playing on the 
      global stage, and she understands the transformational power of 
      connection. With Sallie at the helm, 85 Broads will enable women from 
      all parts of the globe to advance and achieve their greatest career 
      objectives and leadership aspirations.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;Give me your smart, your educated, your startup founders yearning to build companies?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As research indicates that the U.S. is an increasingly difficult place for foreign founders to come and build companies and founders tell horror stories of the massive challenges they faced dealing with byzantine U.S. immigration policies, Canada is burnishing its reputation as open for business &#8212; and open for new residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s new startup visa has received a huge amount of attention in the U.S. as the the global war for talent heats up. Senators such as Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) have tried to address the situation via legislation like the Startup Act 3.0, but that&#8217;s a slim hope after deaths of 1.0 and 2.0.&lt;/p&gt; Source: Wikipedia&lt;p&gt;Jason Kenney, Canadian Minister of Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Startup Visa provides immediate permanent residency in Canada if a founder meets just three criteria. An applicant must:&lt;/p&gt;  Secure an investment from a designated Canadian VC or fund Demonstrate English language proficiency Have at least one year of postsecondary education &lt;p&gt;This weekend, Canadian member of parliament and Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism Minister Jason Kenney is in Silicon Valley promoting his country&#8217;s Startup Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We chatted with Kenney about the visa&#8217;s goals, his intentions, and the U.S. immigration system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: What&#8217;s the ultimate goal of the Startup Visa?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Kenney: We&#160;want a pathway for the world&#8217;s best and brightest to come to Canada and to harness that&#160;drive and innovation to be at the cutting edge of the modern economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: Why are you coming to Silicon Valley right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney: The U.S. immigration system is dysfunctional, and it&#8217;s&#160;really difficult for talented immigrants to stay in the U.S. permanently.&#160;I&#8217;m coming to further raise the profile of the program and send the message that&#160;Canada&#8217;s open for business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#8217;re a young startup entrepreneur having trouble renewing your visa, come here!&#160;We offer&#160;immediate permanent residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: What&#8217;s the response been so far?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney: There&#8217;s been a&#160;great amount of interest, but we&#160;only opened for applications on April 4, so it&#8217;s&#160;too early to tell.&#160;We will issue up to 2,500 per year, but&#160;I don&#8217;t anticipate it will be fully subscribed for the first year because it&#8217;s still new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know there&#8217;s a huge pent-up demand in the U.S., and&#160;I think the word is going to spread virally:&#160;If you want to stay permanently in NA, think of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: You&#8217;re offering permanent residency to anyone in who secures an investment. What about those who fail?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney: Many countries, such as&#160;Australia, only offer temporary resident status.&#160;In Canada, we&#8217;re going to give you the &#8220;green card&#8221; right up front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know full well the rate of failure in startups is high,&#160;but if they come up here and don&#8217;t succeed, they have demonstrated they they have high human capital. And&#160;in the long run, their chances of succeeding and building a successful enterprise are high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want Canada to become a magnet for people like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: Why is Canada a good place to come build a startup?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney: We have really&#160;strong tech sectors in Kitchener/Waterloo, Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and a few other places, an&#160;increasingly strong venture capital industry, and very well-run industry associations,&#160;angel associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, we have the&#160;lowest business taxes in the developed world, and the&#160;strongest fiscal position in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of macro-economic terms, that&#8217;s important &#8230; Canada weathered the storm of the economic downturn better than any other country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have&#160;an immigration system that works, which means you have access to global talent &#8230; and&#160;human capital is even more important than financial capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: Any other message for Silicon Valley?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney: While here&#160;we&#8217;ll be meeting with the CEOs of many major IT companies just to emphasize what a great place Canada is to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we&#8217;re really going to kick this into hyperdrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;photo credit: PhOtOnQuAnTiQuE via photopin cc&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Entrepreneur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s Ratings at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s (JPM) long-term Issuer 
      Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and short-term IDR at 'F1'. Fitch has also 
      affirmed JPM's viability rating (VR) at 'a+', its support rating at '1', 
      and its support rating floor (SRF) at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. 
      A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating actions on JPM have been taken in conjunction with Fitch's 
      Global Trading and Universal Bank (GTUB) periodic review. Fitch's 
      outlook for the industry is stable. Positive rating drivers include 
      improved liquidity, funding, capitalization and more streamlined 
      businesses, all partly driven by regulation. Offsetting these positive 
      drivers are substantial earnings pressure, regulatory uncertainty and 
      heightened legal and operational risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's ratings affirmation reflects its dominant domestic franchise and 
      growing international franchise. The firm continues to maintain a 
      leading position in its businesses, particularly in U.S. domestic 
      commercial banking and investment banking (IB). JPM's product line 
      diversity has contributed to consistent earnings generation in recent 
      periods and superior operating performance throughout the crisis, 
      relative to other global banks. Funding flexibility remains strong, 
      despite cited weaknesses in risk management as a result of trading 
      losses in the Chief Investment Office (CIO), and liquidity has 
      strengthened, with continued progress toward achieving compliance with 
      the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) by year-end 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating 
      consistency, although Fitch believes earnings could decline from current 
      levels as the interest rate environment remains challenging, regulatory 
      costs grow, and credit metrics, particularly in card and the commercial 
      bank, normalize from unsustainable lows. Still, offsets could be 
      achieved from improved performance in mortgage banking and stronger 
      operating efficiencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating also recognizes that the firm still has some work to do in 
      addressing its risk governance weaknesses arising from the losses in the 
      CIO. In addition to implementing recommendations from board and internal 
      task force reviews, JPM entered into consent orders with its primary 
      regulators in January 2013 for issues related to risk management, model 
      governance, CIO, BSA/AML compliance, and other trading activities at the 
      firm. Still, JPM has made progress enhancing its risk management and 
      governance framework since CIO trading losses were revealed. Fitch 
      believes the firm is committed to a best-in-class risk framework and 
      will continue to address any unresolved issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capital is adequate for the rating level, although JPM has historically 
      been a more aggressive capital manager than some of its global peers. 
      Estimated Basel III Tier I common ratio was 8.9% at 1Q13 and the bank 
      plans to reach the 9.5% target by year-end, which Fitch believes is 
      reasonable. Share repurchases resumed in 2013, with $2.6 billion of 
      buybacks in 1Q13, and JPM received permission from regulators to 
      repurchase an additional $6 billion of capital through 1Q14. However, 
      the permission was conditional, given weaknesses cited in the capital 
      planning process, and JPM is required to resubmit a capital plan to 
      regulators by the end of 3Q13. Should regulators not be satisfied with 
      remedial actions taken at that time, repurchase authority could be 
      altered. Fitch would view an adverse result from the regulators 
      negatively as it would signal failures in risk management and modeling, 
      which has been an area of focus for the firm recently.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's LCR ratio was approximately 83% at Dec. 31, 2012. Since then, high 
      quality liquid assets, consisting of cash, governments, and agency 
      mortgages, have grown $72 billion to $413 billion at March 31, 2013. The 
      firm believes that through quarter-end it had closed the gap to full 
      compliance with the LCR by about one-third, and it expects to be in full 
      compliance by year-end. Fitch views the progress favorably and believes 
      the firm manages liquidity well, though wholesale funding is a 
      meaningful component which mainly supports its global broker/dealer 
      operations. However, the company has a solid core deposit base, mainly 
      in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mortgage business, particularly JPM's real estate portfolios 
      continue to have relatively weak asset quality, although trends are 
      improving. Mortgage production remained strong in 1Q13, but margins are 
      declining and Fitch expects refinancing volume to slow in 2013. Mortgage 
      servicing continues to be a drag on earnings, although costs have 
      improved following the Independent Foreclosure Review Settlement in 
      4Q12. JPM expects servicing costs to decline further throughout the 
      year, but Fitch believes it will be some time before the firm reaches 
      its longer-term expense target of $325 million per quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's diverse business franchise has helped to offset weaknesses in 
      mortgage. The credit card business continues to exceed Fitch's 
      expectations, with low credit losses and $500 million of reserve 
      releases in 1Q13, but Fitch expects that there will likely be some 
      deterioration in card asset quality in 2013 as the credit metrics are at 
      unsustainable levels across the industry. The commercial banking, 
      treasury  security services and the asset management businesses remain 
      stable performers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Like other global trading and universal banks, Fitch believes the IB 
      creates greater volatility in JPM's earnings and serves as a rating 
      constraint. While the agency recognizes the firm's leading position in 
      IB, the business is vulnerable to cyclicality and more sensitive to 
      market conditions than many of its other business lines. In addition, IB 
      has historically been an important component of the firm's earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given the company's size and scale in many businesses, it, along with 
      many other large financial firms, continues to be subject to various 
      investigations and litigation. The most costly so far are mortgage 
      related, including foreclosures and repurchases. LIBOR investigations 
      are pending as well as several litigations stemming from the crisis and 
      as a result of the CIO losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to continue 
      to deliver consistent earnings growth, particularly in light of the 
      current regulatory environment. Higher capital charges and what remains 
      difficult market conditions present a challenge for all GTUBs, which may 
      be encouraged to seek more aggressive ways to generate profits that take 
      advantage of regulatory loopholes. However, Fitch expects that JPM's 
      strong global franchise, liquidity risk management, and product 
      diversity mitigate some of these concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Negative rating actions could result from material asset quality 
      weakening which would pressure JPM's earnings and its ability to build 
      capital, deterioration in liquidity levels, material and unexpected 
      litigation losses, and/or failure to sufficiently address weaknesses 
      noted in regulatory consent orders and the CCAR submission process in a 
      timely fashion. Further, significant risk management or operational 
      failures that result in material losses to the firm could also result in 
      a negative rating action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upward rating momentum For JPM is believed to be limited for the 
      foreseeable future given the risk and governance issues the firm is 
      still addressing. Further its current rating level is among the highest 
      of its peer group and relative to the global bank universe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations of JPM's Support Rating and SRF are based on Fitch's 
      view that the probability of support from the U.S. authorities for JPM, 
      if required, remains extremely high in the near term due to the bank's 
      systemic importance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Support Rating and SRF are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of 
      the ability or propensity of the U.S. sovereign to extend full support 
      to the bank's senior creditors. There is a clear political intention to 
      ultimately reduce the implicit state support for systemically important 
      banks in Europe and the U.S., as demonstrated by a series of policy and 
      regulatory initiatives aimed at curbing systemic risk posed by the 
      banking industry. This might result in Fitch revising SRFs downward in 
      the medium term, although the timing and degree of any change would 
      depend on developments with respect to specific jurisdictions. Until 
      now, senior creditors in major global banks have been supported in full, 
      but resolution legislation is developing quickly and the implementation 
      of creditor 'bail-in' is starting to make it look more feasible for 
      taxpayers and creditors to share the burden of supporting large, complex 
      banks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID 
      SECURITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and by various 
      issuing vehicles are all notched down from JPM's or its bank 
      subsidiaries' VRs in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each 
      instrument's respective nonperformance and relative Loss Severity risk 
      profiles. Their ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs 
      of JPM or its bank subsidiaries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and 
      banks, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is 
      mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank 
      subsidiaries. It has modest double leverage of 105.6% at year-end 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IDRs and VRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries benefit from the 
      cross-guarantee mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs 
      and VRs are equalized across the group. JPMorgan Securities LLC (JPMS) 
      is a wholly owned subsidiary that is the firm's U.S. broker dealer and 
      is considered core to JPM's business. As a result its IDR is equalized 
      with that of its parent JPM. Bear Stearns Companies, LLC and JPMorgan 
      Clearing Corp. benefit from a parent guarantee and therefore their IDRs 
      are equalized with JPM's. Collateralized Commercial Paper Co., LLC's 
      short-term IDR benefits from JPMS's guarantee of the amounts payable by 
      the repo seller, JPMCC, and as result its short-term IDR is equalized 
      with that of JPMS. Collateralized Commercial Paper II Co., LLC's 
      short-term IDR is based on the repo seller, JPMS's ST IDR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM is a leading global trading and universal bank with $2.4 trillion in 
      total assets and $6.5 billion of net income as of March 31, 2013.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Goldman Sachs' IDRs at 'A/F1'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s (Goldman) 
      IDRs at 'A/F1'. Fitch also affirms Goldman's Support Rating at '1', 
      Support Rating Floor (SRF) at 'A' and Viability Rating (VR) at 'a'. A 
      complete list of ratings follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating actions on Goldman have been taken in conjunction with 
      Fitch's Global Trading and Universal Bank (GTUB) periodic review. 
      Fitch's outlook for the industry is stable. Positive rating drivers 
      include improved liquidity, funding, capitalization and more streamlined 
      businesses, all partly driven by regulation. Offsetting these positive 
      drivers are substantial earnings pressure, regulatory uncertainty and 
      heightened legal and operational risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's IDRs, VR and senior debt continue to be supported by its 
      leading investment banking franchise, strong risk management, solid 
      liquidity position, and better-than-average capital position. These 
      ratings are constrained by Goldman's focus on capital market activities 
      and relatively higher level of wholesale funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman has higher reliance on capital market operations than many 
      global trading and universal banks (GTUBs). Fitch recognizes that 
      capital market revenues are inherently volatile and susceptible to 
      declines in difficult market periods. Concerns over this inherent 
      volatility are tempered by management's successful track record in 
      managing through difficult periods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman has demonstrated favorable risk management during the financial 
      crisis and its aftermath. Fitch believes that Goldman has a 
      comparatively strong risk management organization and systems to manage 
      and monitor risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquidity remains at conservative levels. Cash and unencumbered highly 
      liquid securities totaled $174 billion (18% of total assets) at 
      end-1Q'13. Conservative liquidity management reduces Fitch's concerns 
      regarding reliance on wholesale funding. Reliance on unsecured 
      short-term funding remains at modest levels and the weighted average 
      maturity of secured funding has been increased (particularly repos 
      associated with less liquid collateral).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's capital position continues to improve and remains 
      comparatively strong. Fitch Core Capital to risk-weighted assets 
      remained significantly above the GTUB average. Under Basel III, 
      Goldman's Tier I common ratio was approximately 9% at end-1Q'13 (in line 
      with the average of U.S. GTUBs).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulatory and legal issues appear manageable. Goldman and peers face 
      new capital markets regulations such as the pending Volcker Rule and 
      implementation of Basel III capital and liquidity standards. Goldman is 
      projected to meet new requirements well within allowable time frames.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's IDRs, VR and senior debt continue to be underpinned by a 
      strong risk management track record and leading investment banking 
      franchise. These ratings factor in Fitch core capital in line with 
      current levels and the management of capital comfortably above Basel III 
      capital minimums. The IDRs, VR and senior debt have limited upward 
      potential, given Goldman's business focus on the capital markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downward pressure on the VR would result from a material loss, reduction 
      in capital ratios or significant deterioration in liquidity levels. 
      Likewise, any unforeseen outsized fines, settlements or other charges 
      could also have adverse rating implications. Goldman's Long-term IDR is 
      at its SRF, which means that a downgrade of its VR would only trigger 
      downgrades of the IDRs if the SRF were revised down as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations of Goldman's Support Rating and SRF are based on 
      Fitch's view that the probability of support from the U.S. authorities, 
      if required, remains extremely high in the near term due to the bank's 
      systemic importance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Support Rating and SRF are sensitive to a change in Fitch's 
      assumptions about the availability of sovereign support for the bank. 
      There is a clear political intention to ultimately reduce the implicit 
      state support for systemically important banks in Europe and the U.S., 
      as demonstrated by a series of policy and regulatory initiatives aimed 
      at curbing systemic risk posed by the banking industry. This might 
      result in Fitch revising SRFs downward in the medium term, although the 
      timing and degree of any change would depend on developments with 
      respect to specific jurisdictions. Until now, senior creditors in major 
      global banks have been supported in full, but resolution legislation is 
      developing quickly and the implementation of creditor 'bail-in' is 
      starting to make it look more feasible for taxpayers and creditors to 
      share the burden of supporting large, complex banks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES -SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID 
      SECURITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Goldman and by 
      various issuing vehicles are all notched down from Goldman's VR in 
      accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective 
      nonperformance and relative Loss Severity risk profiles. Their ratings 
      are primarily sensitive to any change in Goldman's VR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's IDR is equalized with those of its operating companies and 
      banks, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is 
      mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank 
      subsidiaries, as well as the use of the holding company to fund 
      subsidiary operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IDRs of major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized with Goldman's 
      IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to Goldman's 
      business strategy and financial profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman is a top global bank with four business segments: investment 
      banking, institutional client services, investment management, and 
      investing and lending.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, May 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co.'s (JPM) 
long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and short-term IDR
at 'F1'. Fitch 
has also affirmed JPM's viability rating (VR) at 'a+', its
support rating at 
'1', and its support rating floor (SRF) at 'A'. The Rating
Outlook is Stable. A 
full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release.
The rating actions on JPM have been taken in conjunction with
Fitch's Global 
Trading and Universal Bank (GTUB) periodic review. Fitch's
outlook for the 
industry is stable. Positive rating drivers include improved
liquidity, funding, 
capitalization and more streamlined businesses, all partly
driven by regulation. 
Offsetting these positive drivers are substantial earnings
pressure, regulatory 
uncertainty and heightened legal and operational risk.
KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
JPM's ratings affirmation reflects its dominant domestic
franchise and growing 
international franchise. The firm continues to maintain a
leading position in 
its businesses, particularly in U.S. domestic commercial banking
and investment 
banking (IB). JPM's product line diversity has contributed to
consistent 
earnings generation in recent periods and superior operating
performance 
throughout the crisis, relative to other global banks. Funding
flexibility 
remains strong, despite cited weaknesses in risk management as a
result of 
trading losses in the Chief Investment Office (CIO), and
liquidity has 
strengthened, with continued progress toward achieving
compliance with the 
liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) by year-end 2013. 
The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating
consistency, 
although Fitch believes earnings could decline from current
levels as the 
interest rate environment remains challenging, regulatory costs
grow, and credit 
metrics, particularly in card and the commercial bank, normalize
from 
unsustainable lows. Still, offsets could be achieved from
improved performance 
in mortgage banking and stronger operating efficiencies.
The rating also recognizes that the firm still has some work to
do in addressing 
its risk governance weaknesses arising from the losses in the
CIO. In addition 
to implementing recommendations from board and internal task
force reviews, JPM 
entered into consent orders with its primary regulators in
January 2013 for 
issues related to risk management, model governance, CIO,
BSA/AML compliance, 
and other trading activities at the firm. Still, JPM has made
progress enhancing 
its risk management and governance framework since CIO trading
losses were 
revealed. Fitch believes the firm is committed to a
best-in-class risk framework 
and will continue to address any unresolved issues. 
Capital is adequate for the rating level, although JPM has
historically been a 
more aggressive capital manager than some of its global peers.
Estimated Basel 
III Tier I common ratio was 8.9% at 1Q13 and the bank plans to
reach the 9.5% 
target by year-end, which Fitch believes is reasonable. Share
repurchases 
resumed in 2013, with $2.6 billion of buybacks in 1Q13, and JPM
received 
permission from regulators to repurchase an additional $6
billion of capital 
through 1Q14. However, the permission was conditional, given
weaknesses cited in 
the capital planning process, and JPM is required to resubmit a
capital plan to 
regulators by the end of 3Q13. Should regulators not be
satisfied with remedial 
actions taken at that time, repurchase authority could be
altered. Fitch would 
view an adverse result from the regulators negatively as it
would signal 
failures in risk management and modeling, which has been an area
of focus for 
the firm recently. 
JPM's LCR ratio was approximately 83% at Dec. 31, 2012. Since
then, high quality 
liquid assets, consisting of cash, governments, and agency
mortgages, have grown 
$72 billion to $413 billion at March 31, 2013. The firm believes
that through 
quarter-end it had closed the gap to full compliance with the
LCR by about 
one-third, and it expects to be in full compliance by year-end.
Fitch views the 
progress favorably and believes the firm manages liquidity well,
though 
wholesale funding is a meaningful component which mainly
supports its global 
broker/dealer operations. However, the company has a solid core
deposit base, 
mainly in the U.S.    
The mortgage business, particularly JPM's real estate portfolios
continue to 
have relatively weak asset quality, although trends are
improving. Mortgage 
production remained strong in 1Q13, but margins are declining
and Fitch expects 
refinancing volume to slow in 2013. Mortgage servicing continues
to be a drag on 
earnings, although costs have improved following the Independent
Foreclosure 
Review Settlement in 4Q12. JPM expects servicing costs to
decline further 
throughout the year, but Fitch believes it will be some time
before the firm 
reaches its longer-term expense target of $325 million per
quarter. 
JPM's diverse business franchise has helped to offset weaknesses
in mortgage. 
The credit card business continues to exceed Fitch's
expectations, with low 
credit losses and $500 million of reserve releases in 1Q13, but
Fitch expects 
that there will likely be some deterioration in card asset
quality in 2013 as 
the credit metrics are at unsustainable levels across the
industry. The 
commercial banking, treasury &amp; security services and the asset
management 
businesses remain stable performers. 
Like other global trading and universal banks, Fitch believes
the IB creates 
greater volatility in JPM's earnings and serves as a rating
constraint. While 
the agency recognizes the firm's leading position in IB, the
business is 
vulnerable to cyclicality and more sensitive to market
conditions than many of 
its other business lines. In addition, IB has historically been
an important 
component of the firm's earnings. 
Given the company's size and scale in many businesses, it, along
with many other 
large financial firms, continues to be subject to various
investigations and 
litigation. The most costly so far are mortgage related,
including foreclosures 
and repurchases. LIBOR investigations are pending as well as
several litigations 
stemming from the crisis and as a result of the CIO losses.
RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to
continue to 
deliver consistent earnings growth, particularly in light of the
current 
regulatory environment. Higher capital charges and what remains
difficult market 
conditions present a challenge for all GTUBs, which may be
encouraged to seek 
more aggressive ways to generate profits that take advantage of
regulatory 
loopholes. However, Fitch expects that JPM's strong global
franchise, liquidity 
risk management, and product diversity mitigate some of these
concerns.
Negative rating actions could result from material asset quality
weakening which 
would pressure JPM's earnings and its ability to build capital,
deterioration in 
liquidity levels, material and unexpected litigation losses,
and/or failure to 
sufficiently address weaknesses noted in regulatory consent
orders and the CCAR 
submission process in a timely fashion. Further, significant
risk management or 
operational failures that result in material losses to the firm
could also 
result in a negative rating action.
Upward rating momentum For JPM is believed to be limited for the
foreseeable 
future given the risk and governance issues the firm is still
addressing. 
Further its current rating level is among the highest of its
peer group and 
relative to the global bank universe. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
The affirmations of JPM's Support Rating and SRF are based on
Fitch's view that 
the probability of support from the U.S. authorities for JPM, if
required, 
remains extremely high in the near term due to the bank's
systemic importance. 
RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
The Support Rating and SRF are sensitive to a change in Fitch's
view of the 
ability or propensity of the U.S. sovereign to extend full
support to the bank's 
senior creditors. There is a clear political intention to
ultimately reduce the 
implicit state support for systemically important banks in
Europe and the U.S., 
as demonstrated by a series of policy and regulatory initiatives
aimed at 
curbing systemic risk posed by the banking industry. This might
result in Fitch 
revising SRFs downward in the medium term, although the timing
and degree of any 
change would depend on developments with respect to specific
jurisdictions. 
Until now, senior creditors in major global banks have been
supported in full, 
but resolution legislation is developing quickly and the
implementation of 
creditor 'bail-in' is starting to make it look more feasible for
taxpayers and 
creditors to share the burden of supporting large, complex
banks.
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER
HYBRID 
SECURITIES
Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and by
various issuing 
vehicles are all notched down from JPM's or its bank
subsidiaries' VRs in 
accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's
respective 
nonperformance and relative Loss Severity risk profiles. Their
ratings are 
primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs of JPM or its bank
subsidiaries. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY 
JPM's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating
companies and banks, 
reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is
mandated in the U.S. 
to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. It has
modest double 
leverage of 105.6% at year-end 2012.
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED
COMPANY 
The IDRs and VRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries benefit from the
cross-guarantee 
mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs and VRs
are equalized 
across the group. JPMorgan Securities LLC (JPMS) is a wholly
owned subsidiary 
that is the firm's U.S. broker dealer and is considered core to
JPM's business. 
As a result its IDR is equalized with that of its parent JPM.
Bear Stearns 
Companies, LLC and JPMorgan Clearing Corp. benefit from a parent
guarantee and 
therefore their IDRs are equalized with JPM's. Collateralized
Commercial Paper 
Co., LLC's short-term IDR benefits from JPMS's guarantee of the
amounts payable 
by the repo seller, JPMCC, and as result its short-term IDR is
equalized with 
that of JPMS. Collateralized Commercial Paper II Co., LLC's
short-term IDR is 
based on the repo seller, JPMS's ST IDR. 
JPM is a leading global trading and universal bank with $2.4
trillion in total 
assets and $6.5 billion of net income as of March 31, 2013.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, May 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Goldman
Sachs Group, 
Inc.'s (Goldman) IDRs at 'A/F1'. Fitch also affirms Goldman's
Support Rating at 
'1', Support Rating Floor (SRF) at 'A' and Viability Rating (VR)
at 'a'. A 
complete list of ratings follows at the end of this release.
The rating actions on Goldman have been taken in conjunction
with Fitch's Global 
Trading and Universal Bank (GTUB) periodic review. Fitch's
outlook for the 
industry is stable. Positive rating drivers include improved
liquidity, funding, 
capitalization and more streamlined businesses, all partly
driven by regulation. 
Offsetting these positive drivers are substantial earnings
pressure, regulatory 
uncertainty and heightened legal and operational risk.
KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
Goldman's IDRs, VR and senior debt continue to be supported by
its leading 
investment banking franchise, strong risk management, solid
liquidity position, 
and better-than-average capital position. These ratings are
constrained by 
Goldman's focus on capital market activities and relatively
higher level of 
wholesale funding
Goldman has higher reliance on capital market operations than
many global 
trading and universal banks (GTUBs). Fitch recognizes that
capital market 
revenues are inherently volatile and susceptible to declines in
difficult market 
periods. Concerns over this inherent volatility are tempered by
management's 
successful track record in managing through difficult periods.
Goldman has demonstrated favorable risk management during the
financial crisis 
and its aftermath. Fitch believes that Goldman has a
comparatively strong risk 
management organization and systems to manage and monitor risk. 
Liquidity remains at conservative levels. Cash and unencumbered
highly liquid 
securities totaled $174 billion (18% of total assets) at
end-1Q'13. Conservative 
liquidity management reduces Fitch's concerns regarding reliance
on wholesale 
funding. Reliance on unsecured short-term funding remains at
modest levels and 
the weighted average maturity of secured funding has been
increased 
(particularly repos associated with less liquid collateral).
Goldman's capital position continues to improve and remains
comparatively 
strong. Fitch Core Capital to risk-weighted assets remained
significantly above 
the GTUB average. Under Basel III, Goldman's Tier I common ratio
was 
approximately 9% at end-1Q'13 (in line with the average of U.S.
GTUBs). 
Regulatory and legal issues appear manageable. Goldman and peers
face new 
capital markets regulations such as the pending Volcker Rule and
implementation 
of Basel III capital and liquidity standards. Goldman is
projected to meet new 
requirements well within allowable time frames. 
RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
Goldman's IDRs, VR and senior debt continue to be underpinned by
a strong risk 
management track record and leading investment banking
franchise. These ratings 
factor in Fitch core capital in line with current levels and the
management of 
capital comfortably above Basel III capital minimums. The IDRs,
VR and senior 
debt have limited upward potential, given Goldman's business
focus on the 
capital markets. 
Downward pressure on the VR would result from a material loss,
reduction in 
capital ratios or significant deterioration in liquidity levels.
Likewise, any 
unforeseen outsized fines, settlements or other charges could
also have adverse 
rating implications. Goldman's Long-term IDR is at its SRF,
which means that a 
downgrade of its VR would only trigger downgrades of the IDRs if
the SRF were 
revised down as well.
KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
The affirmations of Goldman's Support Rating and SRF are based
on Fitch's view 
that the probability of support from the U.S. authorities, if
required, remains 
extremely high in the near term due to the bank's systemic
importance. 
RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
The Support Rating and SRF are sensitive to a change in Fitch's
assumptions 
about the availability of sovereign support for the bank. There
is a clear 
political intention to ultimately reduce the implicit state
support for 
systemically important banks in Europe and the U.S., as
demonstrated by a series 
of policy and regulatory initiatives aimed at curbing systemic
risk posed by the 
banking industry. This might result in Fitch revising SRFs
downward in the 
medium term, although the timing and degree of any change would
depend on 
developments with respect to specific jurisdictions. Until now,
senior creditors 
in major global banks have been supported in full, but
resolution legislation is 
developing quickly and the implementation of creditor 'bail-in'
is starting to 
make it look more feasible for taxpayers and creditors to share
the burden of 
supporting large, complex banks.
RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES -SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER
HYBRID SECURITIES
Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Goldman and
by various 
issuing vehicles are all notched down from Goldman's VR in
accordance with 
Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective
nonperformance and relative 
Loss Severity risk profiles. Their ratings are primarily
sensitive to any change 
in Goldman's VR. 
RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY
Goldman's IDR is equalized with those of its operating companies
and banks, 
reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is
mandated in the U.S. 
to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries, as
well as the use of 
the holding company to fund subsidiary operations.
RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED
COMPANIES
IDRs of major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized with
Goldman's IDR 
reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to
Goldman's business 
strategy and financial profile. 
Goldman is a top global bank with four business segments:
investment banking, 
institutional client services, investment management, and
investing and lending.

			US Subsidiary of Walton Westphalia Development Corporation to Borrow 
      up to US$3,500,000 from Walton Affiliates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Westphalia Development Corporation (the "Corporation") 
      announced today that its board of directors approved its US subsidiary, 
      Walton Westphalia Development (USA), LLC (the "US Sub"), 
      entering into a loan agreement (the "Loan") with one or more 
      lenders affiliated with Walton Asset Management LP, to borrow funds to 
      cover pre-development costs that are expected to be incurred prior to 
      obtaining arm's length construction loans that the Corporation and the 
      US Sub will put in place for Phase 1 construction of the Westphalia 
      property (the "Construction Loans").
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Loan will be an unsecured demand loan for up to US$3,500,000 at 
      10.5% annual interest, payable monthly, and is anticipated to be fully 
      repaid from the proceeds of the Construction Loans. The maturity date of 
      the Loan will be 36 months. The Loan may be repaid by the Corporation 
      prior to the due date without bonus or penalty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Loans are "related-party transactions" under Canadian Securities 
      Regulators Multilateral Instrument 61-101 ("MI 61-101"). The 
      Corporation is exempt from the formal valuation requirements contained 
      in MI 61-101 pursuant to Section 5.5(b) thereof because its securities 
      are not listed on a stock exchange. The Corporation is exempt from the 
      minority approval requirements contained in MI 61-101 because the board 
      of directors of the Corporation has determined that, pursuant to Section 
      5.7(1)(f) of MI 61-101, the Loan is on reasonable commercial terms that 
      are not less advantageous to the Corporation than if the Loans were 
      obtained from a party dealing at arm's length with the Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in March 2012, the Corporation was formed to provide investors 
      with the opportunity to participate in the acquisition and development 
      of the 310-acre Westphalia property located in Prince George&#8217;s County, 
      Maryland, U.S.A. The Westphalia property is approximately 21.7 
      kilometres from Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., which is the site of 
      the White House, the National Mall and the Capitol Building.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the 
      development of the property is managed by Walton Development  
      Management (USA), Inc., both of which are members of the Walton Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES May 16 (Reuters) - Argentina has the world's
second largest reservoir of unconventional oil after the United
States, concentrated in the Vaca Muerta megafield, said Ali
Moshiri, president of Latin American and African operations for
U.S. oil giant Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has signed an agreement with Argentine
state-controlled oil firm YPF, setting the stage for
Chevron  to invest up to $1.5 billion in Vaca Muerta,
located in Argentina's southern region of Patagonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You look at Argentina from the geological point of view,
and it is No. 2 Some people say China is number two, but really
if you look at the geological and volumetric from the shale oil,
Argentina is number two," Moshiri told reporters late on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of Vaca Muerta, which means "dead cow" in
Spanish, is still in the preliminary stages. The final
YPF/Chevron agreement should be signed in July, once outstanding
trade and tax issues are hammered out, Moshiri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Department of Energy report has shown Argentina holds
more natural gas trapped in shale rock than all of Europe - a
bounty estimated at 774 trillion cubic feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YPF, which was renationalized last year as Argentina battles
to reverse a long decline in natural gas and oil output, aims to
drill 132 oil wells at the Vaca Muerta shale formation in
Patagonia this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YPF's former parent company, Spain's Repsol, filed
a lawsuit late last year to block the YPF/Chevron deal, and vows
to take action against any company that partners with YPF after
Argentina seized control of the company from Repsol in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit added to a handful of high-profile legal battles
for Chevron in South America, including its year-long tussle in
Brazil following an offshore spill there and a two-decade
international fight over rainforest pollution in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moshiri said the highly-publicized Ecuador suit should not
interfere with the California-based company's investment plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are hoping that we will able to resolve the legal issue
but that doesn't stop our progress in terms of commercial
decisions," Moshiri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argentina last month created a fund of up to $2 billion to
help develop the 7.4-million acre Vaca Muerta shale field. That 
funding will come from central bank reserves, which the
government also taps periodically to make debt payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unconventional energy fields need greater investment than
conventional resources due to the complexities of extracting the
natural gas and crude from rock formations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the United States, where shale production has
boosted natural gas production, most of the Argentine drilling
to date has targeted oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - For years, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and other executives have hand-picked new directors, in a practice that is now unusual for a major U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan board's governance committee, responsible for hiring new members, relies almost entirely on referrals from management to find director nominees, according to two sources familiar with the bank's practices and a review of bank regulatory filings. All of the other 10 largest U.S. banks say they use executive search firms, which have knowledge of a range of possible candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An examination of the bank's selection process, which until now has been little known, could prompt questions about how much influence Dimon has over the largest U.S. bank's board. It comes ahead of a critical shareholder vote next Tuesday over whether the board should strip him of the chairman's title and give it to another director, which would increase oversight of Dimon's stewardship as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting directors in this way can create the appearance that the board may be too close to Dimon and his senior management team, some corporate governance experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is value in seeking input from others outside of the board room," said Ann Yerger, executive director at the Council of Institutional Investors, an association of pension funds, endowments and foundations. "The point here is you should be casting a wide net, especially at our most elite companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday that the board has used executive search firms but has not found them useful. "Many of the director candidates for our board are names already well known to the business community," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Lemkau said, James Bell, who joined the board in November 2011 shortly before retiring as Boeing Co's chief financial officer, was known to the governance committee as a highly qualified director prospect for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By most corporate standards, JPMorgan's 11-member board is strong - with a lot of business heavyweights - and is relatively independent. Ten directors are described by the bank in regulatory filings as independent from management, and Dimon is the only executive on the board. Former ExxonMobil CEO Lee Raymond is the lead independent director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan executive who has made presentations to the board said that Raymond acts as an effective counterweight to Dimon. Some shareholders agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think these guys are shrinking violets," said Jordan Posner, managing director of Matrix Asset Advisors Inc, a New York money manager with about 619,000 JPMorgan shares, referring to Raymond and other directors. Matrix is voting in favor of keeping Dimon in both roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said that Raymond did not want to be interviewed for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no director other than Dimon has significant banking industry experience - a shortcoming that started to gnaw at some investors last year when JPMorgan suffered a $6 billion loss from failed derivative positions that came to be known as the "London Whale" trades. Since then Dimon has had a series of high-profile dust-ups with regulators, which have further added to shareholder discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This board doesn't have the bench, the expertise, the supporting cast," said Michael Pryce-Jones, an analyst at CtW Investment Group, which, as an adviser to union pension funds owning about 6 million JPMorgan shares, is pushing for changes to the bank's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many investors say they do not want Dimon to leave as CEO of the firm he has profitably run for more than seven years. Dimon has suggested that he might quit if shareholders at the Tampa, Florida meeting vote to ask the board to strip him of the chairmanship. A similar measure won 40 percent support last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISKY BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An executive at an institutional investor with several million shares in JPMorgan said it is looking beyond the trading loss to broader questions around governance as it decides how to vote on the proposal. Last year the investor supported Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended voters support the split. ISS said when it asked Raymond whether board members on the risk management committee had enough expertise, he said that it was hard to find qualified people who had no conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At other banks, the board selection process is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Citigroup Inc added eight directors with skills including regulatory and risk management expertise, ISS said. Bank of America Corp added five directors, including a former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve and a former CEO of a bank holding company, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Citigroup and Bank of America use search firms. Of the 10 largest U.S. banks, only JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon Corp make no mention of using outside search firms to find directors, a review of filings shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon spokesman Ron Gruendl said that the trust bank uses a variety of ways to recruit directors, including working with outside search firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the London Whale losses, the three directors on the risk committee were: James Crown, president of a large family investment company; David Cote, the CEO of Honeywell International Inc; and Ellen Futter, who heads the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The three, who remain on the committee which has now been augmented by a fourth member, were not available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISS found the experience of the original three members wanting. It said plenty of directors with strong backgrounds in risk management, financial regulation and other relevant areas serve on rival financial companies' boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, JPMorgan directors Raymond and William Weldon, who is a former CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, vouched for the qualifications, diligence and independence of board members in a letter to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They pointed out that the board had cut Dimon's pay in half for 2012 because of the London Whale problem, and ensured the employees responsible for the losses paid back $100 million to the bank and were fired. They described the board as "highly functioning, engaged and empowered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their letter, Raymond and Weldon said those three members of the risk panel could not have anticipated that the company's hedging strategy would turn into a far riskier trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nadia Damouni and David Henry in New York and Ross Kerber in Boston, additional reporting by Emily Flitter in New York; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Paritosh Bansal and Martin Howell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Rooftop solar installer SolarCity Corp (SCTY.O) on Thursday said Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) would finance more than $500 million of its solar power projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding for U.S. residential solar leases is the largest such deal ever announced, SolarCity said in a statement. The agreement was initiated last year and the funding expanded in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SolarCity has raised similar funds from banks such as U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and from corporations including Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As owners of the panel systems, the banks and companies are able to claim a federal tax credit worth 30 percent of the value of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funds allow homeowners to pay a monthly fee for their solar energy panels rather than pay for them all at once. The growth of such financing in the solar industry has made generating electric power from the sun an option for households that otherwise could not afford it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the statement, Goldman's global head of clean technology and renewables, Stuart Bernstein, said the firm had set a target of $40 billion in financings and investments in renewable energy over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nichola Groom; editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

			IDC to Host Deep Dive Discussion Session on Transparent Computing and 
      Natural Interfaces with Microsoft, HP, and Intel at SMART TECHnology 
      World Conference, May 30-31
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Limited-seating, interactive discussion session for executives to 
      address what it takes to implement touch, voice, gesture, and other 
      interactive computing technologies in intelligent systems
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      International Data Corporation (IDC) 
      and GTIA L.L.C. today announced that three experts on transparent 
      computing from the Microsoft Xbox, HP Consumer PC, and Intel RD teams 
      will join IDC Research Manager Michael 
      Palma in the "deep dive" session entitled "Transparent Computing: 
      Natural Interfaces for the Client and Beyond" at the SMART 
      TECHnology World 2013 conference in Menlo Park, California on May 
      31st. Joining Palma are:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Ilan Spillinger, Corporate Vice President, Interactive 
        Entertainment Business Hardware, Microsoft Corporation
      
			
				Mike Nash, Vice President, Consumer PCs  Solutions, Printing 
        and Personal Systems Group, Hewlett-Packard Company
      
			
				Dr. Achin Bhowmik, Director of Perceptual Computing, Intel 
        Corporation
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Transparent computing, also called "interactive computing" and 
      "perceptual computing," encompasses touch, gesture recognition, reality 
      augmentation, voice interaction, facial recognition, and other 
      technologies that will change significantly how human beings interact 
      with electronic systems, including PCs, consumer devices, and embedded 
      systems. Already familiar to users of Microsoft's Xbox 360 Kinect and 
      users of HP PCs with touch screens, and developers using the Intel&#174; 
      Perceptual Computing SDK, transparent computing will be deployed in 
      billions of systems across multiple industries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SMART TECH's deep dive sessions are highly interactive discussion and 
      networking sessions among a select group of business, financial, and 
      industry executives, and major end users who decide how transparent 
      computing technology is being deployed. In the "Transparent Computing: 
      Natural Interfaces for the Client and Beyond" deep dive, IDC's Palma 
      will analyze transparent computing's technology and market landscape, 
      then Microsoft's Spillinger, HP's Nash, and Intel's Bhowmik will present 
      the critical issues they face in deploying the technology in intelligent 
      systems. Palma will then lead the ensuing discussion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Transparent computing will be a defining element in the transformation 
      of embedded systems to intelligent systems," said Palma. "Having these 
      leaders from the Microsoft Xbox, HP Consumer PC, and Intel RD teams 
      testifies to the fact that implementing transparent computing will be 
      transformational but challenging. This deep dive session is the best 
      opportunity for executives to hear the perspective of real customers of 
      transparent computing and determine whether their activities are in 
      synch for intelligent system market success."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Building a NUI system that is capable of reaching a broad audience is 
      not an easy task. I look forward to engaging with the executives and 
      Smart Technology audience and sharing my perspective on what it takes to 
      build such a complex system people can connect with easily," said 
      Microsoft's Ilan Spillinger.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "With perceptual computing, we are focusing on adding human-like sensing 
      and perception capabilities to the computing devices," said Intel's 
      Achin Bhowmik. "This will enable new and exciting interactive 
      applications and experiences that are natural, intuitive, and immersive."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Participation in "Transparent Computing: Natural Interfaces for the 
      Client and Beyond" is limited to 25 conference attendees. Content for 
      the session is exclusive, including a formal email invitation from the 
      lead analyst with a profile of the session's participants and goals for 
      the session. All participants will receive an IDC follow-up report that 
      analyzes the session's results.

			SolarCity and Goldman Sachs Create Largest U.S. Rooftop Solar Lease 
      Financing Platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Collaboration Expected to Fund more than $500 Million in Solar 
      Projects, 110 Megawatts of Solar Capacity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SolarCity (Nasdaq: SCTY), a leading provider of clean energy, today 
      announced a lease financing agreement with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) to 
      fund more than $500 million in solar power projects; an estimated 110 
      megawatts in generation capacity for homeowners and businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The financing makes it possible for homeowners, businesses, government 
      and other non-profit organizations to install solar panels with no 
      upfront cost and pay less for clean, solar electricity than they 
      currently pay for utility bills. The agreement was initiated in 2012 and 
      expanded per its initial terms at the end of April. The combined lease 
      financing is the largest of its kind announced in the U.S. for 
      homeowners&#8217; rooftops. The financing has already enabled approximately 26 
      megawatts (MW) of new solar generation to be deployed, and the remainder 
      is reflected in the 158 MW of available financing as of May 10, 2013 
      reported in SolarCity&#8217;s announcement of financial results earlier this 
      week.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited about the opportunity in distributed solar, which has 
      the potential to both lower energy costs and create jobs,&#8221; said Stuart 
      Bernstein, Global Head of Clean Technology and Renewables at Goldman 
      Sachs. &#8220;Our firm has set a target of $40 billion in financings and 
      investments in renewable energy over the next decade, and we believe 
      SolarCity&#8217;s range of distributed solar solutions targeting a wider 
      customer base will help us move toward a low carbon energy future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As more investors have become familiar with the reliability and quality 
      of solar as a technology and an asset class, it has become possible to 
      expand the pool of available financing and offer options to a broader 
      range of potential customers, including those with lower credit 
      profiles. SolarCity and Goldman Sachs have created an attractive 
      financing structure to further lower the cost of capital of financing 
      solar. The financing can make it easier to fund projects for schools, 
      municipalities and other organizations that are not publicly rated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Goldman lease financing will make affordable solar electricity 
      available to more types of homeowners and organizations,&#8221; said Jimmy 
      Chuang, SolarCity&#8217;s vice president of structured finance. &#8220;We expect to 
      be able to expand our offering to a broader customer base by lowering 
      the credit requirements even further in future financings.&#8221;

			Fixmo Launches Industry&#8217;s First Mobile Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) 
      Solution for Microsoft SharePoint
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fixmo SharePlace Delivers Integrated Mobile Security and DLP for 
      Microsoft SharePoint; Supports Mobile-Specific Access Control Policies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fixmo, 
      a leading provider of mobile security and risk management solutions, 
      today announced the availability of Fixmo 
      SharePlace, the first defense-grade data leakage prevention (DLP) 
      solution enabling secure and compliant access to Microsoft SharePoint 
      from Apple iOS and Android devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Enterprises and government agencies continue to expand their use of 
      Microsoft SharePoint for centralized document management and employee 
      collaboration; but, unfortunately, because IT can&#8217;t delineate between 
      content made available via SharePoint on desktops versus mobile devices, 
      many organizations are blocking mobile SharePoint access altogether due 
      to concerns over corporate data leakage and potential compliance 
      breaches. And while some solutions in the market provide advanced data 
      encryption and user authentication on mobile devices, they lack the 
      ability to define mobile-specific user permissions to restrict the 
      content that can be downloaded and stored on mobile devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SharePlace combines end-to-end FIPS 140-2 data encryption, on-device 
      data containerization, multi-factor user authentication, mobile-specific 
      access permissions and geo-location policy controls into a defense-grade 
      mobile DLP solution that enables organizations to embrace SharePoint on 
      mobile devices without compromising security, integrity or compliance. 
      It provides mobile-specific access control policies that can prevent 
      specific documents from being downloaded to mobile devices. Mobile 
      access permissions can be restricted based on the sensitivity of the 
      information, the user profile, or the current location of the device &#8211; 
      all without changing the user&#8217;s permissions for desktop-based access.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Too many organizations have been left considering an &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; 
      proposition when it comes to accessing content stored in SharePoint from 
      a mobile device due to the high risk of data leakage,&#8221; said Alan 
      Pelz-Sharpe, Research Director Content Management and Collaboration, 451 
      Research. &#8220;Products like Fixmo&#8217;s SharePlace allow organizations to 
      manage that risk while enabling mobile SharePoint access intelligently, 
      bringing potential benefits both to employees and CISOs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to offering advanced security and DLP capabilities, Fixmo 
      SharePlace also offers a server-side Enterprise Gateway that accelerates 
      mobile SharePoint access through bandwidth optimization as well as the 
      ability to automate the synchronization of approved folders and 
      documents down to the mobile device. Fixmo SharePlace is now available 
      for Government agencies and enterprise customers. For more information 
      or to request a free trial, please visit http://fixmo.com/products/shareplace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IT organizations around the world are investing in both Microsoft 
      SharePoint and their enterprise mobility deployments, but many are 
      becoming increasingly frustrated that there is no way to align these two 
      strategies without heightening the risk of sensitive data leakage,&#8221; said 
      Rick Segal, Fixmo CEO. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to introduce Fixmo SharePlace to 
      solve this challenge. For the first time, SharePoint administrators can 
      create custom IT policies to restrict access to specific content on 
      certain mobile devices, or outside of a given geographic region, without 
      impacting what a user can do on their desktop computer.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. rooftop solar installer
SolarCity Corp on Thursday said Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 would finance more than $500 million of its solar power
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding for U.S. residential solar leases is the largest
such deal ever announced, SolarCity said in a statement. The
agreement was initiated last year and the funding expanded in
April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SolarCity has raised similar funds from banks such as U.S.
Bancorp and from corporations including Google Inc
 and Honda Motor Co Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As owners of the panel systems, the banks and companies are
able to claim a federal tax credit worth 30 percent of the value
of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funds allow homeowners to pay a monthly fee for their
solar energy panels rather than pay for them all at once. The
growth of such financing in the solar industry has made
generating electric power from the sun an option for households
that otherwise could not afford it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the statement, Goldman's global head of clean technology
and renewables, Stuart Bernstein, said the firm had set a target
of $40 billion in financings and investments in renewable energy
over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nadia Damouni, David Henry and Ross Kerber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 16 (Reuters) - For years, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and other executives have
hand-picked new directors, in a practice that is now unusual for
a major U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan board's governance committee, responsible for
hiring new members, relies almost entirely on referrals from
management to find director nominees, according to two sources
familiar with the bank's practices and a review of bank
regulatory filings. All of the other 10 largest U.S. banks say
they use executive search firms, which have knowledge of a range
of possible candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An examination of the bank's selection process, which until
now has been little known, could prompt questions about how much
influence Dimon has over the largest U.S. bank's board. It comes
ahead of a critical shareholder vote next Tuesday over whether
the board should strip him of the chairman's title and give it
to another director, which would increase oversight of Dimon's
stewardship as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting directors in this way can create the appearance
that the board may be too close to Dimon and his senior
management team, some corporate governance experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is value in seeking input from others outside of the
board room," said Ann Yerger, executive director at the Council
of Institutional Investors, an association of pension funds,
endowments and foundations. "The point here is you should be
casting a wide net, especially at our most elite companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday that
the board has used executive search firms but has not found them
useful. "Many of the director candidates for our board are names
already well known to the business community," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Lemkau said, James Bell, who joined the board
in November 2011 shortly before retiring as Boeing Co's 
chief financial officer, was known to the governance committee
as a highly qualified director prospect for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By most corporate standards, JPMorgan's 11-member board is
strong - with a lot of business heavyweights - and is relatively
independent. Ten directors are described by the bank in
regulatory filings as independent from management, and Dimon is
the only executive on the board. Former ExxonMobil CEO
Lee Raymond is the lead independent director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan executive who has made presentations to
the board said that Raymond acts as an effective counterweight
to Dimon. Some shareholders agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think these guys are shrinking violets," said
Jordan Posner, managing director of Matrix Asset Advisors Inc, a
New York money manager with about 619,000 JPMorgan shares,
referring to Raymond and other directors. Matrix is voting in
favor of keeping Dimon in both roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said that Raymond did not want to be interviewed
for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no director other than Dimon has significant banking
industry experience - a shortcoming that started to gnaw at some
investors last year when JPMorgan suffered a $6 billion loss
from failed derivative positions that came to be known as the
"London Whale" trades. Since then Dimon has had a series of
high-profile dust-ups with regulators, which have further added
to shareholder discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This board doesn't have the bench, the expertise, the
supporting cast," said Michael Pryce-Jones, an analyst at CtW
Investment Group, which, as an adviser to union pension funds
owning about 6 million JPMorgan shares, is pushing for changes
to the bank's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many investors say they do not want Dimon to leave as
CEO of the firm he has profitably run for more than seven years.
Dimon has suggested that he might quit if shareholders at the
Tampa, Florida meeting vote to ask the board to strip him of the
chairmanship. A similar measure won 40 percent support last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISKY BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An executive at an institutional investor with several
million shares in JPMorgan said it is looking beyond the trading
loss to broader questions around governance as it decides how to
vote on the proposal. Last year the investor supported Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has
recommended voters support the split. ISS said when it asked
Raymond whether board members on the risk management committee
had enough expertise, he said that it was hard to find qualified
people who had no conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At other banks, the board selection process is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Citigroup Inc
 added eight directors with skills including regulatory and
risk management expertise, ISS said. Bank of America Corp
 added five directors, including a former governor of the
U.S. Federal Reserve and a former CEO of a bank holding company,
it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Citigroup and Bank of America use search firms. Of the
10 largest U.S. banks, only JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon
Corp make no mention of using outside search firms to
find directors, a review of filings shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon spokesman Ron Gruendl said that the trust bank
uses a variety of ways to recruit directors, including working
with outside search firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the London Whale losses, the three directors
on the risk committee were: James Crown, president of a large
family investment company; David Cote, the CEO of Honeywell
International Inc ; and Ellen Futter, who heads the
American Museum of Natural History in New York. The three, who
remain on the committee which has now been augmented by a fourth
member, were not available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISS found the experience of the original three members
wanting. It said plenty of directors with strong backgrounds in
risk management, financial regulation and other relevant areas
serve on rival financial companies' boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, JPMorgan directors Raymond and William Weldon,
who is a former CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, vouched for
the qualifications, diligence and independence of board members
in a letter to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They pointed out that the board had cut Dimon's pay in half
for 2012 because of the London Whale problem, and ensured the
employees responsible for the losses paid back $100 million to
the bank and were fired. They described the board as "highly
functioning, engaged and empowered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their letter, Raymond and Weldon said those three members
of the risk panel could not have anticipated that the company's
hedging strategy would turn into a far riskier trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Judge dismisses activists' challenge to Goldman deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Says taxman made mistakes but did not break law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ruling adds to debate on corporate tax avoidance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Estelle Shirbon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Britain's tax authority was
heavily criticised by a judge on Thursday, who nonetheless ruled
its deal with Goldman Sachs worth up to 20 million pounds
($30 million) to the U.S. bank was lawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High Court Judge Andrew Nicol dismissed a claim by campaign
group UK Uncut Legal Action that the tax settlement with the
bank in 2010 was an unlawful "sweetheart deal".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he criticised the way HMRC had decided how much tax
Goldman Sachs should pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement with Goldman Sachs was not a glorious
episode in the history of the Revenue," the judge wrote, before
listing errors made by HMRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, my task is to decide whether the decisions of HMRC
under challenge were unlawful," he wrote, citing a previous
ruling that said "maladministration and illegality are separate
issues".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judgment feeds into the debate on corporate tax
avoidance in Britain, where some lawmakers have accused the
taxman of being "too cosy" with big business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time of government austerity cuts and economic
stagnation, the question of how big companies keep their tax
bills low is considered a matter of high public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Inc was facing another grilling over its tax
affairs on Thursday from a committee of lawmakers who called the
company back after questions were raised about testimony given
in an earlier hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Reuters investigation has revealed that the tax take from
big companies fell sharply in the past 12 years, despite profits
rising, while income taxes from individuals and small businesses
have risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMRC said the judge's ruling had "drawn a line under the
Goldman Sachs issue".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The High Court's comprehensive dismissal of UK Uncut's
claim puts to rest the fallacy that HMRC is soft on large
businesses," Director General for Business Tax Jim Harra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was heard earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMBARRASSMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Uncut Legal Action said it was disappointed by the
ruling, but the court case had helped expose what went on behind
closed doors between HMRC and large companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which was not a party to the court case,
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerned a deal reached orally in November 2010
between then HMRC boss Dave Hartnett and Goldman Sachs
executives to resolve a long-running dispute over a now-banned
tax avoidance scheme involving the payment of bonuses to UK
staff via an offshore tax haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Uncut alleged that Hartnett had wrongly agreed that
Goldman should pay the principal it owed but not the interest
that had accrued during the five-year dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hartnett then approved the deal despite opposition from
HMRC's own High Risk Corporate Programme Board, partly to avoid
embarrassing George Osborne, the finance minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne had just announced a new tax code for banks aimed at
reducing avoidance and Goldman was threatening to pull out of
the code if Hartnett reneged on the oral settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr Hartnett took into account the potential embarrassment
to (Osborne) if Goldman Sachs were to withdraw from the tax
code. HMRC accepts that was an irrelevant consideration and
should not have featured in his decision-making process," the
judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A British group campaigning against tax avoidance has lost a legal challenge against a 2010 settlement between Goldman Sachs and HMRC, the British tax authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Andrew Nicol wrote in a judgment on Thursday that the controversial settlement, worth up to 20 million pounds ($30 million) to the U.S. bank, was "not a glorious episode" in the history of HMRC but that it was not unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerns a deal reached orally in November 2010 between then HMRC boss Dave Hartnett and Goldman Sachs executives to resolve a long-running dispute over a now-banned tax avoidance scheme involving the payment of bonuses to UK staff via an offshore tax haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist group UK Uncut Legal Action alleged that Hartnett had wrongly agreed a "sweetheart deal" whereby Goldman paid the principal it owed but not the accrued interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Nicol said mistakes had been made which HMRC now acknowledge, but the deal had not broken the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Estelle Shirbon; editing by Stephen Addison)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A tax deal between the British government and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) worth up to 20 million pounds ($30 million) to the U.S. bank was lawful but "not a glorious episode" for the tax authority, a judge ruled on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK Uncut Legal Action, a group campaigning against tax avoidance, had taken HMRC to court arguing that the 2010 settlement was an unlawful "sweetheart deal".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High Court Judge Andrew Nicol dismissed the group's overall claim on Thursday, but criticized the way HMRC had reached the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement with Goldman Sachs was not a glorious episode in the history of the Revenue," the judge wrote, before listing a litany of errors by HMRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, my task is to decide whether the decisions of HMRC under challenge were unlawful," he wrote, citing a previous ruling that said "maladministration and illegality are separate issues".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers have accused HMRC of being "too cozy" with big business, and a Reuters investigation has revealed that the tax take from big companies fell sharply in the past 12 years, despite profits rising, while income taxes from individuals and small businesses have risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Uncut Legal Action said it was disappointed by the ruling but said the court case had helped expose how the taxman dealt with big businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite not having won the case today we still feel that this judgment has demonstrated that the government is making a political choice to cut legal aid, public services and the welfare system, rather than take action to make corporate giants pay their fair share of tax," said Anna Walker, the group's campaigns director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which was not a party to the court case, declined to comment. HMRC said the ruling had vindicated it's position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The High Court's comprehensive dismissal of UK Uncut's claim puts to rest the fallacy that HMRC is soft on large businesses," said HMRC's Director General for Business Tax, Jim Harra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Erica Billingham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 16 (Reuters) - A British group campaigning
against tax avoidance has lost a legal challenge against a 2010
settlement between Goldman Sachs and HMRC, the British tax
authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Andrew Nicol wrote in a judgment on Thursday that the
controversial settlement, worth up to 20 million pounds ($30
million) to the U.S. bank, was "not a glorious episode" in the
history of HMRC but that it was not unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerns a deal reached orally in November 2010
between then HMRC boss Dave Hartnett and Goldman Sachs
executives to resolve a long-running dispute over a now-banned
tax avoidance scheme involving the payment of bonuses to UK
staff via an offshore tax haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist group UK Uncut Legal Action alleged that Hartnett
had wrongly agreed a "sweetheart deal" whereby Goldman paid the
principal it owed but not the accrued interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Nicol said mistakes had been made which HMRC now
acknowledge, but the deal had not broken the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* First-quarter sales at 426.7 mln unit cases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Proposes dividend of 0.34 euros per share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Says conditions in established markets remain tough

 (Adds details, dividend)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATHENS, May 16 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola HBC (CCHBC), the
world's second-largest bottler of Coca-Cola, on Thursday
reported flat first-quarter sales, with strong growth in Russia
offset by weaker demand in austerity-hit European Union
countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCHBC  buys syrup concentrate from The
Coca-Cola Company and bottles and distributes the U.S.
group's drinks in 28 countries from Russia to Nigeria. The first
quarter traditionally accounts for a small part of full-year
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales volume was 426.7 million unit cases in the first
quarter, matching analysts' average forecast of 426 million
cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government spending cuts and high unemployment in Greece and
Italy, CCHBC's second-biggest market, are hitting demand for
soft drinks, eclipsing robust growth in Russia, the bottler's
biggest market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, cost savings helped CCHBC's bottom line. The
company narrowed its loss to 15.9 million euros ($20.45 million)
from 19 million euros in the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reported loss excludes restructuring and other one-off
items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCHBC has been cutting costs and adapting prices to boost
profit. The bottler said it will continue this policy to deal
with tough conditions for the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its board proposed a 2012 dividend of 0.34 euros per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCHBC moved its headquarters to Switzerland from debt-laden
Greece last month and its primary listing to London to save on
taxes and improve access to capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock trades 22 times its estimated 2013 earnings, 
according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

&lt;p&gt;May 16 (Reuters) - For years, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and other executives have
hand-picked new directors, in a practice that is now unusual for
a major U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan board's governance committee, responsible for
hiring new members, relies almost entirely on referrals from
management to find director nominees, according to two sources
familiar with the bank's practices and a review of bank
regulatory filings. All of the other 10 largest U.S. banks say
they use executive search firms, which have knowledge of a range
of possible candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An examination of the bank's selection process, which until
now has been little known, could prompt questions about how much
influence Dimon has over the largest U.S. bank's board. It comes
ahead of a critical shareholder vote next Tuesday over whether
the board should strip him of the chairman's title and give it
to another director, which would increase oversight of Dimon's
stewardship as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting directors in this way can create the appearance
that the board may be too close to Dimon and his senior
management team, some corporate governance experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is value in seeking input from others outside of the
board room," said Ann Yerger, executive director at the Council
of Institutional Investors, an association of pension funds,
endowments and foundations. "The point here is you should be
casting a wide net, especially at our most elite companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday that
the board has used executive search firms but has not found them
useful. "Many of the director candidates for our board are names
already well known to the business community," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Lemkau said, James Bell, who joined the board
in November 2011 shortly before retiring as Boeing Co's 
chief financial officer, was known to the governance committee
as a highly qualified director prospect for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By most corporate standards, JPMorgan's 11-member board is
strong - with a lot of business heavyweights - and is relatively
independent. Ten directors are described by the bank in
regulatory filings as independent from management, and Dimon is
the only executive on the board. Former ExxonMobil CEO
Lee Raymond is the lead independent director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan executive who has made presentations to
the board said that Raymond acts as an effective counterweight
to Dimon. Some shareholders agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think these guys are shrinking violets," said
Jordan Posner, managing director of Matrix Asset Advisors Inc, a
New York money manager with about 619,000 JPMorgan shares,
referring to Raymond and other directors. Matrix is voting in
favor of keeping Dimon in both roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said that Raymond did not want to be interviewed
for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no director other than Dimon has significant banking
industry experience - a shortcoming that started to gnaw at some
investors last year when JPMorgan suffered a $6 billion loss
from failed derivative positions that came to be known as the
"London Whale" trades. Since then Dimon has had a series of
high-profile dust-ups with regulators, which have further added
to shareholder discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This board doesn't have the bench, the expertise, the
supporting cast," said Michael Pryce-Jones, an analyst at CtW
Investment Group, which, as an adviser to union pension funds
owning about 6 million JPMorgan shares, is pushing for changes
to the bank's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many investors say they do not want Dimon to leave as
CEO of the firm he has profitably run for more than seven years.
Dimon has suggested that he might quit if shareholders at the
Tampa, Florida meeting vote to ask the board to strip him of the
chairmanship. A similar measure won 40 percent support last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISKY BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An executive at an institutional investor with several
million shares in JPMorgan said it is looking beyond the trading
loss to broader questions around governance as it decides how to
vote on the proposal. Last year the investor supported Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has
recommended voters support the split. ISS said when it asked
Raymond whether board members on the risk management committee
had enough expertise, he said that it was hard to find qualified
people who had no conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At other banks, the board selection process is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Citigroup Inc
 added eight directors with skills including regulatory and
risk management expertise, ISS said. Bank of America Corp
 added five directors, including a former governor of the
U.S. Federal Reserve and a former CEO of a bank holding company,
it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Citigroup and Bank of America use search firms. Of the
10 largest U.S. banks, only JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon
Corp make no mention of using outside search firms to
find directors, a review of filings shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon spokesman Ron Gruendl said that the trust bank
uses a variety of ways to recruit directors, including working
with outside search firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the London Whale losses, the three directors
on the risk committee were: James Crown, president of a large
family investment company; David Cote, the CEO of Honeywell
International Inc ; and Ellen Futter, who heads the
American Museum of Natural History in New York. The three, who
remain on the committee which has now been augmented by a fourth
member, were not available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISS found the experience of the original three members
wanting. It said plenty of directors with strong backgrounds in
risk management, financial regulation and other relevant areas
serve on rival financial companies' boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, JPMorgan directors Raymond and William Weldon,
who is a former CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, vouched for
the qualifications, diligence and independence of board members
in a letter to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They pointed out that the board had cut Dimon's pay in half
for 2012 because of the London Whale problem, and ensured the
employees responsible for the losses paid back $100 million to
the bank and were fired. They described the board as "highly
functioning, engaged and empowered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their letter, Raymond and Weldon said those three members
of the risk panel could not have anticipated that the company's
hedging strategy would turn into a far riskier trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A federal judge has revived a closely watched lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) of misleading Belgian-French bank Dexia SA (DEXI.BR) into buying more than $1.6 billion of troubled mortgage debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing a recent federal appeals court decision involving American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said he had lacked jurisdiction when he decided on April 2 to throw out much of Dexia's lawsuit against JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ruling had dismissed claims for all but $5.7 million, or less than 1 percent, of the roughly $774 million of damages that Dexia had sought from the largest U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In finding on Friday that he had no jurisdiction under an obscure 1919 federal law known as the Edge Act, Rakoff reinstated the dismissed claims and sent the case back to the New York state court where it began in January 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those who don't believe in ghosts have never been in court, where legal claims are regularly seen rising from the grave," Rakoff wrote on Friday. "This is a case in point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Justin Perras declined to comment. Timothy DeLange, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger &amp; Grossmann representing Dexia, also declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is one of many accusing banks of trying to boost profit by packaging low-quality mortgages into seemingly safe securities, while fraudulently hiding the risks or failing to ensure the loans were underwritten properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dexia alleged it was misled about the quality of 65 residential mortgage-backed securities certificates it bought from 51 offerings between 2005 and 2007 by JPMorgan, Bear Stearns Cos and Washington Mutual Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose chief executive is Jamie Dimon, bought Bear and most of WaMu in 2008. The Dexia case gained notoriety from emails and other materials that suggested the defendants knew the securities they were selling were toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2ND CIRCUIT DECISION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his earlier ruling, Rakoff let Dexia sue JPMorgan in federal court only over claims by its FSA Asset Management unit on five of the 65 certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But matters changed after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said on April 19 that AIG's similar, larger lawsuit against Bank of America belonged in state court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Edge Act was designed to help free banks from state regulatory burdens and compete in offshore banking, and Bank of America said it warranted federal court jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG said the Edge Act should not apply, noting that the $28 billion of securities it bought were created domestically, as were nearly all of the 1.7 million underlying home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ruling for AIG, the 2nd Circuit said federal courts could resolve disputes over offshore transactions handled by federally chartered corporations that are parties to those disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rakoff said this forced him to reverse his original order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While noting that some loans underlying Dexia's securities involved Virgin Islands properties, he said these were created by another lender, Flagstar Bank. Rakoff also said it did not matter that JPMorgan engaged in other international banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because JPMorgan Chase Bank did not itself engage in the foreign banking transactions on the basis of which the defendants sought removal, the court cannot exercise jurisdiction over this case under the Edge Act," Rakoff wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In seeking to dismiss Dexia's lawsuit, JPMorgan argued that all of the alleged misstatements were addressed in a prospectus or prospectus supplement, and that there was no showing that alleged fraud caused any of Dexia's alleged losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emails disclosed in the case suggested many instances where bank employees tried to press ahead with underwriting mortgage securities, despite knowing of deficient documentation in many of the underlying loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Dexia SA/NV et al v. Bear Stearns &amp; Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-04761.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Alison Franke; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, a target of criticism for his often unconventional conduct, on Friday denied media allegations that he had been caught on video smoking crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Absolutely not true," Ford told reporters gathered outside his west Toronto house, before driving off in his SUV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporters for the Toronto Star and Gawker Media said late on Thursday they had watched a cellphone video that appears to show Ford smoking crack, although both news outlets said they had declined to pay the $100,000 price asked by the tipsters, people that the Star said were involved in the Toronto drug trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not confirm the existence of the video and it is not clear what impact the allegations will have on Ford's position as mayor of Canada's largest city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor still has an approval rating of around 50 percent despite a series of negative headlines, although that's down from 70 percent in the year after he took power, according to Forum Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Toronto Police spokesman said police are "closely monitoring the situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, did not return Reuters' requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're just trying to see whether or not such a video exists and whether or not any video has been doctored or altered," Morris told the Toronto Sun newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Ford planned legal action, Morris said it is at the "bottom rung of the ladder" now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gawker is asking for donations in what it has labeled a "Crackstarter" campaign to raise $200,000 to buy the video and post it online. It says it has already raised $28,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford, 43, was elected in 2010 on a promise to "stop the gravy train" at City Hall.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds Gawker campaign to buy video, details on Ford approval
rating)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Julie Gordon and Cameron French&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TORONTO May 17 (Reuters) - Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, a target
of criticism for his often unconventional conduct, on Friday
denied media allegations that he had been caught on video
smoking crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Absolutely not true," Ford told reporters gathered outside
his west Toronto house, before driving off in his SUV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporters for the Toronto Star and Gawker Media said late on
Thursday they had watched a cellphone video that appears to show
Ford smoking crack, although both news outlets said they had
declined to pay the $100,000 price asked by the tipsters, people
that the Star said were involved in the Toronto drug trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not confirm the existence of the video and it
is not clear what impact the allegations will have on Ford's
position as mayor of Canada's largest city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor still has an approval rating of around 50 percent
despite a series of negative headlines, although that's down
from 70 percent in the year after he took power, according to
Forum Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Toronto Police spokesman said police are "closely
monitoring the situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, did not return Reuters'
requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're just trying to see whether or not such a video exists
and whether or not any video has been doctored or altered,"
Morris told the Toronto Sun newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Ford planned legal action, Morris said it is at the
"bottom rung of the ladder" now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gawker is asking for donations in what it has labeled a
"Crackstarter" campaign to raise $200,000 to buy the video and
post it online. It says it has already raised $28,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford, 43, was elected in 2010 on a promise to "stop the
gravy train" at City Hall. But he has frequently attracted
unfavorable news coverage, including for a conflict of interest
case that almost cost him his job, a photograph of him reading
documents while driving on the freeway, and an altercation with
a reporter on a patch of land outside his house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At City Hall on Friday, Ford initially brushed past
reporters, only to return to deliver a very brief statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These allegations are ridiculous, another story with
respect to the Toronto Star going after me," Ford said. "And
that's all I've got to say for now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not reply when asked if he believed the video was
faked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAR, GAWKER STAND BY STORIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Star, Canada's largest circulation newspaper, said it
stands by its reporting and the story is one piece of a broader
investigative report that it has been working on for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This isn't a story that we're going to report lightly,"
said Robyn Doolittle, one of two Toronto Star reporters who said
they had watched the video three times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: "The Toronto Star has a high bar that we always
make sure we meet before we run something, especially when it
comes to this mayor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doolittle said the paper never intended to pay for the video
but did engage in discussions about "numbers" in an attempt to
see it. She said the men trying to sell the video first wanted
C$1 million ($975,000) but then dropped the price to C$100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford and his older brother Doug, a city councillor who often
speaks on Ford's behalf, have a mostly hostile relationship with
Toronto's news media, and a particularly rocky relationship with
the Star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gawker, first to publish the cocaine allegations, did so
after the existence of the video began to leak out, said the
site's editor-in-chief, John Cook. "I am confident that I saw
Rob Ford smoking crack in that video," Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking early on Friday, Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday, told
reporters he stands by the mayor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Certainly, at this point, we all know that videos can be
altered and we certainly know that drug dealers can't be
trusted," he said at Toronto City Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTROVERSY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is hardly the first controversy for Ford, who has drawn
criticism for skipping city council meetings to coach
high-school football and engaging in a confrontation outside his
home with a reporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was briefly ordered out of office in 2012 after he was
found guilty of conflict of interest, but won an appeal and was
allowed to finish his four-year term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just two months ago, the Star reported that Toronto City
Councilor Paul Ainslie had asked Ford to leave a charity
function after several people complained the mayor was impaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford called that story an "outright lie".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These controversies have eaten into Ford's popularity,
although he still enjoys support from significant chunk of the
population, mostly in Toronto's suburbs.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A federal judge has revived a closely watched lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) of misleading Belgian-French bank Dexia SA (DEXI.BR) into buying more than $1.6 billion of troubled mortgage debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing a recent federal appeals court decision involving American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said he had lacked jurisdiction when he decided on April 2 to throw out much of Dexia's lawsuit against JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ruling had dismissed claims for all but $5.7 million, or less than 1 percent, of the roughly $774 million of damages that Dexia had sought from the largest U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In finding on Friday that he had no jurisdiction under an obscure 1919 federal law known as the Edge Act, Rakoff reinstated the dismissed claims and sent the case back to the New York state court where it began in January 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those who don't believe in ghosts have never been in court, where legal claims are regularly seen rising from the grave," Rakoff wrote on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;Give me your smart, your educated, your startup founders yearning to build companies?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As research indicates that the U.S. is an increasingly difficult place for foreign founders to come and build companies and founders tell horror stories of the massive challenges they faced dealing with byzantine U.S. immigration policies, Canada is burnishing its reputation as open for business &#8212; and open for new residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s new startup visa has received a huge amount of attention in the U.S. as the the global war for talent heats up. Senators such as Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) have tried to address the situation via legislation like the Startup Act 3.0, but that&#8217;s a slim hope after deaths of 1.0 and 2.0.&lt;/p&gt; Source: Wikipedia&lt;p&gt;Jason Kenney, Canadian Minister of Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Startup Visa provides immediate permanent residency in Canada if a founder meets just three criteria. An applicant must:&lt;/p&gt;  Secure an investment from a designated Canadian VC or fund Demonstrate English language proficiency Have at least one year of postsecondary education &lt;p&gt;This weekend, Canadian member of parliament and Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism Minister Jason Kenney is in Silicon Valley promoting his country&#8217;s Startup Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We chatted with Kenney about the visa&#8217;s goals, his intentions, and the U.S. immigration system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: What&#8217;s the ultimate goal of the Startup Visa?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Kenney: We&#160;want a pathway for the world&#8217;s best and brightest to come to Canada and to harness that&#160;drive and innovation to be at the cutting edge of the modern economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: Why are you coming to Silicon Valley right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney: The U.S. immigration system is dysfunctional, and it&#8217;s&#160;really difficult for talented immigrants to stay in the U.S. permanently.&#160;I&#8217;m coming to further raise the profile of the program and send the message that&#160;Canada&#8217;s open for business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#8217;re a young startup entrepreneur having trouble renewing your visa, come here!&#160;We offer&#160;immediate permanent residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: What&#8217;s the response been so far?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney: There&#8217;s been a&#160;great amount of interest, but we&#160;only opened for applications on April 4, so it&#8217;s&#160;too early to tell.&#160;We will issue up to 2,500 per year, but&#160;I don&#8217;t anticipate it will be fully subscribed for the first year because it&#8217;s still new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know there&#8217;s a huge pent-up demand in the U.S., and&#160;I think the word is going to spread virally:&#160;If you want to stay permanently in NA, think of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: You&#8217;re offering permanent residency to anyone in who secures an investment. What about those who fail?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney: Many countries, such as&#160;Australia, only offer temporary resident status.&#160;In Canada, we&#8217;re going to give you the &#8220;green card&#8221; right up front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know full well the rate of failure in startups is high,&#160;but if they come up here and don&#8217;t succeed, they have demonstrated they they have high human capital. And&#160;in the long run, their chances of succeeding and building a successful enterprise are high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want Canada to become a magnet for people like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: Why is Canada a good place to come build a startup?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney: We have really&#160;strong tech sectors in Kitchener/Waterloo, Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and a few other places, an&#160;increasingly strong venture capital industry, and very well-run industry associations,&#160;angel associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, we have the&#160;lowest business taxes in the developed world, and the&#160;strongest fiscal position in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of macro-economic terms, that&#8217;s important &#8230; Canada weathered the storm of the economic downturn better than any other country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have&#160;an immigration system that works, which means you have access to global talent &#8230; and&#160;human capital is even more important than financial capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat: Any other message for Silicon Valley?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney: While here&#160;we&#8217;ll be meeting with the CEOs of many major IT companies just to emphasize what a great place Canada is to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we&#8217;re really going to kick this into hyperdrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;photo credit: PhOtOnQuAnTiQuE via photopin cc&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Entrepreneur&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms All Classes of JPMCCM 2004-C3
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 19 classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. commercial mortgage pass-through certificates 
      series 2004-C3 (JPMCCM 2004-C3). A detailed list of rating actions 
      follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 8.9% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 7.8%, including losses already incurred. 
      The pool has experienced $30.8 million (2% of the original pool balance) 
      in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 34 loans (37.7%) as 
      Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes four specially serviced assets 
      (7.1%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the April 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 34.9% to $988.2 million from $1.52 billion 
      at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, 14 loans (15.9% of the pool) 
      are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes H 
      through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to modeled losses is a real estate owned (REO) 
      portfolio, the Everest Portfolio, (5.6% of the pool), which now consists 
      of six industrial/office buildings located in the greater Boston 
      metropolitan statistical area. The loan went into maturity default in 
      January 2010, and the trust took title to the original eight building 
      portfolio in 2012. Two buildings were sold in the first quarter of 2013 
      with proceeds applied towards the debt. The remaining six properties are 
      expected to be listed for sale this quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to expected losses is the Crossroads 
      Shopping Center loan (6%), which is secured by a 310,000 square foot 
      (sf) anchored retail center located in White Plains, NY. As of the March 
      2013 rent roll, occupancy at the property was approximately 77% compared 
      with 82% in March 2012. Property performance significantly declined when 
      bankrupt AP Supermarket (12% of the NRA) vacated its space in 2011. An 
      additional 13% of the space rolls over the next 12 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the Lakeshore Club 
      Apartments loan (2.7%), which is secured by a 650 unit multifamily 
      property located in Tampa, FL. As of January 2013, the servicer reported 
      occupancy was 94%. The loan was returned to the master servicer from 
      special servicing in December 2012 after a loan modification. The loan 
      is now interest only through the remaining term, which was extended to 
      November 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings of classes A through D are expected to remain stable. The 
      ratings on classes E and F could be subject to further downgrades should 
      realized losses be greater than Fitch expectations. The distressed 
      classes (those rated below 'B') are expected to be subject to further 
      downgrades as losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes and revises Outlooks as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$116.7 million class A-1A at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;

    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$19 million class G at 'CCCsf', RE 25%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$15.2 million class H at 'CCCsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$20.9 million class J at 'CCsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$7.6 million class K at 'Csf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.7 million class L at 'Csf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$9.5 million class M at 'Csf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$3.8 million class N at 'Csf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.8 million class P at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class Q at 'Dsf', RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-1 and A-2 certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not 
      rate the class NR certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the ratings on 
      the interest-only class X-1 and X-2 certificates.

      The Notes are subject to a maximum issuance limitation of 129,000,000 
      Notes, which may cause the Notes to trade at a premium relative to the 
      indicative note value. Investors that pay a premium for the Notes could 
      incur significant losses if that investor sells its notes at a time when 
      some or all of the premium is no longer present.

			Clear Creek Independent School District Launches Personalized 
      Learning Initiative with Dell, Microsoft and Intel
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Clear Creek ISD chooses Dell Windows 8 Latitude 10 tablets to support 
        30,000 students, teachers and administrators
      
			
        Dell, Microsoft and Intel to deliver professional learning services to 
        integrate technology into curriculum
      
			
        Dell Latitude 10 student, teacher, administrator and CCISD community 
        tested and approved
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Dell announced today that Clear 
      Creek Independent School District (CCISD) in Texas will deploy 
      30,000 Dell 
      Latitude 10 tablets running Microsoft 
      Windows 8 throughout its 43 schools in a program they call Latitude 
      to Learn to help personalize 
      learning. The tablets will be used by students, teachers and 
      administrators and will be integrated into the district&#8217;s curriculum 
      through professional learning services provided by Dell, Microsoft and 
      Intel. CCISD evaluated Dell and Apple devices for their new one-to-one 
      device deployment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The first building block to personalized learning is access to 
      technology and the Internet,&#8221; said Kevin Schwartz, Chief Technology 
      Officer, Clear Creek Independent School District. &#8220;You can get access 
      with most any tablet, but to fully deliver personalized learning 
      requires a device that works seamlessly with all systems. The Dell 
      Latitude 10 provides all of those features at a price that allows us to 
      extend the initiative to more students.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The decision was made with feedback from teachers, administrators and 
      students. Students&#8217; feedback included that Dell was a better choice for 
      preparing them for college and career. The Dell 
      Latitude 10 also enables students to produce content as readily as 
      they consume it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Every student today feels the polarization of traditional education and 
      the real world,&#8221; said Andrew Barrett, Clear Brook High School student. 
      &#8220;The average classroom experience often lacks relevancy. This initiative 
      is by far the most influential move yet in bridging the widening gap 
      between academia's demands and a student's life.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For administrators, the Dell Latitude 10 tablet will help them 
      streamline and easily manage the devices in an existing Windows 
      environment to help save budget and time. Teachers will take advantage 
      of professional learning to best integrate the technology into their 
      curriculum.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Having Microsoft Office on these tablets is the perfect blend of 
      something teachers already know with a new opportunity for anytime, 
      anywhere access,&#8221; said Kelly Lane, Technology Integration Specialist. 
      &#8220;It makes for a natural progression. Now, we can focus on the 
      integration and learning, rather than the workarounds.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Microsoft 
      Shape the Future program allowed CCISD to purchase the devices at a 
      discounted rate. Teachers will also be equipped with tools and resources 
      to help them integrate technology into their curriculum. As part of its Partners 
      in Learning Program, Microsoft will provide 10 days of professional 
      development training so teachers can learn more about the newest 
      software and how Windows 8 can extend learning times, inspire students 
      to build real-world skills and improve educational outcomes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Preferred by educators, 
      the Dell Latitude 10 is steadily deployed by schools around the world 
      because of its affordability, accessibility, manageability and 
      personalized learning features. Windows 8 is Microsoft&#8217;s new operating 
      system helping schools modernize by providing tools for better creation, 
      consumption and collaboration to meet new education standards and the 
      move to digital learning. According to a Harris 
      Interactive online survey commissioned by Dell and Intel, 59 percent 
      of school system IT decision makers and administrators say choosing 
      devices that integrate with their existing IT infrastructure and that 
      can be managed by existing tools is the best way to minimize total cost 
      of ownership for tablets. The Dell Latitude 10 essentials configuration 
      has been proven in a study by Principled 
      Technologies to require 52 percent less time to manage and doubles 
      the number of devices a single IT staff member can manage.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is set to make a splash this week with the eagerly awaited unveiling of its new Xbox game console, eight years after the last version, as it seeks a larger share of the $65 billion a year global computer gaming industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the small device faces some big competition from the PlayStation 4 by Sony Corp and the Wii U by Nintendo Co Ltd in a shifting market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gamers are gravitating to online play - suggesting the hey-day of console games are over - while Microsoft wants its sleek new toy to finally cross the bridge to the mainstream and become the family's entertainment center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Core gamers are very hungry for a new machine but the difference between 2005 and now is that the stakes are so much higher," said Ryan McCaffrey, executive editor at entertainment website IGN.com, harking back to Microsoft's last Xbox release. "The entire Xbox experiment from Microsoft was for it to be the center piece of your living room."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, industry-watchers are expecting a raft of improvements from the new Xbox, when Microsoft unveils it at its Redmond, Washington, headquarters on Tuesday, from closer integration with the TV and link-ups with mobile devices to access to new and even exclusive content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Console gaming still takes the lion's share of a growing gaming market - about 42 percent of the $65 billion world market, according to Microsoft. But playing games on smartphones and tablets, or as an offshoot to online social networks, is gaining ground fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Console sales have been in decline for the last four years, chiefly because of aging devices, but the first of the new generation of machines has not reignited the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo's Wii U, launched in November, had sold only 3.45 million units through the end of March, well below the company's initial forecast of 5.5 million. Hopes for Sony's PS4, teased in March, are low key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next wave crest isn't as high as the previous one," said Lewis Ward, research manager at International Data Corp, who calculates that about 250 million Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii units were sold between 2005 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think that consoles as a product category have peaked and the next gen devices won't match those totals," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOW MARGINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox itself is not a key financial factor for the world's largest software maker. Its Entertainment &amp; Devices unit is set to break $10 billion in sales for the first time this year, but that's half the sales of its Windows unit, and a lot less profitable, averaging less than 15 percent margin compared to 60 percent or higher for Windows or Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has more than 46 million members who subscribe to its online gaming and digital entertainment service Xbox Live, but that's still a fraction of the people who pay for its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Xbox is still a key weapon in Microsoft's strategic battle with Google Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and others for a central place in consumers' lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This (the new Xbox) is of massive importance to Microsoft. It is a piece of a larger war for the consumer that it is battling. They want to be fully integrated with the consumer whether it's in the living room or mobile," said P.J. McNealy, CEO and founder of Digital World Research. "Arguably the battle against both Apple and Google for dominating a consumer's time share more so than taking on Sony and Nintendo directly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means Microsoft will be aiming for many markets at the same time, from the core and casual gamer to the TV watcher and music fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do that, industry watchers expect Microsoft to integrate the new Xbox much more closely to the TV and cable or satellite box, perhaps allowing users to change channel or buy movies with a wave of the hand through its motion-control Kinect sensor. They also expect to hear more about SmartGlass, Microsoft's app that lets you link an Xbox to a tablet or smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can already get Netflix through the Xbox, and Microsoft recently started its own studio to produce exclusive content, meaning the new device is a gateway to much more than games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they're going to try to have their cake and eat it too - they will try to get casual people for entertainment while keeping the hardcore gamers interested," said McCaffrey at IGN.com. "They want their console on all the time, whether it's a mom watching Amazon video, the son playing a game and the dad watching (Major League Baseball) TV on another app - that's their goal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Edwin Chan; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

to start down from a 3-1/2-month high on Tuesday, with
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China sliding 1.8
percent after Goldman Sachs launched a sale of their remaining
stake in the leading Chinese lender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), under pressure from New York officials, gave shareholders information about an upcoming vote that would increase oversight of Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. But the ballot details may have come too late for some investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank's annual meeting is on Tuesday and by far the most controversial matter up for vote is whether Dimon should retain his chairman title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the company that collects votes from investors, Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc (BR.N), stopped telling shareholders how votes had been cast so far for this and other measures up for vote at the annual meeting.

&lt;p&gt;By Karen Freifeld and David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, under
pressure from New York officials, gave shareholders information
about an upcoming vote that would increase oversight of Chairman
and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. But the ballot details may have
come too late for some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's annual meeting is on Tuesday and by far the most
controversial matter up for vote is whether Dimon should retain
his chairman title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the company that collects votes from investors,
Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc, stopped telling
shareholders how votes had been cast so far for this and other
measures up for vote at the annual meeting. It was not clear why
Broadridge stopped giving out the information. Investors that
are lobbying other shareholders on proxy proposals use daily
vote tallies to determine how to tailor their campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a source familiar with the situation, New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office sent a letter late
Friday to the bank's general counsel, Stephen Cutler, raising
concerns about the cutting off of ballot information to
shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff from Schneiderman's office held two conference calls
with JPMorgan on Saturday, and the bank agreed to tell
Broadridge to provide interim results to investors, the source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadridge, however, balked at providing the information,
because it was not sure it had the legal authority to do so, the
source said. But JPMorgan agreed to give the information

Investment Group, which advises pensions that were voting
against the bank in separate measures regarding the re-election
of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were cut off from the tallies during the crucial week
leading up to the meeting," Waizenegger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for the New York Attorney
General's office, said: "We appreciate that JPMorgan Chase was
responsive to our concerns and has changed course on a decision
that Attorney General Schneiderman believes was ill-advised
under the circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadridge said on Monday that it follows U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission regulations, and there are no rules
requiring that voting information be provided to proponents of
proxy measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given concerns raised by multiple broker clients regarding
the release of this voting, we have stopped releasing voting
information to proponents," it said.&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer to Continue Evaluation of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin in Other 
      Hematologic Malignancies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today the discontinuation of a Phase 3 randomized, 
      open-label, two-arm study (B1931008) evaluating the safety and efficacy 
      of the investigational compound inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with 
      relapsed or refractory CD22+ aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who 
      are not candidates for intensive high-dose chemotherapy. In this study, 
      inotuzumab ozogamicin was administered on a once-a-month schedule in 
      combination with rituximab and compared with an active comparator arm 
      (investigator's choice of bendamustine plus rituximab or gemcitabine 
      plus rituximab). During a scheduled interim analysis, an independent 
      Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) concluded that in this study treatment 
      with inotuzumab ozogamicin plus rituximab would not meet the primary 
      objective of improving overall survival (OS) when compared to the 
      comparator arm. No new or unexpected safety issues were identified.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are working to better understand the findings from this review to 
      determine if there are any patterns of outcome that may help us gain 
      greater understanding of the potential effect of inotuzumab ozogamicin 
      in specific patient subsets within the heterogeneous patient population 
      enrolled in this trial,&#8221; said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president 
      of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer&#8217;s Oncology 
      Business Unit. &#8220;Hematologic cancers are a complex group of diseases, 
      with more than 70 different types of lymphomas, leukemias or myelomas 
      that require unique treatment options. We remain committed to evaluating 
      inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with hematologic malignancies.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has notified the study investigators and appropriate regulatory 
      authorities of the decision to discontinue the study. Investigators will 
      work with patients in the study on an individual basis to determine an 
      appropriate course of action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Inotuzumab ozogamicin, administered on a weekly basis, 3 weeks out of 4, 
      continues to be evaluated in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 
      The INO-VATE ALL Study (B1931022) is an open-label, randomized, Phase 3 
      study of inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to a defined investigator&#8217;s 
      choice of chemotherapy in adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
      CD22+ ALL.

			About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is one of the most commonly occurring 
      hematologic cancers among adults.1 In 2008, there were 
      approximately 355,900 new cases of NHL worldwide, and approximately 
      191,400 related deaths.2 Indolent lymphomas, such as 
      follicular lymphoma, show a high level of relapse, as treatment with 
      chemotherapy alone has not yet resulted in an improvement in OS.3 
      Similarly, in aggressive disease, standard of care treatment achieves 
      long-term remission in less than half of NHL cases, demonstrating an 
      unmet need for both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients.4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the four main types of 
      leukemia. ALL is an aggressive type of leukemia; without treatment, most 
      patients with acute leukemia would live only a few months.5 
      Of the estimated 48,610 new cases of all kinds of leukemia that will be 
      diagnosed in the U.S. in 2013,6 about 6,070 cases will be 
      diagnosed as ALL, of which about one out of three cases are in adults.5 
      The five-year relative survival rate of ALL overall (including adults 
      and children) for 2003 &#8211; 2009 was approximately 66 percent.7 
      Survival rates in adults only are less favorable, with a five-year 
      survival rate of less than 10 percent in this patient population.8
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Inotuzumab Ozogamicin
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate 
      (ADC) comprised of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting CD22,9 
      a cell surface antigen expressed on approximately 90 percent of B-cell 
      malignancies,10 linked to a cytotoxic agent. When inotuzumab 
      ozogamicin binds to the CD22 antigen on malignant B-cells, it is 
      internalized into the cell, where the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin is 
      released to destroy the cell.11
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Inotuzumab ozogamicin originates from a collaboration between Pfizer and 
      Celltech, now UCB. Pfizer has responsibility for all manufacturing and 
      development activities for this molecule.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) launched the sale of about $1.1 billion worth of Hong Kong-traded shares in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK) on Monday, offering its entire remaining stake in the world's biggest bank by market value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale would be the final chapter in Goldman's investment alongside clients and employees in China's ICBC. Prior to its 2006 initial public offering, ICBC was a technically insolvent state institution, reeling from the bad loans that had saddled China's financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBC's fortunes turned after it went public, and the bank grew along with China's economic boom. The bank's $240 billion market value is just shy of the combined worth of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and Barclays (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman offered the ICBC shares in a range of HK$5.47 to HK$5.50, equivalent to a discount of up to 3 percent to Monday's close of HK$5.64, according to a term sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman agreed to invest $2.58 billion in ICBC in January 2006, using internal funds that invest a mix of client, employee and corporate cash. The bank has sold down that stake through six deals since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Goldman is able to sell its final stake for $1.1 billion, total gross proceeds from the sales would be $10.1 billion. Calculating Goldman's own profit on the stake is tricky because not all of the investment came from its own balance sheet, and the cost of acquiring and maintaining the ICBC stake is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, Goldman has reported $3.5 billion in net revenue related to ICBC in quarterly filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale would be Goldman's third in about a year. The New York-based investment bank raised $2.5 billion from a partial selldown of ICBC in April 2012, most of which was bought by Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings Ltd TEM.UL, and another in January 2013 worth $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Fiona Lau of IFR and Elzio Barreto in Hong Kong; Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Miral Fahmy, Michael Flaherty and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By David Randall
    NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co 
shareholders will decide Tuesday whether Jamie Dimon should be
both chairman and chief executive, and investors in funds with
large stakes in the bank have a lot riding on the outcome.
    Supporters of the motion to strip Dimon of the chairmanship
say it would improve management oversight and reduce the chances
of debacles such as the $6.2 billion in losses the bank incurred
in last year's so-called "London Whale" derivatives trades. The
bank will announce the results of a non-binding vote on May 21. 
    There is concern that the strong-willed Dimon, one of the
most dynamic leaders in the financial industry, may decide to
leave JP Morgan should the vote go against him. That in turn
could hammer the shares and hurt the performances of funds with
5 percent or more of their assets invested in the bank. A
victory by Dimon, who is expected to prevail, may not affect the
shares significantly, analysts said. 
    Investors in the following funds may want to pay extra
attention. These 10 funds have the largest percentage of their
assets in JP Morgan shares, according to Lipper data. Of course,
many are funds that focus solely on the financial sector. But
investors in some diversified funds may be surprised at their
stake in the company.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Fiona Lau and Elzio Barreto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG May 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
launched the sale of about $1.1 billion worth of Hong
Kong-traded shares in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
 on Monday, offering its entire remaining stake in the
world's biggest bank by market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale would be the final chapter in Goldman's investment
alongside clients and employees in China's ICBC. Prior to its
2006 initial public offering, ICBC was a technically insolvent
state institution, reeling from the bad loans that had saddled
China's financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBC's fortunes turned after it went public, and the bank
grew along with China's economic boom. The bank's $240 billion
market value is just shy of the combined worth of J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co and Barclays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman offered the ICBC shares in a range of HK$5.47 to
HK$5.50, equivalent to a discount of up to 3 percent to Monday's
close of HK$5.64, according to a term sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman agreed to invest $2.58 billion in ICBC in January
2006, using internal funds that invest a mix of client, employee
and corporate cash. The bank has sold down that stake through
six deals since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Goldman is able to sell its final stake for $1.1 billion,
total gross proceeds from the sales would be $10.1 billion.
Calculating Goldman's own profit on the stake is tricky because
not all of the investment came from its own balance sheet, and
the cost of acquiring and maintaining the ICBC stake is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, Goldman has reported $3.5 billion in net revenue
related to ICBC in quarterly filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale would be Goldman's third in about a year. The New
York-based investment bank raised $2.5 billion from a partial
selldown of ICBC in April 2012, most of which was bought by
Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings Ltd, and
another in January 2013 worth $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS, May 20, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Despite rising interest in real world outcomes, a recent study performed by Context Matters and Pfizer demonstrates that less than ten percent of diabetes clinical trials conducted in the past decade included patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as part of their protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Presented today at the 18th Annual International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) conference in New Orleans, the study analyzed nearly 650 Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 diabetes clinical trials from the clinicaltrials.gov database. Among these trials, only 7.4 percent (47 trials) included PROs as part of their assessment protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"One of the current trends in the pharmaceutical industry is to track real world outcomes. However, in the area of diabetes, one of the most prevalent diseases in the United States, patient-reported outcomes, which are a commonly used real world assessment tool, were included in less than ten percent of clinical trial protocols since the year 2000," said Ashley Jaksa, MPH, director of data and analytics at Context Matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The study concluded that the development of a standardized clinical trial-specific tool that helps measure patient-reported outcomes might lead to wider incorporation of PROs in clinical trial protocols, in line with the interest in real world outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Working with Context Matters has been a very valuable experience. In the past, it was difficult and time-consuming to collect this information, but their data curation procedures and analytics platform has allowed us to gain a quick, clear understanding of the use of PROs in diabetes clinical trials in the past decade, " Alexandra Barsdorf, associate director, PRO Centre of Excellence, Global Market Access, PCBU, Pfizer, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SAN ANTONIO - May 20, 2013 - Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP) ("TLLP" or the "Partnership") today announced that it has amended the purchase agreement for the acquisition of Chevron Pipe Line Company's Northwest Products System ("Northwest Products System"), reducing the purchase price from $400 million to $355 million. &#160;The lower purchase price reflects a renegotiation as a result of the diesel fuel release that occurred near Willard, Utah on March 18, 2013. &#160;Chevron Pipe Line Company will retain liabilities and responsibility for remediation of the diesel fuel release site for a period of two years. &#160; &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"As we enter into the final stages of the regulatory approval process on the Northwest Products System acquisition, we look forward to the successful integration of these assets within our system," said Greg Goff, TLLP's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. &#160;"Closing this transaction will allow us to add to our portfolio of well positioned, fee-based logistics assets while significantly increasing third-party revenue. &#160;We&#160;expect to invest $15 million to $25 million over the next two years to implement a detailed inspection program to further improve the integrity of the pipeline system." &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Partnership expects to utilize net proceeds from the $392 million equity offering on January 14, 2013 to fund the acquisition of the Northwest Products System. &#160;Estimated EBITDA from the Northwest Products System for the first twelve months is $30 million to $35 million. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Northwest Products System consists of the Northwest Product Pipeline, a 760-mile Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-regulated common carrier products pipeline which extends from Salt Lake City, Utah to Spokane, Washington, a five-mile jet fuel pipeline to the Salt Lake City International Airport and the Northwest Terminalling Company, consisting of refined products terminals in Boise and Pocatello, Idaho and Pasco, Washington, which are not subject to FERC regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The common carrier pipeline is the primary source of refined products to southern Idaho and is a major supplier of refined products to eastern Washington. &#160;For 2012, throughput volumes on the pipeline system averaged approximately 87,000 barrels per day. &#160;The terminals have a total storage capacity of 1.3 million barrels and delivered an average of approximately 56,000 barrels per day. &lt;/p&gt;

			About the Arcelis&#8482; Technology Platform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Arcelis is a fully personalized, active immunotherapy technology that captures all antigens, including mutated and variant antigens that are specific to each patient's disease. It has been shown to overcome immunosuppression by producing a durable memory T-cell response without adjuvants that are associated with toxicity. The technology can be leveraged to manufacture personalized therapies for any cancer or infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Arcelis process integrates readily into many current treatment paradigms, using only a small tumor or blood sample and the patient's own dendritic cells, which are derived and optimized following a single leukapheresis procedure. The proprietary process uses RNA isolated from the patient sample to program the dendritic cells to target the entire disease-antigen repertoire. The activated, antigen-loaded dendritic cells are then formulated into the patient's plasma and administered as an intradermal injection to produce the desired patient-specific immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Arcelis technology also overcomes many of the manufacturing and commercialization challenges that have impeded other personalized cancer immunotherapies. Automated processes allow a single facility to serve all of North America and can be used to treat any cancer or infectious disease with the same manufacturing process and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is set to make a splash this week with the eagerly awaited unveiling of its new Xbox game console, eight years after the last version, as it seeks a larger share of the $65 billion a year global computer gaming industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the small device faces some big competition from the PlayStation 4 by Sony Corp and the Wii U by Nintendo Co Ltd in a shifting market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gamers are gravitating to online play - suggesting the hey-day of console games are over - while Microsoft wants its sleek new toy to finally cross the bridge to the mainstream and become the family's entertainment center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Core gamers are very hungry for a new machine but the difference between 2005 and now is that the stakes are so much higher," said Ryan McCaffrey, executive editor at entertainment website IGN.com, harking back to Microsoft's last Xbox release. "The entire Xbox experiment from Microsoft was for it to be the center piece of your living room."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, industry-watchers are expecting a raft of improvements from the new Xbox, when Microsoft unveils it at its Redmond, Washington, headquarters on Tuesday, from closer integration with the TV and link-ups with mobile devices to access to new and even exclusive content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Console gaming still takes the lion's share of a growing gaming market - about 42 percent of the $65 billion world market, according to Microsoft. But playing games on smartphones and tablets, or as an offshoot to online social networks, is gaining ground fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Console sales have been in decline for the last four years, chiefly because of aging devices, but the first of the new generation of machines has not reignited the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo's Wii U, launched in November, had sold only 3.45 million units through the end of March, well below the company's initial forecast of 5.5 million. Hopes for Sony's PS4, teased in March, are low key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next wave crest isn't as high as the previous one," said Lewis Ward, research manager at International Data Corp, who calculates that about 250 million Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii units were sold between 2005 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think that consoles as a product category have peaked and the next gen devices won't match those totals," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOW MARGINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox itself is not a key financial factor for the world's largest software maker. Its Entertainment &amp; Devices unit is set to break $10 billion in sales for the first time this year, but that's half the sales of its Windows unit, and a lot less profitable, averaging less than 15 percent margin compared to 60 percent or higher for Windows or Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has more than 46 million members who subscribe to its online gaming and digital entertainment service Xbox Live, but that's still a fraction of the people who pay for its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Xbox is still a key weapon in Microsoft's strategic battle with Google Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and others for a central place in consumers' lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This (the new Xbox) is of massive importance to Microsoft. It is a piece of a larger war for the consumer that it is battling. They want to be fully integrated with the consumer whether it's in the living room or mobile," said P.J. McNealy, CEO and founder of Digital World Research. "Arguably the battle against both Apple and Google for dominating a consumer's time share more so than taking on Sony and Nintendo directly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means Microsoft will be aiming for many markets at the same time, from the core and casual gamer to the TV watcher and music fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do that, industry watchers expect Microsoft to integrate the new Xbox much more closely to the TV and cable or satellite box, perhaps allowing users to change channel or buy movies with a wave of the hand through its motion-control Kinect sensor. They also expect to hear more about SmartGlass, Microsoft's app that lets you link an Xbox to a tablet or smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can already get Netflix through the Xbox, and Microsoft recently started its own studio to produce exclusive content, meaning the new device is a gateway to much more than games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they're going to try to have their cake and eat it too - they will try to get casual people for entertainment while keeping the hardcore gamers interested," said McCaffrey at IGN.com. "They want their console on all the time, whether it's a mom watching Amazon video, the son playing a game and the dad watching (Major League Baseball) TV on another app - that's their goal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Edwin Chan; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

consumers' lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This (the new Xbox) is of massive importance to Microsoft.
It is a piece of a larger war for the consumer that it is
battling. They want to be fully integrated with the consumer
whether it's in the living room or mobile," said P.J. McNealy,
CEO and founder of Digital World Research. "Arguably the battle
against both Apple and Google for dominating a consumer's time
share more so than taking on Sony and Nintendo directly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means Microsoft will be aiming for many markets at the
same time, from the core and casual gamer to the TV watcher and
music fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do that, industry watchers expect Microsoft to integrate
the new Xbox much more closely to the TV and cable or satellite
box, perhaps allowing users to change channel or buy movies with
a wave of the hand through its motion-control Kinect sensor.
They also expect to hear more about SmartGlass, Microsoft's app
that lets you link an Xbox to a tablet or smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can already get Netflix through the Xbox, and
Microsoft recently started its own studio to produce exclusive
content, meaning the new device is a gateway to much more than
games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they're going to try to have their cake and eat it
too - they will try to get casual people for entertainment while
keeping the hardcore gamers interested," said McCaffrey at
IGN.com. "They want their console on all the time, whether it's
a mom watching Amazon video, the son playing a game and the dad
watching (Major League Baseball) TV on another app - that's
their goal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG May 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs launched
on Monday a sale of about $1.1 billion worth of Hong Kong-traded
shares in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China,
offering to sell its entire remaining stake in the world's
biggest bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman offered the shares in ICBC in a range of HK$5.47 to
HK$5.50, equivalent to a discount of up to 3 percent to Monday's
close of HK$5.64, IFR reported, citing a term sheet of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monday sale will mark the end of an era for the U.S.
bank, which has held a stake in ICBC since 2006, said a source
with direct knowledge of the selldown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale would be Goldman's third in about one year, after
the New York-based investment bank raised $2.5 billion from a
partial selldown of ICBC in April of 2012, most of which was
bought by Singapore state investor Temasek, and another
in January of 2013 worth $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 21 (Reuters) - Merck &amp; Co Inc said it has
entered into a $5 billion share repurchase agreement with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc, as the drug giant looks to prop
up shareholder value in face of stiff competition from makers of
less-costly generics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR),
Merck has agreed to repurchase about 99.5 million shares from
Goldman Sachs based on current market prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have consensus share count post-Q1 earnings to
quantify the impact of the accelerated repurchase, but we
believe this is a positive sign of Merck attempting to create
shareholder value," ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a
note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck's board had authorized additional purchases of up to
$15 billion of its common stock and said that it would buy back
about $7.5 billion over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Merck's asthma drug Singulair plunged 75 percent to
$337 million in the first quarter. The pill was Merck's biggest
product, with annual sales of $6 billion, before cheaper
generics flooded the U.S. market last August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More pain from generics is in store. Merck's Maxalt migraine
drug recently lost patent protection and its Temodar brain
cancer medicine will soon face cheaper copycats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck aims to seek marketing approval this year for a
handful of new drugs, including a sleep aid called suvorexant
now before U.S. regulators. It is counting on these products to
help offset plunging sales of Singulair, Maxalt and Temodar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Florida (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co took an unusual step to fight off investors seeking more oversight of his activities - he hinted he might quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it worked. At the bank's annual meeting on Tuesday, JPMorgan shareholders voted down a proposal to strip Dimon of his chairmanship, giving the measure even less support than last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors showed some unhappiness with the bank's management by only barely re-electing three directors who oversaw a massive trading loss last year. But on the whole, the day was seen as a victory for management, which successfully navigated JPMorgan through the financial crisis, but has suffered some high-profile problems recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People were worried Dimon was going to walk," said Leon Kamhi, executive director of Hermes Equity Ownership Services, one of the sponsors of the shareholder proposal to split the roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert McCormick, chief policy officer for proxy adviser Glass Lewis &amp; Co, added: "It's rare that companies play that card."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, the two biggest firms that advise investors on how to vote in proxies, both recommended that shareholders vote in favor of taking the chairman title away from Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results highlight how difficult it can be for investors to fight management in proxy votes. Some shareholders thought they had a good chance of winning on the question of Dimon's chairmanship after the bank suffered $6.2 billion in losses last year from bad credit bets known as the "London whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan fought hard. The bank's directors spoke to about a dozen major investors during their campaign. The shareholder proposal was non-binding - the board only had to consider it not enact it - but losing would have been a black eye for Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message from the board, investors said, was that Dimon might leave if he were not chairman and that JPMorgan generated record profits last year, despite losing $6.2 billion from "London whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank reached out to critics as part of its campaign as well. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, one of the investors that sponsored the proposal, said lead director Lee Raymond and director William Weldon sat down with it in early May. Board members had not previously met with AFSCME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company pulled out all the stops," said Lisa Lindsley, director of capital strategies for AFSCME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investor holding several million JPMorgan shares who declined to be named said the bank also reached out to portfolio managers with warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investor said the bank "made sure investors were reminded of all the upside and all the potential downside" that could follow the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle at times turned bitter, as when shareholders found themselves cut off from information about how the vote was progressing in the days before the election. The New York Attorney General ended up pressing JPMorgan to give investors the ballot counts [ID:nL2N0E124X] and shareholders are likely to continue to push for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIGGER MARGIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the battle's high profile worked in Dimon's favor. At one large JPMorgan shareholder, an executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said it switched sides this year and voted against the measure to split the dual roles after supporting a similar measure last year when there was less attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the executive said: "The issue became a referendum on Jamie Dimon and, in our view, JPMorgman shareholders are best served by having Jamie Dimon run that company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive added that "it would have been a disaster for the company" if Dimon left because the vote had not gone his way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan won the vote on Tuesday by a greater margin than last year, when shareholders put up a similar proposal. About 68 percent of investors voted to keep Dimon as chairman and CEO, compared with about 60 percent last year. However, three JPMorgan directors who served on the board's risk committee during the London whale imbroglio last year were re-elected by an unusually slim majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond, a former ExxonMobil Corp CEO, told shareholders before the tally was announced that the London Whale episode was not a reason to split the CEO and chairman roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just the opposite," he said during a question-and-answer session at the meeting. "We don't think this is time for disruption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond, viewed as a counterweight to Dimon on the board, said changes were afoot for the board's risk committee, but he did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon smiled as he left the meeting in Tampa and the bank's shares rose 1.4 percent to close at $53.02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors wondered if the publicity around the vote resulted in fewer investors listening to ISS and Glass Lewis, and more doing their own homework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm guessing that because it was more visible this year than last year, the investment committees of stockholders were probably more thoughtful about it," Jordan Posner, managing director of Matrix Asset Advisors Inc, a New York money manager with about 619,000 JPMorgan shares. Posner said his firm voted against the split proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GETTING CREDIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among big-bank CEOs, Dimon ranks first for stock returns, and for delivering a strong balance sheet with no quarterly losses at a time when other global banks were reeling. But some investors feared the bank's trading losses last year and tussles with regulators signaled Dimon could use more oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the vote, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services issued reports critical of the board, particularly the members of the risk committee, whose experience they found wanting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the London Whale losses, the committee was made up of James Crown, president of a large family investment company; David Cote, the CEO of Honeywell International Inc; and Ellen Futter, who heads the American Museum of Natural History in New York. All three remain on the panel, augmented by a new fourth member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futter, who won only a 53.1 percent approval from shareholders, did not attend the meeting. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Tuesday that Futter would likely resign from the board if she won only a slim majority of the votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a huge repudiation of them as directors," Glass Lewis's McCormick said. "That's a strong signal that shareholders are unhappy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crown received 57.4 percent approval, preliminarily, and Cote received 59.3 percent. Apart from the three singled out by ISS and Glass Lewis, directors received at least 90 percent approval votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Simpson, director for corporate governance at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns JPMorgan shares, said the vote had set a "high watermark."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal here is to get the board strengthened, stiffen its backbone and to get people with the experience that is needed to oversee Mr Dimon," Simpson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Nadia Damouni in New York and Ross Kerber in Boston; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Jeffrey Benkoe, Gary Hill and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

trading loss last year. But on the whole, the day was seen as a
victory for management, which successfully navigated JPMorgan
through the financial crisis, but has suffered some high-profile
problems recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People were worried Dimon was going to walk," said Leon
Kamhi, executive director of Hermes Equity Ownership Services,
one of the sponsors of the shareholder proposal to split the
roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert McCormick, chief policy officer for proxy adviser
Glass Lewis &amp; Co, added: "It's rare that companies play that
card."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, the two
biggest firms that advise investors on how to vote in proxies,
both recommended that shareholders vote in favor of taking the
chairman title away from Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results highlight how difficult it can be for investors
to fight management in proxy votes. Some shareholders thought
they had a good chance of winning on the question of Dimon's
chairmanship after the bank suffered $6.2 billion in losses last
year from bad credit bets known as the "London whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan fought hard. The bank's directors spoke to
about a dozen major investors during their campaign. The
shareholder proposal was non-binding - the board only had to
consider it not enact it - but losing would have been a black
eye for Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message from the board, investors said, was that Dimon
might leave if he were not chairman and that JPMorgan generated
record profits last year, despite losing $6.2 billion from
"London whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank reached out to critics as part of its campaign as
well. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, one of the investors that sponsored the proposal,
said lead director Lee Raymond and director William Weldon sat
down with it in early May. Board members had not previously met
with AFSCME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company pulled out all the stops," said Lisa Lindsley,
director of capital strategies for AFSCME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investor holding several million JPMorgan shares who
declined to be named said the bank also reached out to portfolio
managers with warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investor said the bank "made sure investors were
reminded of all the upside and all the potential downside" that
could follow the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle at times turned bitter, as when shareholders
found themselves cut off from information about how the vote was
progressing in the days before the election. The New York
Attorney General ended up pressing JPMorgan to give investors
the ballot counts and shareholders are likely to
continue to push for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIGGER MARGIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the battle's high profile worked in Dimon's
favor. At one large JPMorgan shareholder, an executive who spoke
on condition of anonymity said it switched sides this year and
voted against the measure to split the dual roles after
supporting a similar measure last year when there was less
attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the executive said: "The issue became a
referendum on Jamie Dimon and, in our view, JPMorgman
shareholders are best served by having Jamie Dimon run that
company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive added that "it would have been a disaster for
the company" if Dimon left because the vote had not gone his
way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan won the vote on Tuesday by a greater margin than
last year, when shareholders put up a similar proposal. About 68
percent of investors voted to keep Dimon as chairman and CEO,
compared with about 60 percent last year. However, three
JPMorgan directors who served on the board's risk committee
during the London whale imbroglio last year were re-elected by
an unusually slim majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond, a former ExxonMobil Corp CEO, told
shareholders before the tally was announced that the London
Whale episode was not a reason to split the CEO and chairman
roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just the opposite," he said during a question-and-answer
session at the meeting. "We don't think this is time for
disruption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond, viewed as a counterweight to Dimon on the board,
said changes were afoot for the board's risk committee, but he
did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon smiled as he left the meeting in Tampa and the bank's
shares rose 1.4 percent to close at $53.02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors wondered if the publicity around the vote
resulted in fewer investors listening to ISS and Glass Lewis,
and more doing their own homework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm guessing that because it was more visible this year
than last year, the investment committees of stockholders were
probably more thoughtful about it," Jordan Posner, managing
director of Matrix Asset Advisors Inc, a New York money manager
with about 619,000 JPMorgan shares. Posner said his firm voted
against the split proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GETTING CREDIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among big-bank CEOs, Dimon ranks first for stock returns,
and for delivering a strong balance sheet with no quarterly
losses at a time when other global banks were reeling. But some
investors feared the bank's trading losses last year and tussles
with regulators signaled Dimon could use more oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the vote, Glass Lewis and Institutional
Shareholder Services issued reports critical of the board,
particularly the members of the risk committee, whose experience
they found wanting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the London Whale losses, the committee was
made up of James Crown, president of a large family investment
company; David Cote, the CEO of Honeywell International Inc
 ; and Ellen Futter, who heads the American Museum of
Natural History in New York. All three remain on the panel,
augmented by a new fourth member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futter, who won only a 53.1 percent approval from
shareholders, did not attend the meeting. The Wall Street
Journal reported earlier on Tuesday that Futter would likely
resign from the board if she won only a slim majority of the
votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a huge repudiation of them as directors," Glass
Lewis's McCormick said. "That's a strong signal that
shareholders are unhappy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crown received 57.4 percent approval, preliminarily, and
Cote received 59.3 percent. Apart from the three singled out by
ISS and Glass Lewis, directors received at least 90 percent
approval votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Simpson, director for corporate governance at the
California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns
JPMorgan shares, said the vote had set a "high watermark."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal here is to get the board strengthened, stiffen its
backbone and to get people with the experience that is needed to
oversee Mr Dimon," Simpson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Florida (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's outspoken chairman and chief executive, won a vote of confidence on Tuesday as shareholders recommended that he keep his chairman title, giving him a greater margin of approval than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who had pressed for Dimon to be stripped of his chairman title said they believed they lost because of the chief executive's hints he would quit if he did not win the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 32.2 percent of shareholder votes were in favor of a proposal to create an independent chairman, compared with 40.1 percent last year, the bank said at its annual meeting in Tampa, Florida. Dimon smiled as he left the meeting, and the bank's shares rose to their highest level since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO could not claim total victory. Three JPMorgan directors were re-elected by an unusually slim majority. The three directors were on the board's risk management committee, which is widely seen as having fallen down after the bank lost $6.2 billion from risky derivatives bets last year known as the London Whale trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investors said the bank had worked hard to convince shareholders to vote against the proposal to split the chairman and CEO spot, holding countless meetings with board members and executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company pulled out all the stops," said Lisa Lindsley, director of capital strategies for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), one of the shareholders that sponsored the proposal to split the chairman and CEO roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When push came to shove, "people were worried Dimon was going to walk," said Leon Kamhi, executive director of Hermes equity ownership services - one of the sponsors of the split chair proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's vote came before most of the $6.2 billion in derivatives trading losses came to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Raymond, a former ExxonMobil CEO who now serves as lead independent director on JPMorgan's board, told shareholders before the tally was announced that the episode is not a reason to split the CEO and chairman roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just the opposite," he said during a question-and-answer session at the meeting. "We don't think this is time for disruption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond, who is viewed as a counterweight to Dimon on the board, did say that changes were afoot on the board's risk committee but he did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan rose 2 percent to $53.35, their highest since February 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GETTING CREDIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among big-bank CEOs, Dimon ranks first for stock returns and has been praised for leading the bank through the financial crisis with a strong balance sheet and no quarterly losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take a winning football team. One could always ask the question whether the team would have been as effective without the quarterback," said Benjamin Ram, a co-manager of the $1.6 billion Oppenheimer Main Street Select fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The team gets part of the credit, but Jamie Dimon as the leader also gets the credit," Ram added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ram's fund has 6.4 percent of its assets in JPMorgan shares, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. He declined to comment on how he was voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the vote, Institutional Investors Services and Glass Lewis &amp; Co - two proxy advisory firms whose recommendations are often followed by institutional investors - issued reports critical of the board, particularly the members of the risk committee, whose experience they found wanting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the London Whale losses, the committee was made up of James Crown, president of a large family investment company; David Cote, the CEO of Honeywell International Inc and Ellen Futter, who heads the American Museum of Natural History in New York. All three remain on the panel, augmented by a fourth member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futter, who won only a 53.1 percent approval from shareholders, did not attend Tuesday's meeting. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Tuesday that Futter would likely resign from the board if she won only a slim majority of the votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Jeffrey Benkoe, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - ESPN, the sports channel that is Walt Disney Co's most profitable unit, is cutting 300 to 400 jobs across the company and closing a small Denver office, a person with knowledge of the cuts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Dinesh Nair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI May 21 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp is in
advanced talks to sell most of its downstream assets in Egypt
and Pakistan, three sources said, with the planned disposals
seen raising around $300 million for the U.S. oil major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is conducting
a separate sale process for its assets in both countries, the
banking sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the
matter is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream operations of oil companies include refining and
processing of crude oil, as well as the marketing and
distribution of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron is currently conducting a review of its fuels
operations in Egypt and Pakistan," Chevron spokesman Brent
Tippen told Reuters in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This includes our shareholding in Pakistan Refinery Ltd, as
well as fuels marketing, in Egypt and Pakistan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the company said its lubricants business in Egypt
and Pakistan was not included in the review. It added that no
decision had been made to sell any assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy firm has received at least three non-binding bids
for the assets from interested parties, which include regional
and international energy companies, one of the sources said,
declining to provide details of the bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the bidders are eyeing assets in both the countries,
the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are small assets but are profitable and gaining a lot
of interest in the auction process. There are lots of buyers for
whom owning these businesses makes perfect sense," the source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large oil companies are shrinking their downstream
operations to focus more on high-margin exploration and
production activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell said in April that it was
considering selling some of its Italian downstream assets
including its retail, aviation and supply and distribution
businesses. The company agreed to sell its Egyptian downstream
assets to French energy firm Total, earlier in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based oil and gas producer Hess Corp has
announced plans to exit its retail gasoline, marketing and
trading businesses after pressure from activist investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron operates under the Caltex brand in Pakistan and has
more than 500 petrol outlets in the country. It is also active
in the lubricants business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil giant's first-quarter net income fell 4.5 percent to
$6.18 billion due to lower oil prices, refinery downtime and
high operating costs, it reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc is advising Chevron on the sale process,
according to the sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) board member Rajat Gupta sought to reverse his insider-trading conviction on Tuesday, arguing that wiretap evidence used by the prosecution should not have been introduced at trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyer Seth Waxman told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that wiretaps played for the jury were inadmissible because they amounted to hearsay evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta himself was not heard on the wiretaps, which are instead conversations between convicted Galleon Group manager Raj Rajaratnam and other employees at the hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those wiretaps should never have been admitted," Waxman told a three-judge panel of the appeals court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arguments marked a challenge to one of the highest-profile convictions in the U.S. government's crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 64, is a former head of the consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co and a one-time board member at Goldman and Procter &amp; Gamble Co (PG.N). He was sentenced to two years in prison in October for spilling confidential information about Goldman to Rajaratnam, his one-time friend who is now serving 11 years in prison for insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd Circuit in December said Gupta could remain free on bail while he appeals his conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WIRETAPS AT ISSUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta was convicted on one count of conspiracy and three counts of securities fraud in June 2012. The jury acquitted him on another two securities fraud counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While prosecutors charged Gupta in connection with four tips that they said he illegally provided to Rajaratnam, the jury convicted him of the only two that were supported by wiretaps of the hedge fund manager, Gupta's lawyers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one recorded call on September 23, 2008, the jury heard Rajaratnam telling his principal trader that he had received a call that "something good might happen to Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors sought to use the conversation to show that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam that billionaire Warren Buffett was going to invest $5 billion in the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple calls took place between Rajaratnam and Gupta that same day, including one shortly after a private Goldman board conference call about the Buffett investment. Rajaratnam moved to buy 200,0000 Goldman shares soon after that call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Waxman argued his client had another reason to phone the hedge fund titan as Gupta sought information about joint venture investment fund known as Voyager Capital Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a life full of board meetings, he came out of meetings and returned calls," Waxman said of Gupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Judge Jon Newman, one of the judges on the panel, questioned what a jury was supposed to conclude based on the close timing of Gupta's call and Rajaratnam's trading that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you telling us that's a coincidence?"

&lt;p&gt;* Rajat Gupta says wiretaps improperly admitted at trial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Gupta's 2-year prison term on hold while he appeals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* 2nd Circuit panel hears oral arguments in appeal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - Lawyers for former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc board member Rajat Gupta sought to
reverse his insider-trading conviction on Tuesday, arguing that
wiretap evidence used by the prosecution should not have been
introduced at trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyer Seth Waxman told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in New York that wiretaps played for the jury were
inadmissible because they amounted to hearsay evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta himself was not heard on the wiretaps, which are
instead conversations between convicted Galleon Group manager
Raj Rajaratnam and other employees at the hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those wiretaps should never have been admitted," Waxman
told a three-judge panel of the appeals court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arguments marked a challenge to one of the
highest-profile convictions in the U.S. government's crackdown
on insider trading on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 64, is a former head of the consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co
and a one-time board member at Goldman and Procter &amp; Gamble Co
. He was sentenced to two years in prison in October for
spilling confidential information about Goldman to Rajaratnam,
his one-time friend who is now serving 11 years in prison for
insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd Circuit in December said Gupta could remain free on
bail while he appeals his conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WIRETAPS AT ISSUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta was convicted on one count of conspiracy and three
counts of securities fraud in June 2012. The jury acquitted him
on another two securities fraud counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While prosecutors charged Gupta in connection with four tips
that they said he illegally provided to Rajaratnam, the jury
convicted him of the only two that were supported by wiretaps of
the hedge fund manager, Gupta's lawyers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one recorded call on Sept. 23, 2008, the jury heard
Rajaratnam telling his principal trader that he had received a
call that "something good might happen to Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors sought to use the conversation to show that
Gupta tipped Rajaratnam that billionaire Warren Buffett was
going to invest $5 billion in the investment bank at the height
of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple calls took place between Rajaratnam and Gupta that
same day, including one shortly after a private Goldman board
conference call about the Buffett investment. Rajaratnam moved
to buy 200,0000 Goldman shares soon after that call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Waxman argued his client had another reason to phone the
hedge fund titan as Gupta sought information about joint venture
investment fund known as Voyager Capital Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a life full of board meetings, he came out of meetings
and returned calls," Waxman said of Gupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Judge Jon Newman, one of the judges on the panel,
questioned what a jury was supposed to conclude based on the
close timing of Gupta's call and Rajaratnam's trading that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you telling us that's a coincidence?" Newman asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A different call on Oct. 23, 2008 drew close questioning by
another judge on the panel, Rosemary Pooler, who asked whether
it was properly admitted as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recorded conversation was between Rajaratnam and David
Lau, a portfolio manager at Singapore-based Galleon
International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam on the call said he "heard yesterday from
somebody who's on the board of Goldman Sachs, that they are
gonna lose $2 per share."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's sharing with Lau significant secret information that
the public doesn't have," said Richard Tarlowe, a prosecutor
arguing the case before the appeals court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Waxman said Lau had never been accused of being a
co-conspirator, and Pooler appeared skeptical that the evidence
showed the call was made to further the alleged conspiracy, as
required for it to be admitted as hearsay evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't see that in the conversation," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman also argued that one of Gupta's daughters, Geetanjali
Gupta, was improperly barred at the trial from testifying about
details of discord between Gupta and Rajaratnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defense says she would have told jurors that her father
said he was angry at Rajaratnam for allegedly taking money out
of a joint investment fund known as Voyager Capital Partners
without telling him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta's lawyers said this conversation occurred three days

&lt;p&gt;* Just 32.2 pct of shareholders vote against, vs 40.1 pct
last year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Three directors re-elected by unusually slim margins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Florida, May 21 (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co's outspoken chairman and chief executive, won
a vote of confidence on Tuesday as shareholders recommended that
he keep his chairman title, giving him a greater margin of
approval than last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors who had pressed for Dimon to be stripped of his
chairman title said they believed they lost because of the chief
executive's hints he would quit if he did not win the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 32.2 percent of shareholder votes were in favor of a
proposal to create an independent chairman, compared with 40.1
percent last year, the bank said at its annual meeting in Tampa,
Florida. Dimon smiled as he left the meeting, and the bank's
shares rose to their highest level since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO could not claim total victory. Three JPMorgan
directors were re-elected by an unusually slim majority. The
three directors were on the board's risk management committee,
which is widely seen as having fallen down after the bank lost
$6.2 billion from risky derivatives bets last year known as the
London Whale trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investors said the bank had worked hard to convince
shareholders to vote against the proposal to split the chairman
and CEO spot, holding countless meetings with board members and
executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company pulled out all the stops," said Lisa Lindsley,
director of capital strategies for the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), one of the
shareholders that sponsored the proposal to split the chairman
and CEO roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When push came to shove, "people were worried Dimon was
going to walk," said Leon Kamhi, executive director of Hermes
equity ownership services - one of the sponsors of the split
chair proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's vote came before most of the $6.2 billion in
derivatives trading losses came to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Raymond, a former ExxonMobil CEO who now serves
as lead independent director on JPMorgan's board, told
shareholders before the tally was announced that the episode is
not a reason to split the CEO and chairman roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just the opposite," he said during a question-and-answer
session at the meeting. "We don't think this is time for
disruption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond, who is viewed as a counterweight to Dimon on the
board, did say that changes were afoot on the board's risk
committee but he did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan rose 2 percent to $53.35, their highest
since February 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GETTING CREDIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among big-bank CEOs, Dimon ranks first for stock returns and
has been praised for leading the bank through the financial
crisis with a strong balance sheet and no quarterly losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take a winning football team. One could always ask the
question whether the team would have been as effective without
the quarterback," said Benjamin Ram, a co-manager of the $1.6
billion Oppenheimer Main Street Select fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The team gets part of the credit, but Jamie Dimon as the
leader also gets the credit," Ram added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ram's fund has 6.4 percent of its assets in JPMorgan shares,
 according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. He declined to
comment on how he was voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the runup to the vote, Institutional Investors Services
and Glass Lewis &amp; Co - two proxy advisory firms whose
recommendations are often followed by institutional investors -
issued reports critical of the board, particularly the members
of the risk committee, whose experience they found wanting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the London Whale losses, the committee was
made up of James Crown, president of a large family investment
company; David Cote, the CEO of Honeywell International Inc
 and Ellen Futter, who heads the American Museum of
Natural History in New York. All three remain on the panel,
augmented by a fourth member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futter, who won only a 53.1 percent approval from
shareholders, did not attend Tuesday's meeting. The Wall Street
Journal reported earlier on Tuesday that Futter would likely
resign from the board if she won only a slim majority of the
votes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Home Depot raises outlook, shares hit record intraday high&lt;/p&gt;

after Home Depot raised its profit outlook, while JPMorgan rose
after its chief executive won a vote of confidence from
shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the two companies helped lift the blue-chip Dow as
the broader market picked up steam in the early afternoon,
sending indexes to fresh intraday records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments from a top Federal Reserve official also boosted
the market as they eased some concerns that the central bank
could start to reduce its stimulus program, known as
quantitative easing, or QE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like with regard to QE, they're considering a
slower exit rather than a faster exit," said Bucky Hellwig,
senior vice president at BB Wealth Management in Birmingham,
Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That brought some buying into the market this afternoon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a 17 percent rally for major indexes since the start
of the year, investors are trying to gauge how much further
equities can run. Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients dated
May 20 that it sees the S 500 at 1,750 by the end of the year
- up 5 percent  from Monday's close - and expects a 12-month
rally to 1,825.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's economists forecast above-trend growth in U.S.
gross domestic product in 2014 - for the first time in six
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average gained 68.09 points,
or 0.44 percent, to 15,403.37. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index
 rose 5.44 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,671.73. The
Nasdaq Composite Index added 9.83 points, or 0.28
percent, to 3,506.26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow climbed to an all-time intraday high at 15,418.53,
while the S hit 1,674.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small- and mid-cap Russell 2000 continued to face
technical resistance at the 1,000-point level, but the index
hovered around its all-time closing high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co shareholders voted to allow
Jamie Dimon to keep his chairman title, sending the bank's
shares up 1.7 percent at $53.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The housing market's recovery helped Home Depot 
report higher quarterly sales and earnings, prompting the
world's largest home improvement chain to raise its sales
outlook for the year. Home Depot was the Dow's biggest
percentage gainer, up 3.2 percent at $79.21 after hitting an
intraday record high of $79.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Fed President William Dudley said he cannot be sure
whether policymakers will next reduce or increase the amount of
purchases, due to the "uncertain" economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's current $85 billion per month bond buying program
has played a significant role in the market rally and investors
have become nervous over when the central bank will alter or
halt the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will be parsing testimony by Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke before a congressional panel, the Joint Economic
Committee, on Wednesday morning, while the minutes of the Fed's
latest policy-setting meeting will also be released later that
day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Central banks have been flooding the world with liquidity,
and one place that's gone is into the stock markets," said Brian
Gendreau, market strategist at Cetera Financial Group, based in
Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, a reduction or end of the current quantitative easing
program wouldn't necessarily mean the end of the rally, as a
better economic outlook should offset the change to monetary
policy, Gendreau said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was testifying
before Congress after a U.S. Senate report on the company's
offshore tax structure said the iPhone maker has kept billions
of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no
taxes to any government. Apple shares were up 0.1 percent to
$443.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saks shares jumped more than 8 percent after the
retailer reported better-than-expected sales in the first
quarter. Its shares shot up 8 percent to $13.26.&lt;/p&gt;

			NJPA and Siemens Enter Into Fire and Enterprise Security Contract
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Minnesota-based National Joint Powers Alliance (NJPA) recently 
      awarded Siemens Industry Inc.&#8217;s Building Technologies Division with a 
      four-year national contract for the procurement of facility security 
      services. The contract allows the agency&#8217;s more than 50,000 members to 
      streamline the procurement process by leveraging a pre-competed national 
      contract, saving members time and money. It also facilitates project 
      planning and startups, as Siemens can work directly with the individual 
      members.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NJPA is a municipal contracting agency that has the legislative 
      authority to nationally procure contracts, equipment, and service 
      opportunities for its members. Member agencies include all government, 
      higher education, K-12 education, non-profit, and all other public 
      agencies located throughout the U.S. Leveraging contract purchasing 
      solutions nationally enables contracted suppliers and member agencies to 
      work smarter and more efficiently as they do business with one another. 
      Approximately $1 billion in products are purchased annually through NJPA 
      contracts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For this particular facility security contract, NJPA assessed bids from 
      a number of contenders. Breadth and quality of products and services 
      offered, industry success and experience, competitive pricing, highly 
      developed sales force, and extensive sales and service infrastructure 
      were all important considerations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Certainly, price was a consideration in our selection, but so too were 
      quality and credibility,&#8221; says Tony Glenz, NJPA contract manager. 
      &#8220;Siemens earned high marks in all categories. We also liked the 
      structure of its branch office organization, which will allow the 
      company to respond to our members on a local level with qualified sales 
      and service support.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A systems manufacturer as well as a solutions integrator in enterprise 
      security, Siemens&#8217; Building Technologies Division partners with public 
      safety, emergency managers, and loss prevention professionals to provide 
      turnkey solutions. Its security offerings include video surveillance and 
      advanced analytic systems, access control systems, intrusion detection, 
      fire alarm, monitoring services, advanced mass notification and 
      emergency communications, command and control/PSIM, state-of-the-art IP 
      connectivity, and integration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We look forward to working with the members of NJPA on this unified 
      purchasing alliance,&#8221; says Rob Welton, national business development 
      manager at Siemens Industry, Inc. &#8220;All organizations, whether defined as 
      a city, non-profit, or educational entity, are looking for ways to get 
      the best products in a timely fashion, without duplicative expense. 
      Siemens and the NJPA contract accomplish this with fire and security 
      technology for NJPA members in a world-class way.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Wash. May 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
gave the world the first look at its new game console on
Tuesday, hoping the newly named Xbox One will build on a solid
core of gamer fans and become a hub for living room
entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third-generation console, coming eight years after the
Xbox 360, was unveiled by games unit chief Don Mattrick at an
event at the software company's campus near Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Xbox interacts with a user's television, responds to
voice commands, and includes Skype video calling.&lt;/p&gt;

as a record intraday high for Home Depot helped lift the
blue-chip Dow, but investors were cautious a day ahead of
congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co extended gains after a
preliminary tally showed shareholders had rejected a proposed
split of the rose of chairman and chief executive officer. The
stock was up 2.1 percent at $53.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients dated May 20 that it

from Monday's close - and expects a 12-month rally to 1,825. The

Joint Economic Committee, on Wednesday morning, while the
minutes of the Fed's latest policy-setting meeting will also be
released later that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economic calendar is thin this week and the market
will continue to be vulnerable to profit taking, with the Dow
industrials and the S 500 staying near record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major U.S. stock indexes are up about 17 percent for the
year so far, and the Federal Reserve's ultra-loose monetary
policy has played a significant role in the rally. The Fed is
buying $85 billion in bonds a month, and the market has begun to
search for any sign of when the central bank will alter the
amount of purchases or halt the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Central banks have been flooding the world with liquidity,

that the Fed is tapering would be negative, but I don't know
that three months later, it would make much difference," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 53.63 points,
or 0.35 percent, to 15,388.91. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index
 gained 3.91 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,670.20. The

shareholders reject split of Chairman and CEO roles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Florida (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) Jamie Dimon appears headed for a victory in a shareholder vote on whether he will keep his dual roles as chairman and chief executive of the largest U.S. bank, according to reports on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bitter, months-long shareholder campaign demanding more oversight of Dimon will end with the vote tally at JPMorgan's annual meeting on Tuesday. Dimon had suggested that he may eventually leave the bank if he lost the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported that JPMorgan appeared to have defeated the proposal to split the roles and create an independent chairmanship, citing people familiar with a preliminary vote count. The newspaper said the final outcome could still change and any margin of victory is still unclear. JPMorgan declined comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Dimon was track to garner less support than he did in a similar vote at last year's meeting, when 40 percent of shareholders voted in favor of dividing the roles, Bloomberg News reported, citing two people with knowledge of the preliminary tallies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the independent chair proposal said if the measure gets 40 percent or more of the vote for a second consecutive year, the board should feel obligated to make at least some changes to increase its oversight of management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors said Dimon, 57, needs more oversight after the bank posted $6.2 billion in losses from failed derivative trades last year, but they do not want him to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among big-bank CEOs, Dimon ranks first for stock returns and has been praised for leading the bank through the financial crisis with no quarterly losses and a strong balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Dimon loses the vote and leaves the bank, the bank's shares could fall as much as 10 percent and erase about $20 billion in market value, according to Mike Mayo, a bank analyst with brokerage CLSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares rose 1.3 percent to $52.95 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also has no ready replacement for Dimon, Mayo wrote in a research note, adding that the two lieutenants best positioned to succeed him - Matt Zames, 42, and Mike Cavanagh, 47 - seem to be about three years short of being ready for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zames became sole chief operating officer of JPMorgan in April. Last year, Cavanagh became co-CEO of the company's reconstituted corporate and investment banking segment following a stint as head of treasury and securities services and several years as chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take a winning football team. One could always ask the question whether the team would have been as effective without the quarterback," said Benjamin Ram, a co-manager of the $1.6 billion Oppenheimer Main Street Select fund (OMOBX.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The team gets part of the credit, but Jamie Dimon as the leader also gets the credit," Ram added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ram's fund has 6.4 percent of its assets in JPMorgan shares, more than any other diversified fund, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. He declined to comment on how he was voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholder proposal is non-binding, meaning the bank's board does not have to follow the recommendation, even if the measure gets majority shareholder support. Still, a defeat would be a rebuke for Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar shareholder proposal last year won 40 percent of the vote, before most of the trading losses from the so-called "London Whale" imbroglio came to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's board recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal and the bank lobbied hard against the measure, with tensions rising in the run-up to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the company that collects votes from investors, Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc (BR.N), stopped telling shareholders how votes had been cast so far for the proposal and for other measures. Investors use the information to determine how to tailor their campaigns. ID:L2N0E124X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan decided to release the results to shareholders after the New York Attorney General's office intervened over the weekend, a source familiar with the situation said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were cut off from the tallies during the crucial week leading up to the meeting," said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment Group, which advises pensions that were voting against the bank in a separate measure regarding the re-election of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waizenegger said receiving the information at this late stage was of limited use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote comes amid a growing trend in U.S. corporate governance to have an independent chairman lead the board. Many investors believe that doing so ensures the CEO does not have too much sway over the board and leads to better outcomes for shareholders overall. The debate, however, is far from settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Dimon wins the vote, some shareholders plan to keep the pressure on the bank's board. Two major JPMorgan investors have told Reuters they will continue to press directors behind the scenes to increase their oversight over management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One investor said they will likely encourage the bank to give more authority to lead independent director, former ExxonMobil (XOM.N) CEO Lee Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Edwina Gibbs and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Global leading investment advisor on special opportunities, The 
      Spinoff Report, predicts US Energy Break-ups will escalate in 
      the coming 18 months. As of this week, a total $320bn of Energy 
      companies make up 16 of the SP500&#8217;s near 150 stocks that still sit 
      beneath a 0% return, since the end of 2007 / the last 5 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Surprisingly, that includes the likes of; $24bn, 
      Hess Corp. (HES / -7%) and the already announced Spinoff, $12bn, 
      Murphy Oil (MUR / -8%). Note after doing the analysis, it took 
      the successful US value oriented fund and MUR shareholder, Third Point 
      and its Founder, Dan Loeb, to vocally propose that MUR&#8217;s management 
      break-up the company to for the benefit of shareholders and its future 
      growth prospects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;The Spinoff Report fully forecasted [correctly] the fundamental 
      break-up valuations of ConocoPhillips (COP) Spinoff of its downstream 
      business, Phillips 66 (PSX) before any other main street broker. PSX has 
      returned +89% since&#8230;&#8221;

			Ryan 
      Mendy, COO of The Spinoff Report comments:
			&#8220;Through 
      the sum of the parts analysis and our experience, we believe XOM&#8217;s board 
      can, in a number of ways [restructuring, technicals, new insider 
      incentives, fresh stock options], enhance its shareholder value via a 
      three way potential Spinoff of its Downstream business from the Upstream 
      and Chemical businesses. With total revenues above its current market 
      cap, recently making a series of notable asset sales and a PE of just 
      over 11x; similar to that of COP  PSX, the break-up could win 
      shareholder approval through the distribution of stock in the separated 
      entities and generate new blood investors.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska, May 21, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Polar Petroleum Corp. (OTCBB:POLR) (herein after "Polar Petroleum", "Polar" and/or "the Company") announces the signing of a Letter Of Intent to acquire a 100% Working Interest (WI) in 12 offshore oil and gas leases (approx. 19,662 acres in total) in Alaska's prolific North Slope region as of May 20, 2013. The leases are collectively known as the North Point Thomson Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Polar Petroleum (AK) Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Polar Petroleum Corp., signed the Letter Of Intent to acquire the properties through a lease purchase agreement that reserved an overriding royalty of 4% for the Sellers of the properties, and royalties for the State of Alaska of 12.5% for 7 of the leases and 16.67% for 5 of the leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The properties that Polar will acquire are located ~60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay, North America's largest oil field. The leases lie along the northern border of ExxonMobil's Point Thomson Unit (PTU). The PTU represents an estimated 295 million barrels of oil (MMBO) [1] and 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (TCFG), which represents about 25% of the recoverable natural gas on Alaska's North Slope.[2] In February 2013, Russia's Rosneft &#8211; the world's largest publicly traded oil company &#8211; entered an agreement with ExxonMobil, giving Rosneft the option to buy a 25% interest in ExxonMobil's holdings in the Point Thomson field.[2] During this year's December-to-May operations window, ExxonMobil began construction of a 22-mile pipeline to transport liquid natural gas condensates from their PTU wells to the Badami Unit, where the liquid fuel will be diverted into a pipeline spur that carries oil to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the North Point Thomson Project leases are located 8 miles northeast of the Badami Unit (60+ MMBO), which has produced 5.9 MMBO and 30 billion cubic feet of gas (BCFG) to date. As of May 2012, Badami had production of 1,535 barrels of oil per day (BOPD).[1] The leases are also in close proximity to various oil discoveries: 9 miles southwest of Unocal/Shell's Hammerhead-Sivulliq discovery (100-200+ MMBO); 12 miles west-southwest of the Kuvlum discovery (160-300 MMBO); and 8 miles northwest of the Stinson discovery (150+ MMBO).[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The North Point Thomson Project also sits along an east-west line of exploratory wells that have encountered carbonate-rich, Pre-Mississippian "basement" lithologies. The line starts 8 miles to the east with the Stinson #1, then the Alaska State #A-1, the Alaska State #F-1, the Alaska Island #1, and continues through the Challenge Island #1 on the western end of the North Point Thomson Project before extending westward towards the Liberty Unit area. In particular, the Alaska St. #F-1 Well tested 284 BOPD (35 API) and 4 MMCFGPD in Thomson, and 152 BOPD (35 API) and 3 MMCFGPD in Pre-Mississippian; the Alaska St. #A-1 was the discovery well for Flaxman Island Oil Pool (Canning), and tested 4,220 BWPD in Pre-Mississippian; and less than 4 miles to the southwest of Polar Petroleum's new project, BP's Red Dog #1 Well had 1,275' of oil and gas shows in Middle Brookian sands.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Red Dog #1 Well is within the northeast portion of the proposed Telemark Unit, which would lie 2 miles southwest of the North Point Thomson Project. The new Telemark Unit would lie between the Badami and Point Thomson units, and would develop the Tertiary "Flaxman Sands" encountered when Humble Oil (Exxon) drilled the onshore E. Mikkelsen Bay State #1 well in 1971. BP drilled the Red Dog #1 Well in 1999.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Polar Petroleum Corp.'s President and CEO, Daniel Walker, commented: "The proximity of the North Point Thomson Project couldn't be overlooked, from bordering ExxonMobil's Point Thomson Unit, to Rosneft's interest in that project, the Badami Unit to the immediate west, nearby oil discoveries and significant exploration well results. Alaska's energy industry is clearly investing in the development of this area, and we're fortunate to be positioned in the middle of that activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Florida May 21 (Reuters) - As final ballots come in
on a proposal to strip JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co Chairman and
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon of his chairman title, some worry
about what will happen if shareholders win what will likely be a
close vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's annual meeting on Tuesday will bring to head a
months-long and bitter shareholder campaign demanding more
oversight of Dimon, who has suggested that he may eventually
leave the bank if he loses the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors say that while Dimon, 57, may need more oversight
after the bank posted $6.2 billion in losses from failed
derivative trades last year, they do not want him to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among big bank CEOs, Dimon ranks first for stock returns and
has been praised for leading the bank through the financial
crisis with no quarterly losses and a strong balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Dimon were to leave, the bank's shares could fall as much
as 10 percent and erase about $20 billion of market value,
according to Mike Mayo, a bank analyst with brokerage CLSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also has no ready replacement for Dimon, Mayo wrote
in a research note, adding that the two lieutenants best
positioned to succeed him - Matt Zames, 42, and Mike Cavanagh,
47 - seem to be about three years short of being ready for the
job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zames became sole chief operating officer of the largest
U.S. bank in April. Last year, Cavanagh became co-CEO of the
company's reconstituted corporate and investment banking segment
following a stint as head of treasury and securities services
and several years as chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take a winning football team. One could always ask the
question whether the team would have been as effective without
the quarterback," said Benjamin Ram, a co-manager of the $1.6
billion Oppenheimer Main Street Select fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The team gets part of the credit, but Jamie Dimon as the
leader also gets the credit," Ram added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ram's fund has 6.4 percent of its assets in JPMorgan shares,
more than any other diversified fund, according to Lipper, a
Thomson Reuters company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholder proposal is non-binding, meaning the bank's
board does not have to follow through with the recommendation
even if the measure gets majority shareholder support. Still, a
defeat would be an unpleasant rebuke for Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar shareholder proposal last year won 40 percent of
the vote, before most of the trading losses from the so-called
"London Whale" imbroglio came to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's board has recommended that shareholders vote
against the proposal and the bank has been lobbying hard against
the measure, with tensions rising in the run-up to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the independent chair proposal said that if
the measure gets 40 percent or more of the vote for a second
consecutive year that the board should feel obligated to make at
least some changes to increase its oversight of management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the company that collects votes from investors,
Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc, stopped telling
shareholders how votes had been cast so far for this and other
measures. Investors use this information to determine how to
tailor their campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan decided to release the results to shareholders
after the New York Attorney General's office intervened over the
weekend, a source familiar with the situation said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were cut off from the tallies during the crucial week
leading up to the meeting," said Dieter Waizenegger, executive
director of the CtW Investment Group, which advises pensions
that were voting against the bank in a separate measure
regarding the reelection of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waizenegger said receiving the information at this late
stage was of limited use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote comes amid a growing trend in U.S. corporate
governance to have an independent chairman lead the board. Many
investors believe that doing so ensures that the chief executive
does not have too much sway over the board and leads to better
outcomes for shareholders overall. The debate, however, is far
from settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Dimon wins the vote, some shareholders plan to keep
the pressure on the bank's board. Two major JPMorgan investors
have told Reuters that they will continue to press directors
behind the scenes to increase their oversight over management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One investor said that they will likely encourage the bank
to give more authority to its lead independent director, former
ExxonMobil Chief Executive Lee Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;

      TalkTalk Business&#8217; SIP Trunking Service
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key Takeaways:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        TalkTalk Business&#8217; network carries more than 2.85 billion voice 
        minutes per month, supports more than 4 million customer lines and 5 
        million broadband connections
      
			
        Sonus is the preferred session border controller (SBC) provider for 
        TalkTalk Business Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking 
        deployments
      
			
        Enterprises can leverage TalkTalk&#8217;s SIP trunking service and Sonus&#8217; 
        SBC 1000 or SBC 2000 Session Border Controllers at the core of their 
        networks to manage interoperability and provide high levels of network 
        security
      
			
        As Unified Communications (UC) usage grows, SBCs help companies enable 
        interoperability, enhance service quality and deliver security 
        features required when deployed across multi-vendor networks for 
        SIP-based applications
      
			
        Survivable Branch Appliance (SBA) capabilities of the Sonus SBC 1000 
        and Sonus SBC 2000 for Microsoft Lync ensure business continuity in 
        branch offices if the wide area network (WAN) fails
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sonus 
      Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq: SONS), a global 
      leader in SIP communications, today announced that the Sonus SBC 
      1000 and SBC 2000 Session Border Controllers (SBCs) are certified for 
      deployment with TalkTalk 
      Business&#8217; Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking services and 
      Microsoft Lync Server 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SIP trunking solutions from TalkTalk Business allow enterprises to 
      reduce capital expenditures by eliminating the need for equipment 
      changeover or disruption of service, so legacy network investments are 
      preserved; and reduce overhead costs associated with operating and 
      maintaining multiple service-specific access lines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A Microsoft Gold Communications Partner, Sonus helps enterprises 
      optimize Microsoft Lync voice deployments by securing SIP trunking 
      services at the network border and providing a more seamless flow of 
      SIP-based, multi-vendor media for advanced real-time applications like 
      Unified Communications (UC). Access to UC applications such as instant 
      messaging (IM), collaboration, conferencing and voice empowers 
      enterprises to communicate in the most efficient and cost-effective ways 
      &#8211; whenever and wherever.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TalkTalk Business&#8217; SIP trunking solution offers seamless integration, 
      allowing the full range of voice call features to be used across an 
      enterprise. The SIP trunking service can help enterprises save up to 50 
      percent on business phone bills and extend advanced communication 
      features over IP to employees in all offices, whether a main site, a 
      branch office or a remote location.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sonus SBCs serve as a foundational access technology to enable customers 
      to unify disparate UC architectures across an enterprise. The Sonus 
      portfolio provides the industry&#8217;s only end-to-end SBC solution 
      delivering SIP-enabled applications from the service provider to 
      enterprise headquarters to the branch office.

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI May 21 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp is in
advanced talks to sell its downstream assets in Egypt and
Pakistan, three sources said, with the planned disposals seen
raising around $300 million for the U.S. oil major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is conducting
a separate sale process for its assets in both countries, the
banking sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the
matter is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream operations of oil companies include refining and
processing of crude oil, as well as the marketing and
distribution of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy firm has received at least three non-binding bids
for the assets from interested parties, which include regional
and international energy companies, one of the sources said,
declining to provide details of the bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the bidders are eyeing assets in both the countries,
the source said. Chevron declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are small assets but are profitable and gaining a lot
of interest in the auction process. There are lots of buyers for
whom owning these businesses makes perfect sense," the source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large oil companies are shrinking their downstream
operations to focus more on high-margin exploration and
production activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell said in April that it was
considering selling some of its Italian downstream assets
including its retail, aviation and supply and distribution
businesses. The company agreed to sell its Egyptian downstream
assets to French energy firm Total, earlier in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based oil and gas producer Hess Corp has
announced plans to exit its retail gasoline, marketing and
trading businesses after pressure from activist investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron operates under the Caltex brand in Pakistan and has
more than 500 petrol outlets in the country. It is also active
in the lubricants business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil giant's first-quarter net income fell 4.5 percent to
$6.18 billion due to lower oil prices, refinery downtime and
high operating costs, it reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc is advising Chevron on the sale process,
according to the sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc raised $1.1 billion by selling its remaining shares in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, ending a seven-year old investment and handing the Wall Street firm a return of nearly four times its original stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman's relationship with ICBC (1398.HK) was similar to that of other big global financial institutions that purchased stakes in Chinese banks and insurers. While the relationship was profitable, involved some cooperation and helped Chinese lenders become some of the world's biggest banks, few products or strategic benefits emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selldown also comes at a time when Goldman, like other big Western banks, is keen to boost its balance sheet ahead of new capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to its 2006 initial public offering, ICBC was a technically insolvent state institution, reeling from the bad loans that had saddled China's financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBC's fortunes turned after it went public, and the bank grew along with China's economic boom. The bank's $240 billion market value is now just shy of the combined worth of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and Barclays (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman (GS.N) agreed to invest $2.58 billion in ICBC in January 2006, using internal funds that invest a mix of client, employee and corporate cash. With the final selldown, the last of six, gross proceeds from the sales would be $10.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calculating Goldman's own profit on the stake is tricky because not all of the investment came from its own balance sheet, and the cost of acquiring and maintaining the ICBC stake is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman late on Monday sold 1.585 billion Hong Kong-traded shares of ICBC at HK$5.50 each, equivalent to a 2.5 percent discount to Monday's close of HK$5.64, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The deal, which was marketed in a range of HK$5.47-$5.50 per share, totaled HK$8.72 billion ($1.1 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBC shares fell 2 percent to HK$5.53, compared with a 0.6 percent decline in the benchmark Hang Seng index .HSI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA GAME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N), UBS (UBSN.VX) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) all bought into Chinese banks shortly after Goldman's deal, as Beijing prepared to float its major financial institutions on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman began to sell its ICBC stake in 2009. The New York bank, like other foreign financial groups, was able to reap a hefty windfall from China holdings at the time, when cash was precious post financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike other foreign banks that sold out of China quickly, Goldman remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman increased its pace of ICBC sales in the last few years, as banks needed to meet tougher capital requirements under the global Basel III accord, with asset sales one of the quickest ways for them to bolster their balance sheets. U.S. regulators are still in the process of finalizing how they will implement Basel III, though banks are under pressure from investors to show they can meet the requirements regardless of whether the laws have been finalized or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also has a securities joint venture and a 12 percent stake in Taikang Life Insurance Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other foreign banks still have holdings in Chinese lenders.

&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Florida May 21 (Reuters) - As final ballots come in
on a proposal to strip JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co Chairman and
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon of his chairman title, some worry
about what will happen if shareholders win what will likely be a
close vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's annual meeting on Tuesday will bring to head a
months-long and bitter shareholder campaign demanding more
oversight of Dimon, who has suggested that he may eventually
leave the bank if he loses the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors say that while Dimon, 57, may need more oversight
after the bank posted $6.2 billion in losses from failed
derivative trades last year, they do not want him to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among big bank CEOs, Dimon ranks first for stock returns and
has been praised for leading the bank through the financial
crisis with no quarterly losses and a strong balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Dimon were to leave, the bank's shares could fall as much
as 10 percent and erase about $20 billion of market value,
according to Mike Mayo, a bank analyst with brokerage CLSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also has no ready replacement for Dimon, Mayo wrote
in a research note, adding that the two lieutenants best
positioned to succeed him - Matt Zames, 42, and Mike Cavanagh,
47 - seem to be about three years short of being ready for the
job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zames became sole chief operating officer of the largest
U.S. bank in April. Last year, Cavanagh became co-CEO of the
company's reconstituted corporate and investment banking segment
following a stint as head of treasury and securities services
and several years as chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take a winning football team. One could always ask the
question whether the team would have been as effective without
the quarterback," said Benjamin Ram, a co-manager of the $1.6
billion Oppenheimer Main Street Select fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The team gets part of the credit, but Jamie Dimon as the
leader also gets the credit," Ram added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ram's fund has 6.4 percent of its assets in JPMorgan shares,
more than any other diversified fund, according to Lipper, a
Thomson Reuters company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholder proposal is non-binding, meaning the bank's
board does not have to follow through with the recommendation
even if the measure gets majority shareholder support. Still, a
defeat would be an unpleasant rebuke for Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar shareholder proposal last year won 40 percent of
the vote, before most of the trading losses from the so-called
"London Whale" imbroglio came to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's board has recommended that shareholders vote
against the proposal and the bank has been lobbying hard against
the measure, with tensions rising in the run-up to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the independent chair proposal said that if
the measure gets 40 percent or more of the vote for a second
consecutive year that the board should feel obligated to make at
least some changes to increase its oversight of management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the company that collects votes from investors,
Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc, stopped telling
shareholders how votes had been cast so far for this and other
measures. Investors use this information to determine how to
tailor their campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan decided to release the results to shareholders
after the New York Attorney General's office intervened over the
weekend, a source familiar with the situation said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were cut off from the tallies during the crucial week
leading up to the meeting," said Dieter Waizenegger, executive
director of the CtW Investment Group, which advises pensions
that were voting against the bank in a separate measure
regarding the reelection of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waizenegger said receiving the information at this late
stage was of limited use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote comes amid a growing trend in U.S. corporate
governance to have an independent chairman lead the board. Many
investors believe that doing so ensures that the chief executive
does not have too much sway over the board and leads to better
outcomes for shareholders overall. The debate, however, is far
from settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Dimon wins the vote, some shareholders plan to keep
the pressure on the bank's board. Two major JPMorgan investors
have told Reuters that they will continue to press directors
behind the scenes to increase their oversight over management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One investor said that they will likely encourage the bank
to give more authority to its lead independent director, former
ExxonMobil Chief Executive Lee Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;

			Portland General Electric Increases Dividend
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On May 22, 2013, the Board of Directors of Portland General Electric 
      Company (NYSE: POR) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 27.5 
      cents per share, up from last quarter&#8217;s dividend of 27 cents per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;PGE&#8217;s strong operations, prudent financial management, and focus on 
      delivering value to both our customers and our shareholders makes it 
      possible to provide the seventh consecutive annual dividend increase 
      since going public in 2006,&#8221; said Jim Piro, PGE&#8217;s president and chief 
      executive officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company&#8217;s dividend is evaluated based on capital requirements and 
      financial performance. Over the long term, PGE targets a dividend payout 
      ratio of 50 to 70 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The dividend is payable on or before July 15, 2013, to shareholders of

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Goldman Sachs Financial Square Prime Obligations Fund at 
      'AAAmmf'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings affirms the 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the Goldman Sachs 
      Financial Square Prime Obligations Fund, a money market fund managed by 
      Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (GSAM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The main drivers for the affirmation are:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The portfolio's overall credit quality and diversification;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Low exposure to interest rate and spread risks;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The fund's maturity profile, overnight and weekly liquidity, 
      consistent with its shareholders profile and concentration;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The capabilities and resources of GSAM as investment advisor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PORTFOLIO CREDIT QUALITY/DIVERSIFICATION
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' money market fund rating criteria, the 
      fund seeks to maintain a high credit quality by investing in securities 
      rated at least 'A-' or 'F1' by Fitch or equivalent, in line with its 
      investment policies. The fund limits its exposures to individual issuers 
      at 5% of the fund's assets. The fund limits its exposure to individual 
      repurchase agreement counterparties to 25% of their total assets for 
      those repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury and 
      government securities. Other types of repurchase agreements entail lower 
      counterparty exposure limits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the day of the rating affirmation and during the past year the fund's 
      Portfolio Credit Factor (PCF), which is a risk-weighted measure of the 
      fund's portfolio assets accounting for the credit quality and maturity 
      profile of the portfolio securities, met Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating 
      criterion of 1.50 or less.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MATURITY PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund seeks to limit interest rate and spread risk consistent with 
      Fitch's ratings criteria for funds rated 'AAAmmf' by maintaining its 
      weighted average maturity (WAM) and weighted average life (WAL) below 60 
      days and 120 days, respectively. It also limits the maturity date of any 
      single investment to 397 days. This maturity limit could be reduced 
      depending on the creditworthiness of the issuer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LIQUIDITY PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund's additional investment restrictions are aimed at maintaining 
      sufficient levels of daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' 
      redemption requests. Specifically, the fund must invest at least 10% of 
      its total assets in daily liquid securities and at least 30% of its 
      total assets in weekly liquid. At the day of the rating affirmation, the 
      fund fully met its liquidity requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FUND OBJECTIVES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Prime Obligations Fund seeks to maximize current 
      income to the extent consistent with the preservation of capital and 
      maintenance of liquidity. The fund pursues its investment objective by 
      investing in U.S. government securities, obligations of U.S. banks, 
      commercial paper and other short-term obligations of U.S. companies, 
      states, municipalities and other entities and repurchase agreements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Per its prospectus, the fund does not incur any direct exposure to 
      foreign entities, although such exposures may be incurred indirectly, 
      for example, through investments in asset-backed commercial paper 
      programs sponsored by foreign financial institutions. As of April 30th, 
      2013, the fund had $20.1 billion in assets under management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INVESTMENT ADVISOR
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSAM is an affiliate of Goldman Sachs Group (rated 'A/F1' by Fitch). 
      GSAM manages assets on behalf of institutions and individuals through a 
      variety of equity, fixed income, cash management and alternative 
      investment products. Fitch views GSAM's investment advisory 
      capabilities, resource commitment, operational controls, corporate 
      governance, and compliance procedures as consistent with the rating 
      assigned to the fund.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY AND SURVEILLANCE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality 
      or market risk profiles of the fund. A material adverse deviation from 
      Fitch's guidelines for any key rating driver could cause Fitch to 
      downgrade the ratings. For additional information about Fitch's money 
      market fund ratings guidelines, please review the criteria referenced 
      below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To maintain the fund rating, Fitch seeks weekly portfolio holdings 
      information from the fund administrator and conducts surveillance checks 
      against its ratings guidelines. Surveillance data for this fund is 
      available at www.fitchratings.com/FAM 
      then 'Surveillance'.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Around 600 interpreters who serve alongside British soldiers in Afghanistan are to be offered visas to live in the UK, in a softening of the government's previous policy of encouraging them to stay in the country after British troops withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But limits attached to the offer have drawn fire from human rights activists and even from Prime Minister David Cameron's own party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interpreters, who are employed by the Ministry of Defence, will be allowed to choose between a free five-year training program in Afghanistan or the right to live in Britain for five years, with the option to apply for permanent asylum afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The residence offer, however, only applies to those who have been working for British forces since the start of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These proposals give them a choice: the opportunity to go on working in Afghanistan, learning new skills and to go on rebuilding their country or to come and make a new start in Britain," said a government statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Foreign Office spokeswoman added: "It's a redundancy package designed for those who will not be able to work as a result of our drawdown."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron has previously said the interpreters should remain in Afghanistan to help rebuild the country after British forces withdraw next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His junior Liberal Democrat coalition partners however had long pressed for the interpreters - who say they and their families will be at risk from Taliban reprisals once the British go - to be allowed to claim asylum in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's 9,000 combat troops in Afghanistan are due to leave the country by the end of 2014, with nearly half of them expected to pull out this year, after more than a decade of conflict that has cost the lives of nearly 450 British troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians in Cameron's own party have expressed concern that the deal will only allow Afghan interpreters who have been working since January 1, 2013 to seek asylum in Britain, and will not help those working with British troops before then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a slightly thoughtless way of limiting numbers," lawmaker David Davis told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three interpreters issued a claim at the High Court in London earlier this month challenging the government's decision not to treat them in the same way as it had done with local staff in Iraq after the 2003 American-led invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyer Rosa Curling, who acted for the three, said she was pleased the "bravery of the Afghan interpreters now seems to have been recognized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she told BBC radio: "We are, however, concerned that some interpreters may not qualify if the scheme is only available to those employed between December 2012 and December 2014 and limited to front-line staff only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This would completely undermine the purpose of the policy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammad Rafi, an Afghan interpreter who served alongside British forces from 2006-2011, also criticized the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not the right deal because it doesn't apply to me, my family, or my brother who have served this country, and it doesn't apply to other interpreters who have served this country," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today the government is leaving them (interpreters) behind to be killed by the Taliban."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign director of human rights group Avaaz, which delivered a petition with 82,000 signatories to the Foreign Office that called for Afghan interpreters to be offered asylum, urged that the deal be the same as that offered for interpreters in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Under that deal, staff employed on or after January 2005 were eligible to apply for asylum," said Alex Wilks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Avaaz is today urging the British government to extend today's deal to all former Afghan employees facing threats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jon Hemming)&lt;/p&gt;

			Microsoft Names Perficient Country Partner of the Year for the United 
      States
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Perficient takes top honor among all partners in the United States 
      for demonstrating excellence in innovation and implementation of 
      Microsoft technologies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Perficient, 
      Inc. (NASDAQ: PRFT), a leading information technology consulting 
      firm serving Global 2000 and other large enterprise customers, today 
      announced it has been named Microsoft&#8217;s 2013 US Partner of the Year. The 
      award recognizes Perficient, one of the top National Systems Integrator 
      (NSI) partners in the country, for delivering innovative technology 
      solutions across all industry verticals and the entire Microsoft product 
      stack.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This recognition highlights the incredible talent and expertise we have 
      on our team, Perficient&#8217;s commitment to the Microsoft partnership, and 
      the pride we take in helping clients realize enhanced productivity, 
      communications and business growth through the use of innovative 
      Microsoft technology solutions,&#8221; said Jeffrey Davis, Perficient&#8217;s chief 
      executive officer and president. &#8220;We already are extremely proud to be 
      included among an elite group of NSI partners, and to be named the U.S. 
      Partner of the Year is an even bigger accomplishment and incredible 
      honor to receive.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2012, Perficient delivered numerous, end-to-end integrated solutions 
      for clients leveraging technologies such as SharePoint 
      2013, Office 
      365, Lync 
      Voice and SQL 
      Server. Within four months of SharePoint 2013&#8217;s release Perficient 
      had already implemented new SharePoint 2013 public websites for three 
      clients with dozens of additional clients going live in the coming 
      months. Perficient also has activated more than 500,000 Office 365 
      seats, which is more than any other National Systems Integrator. In 
      addition, the company has helped several clients gain access to Epic 
      data via Microsoft&#8217;s SQL Server and SharePoint products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights of client solutions Perficient delivered this year include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				SharePoint 2013
				Implementation &#8211; An international 
        financial and professional services firm specializing in real estate 
        services and investment management recognized changes in use patterns 
        on its public website, and sought to find a platform that would 
        deliver the right content to an increasingly mobile and discerning 
        user base. Perficient created a SharePoint 
        2013 website targeted to a specific property market in order to 
        assess its new web content management features, such as search, user 
        segmentation, and mobile device support.
      
			
				Office 365 Migration &#8211; One of the country&#8217;s largest healthcare 
        providers was looking for a way to provide better collaboration 
        capabilities to their end users. Lync Online was a natural fit for 
        this requirement. Office 
        365 integration options allowed for the client to quickly setup 
        and extend their Active Directory environment for not only Lync 
        Online, but all of the Office 365 services. With the simplified 
        integration options, the client was able to deploy Lync Online to all 
        6,000 users within weeks.
      
			
				BI/SQL Server Implementation &#8211; A leading health system 
        organization sought to optimize and extend the role of its electronic 
        health records (EHR) system, helping the hospital make more 
        well-informed decisions on critical matters. The company decided to 
        make the information generated by analytics and EHR systems more 
        timely and accessible through an integrated, business intelligence 
        solution that leveraged SharePoint and SQL Server 2012. The health 
        system&#8217;s orthopedic surgeons now have accurate benchmark data on the 
        performance of the various implant devices and timely information on 
        which devices the hospital recommends. As a result, healthcare dollars 
        are spent more effectively, saving over $1 million annually on implant 
        device purchases.

      substantially that it now represents nearly a quarter of Perficient&#8217;s 
      revenue overall. This recognition from Microsoft is proof-positive that 
      we&#8217;re building the business the right way.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday it will spin off its majority stake in animal health business Zoetis Inc to shareholders by allowing them to swap Pfizer stock for Zoetis shares at a 7 percent discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, sold Zoetis shares in an initial public offering in February that raised $2.2 billion. Pfizer retained an 80 percent stake in Zoetis after the IPO and now plans to unwind that, starting with this offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes as Pfizer continues to unload its non-pharmaceuticals businesses to focus on its core prescription drugs business, which has far higher profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer would allow Pfizer shareholders to exchange $100 worth of company stock for $107.52 worth of Zoetis stock. The premium is meant to encourage Pfizer shareholders to acquire Zoetis shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer owns 400,985,000 shares of Zoetis Class B common stock that it will convert to Class A shares for the exchange. Pfizer shareholders must request at least 160.4 million shares of Zoetis common stock for the exchange to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said that selling the rest of Zoetis will boost earnings starting in 2014. If it does not sell all of its stake through the exchange offer, Pfizer said it could turn to additional exchange offers or a special dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 3 percent to $29.65 on Wednesday while Zoetis shares fell 1.5 percent to $32.53, moving closer to their relative values under the estimated exchange ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoetis shares were priced at $26 in the February IPO and closed their first day of trading at $31.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2012 Pfizer sold its infant nutrition business to Nestle SA for $11.9 billion.

			Turkish Airlines Announces Participation in New e-Visa Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global Airline Partners with Turkish Government for New Initiative
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Turkish Airlines (www.turkishairlines.com, 
      www.thy.com) 
      is proud to announce its participation in the new e-Visa program &#8211; an 
      exciting initiative intended to make the visa application process faster 
      and easier for those traveling to Turkey. Officially launched in April 
      of 2013, this new system will allow foreign nationals to obtain Turkish 
      visas online rather than at the Turkish consulates and embassies, or at 
      the border gates upon arrival.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Accessing and using the online system is easy and quick: all travelers 
      need to apply for an e-Visa is a passport that has been valid for at 
      least six months, documentation of their flight reservation and a credit 
      card (currently only Visa and MasterCard are accepted). An electronic 
      copy of one&#8217;s e-Visa will be available online as soon as the application 
      is submitted and the credit card has been charged. A hard copy will also 
      be mailed to the travelers directly, which they can print out and show 
      to airport and customs officials upon their arrival in Turkey.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very excited about the launch of the new e-Visa program, which 
      is the result of a unique collaboration between Turkish Airlines, the 
      Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Turkish Ministry of &#304;nterior 
      Affairs,&#8221; says Turkish Airlines&#8217; Chairman of the Board Hamdi Top&#231;u. 
      &#8220;This new initiative will not only make it easier for foreign nationals 
      to apply for and obtain a Turkish visa, but is also expected to increase 
      the number of visitors to Turkey, thus attracting additional tourism and 
      foreign trade revenue.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The e-Visa takes the place of the traditional stamp or sticker usually 
      issued at the border crossing. Travelers are required to carry their 
      e-Visa with them at all times as it is an official endorsement from the 
      Turkish government that the bearer is allowed to enter and be in the 
      country. E-Visas can only be used for tourism or trade purposes. Those 
      looking to travel to Turkey for work or study are still required to file 
      an application through the country&#8217;s embassies or consulates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Perficient and IBM Help The Men&#8217;s Wearhouse Better Engage Customers, 
      Improve Productivity Through Smarter Commerce
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Will share best practices at IBM Smarter Commerce Summit 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Perficient and IBM are working with The Men&#8217;s Wearhouse to better engage 
      customers and improve productivity through a Smarter Commerce approach 
      that puts the clients&#8217; customers at the center of their operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today&#8217;s consumers demand businesses engage with them when, where and how 
      they prefer, and they expect to receive a consistent, positive 
      experience across all points of interaction. Organizations are 
      challenged with improving operational efficiencies while focusing on 
      their customers&#8217; brand engagement. As a result, Perficient, 
      Inc. (NASDAQ: PRFT), a leading information technology consulting 
      firm serving Global 2000 and other large enterprise customers throughout 
      North America, is experiencing an increased demand from clients for help 
      in applying smarter commerce strategies and technology solutions to 
      address these business challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			How Men&#8217;s Wearhouse Addresses Commerce in the Age of the Informed 
      Consumer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Perficient recently partnered with The 
      Men&#8217;s Wearhouse, a leading men's&#160;dress apparel&#160;retailer in 
      the&#160;United States, to evolve their e-commerce strategy. The Men&#8217;s 
      Wearhouse had long been a brick and mortar store, but recognized its 
      customers&#8217; growing use of digital channels during the shopping 
      experience. To improve their competitive and customer experience, the 
      retailer increased their online and mobile presence and is now engaging 
      customers across all commerce channels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Men&#8217;s Wearhouse challenges were to transition from their legacy 
      architecture system that required customized support, improve 
      productivity and reduce costs. The company partnered with Perficient to 
      upgrade their WebSphere Commerce platform, which effectively put the 
      customer at the center of its commerce strategy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At The Men&#8217;s Wearhouse, our number one differentiator is our customer 
      service. Our customers were online, they were mobile, and we needed to 
      quickly transform our systems in order to provide a positive and 
      consistent customer experience across all channels,&#8221; said Vlad 
      Kuznetsov, chief technology officer and vice president of engineering 
      for The Men&#8217;s Wearhouse. &#8220;In partnership with Perficient, we have 
      successfully built a system that provides improved internal productivity 
      and an enhanced level of service our customers have grown accustomed to, 
      meeting them with a consistent experience at all touch points, and 
      maintaining our brand integrity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are in the era of the empowered customer where the customer expects 
      a certain type of experience and engagement that essentially dictates 
      the way products are sold, sourced and distributed. Enterprises are 
      becoming more conscious of the overall customer and brand experience 
      across channels, and the challenges that lie ahead will be maintaining 
      the balance without breaking the bank,&#8221; said Sameer Peera, principal, 
      Perficient&#8217;s National Commerce practice. &#8220;Organizations that embark on a 
      path to evolve their commerce strategy and infrastructure to support 
      business agility will continue to maintain a competitive edge in this 
      environment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of this shift toward the empowered consumer, Perficient has 
      experienced significant growth in its IBM 
      Smarter Commerce Practice. Perficient&#8217;s commerce practice leverages 
      and extends the capabilities of the IBM Smarter Commerce Portfolio, 
      including WebSphere 
      eCommerce, Sterling 
      Order Management solution, Emptoris, 
      Worklight, 
      Cast 
      Iron, and Tealeaf, 
      to deliver a seamless and unified commerce experience for its clients. 
      Perficient&#8217;s experts design, develop, implement and integrate secure and 
      scalable IBM Smarter Commerce solutions that integrate with the clients&#8217; 
      business systems and manage business processes. Perficient creates a 
      solution that includes a single view of customers&#8217; buying patterns and 
      preferences across the entire commerce continuum. This results in the 
      company&#8217;s clients garnering better customer insights, creating 
      actionable analytics and delivering targeted promotions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The informed customer has caused forward-thinking organizations to 
      seamlessly integrate their buying, selling, marketing and service 
      processes in order to proactively meet a customer&#8217;s need and respond 
      quickly to changing demands,&#8221; said Ruth Minj, Perficient general manager 
      of IBM Industry Solutions. &#8220;The right tools and technologies create 
      increased transparency, visibility and efficiencies in an organization&#8217;s 
      value chain and also help them adopt new disruptive technologies like 
      social media and mobile. Our expertise in IBM&#8217;s Smarter Commerce 
      technologies can help clients evolve their business, leading to enhanced 
      customer loyalty and improved business results.&#8221;

Zoetis Inc through an exchange offer in which

			Zoetis To File Registration Statement; Comments 
      on Pfizer&#8217;s Split-off Plans for Remaining Interest in Zoetis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS) announced it intends to file a Registration 
      Statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
      today in connection with the proposed exchange offer announced by Pfizer 
      Inc. (NYSE: PFE). As part of the offer, Pfizer shareholders will be able 
      to exchange all, some or none of their shares of Pfizer common stock for 
      shares of Zoetis common stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer currently holds approximately 80% of the outstanding common stock 
      of Zoetis. If the exchange offer is fully subscribed, Pfizer will no 
      longer have a controlling ownership interest in Zoetis, and Zoetis will 
      become a fully independent company upon completion of the exchange 
      offer. If the exchange offer is undersubscribed, Pfizer would distribute 
      less than 400,985,000 shares of Zoetis common stock. In that case, 
      Pfizer would continue to own an interest in Zoetis and, depending on the 
      number of shares of Zoetis common stock distributed in the exchange 
      offer, Pfizer could retain voting control of Zoetis with respect to the 
      election of directors. In addition, Pfizer could use additional exchange 
      offers or a special dividend to all Pfizer shareholders to complete the 
      disposition of its Zoetis shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s announcement marks the final step in our journey to make 
      Zoetis a fully independent company,&#8221; said Zoetis Chief Executive Officer 
      Juan Ram&#243;n Alaix, commenting on the Pfizer announcement. &#8220;We have been 
      preparing for this day for nearly two years, and we are excited by the 
      opportunity to stand on our own as the world&#8217;s leading animal health 
      company. We will continue serving our customers in ways that make a 
      meaningful difference to their businesses, and develop long-term 
      partnerships delivering results that matter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We thank Pfizer&#8217;s leadership team and colleagues for their support 
      throughout this entire process, and we will continue to work with them 
      as we complete the transition to our own infrastructure,&#8221; said Alaix. 
      &#8220;We remain confident in the long-term success of our growth strategies 
      and financial performance based on the character of our people, the 
      diversity of our business model and the fundamental drivers that are 
      evident in the animal health industry today.&#8221;

        Better positions Pfizer to focus on its core business as an innovative

        The completion of the full separation of Zoetis expected to be 
        accretive to Pfizer&#8217;s EPS beginning in 2014
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced its intention to split off its 
      remaining interest in Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS), through an exchange 
      offer. Zoetis, formerly Pfizer&#8217;s animal health business, completed its 
      initial public offering (IPO) in February 2013. In the exchange offer, 
      Pfizer shareholders can exchange all, some or none of their shares of 
      Pfizer common stock for shares of Zoetis common stock owned by Pfizer. 
      The exchange offer is anticipated to be tax-free for participating 
      Pfizer shareholders in the United States, except with respect to cash 
      received in lieu of a fractional share. The completion of the full 
      separation of Zoetis is expected to be accretive to Pfizer&#8217;s earnings 
      per share beginning in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer also announced today that, in connection with the planned 
      split-off, it has received a waiver of the 180-day lock-up from the 
      joint book running managers of the Zoetis IPO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased with Zoetis&#8217;s performance since the IPO in February. 
      Given the strong demand in the IPO and a favorable market environment, 
      we concluded that now is the appropriate time to distribute our 
      remaining stake in Zoetis,&#8221; said Ian Read, Pfizer Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer. &#8220;We expect that this exchange offer will continue to 
      deliver value to Pfizer shareholders by reducing the number of our 
      outstanding shares in a tax-efficient manner. At the same time, we 
      believe that this transaction better positions Pfizer to focus on our 
      core business as an innovative biopharmaceutical company.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The exchange offer is designed to permit Pfizer shareholders to exchange 
      their shares of Pfizer common stock for shares of Zoetis common stock at 
      a 7% discount, subject to an upper limit of 0.9898 shares of Zoetis 
      common stock per share of Pfizer common stock. If the upper limit is not 
      in effect, for each $100.00 of shares of Pfizer common stock accepted in 
      the exchange offer, tendering shareholders would receive approximately 
      $107.52 of Zoetis common stock. These values will be determined by the 
      simple arithmetic average of the daily volume-weighted average price of 
      Pfizer common stock and Zoetis common stock on the NYSE during the three 
      consecutive trading days ending on and including the expiration date of 
      the exchange offer, which are expected to be June 17, June 18 and June 
      19, 2013. The final exchange ratio, reflecting the number of shares of 
      Zoetis common stock that tendering shareholders will receive for each 
      share of Pfizer common stock accepted in the exchange offer, will be 
      announced by press release by 4:30 p.m., New York City time, on June 19, 
      2013, unless the exchange offer is extended or terminated. The final 
      exchange ratio, when announced, and a daily indicative exchange ratio 
      beginning at the end of the third day of the exchange offer period, will 
      also be available at www.zoetisexchange.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The completion of the exchange offer is subject to certain conditions, 
      including: the distribution of at least 160,394,000 shares of Zoetis 
      common stock in exchange for shares of Pfizer common stock tendered in 
      the exchange offer; the receipt of an opinion of counsel that the 
      exchange offer will qualify for tax-free treatment to Pfizer and its 
      participating shareholders; and the continued effectiveness and validity 
      of a private letter ruling received from the U.S. Internal Revenue 
      Service, regarding the exchange offer, among other things.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer owns 400,985,000 shares of Zoetis Class B common stock, which 
      represents approximately 80.2% of the outstanding common stock of 
      Zoetis. Prior to completion of the exchange offer, Pfizer intends to 
      convert its Zoetis Class B common stock into Zoetis Class A common stock 
      in an amount sufficient such that Zoetis Class A common stock may be 
      distributed in the exchange offer. Upon the completion of a fully 
      subscribed exchange offer, only Zoetis Class A common stock (which will 
      be reclassified as Zoetis common stock) will remain outstanding. The 
      largest possible number of shares of Pfizer common stock that will be 
      accepted in the exchange offer equals 400,985,000 divided by the final 
      exchange ratio. Because the exchange offer is subject to proration if 
      the exchange offer is oversubscribed, the number of shares of Pfizer 
      common stock that Pfizer accepts in the exchange offer may be less than 
      the number of shares tendered. If the exchange offer is undersubscribed, 
      Pfizer would distribute less than 400,985,000 shares of Zoetis common 
      stock. In that case, Pfizer would continue to own an interest in Zoetis 
      and, depending on the number of shares of Zoetis common stock 
      distributed in the exchange offer, Pfizer could retain voting control of 
      Zoetis with respect to the election of directors. In addition, Pfizer 
      could use additional exchange offers or a special dividend to all Pfizer 
      shareholders to complete the disposition of its Zoetis shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The exchange offer is voluntary for Pfizer shareholders. No action is 
      necessary for Pfizer shareholders who choose not to participate, and 
      their existing Pfizer shares will not be impacted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The terms and conditions of the exchange offer will be more fully 
      described in a registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Zoetis 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a tender offer 
      statement on Schedule TO to be filed by Pfizer with the SEC today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs  Co. and 
      Morgan Stanley will serve as the dealer managers for the exchange offer.

      of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in 
      connection with any discussion of future performance, actions or events. 
      Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, 
      actions or events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties as 
      discussed in Pfizer&#8217;s periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and 
      its current reports on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC. Many factors could 
      cause actual results to differ materially from Pfizer&#8217;s forward-looking 
      statements. This communication also contains statements about the 
      exchange offer and when it is expected to be accretive to Pfizer&#8217;s 
      earnings per share. Many factors could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from Pfizer&#8217;s forward-looking statements with respect to the 
      exchange offer, including the ability to satisfy the conditions of the 
      exchange offer, and risks relating to any unforeseen liabilities, future 
      capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic 
      performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses and future 
      prospects. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here is 
      considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a 
      complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted 
      factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization 
      of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in 
      results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking 
      statements could include, among other things, business disruption, 
      operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties 
      and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on 
      Pfizer&#8217;s consolidated financial condition, results or operations or 
      liquidity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many 
      of which are beyond the control of Pfizer, and are potentially 
      inaccurate assumptions. You should not put undue reliance on 
      forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of 
      the date on which they are made. Pfizer undertakes no obligation to 
      publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new 
      information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required 
      by applicable securities laws. Investors should understand that it is 
      not possible to predict or identify all such factors.

      Zoetis will file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that 
      will include a Prospectus. The Prospectus will contain important 
      information about the exchange offer, Pfizer, Zoetis and related 
      matters, and Pfizer will deliver the Prospectus to holders of Pfizer 
      common stock. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE 
      PROSPECTUS, AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC, WHEN 
      THEY BECOME AVAILABLE AND BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT DECISION. None of 
      Pfizer, Zoetis or any of their respective directors or officers or the 
      dealer managers appointed with respect to the exchange offer makes any 
      recommendation as to whether you should participate in the exchange 
      offer. This announcement is for informational purposes only and is 
      neither an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any 
      securities or a recommendation as to whether investors should 
      participate in the exchange offer. The offer will be made solely by the 
      Prospectus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Holders of Pfizer common stock may obtain the Prospectus, and other 
      related documents filed with the SEC, at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference 
      Room, located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, and will be 
      able to obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room 
      by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Holders of Pfizer common stock 
      will also be able to obtain copies of the Prospectus, and other 
      documents filed with the SEC, by mail from the SEC at the above address, 
      at prescribed rates. The SEC also maintains a website that contains 
      reports, proxy statements and other information that Pfizer and Zoetis 
      file electronically with the SEC. The address of that website is http://www.sec.gov. 
      Holders of Pfizer common stock will also be able to obtain a copy of the 
      Prospectus by clicking on the appropriate link on this website. 
      Alternatively, Georgeson Inc., the information agent for the exchange 
      offer, will, upon request, arrange to send the Prospectus to holders of 
      Pfizer common stock who call 1-866-628-6024 (toll-free in the United 
      States), 1-800-223-2064 (toll-free for banks and brokers), 00800

			Oberthur Technologies&#8217; dragonFly NFC SIM Card Certified by MasterCard 
      and Visa
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Oberthur Technologies, one of the world&#8217;s largest providers of security 
      and identification solutions and services based on smart card 
      technologies, today announced that it has obtained certifications from 
      MasterCard and Visa, two of the largest global payment networks, for its 
      dragonFly NFC SIM card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Oberthur Technologies&#8217; NFC SIM cards are available in all form factors 
      including 2FF, 3FF, 4FF, and SMD&#185;, and are compatible with all networks 
      2G, 3G and 4G. Through MasterCard and Visa&#8217;s certifications, Oberthur 
      Technologies is able to provide flexibility for payment scheme users and 
      enhance security for payment transactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Oberthur Technologies gained recognition for the high security levels of 
      its NFC SIM cards, when it was the first to receive the EAL4+ 
      certification and is today the sole card vendor to offer a built-in 
      anti-virus. With the MasterCard and Visa certifications, Oberthur 
      Technologies reinforces its position worldwide, in the field of secure 
      mobile banking.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This latest generation of Oberthur Technologies&#8217; NFC SIM card, 
      dragonFly, is fast, convenient and secure. As the fastest card on the 
      market, it offers speedy download of new services and files through an 
      integrated &#8220;NFC Turbo Engine&#8221;, based on a hardware accelerator and 
      software optimisation. This dramatically reduces the time a transaction 
      takes to run; transport access validation or transport ticketing 
      transactions are granted faster than with any other SIM card. The 
      dragonFly NFC SIM card is also the most secure with its integrated 
      anti-virus; if attacked, it isolates the malware, preventing the 
      corrupted application from interacting with any other application 
      containing stored sensitive data. Finally, its convenience stems from 
      the wide variety of applications it offers: transport, identification, 
      access control, loyalty and payment. In the field of payment, Oberthur 
      Technologies demonstrates a true competitive advantage by offering 
      MasterCard and Visa certified NFC SIM cards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very proud to announce that our NFC SIM card is now certified by 
      MasterCard and Visa payment schemes, offering our customers the 
      flexibility they need to efficiently address their markets&#8221; said 
      Christian Lefebvre, Managing Director of the Telecom Product Line at 
      Oberthur Technologies. &#8220;This critical milestone has been passed thanks 
      to our best-in-class expertise in the Payment and Telecom fields, to 
      deliver state-of-the-art products to our customers&#8221;.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA May 22 (Reuters) - Authorities have bypassed a
court order and re-arrested an executive at Chevron Corp's
 Indonesian unit in a graft case that highlights growing
tension with big oil companies in a country struggling to
reverse a decline in oil production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorney general's office said on Wednesday it had
re-arrested Bachtiar Abdul, an executive at PT Chevron Pacific
Indonesia, despite a Nov. 27 court order that cleared him of any
wrongdoing and released him from detention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bachtiar was one of four Chevron employees detained on Sept.
26 in an investigation into possible corruption at a Sumatra
cleanup site set up to remove toxins secreted into the soil
after drilling by Chevron, which has operated in Indonesia for
more than 90 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, South Jakarta District Court ordered his
release, citing a lack of evidence of any criminal activity. He
was re-arrested on Friday, said Setia Untung, a spokesman for
the attorney general's office, which accuses him of abusing his
authority, breaking the law and causing state losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case adds to mounting concern among multinational
companies over rising economic nationalism. Indonesia has
received repeated warnings from energy and mining companies over
legal uncertainty, particularly after a recent spate of court
decisions including an order in November to dismantle the
domestic oil and gas regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new regulator, SKKMigas, has expressed its alarm over
the case and the impact it will have on energy production by the
former OPEC member for which oil imports have become a major
factor behind a growing trade deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This issue will definitely disrupt exploration operations
and the exploitation of oil and gas," regulator spokesman Elan
Biantoro said. "Upstream oil and gas workers fear they may some
day be hit by a similar situation if they are criminalised when
a civil case becomes a criminal case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"PROSECUTION STAGE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case pits Indonesia's biggest crude producer, PT Chevron
Pacific Indonesia, against prosecutors in an investigation
involving five Chevron employees and two contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, Jakarta Corruption Court found the two
contractors guilty of graft. They were jailed for 5 and 6 years
respectively, fined and ordered to repay losses to the state
totalling about $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to both Chevron and SKKMigas, all costs
involved in the project were borne by the company and therefore
the state did not suffer any losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the attorney-general's office, the South
Jakarta District Court order only referred to the investigation
stage. The case was "now being processed in the prosecution
stage," attorney-general spokesman Setia Untung said. "There's
an investigation stage and a prosecution stage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bachtiar had failed twice to heed a summons, said Adi
Toegarisman, who heads the attorney-general's office team
investigating the Chevron case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He abused his authority, he broke the law and caused state
losses as a consequence," he told Reuters. He declined to
comment on how much the graft case had cost the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia's human rights commission, Komnas HAM, this week
accused the attorney-general's office of violating the human
rights of the Chevron employees and contractors. Its 400-page
report will be sent to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the
judicial commission and parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several major foreign energy companies have found themselves
at odds with the government. Some have openly criticised the
central bank's move to force them to initially put all their
earnings onshore, which they argue contradicts the production
sharing contracts they work under with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early this year, authorities effectively sacked the head of
Exxon Mobil Corp's Indonesia operations by refusing to
renew his work permit and complaining about the company's slow
progress over a major new oil field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French oil giant Total SA has also accused the
government of dragging its heels in making a decision on the
company's future investment in a large gas field it operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Minister Jero Wacik has said the government would not
get involved in the Chevron case. "If they're guilty punish
them, if they're not, don't," he told a recent conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says Bachtiar's latest detention was a violation of
the court order and of his legal and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The courts must step in and protect the rights of our
people against this kind of action," Chevron Indonesia said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasingly testy exchanges come as Indonesia tries to
meet surging domestic energy demand and reverse an almost
two-decade decline in crude-oil production. With its oilfields
old and running dry and no new finds on the horizon, investment
in exploration will not likely help the country meet future
demand any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By John Foley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who&#8217;s the smarter investor in China  HSBC or Goldman Sachs? The UK lender&#8217;s business in China has grown impressively. But based on their recent sale of stakes in two of China&#8217;s biggest financial groups, the Wall Street investment bank has the edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman just sold its remaining stake in ICBC for around $1.1 billion, seven years after first buying shares in the Chinese megabank. By holding on through ICBC&#8217;s stock-market listing and selling its shares in slices, Goldman has turned an initial investment of $2.6 billion  split between the bank, its clients and some employees  into $9.9 billion. Add dividends of $1.7 billion, according to public filings, and Goldman&#8217;s profit is 3.5 times what it put in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that basis, HSBC&#8217;s exit from insurer Ping An in February was a bigger triumph. It first invested ten years ago, so it has had more time to ride the upward trajectory of China&#8217;s insurance sector. Selling out for $9.4 billion, and factoring in around $550 million of cumulative dividends, HSBC&#8217;s $1.8 billion investment looks to have made a 4.5 times return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such multiples, though, don&#8217;t reflect the length of the investment. Try another measure: internal rate of return, which weights cash flows by how long they took to come to fruition. On that basis, Goldman&#8217;s investment in ICBC, excluding the effect of taxes, created an annual gain of 36 percent. HSBC&#8217;s was a lesser  but still impressive  23 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the difference? It might be to do with expectations. Both banks ploughed resources into beefing up their partners&#8217; systems and risk management. But Goldman never had a prayer of owning ICBC, which is many times the Wall Street firm&#8217;s size. It invested once, and sat tight. The stake may have earned some goodwill, but the benefits were largely financial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC, by contrast, went back for more, tripling its initial investment in Ping An by the end of 2005. It hoped China would one day let foreign financial groups buy even more  or that it would develop a partnership with Ping An. Instead, China&#8217;s financial sector remains effectively closed.
Still, shareholders in both can feel content. HSBC&#8217;s average pre-tax return on equity since 2002 has been 16 percent; Goldman&#8217;s 22 percent. While Goldman comes out better, both can claim their Chinese investments were their best features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Merck &amp; Co Inc said it has entered into a $5 billion share repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs Group Inc, as the drug giant looks to prop up shareholder value in face of stiff competition from makers of less-costly generics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR), Merck has agreed to repurchase about 99.5 million shares from Goldman Sachs based on current market prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have consensus share count post-Q1 earnings to quantify the impact of the accelerated repurchase, but we believe this is a positive sign of Merck attempting to create shareholder value," ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck's board had authorized additional purchases of up to $15 billion of its common stock and said that it would buy back about $7.5 billion over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Merck's asthma drug Singulair plunged 75 percent to $337 million in the first quarter. The pill was Merck's biggest product, with annual sales of $6 billion, before cheaper generics flooded the U.S. market last August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More pain from generics is in store. Merck's Maxalt migraine drug recently lost patent protection and its Temodar brain cancer medicine will soon face cheaper copycats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck aims to seek marketing approval this year for a handful of new drugs, including a sleep aid called suvorexant now before U.S. regulators. It is counting on these products to help offset plunging sales of Singulair, Maxalt and Temodar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Chris Gallagher)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE City (Reuters) - After dozens of meetings with executives and regulators, 100,000 hours of employee training and an immeasurable amount of public grief, Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) Lloyd Blankfein claimed success in putting the bank and his legacy as CEO back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Goldman's annual meeting on Thursday, Blankfein unveiled details of a three-year review and overhaul of the bank's practices in dealing with clients, following high-profile missteps that tarnished its reputation in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The overhaul imposes checks, including through elaborate computerized systems, to ensure that the bank is fair to clients and avoids conflicts, such as being on different sides of the same trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's changes do not appear to go beyond the kind of committee reviews that other Wall Street firms now do, executives at two rival banks said. But they added the use of computerized analyses to detect unfair deals could make the system more effective than rivals' at catching potential pitfalls, even if it costs them some business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They want to get their reputation back," said Roy Smith, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. "They know that means giving up some business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman faced public outrage in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis over accusations, including a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit, that it had treated clients improperly. Blankfein and other executives also faced intense grilling on Capitol Hill, which deeply embarrassed its CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After serving as CEO since June 2006 and steering the bank through the financial crisis, the 58-year-old Blankfein does not want to leave his post until he feels the bank's reputation and his own legacy are fully restored, people familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The month after the SEC's charges, Blankfein set up the Business Standards Committee. He traveled around the world to hold town-hall-style discussions with Goldman partners and managing directors. In a video on Goldman's website on Thursday, Blankfein tells a group of employees not to be afraid to call him if a problem appears because the risk of reputational damage outweighs the cost of possibly wasting his time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone has to have big eyes, big ears, know what's going on around them, and be policemen for the organization," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venue of the annual meeting - in Salt Lake City, where Goldman is heralded as an economic savior because of its recent expansion there - provided a friendlier atmosphere than other recent shareholder gatherings, where protestors drowned out talk of the committee's progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company won shareholder support for its 12 nominees to the board and its positions on the seven other proposals on the ballot.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE City May 23 (Reuters) - After dozens of meetings
with executives and regulators, 100,000 hours of employee
training and an immeasurable amount of public grief, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc's Lloyd Blankfein claimed success in
putting the bank and his legacy as CEO back on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Goldman's annual meeting on Thursday, Blankfein unveiled
details of a three-year review and overhaul of the bank's
practices in dealing with clients, following high-profile
missteps that tarnished its reputation in the aftermath of the
financial crisis. The overhaul imposes checks, including through
elaborate computerized systems, to ensure that the bank is fair
to clients and avoids conflicts, such as being on different
sides of the same trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's changes do not appear to go beyond the kind of
committee reviews that other Wall Street firms now do,
executives at two rival banks said. But they added the use of
computerized analyses to detect unfair deals could make the
system more effective than rivals' at catching potential
pitfalls, even if it costs them some business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They want to get their reputation back," said Roy Smith, a
professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.
"They know that means giving up some business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman faced public outrage in the aftermath of the 2008
financial crisis over accusations, including a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission lawsuit, that it had treated clients
improperly. Blankfein and other executives also faced intense
grilling on Capitol Hill, which deeply embarrassed its CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After serving as CEO since June 2006 and steering the bank
through the financial crisis, the 58-year-old Blankfein does not
want to leave his post until he feels the bank's reputation and
his own legacy are fully restored, people familiar with the
situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The month after the SEC's charges, Blankfein set up the
Business Standards Committee. He traveled around the world to
hold town-hall-style discussions with Goldman partners and
managing directors. In a video on Goldman's website on Thursday,
Blankfein tells a group of employees not to be afraid to call
him if a problem appears because the risk of reputational damage
outweighs the cost of possibly wasting his time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone has to have big eyes, big ears, know what's going
on around them, and be policemen for the organization," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venue of the annual meeting - in Salt Lake City, where
Goldman is heralded as an economic savior because of its recent
expansion there - provided a friendlier atmosphere than other
recent shareholder gatherings, where protestors drowned out talk
of the committee's progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company won shareholder support for its 12 nominees to
the board and its positions on the seven other proposals on the
ballot. The lowest vote the company received was 68 percent
approval for its new stock compensation plan for executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such plans tend to win support from around 85 percent of
shareholders, according to proxy solicitor Georgeson Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHECKS AND BALANCES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the reforms, Goldman staffers are expected to be
"looking around corners" to make sure deals that seem lucrative
in the short term won't harm the bank later, the co-chairs of
Goldman's Business Standards Committee told reporters at a
briefing on Wednesday. The panel, led by J. Michael Evans and
Gerald Corrigan, performed the review and implemented changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans said many proposed deals will now encounter hurdles
that didn't exist before. If they don't clear them, Goldman
won't get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Goldman salespeople and bankers could sell
clients almost anything they wanted to buy. Under the reforms,
they must now run transactions through computerized processes -
which the bank calls matrixes - and sometimes get top-level
approvals to make sure deals are appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction that don't pass muster are taken to more senior
Goldman managers. Deals that reach the top executives tend to
involve large derivatives or complicated financing schemes,
complex structured derivative products or products that involve
tax, accounting or regulatory arbitrage, Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New products proposed by Goldman staff also must run through
a committee for approval, Corrigan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be possible for clients to appeal. Evans gave
examples of one unnamed IPO client that took its business
elsewhere when Goldman rejected its plan, and another that
"begrudgingly" made changes so that Goldman would advise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans said crisis-era deals, like the Abacus and Timberwolf
derivatives trades that were documented in a U.S. Senate
subcommittee report and involved litigation, would likely not be
approved in the same manner today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abacus, a synthetic collateralized debt obligation, was the
focus of the SEC case. The regulator had said that Goldman
allowed Paulson &amp; Co to help pick residential mortgage-backed
securities underlying the CDO while the hedge fund was also
betting against the security, and failed to disclose that to
buyers of the CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Abacus came today, it would run through a totally
different framework for approval than before," Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment banker has agreed to a five-year securities industry ban and a record fine to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he broke rules against influence peddling to win bond underwriting business in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Neil Morrison, 38, accepted what the SEC said was the first industry ban for violating "pay-to-play" rules governing the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also agreed to a $100,000 civil fine, which the SEC called the largest individual penalty in such a case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's settlement was announced eight months after Goldman struck its own $12 million settlement with the SEC over the case, which involved contributions to the 2010 gubernatorial campaign of then-Massachusetts State Treasurer Timothy Cahill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay-to-play refers to the providing of cash or other contributions to public officials in exchange for political favors or the awarding of contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These tough sanctions against Morrison show that we take abuses of the pay-to-play rules in the municipal securities industry very seriously and will hold individuals accountable for their violations," Elaine Greenberg, chief of the municipal securities and public pensions unit of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kiley, a lawyer for Morrison, in an email said his client is happy to have resolved the matter, and agreed with Greenberg's characterization of the sanctions' severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That this is the first time there has been an industry bar for a violation of the pay-to-play rule is a pretty good indication the law wasn't clear at the time of the conduct," Kiley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said: "Neil Morrison violated applicable regulatory rules as well as Goldman Sachs' internal policies. We detected his activities, promptly alerted regulators, terminated his employment, and fully cooperated with investigations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEARING MANY HATS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Morrison, a resident of Taunton, Massachusetts, helped run Cahill's campaign from his Goldman office in Boston, where he was a vice president, during work hours while using the bank's phone and e-mail system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By performing such roles as speechwriter, fundraiser, strategist and media coordinator, Morrison got more access to Cahill and his staff, giving Goldman a leg up on mandates to underwrite municipal bond offerings, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From my standpoint as an advisor/consultant/friend I am saying, PLEASE don't give these (underwriter) slots away willy-nilly," Morrison once e-mailed a deputy treasurer in Cahill's office, according to the SEC. "You are in the fight of your lives and need to reward loyalty and encourage friendship."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Goldman was able to participate in 30 Massachusetts bond offerings from which it should have been disqualified because of Morrison's activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman did not admit wrongdoing in its agreement to settle with the SEC. At the time, it also settled a related case brought by Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fine is small relative to the amount of business that Morrison may have generated for Goldman, said James Cox, a Duke University law professor.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp won a round in a complex patent war on Thursday when the International Trade Commission said the company's popular Xbox entertainment system did not violate a patent owned by Google subsidiary Motorola Mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the ITC had found that Microsoft infringed, it could have barred the Xbox from being imported into the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight over the Xbox is related to a larger smartphone patent war between Apple, Microsoft and the mobile phone makers who use Google's Android software, including Motorola Mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility originally accused Microsoft of infringing upon five patents when it filed its complaint in 2010.

		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists entirely of 
      30-year fixed rate mortgages (FRMs) to borrowers with strong credit 
      profiles, full documentation, low leverage, and significant liquid 
      reserves. A 69.4% CLTV provides a significant buffer against potential 
      home price declines. Strong borrower quality is reflected in the 773 
      weighted average (WA) original FICO, $372,144 WA household income and 
      $419,575 WA liquid reserves. In addition, third-party due diligence was 
      conducted on 100% of the pool and the results indicated strong 
      underwriting controls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Weak Representations and Warranties (RWs) Framework: While the 
      transaction benefits from JPMCB and J.P. Morgan Mortgage Acquisition 
      Corp. (JPMMAC) (rated 'A+'/'F1') as rep providers for more than 92% of 
      the pool, Fitch believes the value of the RW framework is significantly 
      diluted by the presence of qualifying and conditional language that 
      substantially reduces lender loan breach liability and the inclusion of 
      sunsets on three provisions. The sunset trigger has been simplified and 
      strengthened in this transaction. While the agency believes that the 
      high credit quality pool and clean diligence results mitigate the RW 
      risks to some degree, Fitch considered the weaker framework in its 
      analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Originators with Limited Performance History: The majority of the pool 
      was originated by lenders with limited non-agency performance history. 
      Although the significant contribution of loans from these originators is 
      a concern, Fitch believes the lack of performance history is partially 
      mitigated by the 100% third-party diligence conducted on these loans 
      that resulted in immaterial findings. Fitch also considers the credit 
      enhancement (CE) on this transaction sufficient to mitigate the 
      originator risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how 
      the ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than 
      assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national 
      levels. The implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some 
      of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that 
      the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the 
      surveillance of the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected 
      lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The 
      model currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For 
      one of the top 10 regions in the mortgage pool, 
      Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL (11.7% of the mortgage pool), Fitch's SHP 
      model does not project declines in home prices. Fitch conducted 
      sensitivity analyses assuming sMVDs of 10%, 15%, and 20% for this 
      identified metropolitan area. The sensitivity analyses indicated no 
      impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model-projected 14% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In its analysis, Fitch considered placing a greater emphasis on recent 
      economic performance in determining market value declines. While Fitch's 
      current loan loss model looks to three years of historical data and one 
      year of projections, this does not incorporate recent notable economic 
      improvement. To reflect the more recent economic environment, a 
      sensitivity analysis was performed using two years of historical 
      economic data and two years of projections. The result of this 
      sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss 
      expectations for this transaction. This sensitivity analysis resulted in 
      a base sMVD of 13.2%, down from 14.0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      presale report titled 'J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust, Series 2013-2', dated

&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE City (Reuters) - After dozens of meetings with executives and regulators, 100,000 hours of employee training and an immeasurable amount of public grief, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) CEO Lloyd Blankfein claimed success in putting his bank and his legacy back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Goldman's annual meeting on Thursday, Blankfein unveiled details of a three-year review and overhaul of the bank's practices in dealing with clients, following high-profile missteps that tarnished its reputation in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The overhaul imposes a system of checks to ensure that the bank is fair to clients and avoids conflicts, such as being on different sides of the same trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman faced public outrage in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis over accusations that it had treated clients improperly. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the bank in April 2010, accusing it of misleading clients in a mortgage derivative deal. While the bank settled for $550 million without admitting anything more than having made a "mistake," Blankfein and other executives faced intense grilling on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the matter say the lawsuit and the hearings deeply embarrassed Goldman and Blankfein. After serving as CEO since June 2006 and steering the bank through the financial crisis, the 58-year-old Blankfein does not want to leave his post until he feels the bank's reputation and his own legacy are fully restored, these sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The month after the SEC's charges, Blankfein set up the Business Standards Committee. He traveled around the world to hold town-hall-style discussions with Goldman partners and managing directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video on Goldman's website on Thursday, Blankfein tells a group of employees not to be afraid to call him if a problem appears because the risk of reputational damage outweighs the cost of possibly wasting his time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone has to have big eyes, big ears, know what's going on around them, and be policemen for the organization," he says in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said on Thursday that the committee was part of a "much larger ongoing commitment to be open to change and to learn the right lessons from recent experiences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venue of the annual meeting - in Salt Lake City, where Goldman is heralded as an economic savior because of its recent expansion there - provided a friendlier atmosphere than other recent shareholder gatherings, where protestors and activists drowned out Blankfein's talk of the Business Standards Committee's progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company won shareholder support for its 12 nominees to the board and its positions on the seven other proposals on the ballot. Goldman said the directors had been "overwhelmingly approved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest vote the company received was 68 percent approval for its new stock compensation plan for executives. Proxy adviser ISS had recommended shareholders vote against the stock plan on grounds that it transfers too much wealth from shareholders to employees. Stock incentive plans tend to win support from around 85 percent of shareholders, according to proxy solicitor Georgeson Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHECKS AND BALANCES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the reforms, Goldman staffers are expected to be "looking around corners" to make sure deals that seem lucrative in the short term won't harm the bank later, the co-chairs of Goldman's Business Standards Committee told reporters at a briefing on Wednesday. The panel, led by J. Michael Evans and Gerald Corrigan, performed the review and implemented changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans said many proposed deals will now encounter hurdles that didn't exist before. If they don't clear them, Goldman won't get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Goldman salespeople and bankers could sell clients almost anything they wanted to buy. Under the reforms, they must now run transactions through computerized processes - which the bank calls matrixes - and sometimes get top-level approvals to make sure deals are appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction that don't pass muster are taken to more senior Goldman managers. First, a manager in the business unit examines the deal. If necessary, it goes to a panel of managing directors, and then a higher-level committee of top executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transactions that reach the top executives tend to be advisory deals that involve large derivatives or complicated financing schemes, complex structured derivative products or products that involve tax, accounting or regulatory arbitrage, Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New products proposed by Goldman staff also must run through a committee for approval, Corrigan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be possible for clients to appeal: A deal that's initially deemed unsuitable can be approved if changes are made, Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave examples of one unnamed IPO client that took its business elsewhere when Goldman rejected its plan, and another that "begrudgingly" made changes so that Goldman would advise on its offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans said crisis-era deals, like the Abacus and Timberwolf derivatives trades that were documented in a U.S. Senate subcommittee report and involved litigation, would likely not be approved in the same manner today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abacus, a synthetic collateralized debt obligation, was the focus of the SEC case. The regulator had said that Goldman allowed Paulson &amp; Co to help pick residential mortgage-backed securities underlying the CDO while the hedge fund was also betting against the security, and failed to disclose that to buyers of the CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Abacus came today, it would run through a totally different framework for approval than before," he said, adding that his team was "turning ourselves into a pretzel" to figure out ways to avoid such situations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Henry; Editing by Frank McGurty, John Wallace and Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) said it has appointed Barry Sommers, under whom the bank expanded its services to wealthy clients, to head its Chase consumer bank business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sommers, 44, who previously served as chief executive of the bank's wealth management business, joined JP Morgan through the Bear Sterns merger in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sommers was responsible for the company's Chase Private Client business, which has offices in nearly 1,400 Chase bank branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is using its private client business to make money from its branches at a time when more and more banking transactions are taking place online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's consumer bank has a network of about 5,600 branches across the United States and generated about $14 billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sommers replaces Ryan McInerney, who has been named by Visa Inc (V.N) as its president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Visa, McInerney will report to Chief Executive Charlie Scharf. Scharf also joined the credit card company from JPMorgan, where he headed retail banking operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scharf had hired McInerney several years ago to work for him at JPMorgan Chase, McInerney told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McInerney, 37, will replace John Partridge, who retired on March 31. He will receive an annual salary of $750,000, Visa said in a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is one of the largest issuers of Visa cards. It issued about 69.6 million Visa cards in 2012, according to a February 2013 Nilson report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cards issued by Chase, including credit, debit and prepaid, account for about 16 percent of spending on Visa cards, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies this year entered a new 10-year renewable partnership agreement under which JP Morgan will launch a payment platform powered by Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan shares were down 0.7 percent at $53, while Visa was down 1.1 percent at $178.38 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tanya Agrawal and Aman Shah in Bangalore, Additional Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Robin Paxton and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* McInerney to get annual salary of $750,000 at Visa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase said it has
appointed Barry Sommers, under whom the bank expanded its
services to wealthy clients, to head its Chase consumer bank
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sommers, 44, who previously served as chief executive of the
bank's wealth management business, joined JP Morgan through the
Bear Sterns merger in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sommers was responsible for the company's Chase Private
Client business, which has offices in nearly 1,400 Chase bank
branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is using its private client business to make money
from its branches at a time when more and more banking
transactions are taking place online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's consumer bank has a network of about 5,600
branches across the United States and generated about $14
billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sommers replaces Ryan McInerney, who has been named by Visa
Inc as its president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Visa, McInerney will report to Chief Executive Charlie
Scharf. Scharf also joined the credit card company from
JPMorgan, where he headed retail banking operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scharf had hired McInerney several years ago to work for him
at JPMorgan Chase, McInerney told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McInerney, 37, will replace John Partridge, who retired on
March 31. He will receive an annual salary of $750,000, Visa
said in a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is one of the largest issuers of Visa cards. It
issued about 69.6 million Visa cards in 2012, according to a
Feb. 2013 Nilson report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cards issued by Chase, including credit, debit and prepaid,
account for about 16 percent of spending on Visa cards,
according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies this year entered a new 10-year renewable
partnership agreement under which JP Morgan will launch a
payment platform powered by Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan shares were down 0.7 percent at $53, while Visa
was down 1.1 percent at $178.38 on Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A group of U.S. retailers, including Macy's Inc. (M.N) and Target Corp. (TGT.N), sued Visa Inc. (V.N) and MasterCard Inc. (MA.N) on Thursday, breaking off from a proposed $7.2 billion settlement reached last year over fees to process credit card transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, came ahead of a May 28 deadline for the millions of merchants affected by the settlement to decide whether to forego receiving damages under the pact and pursue their own legal action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That settlement, pending in federal court in Brooklyn, would end litigation on behalf of merchants that accused Visa and MasterCard of inflating so-called interchange, or swipe, fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many retailers criticized the proposed settlement after it was announced in July 2012.

But even so, merchants would still be bound by other injunctive relief if the settlement goes forward, including changes to Visa and MasterCard's swipe-fee rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pact received preliminary court approval from a federal judge in Brooklyn in November 2012, and Visa and Mastercard have said they are confident the settlement will win final approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Visa and MasterCard had no immediate comment on the new lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also named as plaintiffs in Thursday's lawsuit are JC Penney Co Inc.

&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE City May 23 (Reuters) - After dozens of meetings
with executives and regulators, 100,000 hours of employee
training and an immeasurable amount of public grief, Goldman
Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein is claiming a victory in getting his
bank, and his legacy, back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs Group Inc's annual meeting on
Thursday, Blankfein announced the culmination of a three-year
review and overhaul of the bank's practices following
high-profile missteps that tarnished its reputation in the
aftermath of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Goldman sales staff and bankers could sell
clients almost anything they wanted to buy. Under the reforms,
they must now run transactions through what the bank calls
technological matrixes - and sometimes get top-level approval -
to make sure deals are appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video to be released on Goldman's website on Thursday,
Blankfein tells a group of employees not to be afraid to call
him if a problem erupts, because the risk of reputational damage
outweighs the cost of possibly wasting his time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone has to have big eyes, big ears, know what's going
on around them and be policemen for the organization," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman staffers are expected to be "looking around corners"
to make sure deals that seem lucrative in the short term won't
harm the bank down the road, the co-chairs of Goldman's Business
Standards Committee told reporters on Wednesday. The panel, led
by J. Michael Evans and Gerald Corrigan, performed the review
and implemented changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had to influence and change behavior," said Corrigan.
"That's not an easy thing to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans said many proposed deals will now encounter hurdles
that didn't exist before. If they don't clear them, Goldman
won't get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients will have preapprovals for a certain "transaction
class" - or matrix - along the lines of deals they have already
done with Goldman. If a proposed transaction falls outside that
matrix, it gets routed to a "suitability" matrix that determines
whether the client's profile makes him eligible for the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transactions that don't pass muster in the matrixes are
escalated to more senior Goldman personnel. First, a manager in
the business unit examines the deal. If necessary, it then goes
to a panel of managing directors, and then to a higher-level
committee of top Goldman executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transactions that reach the higher levels tend to be
advisory deals that involve large derivatives or complicated
financing schemes; complex structured derivative products; or
products that involve tax, accounting or regulatory arbitrage,
Evans said. New products proposed by Goldman staff also must run
through a committee for approval, Corrigan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new system of Goldman approvals, it is possible for
clients to appeal. A deal that is initially deemed unsuitable
can be approved if changes are made, Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave examples of one unnamed IPO client that took its
business elsewhere when Goldman rejected its plan, and another
that "begrudgingly" made changes so that Goldman would advise on
its offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans said crisis-era deals, like the Abacus and Timberwolf
derivatives trades that were documented in a U.S. Senate
subcommittee report and involved litigation, would likely not be
approved in the same manner today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Abacus came today, it would run through a totally
different framework for approval than before," he said, adding
that his team was "turning ourselves into a pretzel" to figure
out ways to avoid such situations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goldman Sachs Releases the Business Standards Committee Impact Report
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today announced the publication 
      of the Business Standards Committee (BSC) Impact Report, which discusses 
      the changes the firm made as a result of the BSC and their impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In May 2010, we announced the creation of the Business Standards 
      Committee to conduct an extensive review of our business standards and 
      practices. In January 2011, we published the report of the BSC, which 
      made 39 recommendations for change, spanning client service, conflicts 
      and business selection, committee governance, training and professional 
      development and employee evaluation and incentives. In February this 
      year, we completed the full implementation of each of the 
      recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This three-year effort is the most extensive review of the firm&#8217;s 
      business standards and practices in the firm&#8217;s 147-year history.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The work underlying the BSC is part of a much larger, ongoing 
      commitment to be open to change and to learn the right lessons from 
      recent experiences,&#8221; said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and CEO. &#8220;We 
      believe that these attributes of our culture provide the foundation on 
      which to sustain the spirit and the impact of the changes we have made 
      in order to meet the long-term needs of our clients and continually 
      improve as a financial institution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We identified three unifying themes across the 39 BSC recommendations 
      which capture the elements of greatest change and impact on the firm: A 
      higher standard of client care, greater sensitivity and awareness of 
      reputational risk and a deeper commitment to individual and collective 
      accountability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A Higher Standard of Client Care
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We have elevated the standard of client care in our business. In 
      addition to a renewed focus on client service, long-term client 
      relationships and communication with our clients, we require greater 
      individual accountability for clients and their interests.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        We established the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee 
        and changed our committee governance structure and committee missions 
        to ensure that clients are at the very center of our decision-making.
      
			
        Revenue divisions and regions within the firm established a divisional 
        or regional Client and Business Standards Committee, respectively, and 
        undertook important steps to better facilitate communication with our 
        clients about our different roles and responsibilities.
      
			
        We enhanced our suitability framework to help us better assess whether 
        our clients have the background, experience and capacity to understand 
        the range of outcomes from transactions they execute with us, 
        particularly those transactions that are strategic or complex.
      
			
        We increased the emphasis on individual accountability for clients in 
        our annual employee performance review process and, for senior client 
        relationship professionals, in compensation determinations.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Greater Reputational Sensitivity and Awareness
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We now have a more systematic, integrated and comprehensive firmwide 
      framework for reputational risk monitoring and management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our major transaction review committees, including the newly created 
        Firmwide Suitability Committee and Firmwide New Activity Committee, 
        are applying more thorough and comprehensive standards for transaction 
        approvals, particularly for those transactions that present 
        reputational risk.
      
			
        We developed a consistent framework of
					disclosure, 
        documentation and control standards for underwriting activities, 
        private placements and other origination activities.
      
			
        We strengthened our business standards through a substantially 
        modified set of conflicts procedures.
      
			
        We introduced new pre-transaction sales practices to ensure heightened 
        due diligence and disclosure before a transaction is executed.
      
			
        We developed the capability to analyze the performance of our clients&#8217; 
        derivatives transactions, enabling our client relationship 
        professionals and their managers to engage with clients as appropriate 
        about the performance of these transactions.
      
			
        We changed our annual employee performance review and rewards 
        processes to include an assessment of reputational excellence, linking 
        &#8220;cultural&#8221; behavior to how our people are recognized and rewarded.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			A Deeper Commitment to Individual and Collective Accountability
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through the significant BSC training and professional development 
      effort, we have engaged our employees at all levels on the importance of 
      individual accountability as well as on our shared responsibility for 
      our clients and for protecting the firm&#8217;s reputation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our Chairman and CEO communicated a direct message to our senior 
        leaders and all employees about the requirement for a deeper 
        commitment to individual and collective accountability. The Chairman&#8217;s 
        Forum comprised 23, three-hour sessions with Lloyd and groups of our 
        partners and managing directors. It featured a case study and 
        intensive discussion focused on how we conduct ourselves in serving 
        our clients and protecting the firm&#8217;s reputation, especially during a 
        stressed market environment.
      
			
        We assess reputational excellence as part of our annual performance 
        review process. Beginning in 2011, reviewers of all professionals were 
        asked to rate reviewees on reputational excellence based on prescribed 
        criteria.
      
			
        As part of the performance review process, reviewers are asked to rate 
        the reviewee with regard to his or her focus on trust, transparency 
        and long-term orientation in connection with client relationships
      
			
        We strengthened our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and made 
        changes to our employee review process that reinforce the importance 
        that the firm is placing on individual and collective accountability.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Defining the Impact of the BSC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The impact of these and other changes discussed in the report means that 
      for all our employees the experience of initiating, approving and 
      executing a transaction for a client at Goldman Sachs is now 
      fundamentally different.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This difference reflects significant changes to processes, business 
      standards, documentation and transaction approvals, all of which impact 
      our approach to decision-making. Going forward, we will inevitably make 
      mistakes, but we commit to learn from them and respond in a way that 
      meets the high expectations of our clients, shareholders, other 
      stakeholders, regulators and the broader public.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Web Content
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the report, we have made additional material related to 
      the impact of the BSC available on our website, www.GoldmanSachs.com/BSCImpactReport.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This material includes video excerpts from the Chairman&#8217;s Forum, a 
      discussion on the impact of the Client and Business Standards Committee 
      and an example of a life cycle of a client transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO, Calif., May 23, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Visage Imaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pro Medicus Ltd. (ASX:PME), announced today that they have released Visage Ease (sm) version 1.3.0, available on the Apple App Store*. When used in tandem with the Visage&#174; 7 Enterprise Imaging Platform, Visage Ease provides authorized healthcare providers simple mobile access to imaging results using iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to numerous enhancements and performance improvements, Visage Ease 1.3.0 supports the iOS Notification Center to display alerts when studies meet the user's search criteria. Creation and management of notifications in Visage Ease is as simple as searching for studies a user wants to be informed of (e.g., today's CT studies, from facility 'x', with a label of 'stroke') and then via the mobile user interface, activating notifications for that particular search. When studies on the Visage 7 server match the search criteria, a PHI-free notification is sent to the user's iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Visage Ease 1.3.0 also includes the ability to attach images (either saved on the device or captured with the device's camera) to imaging studies on Visage 7. Mobile users now have a simple means of uploading non-DICOM images to imaging studies. After the images have been uploaded to Visage 7 from the mobile device, all appropriately authorized users of Visage 7 have access to the new images alongside the DICOM images. When multiple images are attached at the same time, they are displayed in the same Visage 7 viewport, and are presented as a single series of images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We've enhanced Visage Ease using customer feedback as our guidepost," said Dr. Sam Hupert, Chief Executive Officer, Visage Imaging and Pro Medicus. "Radiologists and referring physicians want mobile imaging access that's simple, with no training. That's why we adopted push notifications, because it's a workflow nearly everyone already understands, and it helps to improve usability when users are mobile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. Hupert continued, "Enterprise imaging has expanded beyond traditional modalities, and our customers encouraged us to think beyond the basics. They helped us to imagine non-DICOM image workflows that have the potential to improve patient care, for example, photos taken for line placement, wound care at the bedside, trauma-related reconstruction procedures in the OR, and emergent orthopedic presentations in the ED. When these non-DICOM images are viewed with diagnostic images on Visage 7, they have the potential to add clinical insights and improve radiologist interpretations. Imaging is no longer restricted to the four walls of the radiology department, and with Visage Ease, we're right there supporting our customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Please join Visage Imaging and learn more about Visage Ease and the Visage 7 Enterprise Imaging Platform at the upcoming SIIM 2013 Annual Meeting, Grapevine-Dallas, TX, June 6-9, 2013 at Booth 610. While at SIIM, plan on joining the following Visage Imaging speakers during the conference:&lt;/p&gt;

			CEA Celebrates Introduction of the SKILLS Visa 
      Act
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following statement is attributable to Gary Shapiro, president and 
      CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)&#174;, in 
      response to today&#8217;s introduction of the Supplying Knowledge-Based 
      Immigrants and Lifting Levels of STEM Visas Act, or the SKILLS Visa Act, 
      by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.):
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;On behalf of more than 2,000 of America&#8217;s leading technology companies, 
      CEA supports the SKILLS Visa Act as it recognizes that immigration 
      policy must be strategic to contribute to our national growth and 
      innovation. The legislation includes many long-overdue policy reforms 
      necessary to expand the U.S. economy, advance innovation and allow for 
      the development of small, entrepreneurial companies in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For America to remain the world&#8217;s leading innovator, we must embrace 
      immigration policy reforms like the SKILLS Visa Act that allow the 
      United States to be a magnet for the best and brightest to work and 
      build their businesses, create new jobs and contribute to the overall 
      success of our economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are not alone in this position. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman 
      Ben Bernanke urged policy makers to address the shortage of workers in 
      science, technology, engineering and math fields at a Joint Economic 
      Committee hearing, stressing that &#8216;as a country we need to think about 
      our policies in that area and try to do what we can to address shortages 
      of STEM workers&#8217; and &#8216;assure that talented people from all over the 
      world can come to the United States and participate in technical 
      innovation.&#8217;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;CEA urges the House Judiciary Committee to act immediately by 
      scheduling a legislative hearing and committee markup.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Strategic immigration reform has long been a tenet of CEA&#8217;s Innovation 
      Movement. Tonight at 5:00 p.m. ET, CEA is hosting a Google 
      Hangout on skilled immigration reform in conjunction with the March 
      for Innovation &#8211; a virtual push for smart, comprehensive immigration 
      reform. The Google Hangout will feature thought leaders and advocates, 
      including CEA&#8217;s own Senior Vice President of Government and Regulatory 
      Affairs Michael Petricone, who will discuss how to remedy the broken 
      immigration system in the United States and how we can keep high-skilled 
      workers and innovators in the country.

      Memorial Day weekend, some of NASCAR&#8217;s top drivers will give up their 
      usual pedal-to-the-metal speed to join Coca-Cola for a brisk walk at 
      three of the sport&#8217;s most popular tracks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The program kicks off this week at Charlotte Motor Speedway when Tony 
      Stewart, Denny Hamlin and Darrell Wallace, Jr. join fans for some 
      active, healthy fun at the first of three Coca-Cola Family Track Walks 
      this season. In its fourth consecutive year, the Coca-Cola Family Track 
      Walks program provides thousands of fans with the chance to get out and 
      get active by taking a lap of their own with their favorite drivers &#8211; on 
      foot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola Family Track Walks are a great way to participate in some 
      active family fun this racing season. We&#8217;re excited to give fans amazing 
      access to some of their favorite drivers and a unique vantage point from 
      the actual track,&#8221; said Andy McMillin, vice president Coca-Cola 
      trademark, Coca-Cola North America Group. &#8220;It&#8217;s a program that truly 
      embodies the Coca-Cola values by providing fans with fun, optimism and 
      delicious refreshment -- and, just like our new &#8216;Get The Ball Rolling&#8217; 
      initiative, Coca-Cola Family Track Walks encourages active, healthy 
      living, education and family togetherness.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;May 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase said it has
appointed Barry Sommers as chief executive of its consumer bank,
which includes its wealth management unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc had earlier announced that JPMorgan's current

			Barry Sommers Named CEO of the Consumer Bank at Chase
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase announced today that Barry Sommers has been named CEO of 
      the Consumer Bank at Chase, including Chase Wealth Management. Mr. 
      Sommers has previously been CEO of Chase Wealth Management, the business 
      serving Chase&#8217;s affluent customers, since 2010. He will continue to 
      report to Gordon Smith, CEO of Consumer  Community Banking.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously announced by VISA, Ryan McInerney, currently CEO of the 
      Consumer Bank, will be leaving Chase to become President of Visa. Mr. 
      McInerney has worked at JPMorgan Chase for eight years and has managed 
      the Consumer Bank since 2009. He will stay on through a short transition 
      to Mr. Sommers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Barry is an outstanding leader with a terrific track record of 
      success,&#8221; said Gordon Smith. &#8220;He has helped build our highly successful 
      Chase Wealth Management business, including Chase Private Client. Barry 
      and Ryan have been close partners and friends for several years, and we 
      expect a seamless transition as we bring these businesses under Barry&#8217;s 
      leadership.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Smith added: &#8220;We are disappointed to see Ryan leave the firm, VISA 
      is a close partner of ours and an organization we respect a great deal. 
      We are glad we will continue to have a relationship with him in his 
      career there. He&#8217;s an extraordinarily talented individual who has made a 
      strong positive impact on our company and we wish him the best.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under Mr. Sommers&#8217; leadership, Chase Wealth management has grown its 
      Deposits and Investments by 40% to more than $200 billion in only two 
      years. He has also led the expansion of Chase Private Client, increasing 
      the number of clients just over 4,000 in 2010 to more than 100,000. 
      Today, Chase Private Client is in over 1500 branches across 20 states.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Sommers came to JPMorgan Chase through the Bear Stearns merger, 
      where he managed their brokerage business. He joined Bear Stearns in 
      1996 and previously worked at Goldman Sachs. He graduated from Ohio 
      University and lives in Chappaqua, N.Y. with his wife and children.

			Internet2 Establishes Direct Peering to Microsoft Cloud Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Provides Faster Access to Secure Cloud Computing with Windows Azure 
      and Office 365 Education for Students, Educators, Researchers and 
      College Campuses World-Wide
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Students, staff and researchers at college campuses throughout the 
      nation, and participating institutions through regional, national and 
      global research and education partner networks will benefit from a 
      faster and more secure connection, thanks to a new peering arrangement 
      between Microsoft Corp. and Internet2, the nation&#8217;s premier research and 
      education network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This new agreement enables improved access to infrastructure and 
      application services that support virtual learning environments and 
      large-scale data intensive research projects, through the use of 
      Microsoft&#8217;s high performance computing clusters, collaboration tools, 
      and disaster recovery services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Campuses around the world will have enhanced access to two Internet2 
      NET+ offerings from Microsoft &#8211; Windows Azure and Microsoft Office 365 
      Education. These services will enable unmetered access to both the 
      high-performance computing and the communications infrastructure to aid 
      collaboration. This peering service is part of ongoing collaborative 
      efforts between Microsoft and the Internet2 community to bring other 
      enhanced services to researchers, educators, and students that leverage 
      the Internet2 Network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft and Internet2 have agreed to establish direct peering to 
      leverage the nation&#8217;s fastest research and education network in bringing 
      the power and diversity of Microsoft cloud services to the entire 
      education and research community,&#8221; said Shelton Waggener, senior vice 
      president, Internet2.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very excited to work collaboratively with Internet2 and the 
      Regional Education Networks to help schools quickly build, deploy, and 
      manage cloud applications so they can benefit from big data insights. 
      Windows Azure&#8217;s global and scalable cloud infrastructure enables 
      education institutions to meet their research goals and serve their 
      students&#8217; needs on an open and flexible cloud platform,&#8221; said Margo Day, 
      vice president, Microsoft US Education.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Big Data researchers need the power of a service like Windows Azure. 
      With Internet2, they will be able to transfer very large data sets to 
      and from Windows Azure across Internet2&#8217;s 100 Gigabit per second 
      network,&#8221; said Kelli Trosvig, vice president for UW Information 
      Technology and chief information officer, University of Washington. 
      &#8220;This same high-performance will also be available for applications such 
      as Office 365 Education.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The move to privately peer the Microsoft data centers to the Internet2 
      Network eliminates the need to traverse these very large data sets over 
      the public Internet. This enables a high-bandwidth connection for 
      students, faculty and staff to use Windows Azure and Office 365. 
      Bandwidth is managed and ensures high-speed delivery, with minimal delay 
      or latency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "During our service validation phase of Office 365 Education and Windows 
      Azure, both sides quickly realized that these services not only address 
      campuses' big data research, communication, collaboration and compute 
      needs but also enable the higher education community to be HIPAA and 
      FERPA compliant," said Elias G. Eldayrie, vice president and chief 
      information officer, University of Florida.
			"Microsoft has worked 
      closely with us to understand and meet our needs and is committed to 
      working with higher education throughout the process."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Internet2 recently completed a dramatic expansion to its network&#8212;the 
      nation's first 100 Gigabit per second nationwide open, software-defined 
      network (SDN)&#8212;that is built to support advanced services and cloud 
      applications to spur new waves of innovation in education, research and 
      industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Funded in part through the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s National 
      Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), along with Internet2 
      partners, the upgraded network uses brand new 100G technology and has an 
      unprecedented 8.8 Terabits of capacity. The Internet2 Network is the 
      first national network to deploy 100G waves on its entire footprint, and 
      the most sophisticated research and education platform in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Working with its regional network partners, the Internet2 Network 
      enables access to advanced networking features for more than 200,000 of 
      the country's community anchor institutions, including libraries, 
      hospitals, K-12 schools, community colleges, and public safety 
      organizations. The network infrastructure also will support advanced 
      applications, such as HD and multi-cast video, distance learning and 
      telemedicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Internet2's members also can leverage the new Internet2 Network to 
      deliver other cloud services and keep pace with the exponential growth 
      in Big Data science being driven by the nation's collaborative 
      researchers in labs and universities. Internet2 NET+ Services currently 
      offers more than 30 cloud services to college campuses nationwide that 
      are cost-effective, easy to access, simple to administer, and tailored 
      to the unique needs of the research and education community. The new 
      network and cloud services enable transformational new solutions for 
      education delivery and provide better-yielding solutions for university 
      business functions&#8212;helping higher education institutions remain 
      competitive nationally and globally.

      For one night only, two of the world&#8217;s most celebrated songwriters and 
      composers will take to the stage for &#8220;Richard M. Sherman and Alan 
      Menken: The Disney Songbook.&#8221; The concert will take place at the D23 
      Expo 2013 at the Anaheim Convention Center in the D23 Expo Arena on 
      Saturday, August 10.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Together Sherman and Menken have won a combined 10 Academy Awards for 
      their work with Disney, and have composed music and songs for more than 
      three dozen Disney feature films, over two dozen Disney Park attractions 
      and half a dozen Disney musicals on Broadway.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t express how excited I am that my esteemed friend Alan Menken 
      and I will be sharing the same bill for the very first time,&#8221; said 
      Sherman. &#8220;Alan is an incredible talent, and I know we&#8217;re both thrilled 
      to be performing for Disney&#8217;s most ardent fans&#8212;they&#8217;re the best and I 
      can&#8217;t wait to be a part of what promises to be a very special night for 
      all of us.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Richard Sherman and I share so many things; our cherished association 
      with The Walt Disney Company, the blessing of having the opportunity to 
      share our musical talents with 'children of all ages' and a genuine 
      mutual admiration&#8212;but one thing we've never gotten to share is a concert 
      stage,&#8221; said Menken. &#8220;This summer at the D23 Expo 2013, we will do just 
      that. And I can't think of anyone I'd prefer to share that stage with. 
      Richard, along with his brother Robert, wrote songs that filled my 
      formative years with joy and fantasy. And, all these years later, I can 
      say with complete honesty that there is no one I've met in our business 
      who is more warm and generous than my friend and fellow songwriter, 
      Richard Sherman.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Admission to the concert will be on a first-come, first-served basis and 
      is included in the price of a ticket to the D23 Expo. In addition to the 
      4,000-seat D23 Expo Arena, the concert will be simulcast into a 
      2,000-seat overflow theater inside the Convention Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Richard M. Sherman and his brother Robert B. Sherman composed 
      some of the most beloved songs in the Disney canon. The Disney Legends 
      won two Oscars&#174; for their work on Mary Poppins, and 
      during their decades&#8211;long association with Disney they wrote more than 
      200 songs for 27 films and two dozen television productions. They made 
      unforgettable contributions to such Disney films as The Parent Trap, 
      The Jungle Book, Bedknobs and Broomsticks,
			and the entire Winnie 
      the Pooh series, as well as the family classic Chitty Chitty Bang 
      Bang. They also penned beloved songs for Disney Parks including the 
      theme songs for Walt Disney&#8217;s Enchanted Tiki Room, it&#8217;s a small world, 
      and Carousel of Progress. Richard wrote the song &#8220;Make Way for 
      Tomorrow Today&#8221; for the blockbuster film Iron Man 2, and is 
      working on a new stage musical based on Walt Disney&#8217;s 1967 animated film 
      classic The Jungle Book, premiering this June at the Goodman 
      Theater in Chicago.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With eight Academy Awards, Alan Menken has received more Oscars 
      than any living person. He has written songs and scores for some of the 
      world&#8217;s most beloved films:&#160;Tangled&#160;(Oscar nominee),&#160;Enchanted&#160;(three 
      Oscar nominations)&#160;The Little Mermaid&#160;(two Oscar&#160;wins), Beauty 
      and the Beast&#160;(two Oscar wins), Aladdin&#160;(two 
      Oscar&#160;wins), Pocahontas&#160;(two Oscar&#160;wins), Hercules&#160;(Oscar 
      nominee), The Hunchback of Notre Dame&#160;(Oscar nominee), Little 
      Shop of Horrors&#160;(Oscar nominee), Home on the Range&#160;and&#160;Newsies. 
      His song &#8220;Star Spangled Man,&#8221; was the patriotic anthem of the 2011 hit 
      film Captain America: The First Avenger.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Menken&#8217;s Broadway successes include his 2012 Tony Award&#174; for Newsies, 
      plus The Little Mermaid&#160;(Tony Award nominee),&#160;Beauty 
      and the Beast, Little Shop of Horrors,&#160;and&#160;Sister Act&#160;(Tony 
      Award nominee).&#160;His other stage productions include&#160;King 
      David, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, The Hunchback of Notre Dame&#160;and 
      his latest stage production Aladdin: The New Musical, opening 
      next year. At Disney Parks, Menken added an exclusive ballad (&#8220;To Be 
      Free&#8221;) to his song score for Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular at 
      Disney California Adventure and penned &#8220;Compass of Your Heart,&#8221; the 
      catchy theme song for the attraction Sinbad&#8217;s Storybook Voyage at 
      Tokyo DisneySea.

&lt;p&gt;* NNPC funding problems holding back oil projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Exxon and NNPC joint venture has 550,000 bpd oil capacity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Joe Brock and Emma Farge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA/GENEVA, May 23 (Reuters) - Nigeria's state-oil company
and a local unit of Exxon Mobil plan to tap the bond
market by 2016 to fill a funding shortfall in developing oil
exploration projects, the companies have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) owns at
least 50 percent in several joint ventures with oil majors such
as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon and Chevron but
often fails to meet its share of project funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil majors say NNPC's lack of financing is one of the
biggest brakes on progress in Africa's largest oil industry,
which produces over 2 million bpd of oil and holds the world's
ninth biggest gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NNPC is meeting with her joint venture partner (Exxon) to
brainstorm on alternative sources of funding such as bond
markets to enhance revenue," NNPC's Finance Director Bennard
Otti was quoted as saying in a notice on the company's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's local unit Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN) and the
NNPC operate a joint venture with a capacity of over 550,000
barrels per day of crude oil, condensate and gas liquids. MPN
has a 40 percent stake with NNPC holding the other 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint venture will use external financing options from
2013-2015 but will access the bond market by 2016, MPN's Chief
Financial Officer Segun Banwo was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An NNPC spokesman gave no details on how much would be
raised or which bond markets would be tapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 23 (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA) said it has fined a wealth management unit of
U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase 3.08 million pounds ($4.6
million) for being unable to show it was giving clients the
right advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCA said on Thursday the failings were not corrected
until the watchdog brought them to the bank's attention in the
course of its wider review of wealth management firms in
Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter who they are, customers of wealth managers should
be able to expect the firm to keep complete, up to date client
records so that they can give the right advice," the FCA's 
director of enforcement, Tracey McDermott, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this case the firm did not have complete records, nor
did its management have the information they needed to recognize
this," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCA said the failings persisted over two years, exposing
customers to the risk that they would be given the wrong advice
and inappropriate investments though no actual harm to customers
has been identified to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the failings were pointed out the bank took "prompt
action" to improve its systems and undertake a significant
overhaul of how it assesses if investments are suitable for
customers, the watchdog said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent review of 25 customers found "significant
gaps" in the information the bank had on 22 of them, such as how
much risk the customer wanted to take on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose fine was cut by 30 percent due to an early
stage settlement, said it has fully cooperated with the FCA and
has enhanced its procedures to ensure they comply with required
regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCA is due to publish findings shortly from its review
of the wealth management sector in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's wealth management arm offers loans, mortgages and
porfolio investment services to clients with $25 million or more
to invest, many of whom were working in the financial services
industry when the failings took place, the FCA said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Julie Steenhuysen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO May 23 (Reuters) - Kathrin Jansen is a
microbiologist with at least two breakthrough vaccines to her
name: she brought the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil to market
for Merck and helped develop the $4 billion a year pneumonia and
meningitis vaccine Prevnar 13 for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jansen's next vaccine success could come by taming the
superbug MRSA, a drug-resistant bacterium that she has seen
ravage a healthy man up close and personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infects an
estimated 53 million people globally and costs more than $20
billion a year to treat. In the United States alone, MRSA kills
20,000 Americans each year, exceeding annual deaths from AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jansen watched the infection unfold two years ago when
visiting her stepfather, who was in the hospital for a hip
replacement. The man in the bed next door died soon after MRSA
attacked the vascular graft in his leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He went in healthy and died very quickly," recalls Jansen, 
senior vice president of vaccine research and early development
at Pfizer Inc, the world's largest drug maker. She says
the experience steeled her resolve to develop an effective
vaccine that could prevent such deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Staphylococcus aureus has proven a tenacious adversary.
In the past decade, vaccine candidates by Nabi
Biopharmaceuticals and Merck &amp; Co Inc failed in costly,
late-stage clinical trials. Now, led by Jansen, Pfizer is taking
a shot. Competitors, including vaccine giants GlaxoSmithKline
, Novartis and Sanofi, are, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the race could lead to a viable vaccine,
potentially worth billions in sales, critics say companies may
be risking costly failure with so much work on a bacterium that
is still barely understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'BAG OF TROUBLE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staph has been living in and on its human hosts for
centuries. At any given time, 25 to 35 percent of individuals
will test positive for staph, often with no symptoms. But the
bacterium can cause a range of diseases from boils and impetigo
to raging blood infections and deadly bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of penicillin in 1928 gave doctors a way to
defeat staph infections, but overuse and misuse gave rise to
drug-resistant staph. Methicillin was developed to overcome 
drug-resistance, but by the 1960s, staph evolved new defenses to
overcome this more powerful version of penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus began the decades-long battle against
methicillin-resistant staph, now the most common cause of
hospital-acquired infections that is increasingly spreading into
army barracks, prisons and daycare centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bill Gruber, a Pfizer senior vice president who led
clinical trials for Prevnar 13 and is running the company's
Staph aureus trials, thinks of the bacterium as "a little bag of
trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically, it has a number of different toxins and defenses
to try to defeat you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may explain why vaccines from Nabi and Merck failed.
Both tried to defeat this bug by attacking on just one front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine by Nabi, now Biota Pharmaceuticals,
focused only on the sugar capsule the bacteria make to hide from
the immune system, while Merck's focused on a single protein
that helps staph gets its nutrition. Neither lived up to
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've learned that just focusing on one target of Staph
aureus might not be sufficient," said Dr. Buddy Creech, an
infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT TAKES STAMINA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jansen has been working on a Staph aureus vaccine for the
past decade, first at Merck, then at Wyeth, and now at Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The East German-born scientist - who fled to the West in
1960 and earned her PhD in biology at Philipps University in
Marburg - says it takes stamina to develop a successful vaccine,
a process that can take 15 years or more. With the cervical
cancer vaccine Gardasil, which had 2012 sales of $1.6 billion,
it took 14 years from lab bench to government approval. "That's
actually a fast development program," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Staph aureus, it took eight years from the first
experiments to human safety trials. Now, it could take another
seven to 10 years to wind up clinical trials, putting the team
about midway through the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's initial vaccine targeted three mechanisms key to
staph's survival and ability to cause disease. Two of those
focused on sugar capsules. The third attacks a mechanism called
"clumping factor," which allows bacteria to stick to proteins
when they enter the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jansen's team wanted one more point of attack. They
added a fourth antigen, a protein that allows the bacterium to
steal manganese - a key nutrient - from host cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a four-antigen vaccine that generates antibody
responses at distinct points of the life cycle of the bug. The
company is testing this in Phase 1/Phase 2 trials in healthy
adults in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Pfizer gets the results they hope for, likely later this
year, the company expects to meet with regulators to iron out a
plan for larger trials involving thousands of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the vaccine would be aimed at preventing
infections in millions of people globally who need elective
procedures such as a hip replacement. Ultimately, it could be
used to protect people at risk in the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIVAL VACCINES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is furthest along, but the large, untapped market,
estimated to be worth $3 billion to $4 billion a year, has drawn
interest from several companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline has been quiet about its approach. The
drugmaker had been partnering with Nabi's failed StaphVax
candidate, and in 2009 bought another Nabi candidate called
PentaStaph for $46 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company researchers declined to discuss their program, but
Glaxo spokeswoman Melinda Stubbee confirmed the company has a
four-component vaccine in Phase 1 development. "We are still
evaluating the data and haven't yet announced plans to present
the data or to pursue further development," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NovaDigm Therapeutics, a private company based in Grand
Forks, North Dakota, is developing a single-antigen vaccine that
targets both staph and yeast infections caused by the fungus
Candida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other rivals with early-stage programs include Novartis,
which has a vaccine in Phase 1 trials, and Sanofi, which is
partnering with privately held biotech Syntiron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although academic researchers applaud these efforts, they
say companies may be rushing into trials too soon, especially
when so much is unknown about how staph interacts with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our development of Staphylococcal vaccines has predated an
adequate understanding of the human response to infection,"
Creech said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, it is still not clear whether a Staph aureus
vaccine that protects against skin infections will also protect
individuals from bloodstream infections. It may be that instead
of preventing infection, some vaccines will merely blunt
infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Daum, who leads the MRSA Research Center at the
University of Chicago Medical Center, doubts any of the current
candidates will make it into widespread use. "I am convinced we
need a vaccine. I'm just not sure anyone knows how to make one
yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jansen, who knows Daum, said she understands his skepticism.
"I'm a microbiologist. I know bacteria pretty well. They are
very potent adversaries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says there's a reason the company was not the first out
of the gate. "We wanted to make sure that we looked under all
the rocks and found what we needed to find."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests in animals and people suggest the vaccine induces
production of antibodies that defeat staph's defenses and kill
the bacteria. "To our knowledge, we are the only ones who have
demonstrated very, very robust killing responses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was enough for Jansen. "We essentially said, 'That's
it. We put it together as best as we know how. Now is the time
to test it.'"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 23 (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA) said it has fined U.S. bank JPMorgan 
3.08 million pounds ($4.6 million) for being unable to show it
was giving clients the right advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCA said on Thursday the failings were not corrected
until the watchdog brought them to the firm's attention in the
course of its wider review of wealth management firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter who they are, customers of wealth managers should
be able to expect the firm to keep complete, up to date client
records so that they can give the right advice," FCA director of
enforcement Tracey McDermott said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this case the firm did not have complete records, nor
did its management have the information they needed to recognize
this."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A stable job market in Britain bodes well for an upturn in permanent recruitment that would mirror a recovery already under way in Asia, the founder of Robert Walters Plc (RWA.L) told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters, the 58-year-old chief executive of the recruitment company that bears his name, said he believed a decline in hiring people for permanent employment in Britain had reached its lowest point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not yet at the point where we can detect long-term positive trends in permanent recruitment in the UK, but it's not getting any worse," Walters said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the global recruitment industry has seen a decline in permanent placements in favor of lower-margin temporary hires - due in part to low business confidence in Europe - the reverse is true in Britain, according to a study published this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permanent hiring in Britain has risen steadily over the last seven months, the study on 400 recruitment companies by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and auditing firm KPMG showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain accounts for slightly more than a quarter of Robert Walters' net fee income, a relevant performance indicator for recruitment companies. The company recruits within professions including engineering, legal, marketing and banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitors PageGroup (MPI.L) and SThree Plc (STHR.L) have reported declines in global net fee income as recession-weary employers in Europe, the largest market for both companies, have cut back on permanent staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net fee income at Robert Walters, which is less exposed to Europe, rose 3 percent in 2012 to 188.4 million pounds ($285.26 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares have risen 10 percent since the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the performance of the company, which operates in 26 countries, has been boosted by an improvement in permanent hiring in the Asia-Pacific region, the source of about half of its net fee income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Robert Walters) are seeing a certain amount of stabilization ... in the geographies that they are exposed to," said Henry Carver, an analyst with brokerage Peel Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund said in April that Asia would lead a global economic recovery, posting 5.7 percent growth in 2013, with unemployment at multi-year lows in several countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Premises in Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea are among the 17 offices opened by Robert Walters in the last four years. Walters said he had no plans to open any more offices this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're doing surprisingly well in Hong Kong ... partly because we've diversified away from financial services there," said Walters, whose near-40-year career in recruitment included a stint in setting up PageGroup's New York office in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a prolonged downturn in the global banking industry forced banks to rein in costs by axing jobs and freezing hiring, Robert Walters cut 18 percent of jobs in its global financial services team this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been hit by the banks not hiring so many temps," Walters said. "The numbers seem to be stabilizing, so we're reasonably confident we're over the worst on the temp decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey by the Confederation of British Industry employers' lobby and consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers showed financial sector employment rose 19 percent in the quarter ended March, and similar growth is expected in the three months to July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters said the company would continue to operate in the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not pulling out," he said. "We're waiting for when that happy day comes when they start hiring again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters' shares closed at 212.75 pence on Wednesday on the London Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.6604 British pounds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Brenton Cordeiro in Bangalore; Editing by Robin Paxton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kathrin Jansen is a microbiologist with at least two breakthrough vaccines to her name: she brought the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil to market for Merck and helped develop the $4 billion a year pneumonia and meningitis vaccine Prevnar 13 for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jansen's next vaccine success could come by taming the superbug MRSA, a drug-resistant bacterium that she has seen ravage a healthy man up close and personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infects an estimated 53 million people globally and costs more than $20 billion a year to treat. In the United States alone, MRSA kills 20,000 Americans each year, exceeding annual deaths from AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jansen watched the infection unfold two years ago when visiting her stepfather, who was in the hospital for a hip replacement. The man in the bed next door died soon after MRSA attacked the vascular graft in his leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He went in healthy and died very quickly," recalls Jansen, senior vice president of vaccine research and early development at Pfizer Inc, the world's largest drug maker. She says the experience steeled her resolve to develop an effective vaccine that could prevent such deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Staphylococcus aureus has proven a tenacious adversary. In the past decade, vaccine candidates by Nabi Biopharmaceuticals and Merck &amp; Co Inc failed in costly, late-stage clinical trials. Now, led by Jansen, Pfizer is taking a shot. Competitors, including vaccine giants GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi, are, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the race could lead to a viable vaccine, potentially worth billions in sales, critics say companies may be risking costly failure with so much work on a bacterium that is still barely understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'BAG OF TROUBLE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staph has been living in and on its human hosts for centuries. At any given time, 25 to 35 percent of individuals will test positive for staph, often with no symptoms. But the bacterium can cause a range of diseases from boils and impetigo to raging blood infections and deadly bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of penicillin in 1928 gave doctors a way to defeat staph infections, but overuse and misuse gave rise to drug-resistant staph. Methicillin was developed to overcome drug-resistance, but by the 1960s, staph evolved new defenses to overcome this more powerful version of penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus began the decades-long battle against methicillin-resistant staph, now the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections that is increasingly spreading into army barracks, prisons and daycare centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bill Gruber, a Pfizer senior vice president who led clinical trials for Prevnar 13 and is running the company's Staph aureus trials, thinks of the bacterium as "a little bag of trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically, it has a number of different toxins and defenses to try to defeat you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may explain why vaccines from Nabi and Merck failed. Both tried to defeat this bug by attacking on just one front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine by Nabi, now Biota Pharmaceuticals, focused only on the sugar capsule the bacteria make to hide from the immune system, while Merck's focused on a single protein that helps staph gets its nutrition. Neither lived up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've learned that just focusing on one target of Staph aureus might not be sufficient," said Dr. Buddy Creech, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT TAKES STAMINA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jansen has been working on a Staph aureus vaccine for the past decade, first at Merck, then at Wyeth, and now at Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The East German-born scientist - who fled to the West in 1960 and earned her PhD in biology at Philipps University in Marburg - says it takes stamina to develop a successful vaccine, a process that can take 15 years or more. With the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil, which had 2012 sales of $1.6 billion, it took 14 years from lab bench to government approval. "That's actually a fast development program," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Staph aureus, it took eight years from the first experiments to human safety trials. Now, it could take another seven to 10 years to wind up clinical trials, putting the team about midway through the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's initial vaccine targeted three mechanisms key to staph's survival and ability to cause disease. Two of those focused on sugar capsules. The third attacks a mechanism called "clumping factor," which allows bacteria to stick to proteins when they enter the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jansen's team wanted one more point of attack. They added a fourth antigen, a protein that allows the bacterium to steal manganese - a key nutrient - from host cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a four-antigen vaccine that generates antibody responses at distinct points of the life cycle of the bug. The company is testing this in Phase 1/Phase 2 trials in healthy adults in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Pfizer gets the results they hope for, likely later this year, the company expects to meet with regulators to iron out a plan for larger trials involving thousands of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the vaccine would be aimed at preventing infections in millions of people globally who need elective procedures such as a hip replacement. Ultimately, it could be used to protect people at risk in the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIVAL VACCINES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is furthest along, but the large, untapped market, estimated to be worth $3 billion to $4 billion a year, has drawn interest from several companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline has been quiet about its approach. The drugmaker had been partnering with Nabi's failed StaphVax candidate, and in 2009 bought another Nabi candidate called PentaStaph for $46 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company researchers declined to discuss their program, but Glaxo spokeswoman Melinda Stubbee confirmed the company has a four-component vaccine in Phase 1 development. "We are still evaluating the data and haven't yet announced plans to present the data or to pursue further development," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NovaDigm Therapeutics, a private company based in Grand Forks, North Dakota, is developing a single-antigen vaccine that targets both staph and yeast infections caused by the fungus Candida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other rivals with early-stage programs include Novartis, which has a vaccine in Phase 1 trials, and Sanofi, which is partnering with privately held biotech Syntiron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although academic researchers applaud these efforts, they say companies may be rushing into trials too soon, especially when so much is unknown about how staph interacts with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our development of Staphylococcal vaccines has predated an adequate understanding of the human response to infection," Creech said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, it is still not clear whether a Staph aureus vaccine that protects against skin infections will also protect individuals from bloodstream infections. It may be that instead of preventing infection, some vaccines will merely blunt infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Daum, who leads the MRSA Research Center at the University of Chicago Medical Center, doubts any of the current candidates will make it into widespread use. "I am convinced we need a vaccine. I'm just not sure anyone knows how to make one yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jansen, who knows Daum, said she understands his skepticism. "I'm a microbiologist. I know bacteria pretty well. They are very potent adversaries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says there's a reason the company was not the first out of the gate. "We wanted to make sure that we looked under all the rocks and found what we needed to find."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests in animals and people suggest the vaccine induces production of antibodies that defeat staph's defenses and kill the bacteria. "To our knowledge, we are the only ones who have demonstrated very, very robust killing responses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was enough for Jansen. "We essentially said, 'That's it. We put it together as best as we know how. Now is the time to test it.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by David Greising, Mary Milliken and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO May 23 (Reuters) - Kathrin Jansen is a
microbiologist with at least two breakthrough vaccines to her
name: she brought the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil to market
for Merck and helped develop the $4 billion a year pneumonia and
meningitis vaccine Prevnar 13 for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jansen's next vaccine success could come by taming the
superbug MRSA, a drug-resistant bacterium that she has seen
ravage a healthy man up close and personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infects an
estimated 53 million people globally and costs more than $20
billion a year to treat. In the United States alone, MRSA kills
20,000 Americans each year, exceeding annual deaths from AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jansen watched the infection unfold two years ago when

of staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first controversy for Ford, who has drawn
criticism for skipping city council meetings to coach football
and engaging in a confrontation outside his home with a
reporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was briefly ordered out of office in 2012 after being
found guilty of a conflict of interest, but won an appeal and
was allowed to finish his four-year term.

&lt;p&gt;* Almost two months since Mayflower, Arkansas, spill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Arkansas politicians demand part of line rerouted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 24 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is
still waiting for test results from the ruptured section of its
95,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Pegasus pipeline, almost two months
after it spewed 5,000 barrels of oil into an Arkansas suburb,
the company said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pegasus spill intensified the debate about the safety of
transporting oil from Canada's tar sands across the United
States. After a second far-smaller spill was discovered on the
nearly 70-year-old line in Missouri last month, speculation has
mounted the line could be down for much longer than initially
anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pegasus line, which carries heavy Canadian crude from
Patoka, Illinois, to Nederland, Texas, has been shut since it
first burst in late March, leading to the evacuations of homes
in Mayflower, Arkansas, and sparking a huge cleanup effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is premature to speculate on future plans for the
pipeline until the investigation into the cause of the incident
is completed," said Exxon Mobil spokesman Aaron Stryk in an
email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still waiting on the results from the metallurgic
lab testing. The information we gain from the investigation into
the cause will inform the development of our plans in the
future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon cut out a 52-feet (15.8 meters) section of the damaged
pipeline in mid-April and sent it to an independent third-party
laboratory to try to determine the cause of the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, who launched an
investigation into the oil spill, said in April the rupture was
more than 22 feet (6.7 meters) long and two inches (5 cm) wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shutdown of the line has seen large volumes of crude
oil on the Keystone pipeline from Canada diverted into Cushing,
Oklahoma, delivery point of the U.S. crude oil contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keystone normally splits at Steele City, Nebraska, before
flowing to either Cushing or Patoka, but the shutdown of Pegasus
has seen oil back up around the Illinois terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SENATORS WANT LINE REROUTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians in Arkansas have asked Exxon to relocate a 13.5
mile section of the line that runs through the Lake Maumelle
watershed, the main source of drinking water for the state's
largest city, Little Rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only way to eliminate all risks posed by the pipeline
to Lake Maumelle is to relocate the Pegasus pipeline out of its
watershed," said U.S. Senators Mark Pryor, John Boozman, and
other Arkansas politicians in the letter dated May 15 and
published on the arkansasmatters.com website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lake Maumelle Government Stakeholders expect immediate
action on our request to relocate this pipeline out of the
watershed and to see this project completed within 3-5 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter also requests a series of shorter-term steps the
Government Stakeholders group wants Exxon to take before
restarting the line, including adding remote isolation valves to
the section that runs through the watershed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) requires Exxon to submit
a detailed start-up plan to the regulator for approval before it
can use the line again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, PHMSA threw out an appeal by Exxon to let
them restart a section of the line below the site of the spill,
with the regulator ruling its 'Corrective Action Order' should
remain in place on the entire 850 mile length of the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other companies are also waiting to see when the line will
restart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunoco Logistics Partners LP said earlier this month
that the start-up of a 40,000 bpd section of its West
Texas-to-Nederland Texas on the Gulf Coast pipeline has been
delayed until Pegasus has been repaired, as it connects into the
Exxon line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Sunoco declined to comment on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO May 24 (Reuters) - Toronto's embattled mayor Rob
Ford on Friday denied allegations that he had smoked
crack-cocaine and said he could not comment on a video he had
not seen or does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There has been a serious accusation from the Toronto Star
that I use crack cocaine. I do not use crack cocaine, nor am I
an addict of crack cocaine," he told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As for a video, I cannot comment on a video that I have
never seen or does not exist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Toronto Star and Gawker Media reported last week they
had separately seen a cellphone video that allegedly shows Ford
smoking crack-cocaine while in the company of people involved in
the drug trade.

			EcoCAR 2: Plugging In to the Future today named Pennsylvania 
      State University its Year Two winner at the EcoCAR 2013 Competition in 
      San Diego. The 15 universities competing in EcoCAR 2 gathered in Yuma, 
      Arizona last week for six 
      days of rigorous vehicle testing and evaluation on drive quality and 
      environmental impact at General Motors (GM) Desert Proving Ground. From 
      there, the competition moved to San Diego for a second round of judging 
      by automotive industry experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EcoCAR 2 -- a three-year competition managed by Argonne National 
      Laboratory and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, GM and 30 
      other government and industry leaders -- gives students the opportunity 
      to gain real-world automotive engineering experience while striving to 
      improve the environmental impact and energy efficiency of an already 
      highly-efficient vehicle &#8211; the 2013 Chevrolet Malibu.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The students competing in EcoCAR 2 are leading the way in designing and 
      building the next generation of American-made automobiles that will 
      reduce our dependence on oil and save families and businesses money at 
      the pump,&#8221; said Assistant Secretary for the Energy Department&#8217;s Office 
      of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy David Danielson. &#8220;I look 
      forward to seeing these teams&#8217; creative, super efficient vehicle designs 
      in the final round of the competition next year in Washington, D.C.&#8221;

      &#8220;Engineering advanced technologies that help reduce dependency on 
      petroleum, improve fuel economy and reduce emissions is the key to 
      developing sustainable transportation,&#8221; said John Haraf, GM&#8217;s director 
      of hybrid vehicle integration and controls and one of GM&#8217;s EcoCAR leads. 
      &#8220;These students are the next generation of engineers who will help make 
      that vision a reality, and their hard work and dedication throughout the 
      first two years shows they can rise to the challenge.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After a year creating and testing their eco-vehicle designs using 
      technologies such as Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation, teams spent 
      the second year of EcoCAR 2 utilizing cutting-edge automotive 
      engineering processes to redesign their Malibu vehicles. Argonne 
      National Laboratory and GM engineers subjected these vehicles to 
      extensive safety inspections and on-road evaluations, similar to those 
      conducted on new GM vehicles. Each car was evaluated on reduced fuel 
      consumption and greenhouse gas emissions as well as performance, utility 
      and safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pennsylvania State University was named this year&#8217;s winner after 
      impressing inspectors and other judges representing various EcoCAR 2 
      sponsors with its ethanol (E85) plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. The 
      team was the first to pass safety and technical inspections, on-road 
      safety evaluation as well as run all the competition dynamic events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While Penn State won the top prize, it wasn&#8217;t the only accomplished team 
      at the Year Two Finals. The second place team, Cal State Los Angles 
      excelled with its ethanol-fueled vehicle and was the first team to 
      complete all the dynamic events. The Ohio State University took third 
      place overall after demonstrating its series-parallel hybrid electric 
      vehicle. The 15 university teams will now spend Year Three of EcoCAR 2 
      perfecting their designs before the competition finals in Washington, 
      D.C., in May 2014.

&lt;p&gt;May 24 (Reuters) - Liquefied natural gas producer InterOil
Corp and its joint venture partner have entered into
exclusive negotiations with Exxon Mobil Corp to develop
gas fields in Papua New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions include the possibility of an Exxon unit,
ExxonMobil Papua New Guinea Ltd, taking an interest in petroleum
retention license 15, InterOil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InterOil and its partner, Pacific LNG, will get funding to
drill additional wells in the Elk and Antelope fields, which
form part of the license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc last July said it was in
talks to buy into InterOil's Papua New Guinea exploration
licenses and an LNG terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InterOil has licenses covering about 3.9 million acres in
Papua New Guinea, and the company is also building a $6 billion
LNG terminal with an annual capacity of 9 million metric tons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InterOil shares closed at $93.47, while Exxon closed at
$91.79 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co (PG.N) on Thursday brought back A.G. Lafley to run the world's largest household products maker, replacing Bob McDonald immediately in the midst of a major restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lafley is taking on the roles of chairman, president and chief executive officer, effective immediately, while McDonald is set to retire on June 30 after 33 years at P&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes as some investors have pushed for faster improvements from the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors. P unveiled a $10 billion restructuring program in February 2012. Since then, it has cut thousands of jobs and taken other steps to speed up its operations, improve its success with new products and do a better job in both fast-growing emerging markets and in larger, developed markets such as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bob retired, the board called me and I felt like duty called. I'm back to help maintain the business momentum and keep this productivity program going," Lafley told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no single reason for McDonald's retirement, Lafley said. "I think it's a number of personal reasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald, who had been Lafley's hand-picked successor, was not made available for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the suddenness of the change was a shock, the move to bring back Lafley was not, said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl &amp; Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The board has a known quantity in Lafley. He knows everyone, he knows the systems, and now that Procter is on firmer footing, it expects Lafley to be able to push the company and its stock price higher," said McCormick, whose firm invests more than $9.1 billion, with P as one of its biggest holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lafley, who will celebrate his 66th birthday in June, said P's board asked him days, not weeks, ago to come back, but he did not say exactly when he got the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lafley said he is "fully engaged" in coming back and wants to finish the work that has been started on the productivity program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"65 is the new 45," he joked, adding that he aims to build momentum at P by focusing on growth in emerging markets and innovation in brands and products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last summer, hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management said it had a stake in P worth roughly $2 billion, or 1 percent of the company. CEO William Ackman, who has shaken up management at other companies, most recently J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), has blamed McDonald's team for missteps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ackman's pick for J.C. Penney, Ron Johnson, was ousted last month and replaced by his predecessor, Mike Ullman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pershing representative was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lafley first joined Cincinnati-based P in 1977 and served as president and CEO from 2000 to 2009, when he handed the position over to McDonald. He stepped down as chairman in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(P) wanted to bring someone back who knows the company well and can handle running it, both in the interim and to provide strategic guidance," said David Larcker, director of Stanford University's Rock Center for Corporate Governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reaching out to a successful past CEO can give the markets confidence, while still allowing time for a company to evaluate its strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P also stood by its fiscal year, ending June 30, and fourth-quarter guidance. For the fourth quarter, P said profit should fall to 69 cents to 77 cents per share, from 82 cents per share a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P's stock was up 54 cents, or 0.7 percent, in after hours trading after closing at $78.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago, additional reporting by Martinne Geller and John McCrank in New York and Jonathan Stempel in Chicago, and Svea Herbst in Boston; Editing by Bernard Orr and Stephen Coates)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Gorgon LNG 60 pct complete, Wheatstone 10 pct - Chevron
executive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Australia's high costs could impact future investments -
exec&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRISBANE May 28 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's $52
billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) development in
Australia is now 60 percent complete and plans are afoot to
start engineering and design work for an expansion by the end of
the year, a company executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also continues to talk with third-party gas
suppliers for a potential expansion of its $29 billion
Wheatstone LNG plant, Roy Krzywosinski, managing director of
Chevron Australia, told reporters at an industry conference in
Brisbane on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wheatstone plant in Australia is about 10 percent
complete, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company's plans to continue pursuing LNG capacity
expansion come amid concerns that Australia's high cost
structure will discourage further investment in the $190 billion
LNG industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodside Petroleum last month shelved plans for its
$45 billion Browse LNG project in Western Australia, saying it
will consider a floating LNG plant after deciding the onshore
development did not make economic sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorgon, which will have a capacity of 15.6 million tonnes of
LNG per year, is currently on schedule to ship its first LNG
cargo in early 2015. The expansion is expected to add another
5.2 million tonnes a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is building a plant with a capacity of 8.9 million
tonnes at Wheatstone, but the site has government approval to
grow to a 25 million-tonne hub. Wheatstone is scheduled to ship
its first cargo out in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krzywosinski, however, warned that Australia's high costs
could impact the company's investment decisions going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing is a slam dunk... the issue of cost structure is a
significant issue, especially if you have an international
portfolio of competing priorities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're not going to dump more money into an existing
investment if you have a better alternative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorgon LNG, which has seen a 40 percent cost hike, has about
65 percent of its LNG sold under long-term contracts, short of
the 80 to 90 percent that LNG producers typically aim to have
sold under long-term contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The closer we get to first LNG, the more valuable the
volumes are going to be, so we're confident that we'll be able
to market those incremental volumes," Krzywosinski said.&lt;/p&gt;

      $228,718 (March 31, 2012 &#8211;$246,785). The majority of expenses were 
      comprised of management fees, amortization of debenture issuance costs 
      and servicing fees. The nature and amount of the expenses incurred by 
      the Corporation for the first quarter of 2013 were consistent with 
      management&#8217;s expectations for the period.

			Highlights for the First Quarter
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter of 2013, the Corporation:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Obtained signed letters of intent with three builders to construct 
        homes on all of the lots in Phase 1.
      
			
        Selected a real estate company to represent the Corporation in the 
        sale of the multi-family apartment site in Phase 1.
      
			
        Continued to review the hotel site in Phase 1 with a potential lodging 
        group. Subsequently, in April a formal offer was received from the 
        group and is under review.
      
			
        Continued to participate along with other companies in the Walton 
        Group of Companies in relation to the potential site for a new 
        headquarters facility for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The 
        submission is in competition to a number of proposals submitted by 
        other organizations.
      
			
        A term sheet was executed with an arm&#8217;s length institutional lender in 
        the amount of $39,000,000 and the commitment was subsequently approved 
        by the bank&#8217;s loan committee in March.
      
			
        Subsequently, the Corporation announced in May that its U.S. 
        subsidiary, Walton Westphalia Development (USA), LLC, entered into a 
        loan agreement with one or more lenders affiliated with Walton Asset 
        Management LP, to borrow $3,500,000 to cover pre-development costs 
        incurred prior to obtaining arm's length construction loans that the 
        Corporation and the U.S. subsidiary will put in place for Phase 1 
        construction of the Westphalia property
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given that the project remains on track both financially and from a 
      timing perspective, management believes that the project remains on 
      track for achieving its investment objectives.

			WALTON YELLOWHEAD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2013 
      RESULTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announced today its results for the first quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First Quarter Financial Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter of 2013, the Corporation generated total 
      revenues of $461 (March 31, 2012 - $4,815) and incurred total expenses 
      of $190,400 (March 31, 2012 - $194,160), which translated into a net 
      loss before tax of $189,939 (March 31, 2012 - $189,345).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The amount of revenues and expenditures incurred by the Corporation to 
      date are not materially inconsistent with the amounts originally 
      anticipated by management given the current stage of development. Due to 
      the delay in obtaining municipal approvals and the revised scope of work 
      to service the project when evaluated against the original assumptions 
      used by management in preparing the prospectus, the Corporation&#8217;s 
      ability to meet the investment objectives as outlined in the prospectus 
      may be adversely impacted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While management has made adjustments to the development plan to enable 
      completion of the project within the approximate three-year investment 
      time frame, it is still obtaining additional information which will 
      allow it to evaluate what impact these changes may have on the targeted 
      internal rate of return for the project. Management will report back to 
      investors once an evaluation is complete.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights for the First Quarter
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter of 2013, the Corporation:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Submitted a revised tentative plan to the City of Edmonton to address 
        concerns raised by the Transportation Department on the originally 
        planned alignment for 118A Avenue. Subsequently, the Transportation 
        Department recommended approval of the application for subdivision.
      
			
        Commenced preparing a detailed design and engineering drawings, 
        including, an update to the Neighbourhood Design Report in accordance 
        with the accepted servicing solution.
      
			
        Started preparing tender documents to obtain contract prices for work 
        to service the property including earthworks, underground utilities 
        and surface works.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation held a working session meeting with its Board of 
      Directors to evaluate what impact the revisions to the servicing concept 
      and transportation-related design imposed by the City of Edmonton would 
      have on the overall investment objectives of the Corporation, and to 
      consider what steps the Corporation could take to address any deviations 
      in cash flows and project timing, when compared to the project&#8217;s initial 
      assumptions. The Corporation is still obtaining additional information 
      which will allow it to evaluate what impact these changes may have on 
      the targeted internal rate of return for the project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional Information
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in 2011, the Corporation owns a 131.4-acre industrial 
      development within the Winterburn Industrial Park, in northwest 
      Edmonton, Alberta, which is marketed under the name &#8220;Yellowhead 
      Industrial Park.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the 
      development of the property is managed by Walton Development and 
      Management (Alberta) LP, both of which are members of the Walton Group.

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS May 27 (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil company
PDVSA on Monday signed an agreement to receive a $2 billion loan
from U.S. oil giant Chevron to finance a 16 percent
increase in production capacity at the Petroboscan heavy crude
joint venture in western Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widely expected and long-delayed deal follows similar
financing arrangements for nearly $9 billion this year with
joint venture partners that include Russian and Chinese firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will begin to receive these resources immediately. They
will be used for infrastructure and management to boost
production as soon as possible," said Oil Minister Rafael
Ramirez, who signed the agreement with Chevron Latin America
President Ali Moshiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funds will help boost capacity at Petroboscan to 127,000
barrels per day from 107,000 bpd by 2019. The loan has an
interest rate of Libor plus 4.5 percentage points and is to be
repaid in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sides negotiated the loan over two years. Its
signing was delayed by last-minute changes requested by
Venezuela and by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez's illness
and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDVSA in recent months has signed financing deals with other
 companies, including Russia's Rosneft and China's
CNPC to boost output at joint venture agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil services giant Schlumberger last week agreed to give
PDVSA a $1 billion credit line to continue using its services
amid growing debts from unpaid bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreements may help PDVSA avoid the heavy bond issuance
of recent years even as it transfers billions of dollars to the
government for social spending programs created by Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is a 40 percent partner in Petroboscan, with PDVSA
holding the remaining 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. oil major is also a partner in the Carabobo 3
project in the Orinoco extra-heavy oil belt, considered one of
the world's largest crude deposits, in eastern Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDVSA hopes to boost output by 400,000 bpd this year to
reach 3.3 million bpd by investing a record $25 billion, with
focus on six new Orinoco belt projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez for years used PDVSA to finance heavy social
spending, building up his popular support but spurring criticism
that the company was not investing enough in operations.&lt;/p&gt;

			Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1Reports First Quarter 2013 
      Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) and its general 
      partner Walton Ontario Land 1 Corporation (the &#8220;General Partner&#8221;) 
      announced today the Partnership&#8217;s results for first quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First Quarter Financial Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter of 2013, the Partnership generated total 
      revenues of $12,854 (March 31, 2012 - $16,895), total expenses of 
      $245,961 (March 31, 2012 - $248,430) and a net loss of $233,107 (March 
      31, 2012 - $231,535).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The revenues for both the first quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 
      2012 were comprised of rental revenue and interest revenue earned on the 
      Partnership&#8217;s cash balance. This was consistent with management&#8217;s 
      expectations because the Partnership is not expected to generate 
      significant revenues, except during periods when property is sold. The 
      Partnership&#8217;s expenses are also expected to remain fairly constant 
      throughout the life of the Partnership because the most significant 
      expenses of the Partnership, being the management fees, servicing fees 
      and director fees, are fixed over the life of their respective contracts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The net loss incurred by the Partnership was also consistent with 
      management&#8217;s expectations because the Partnership is not expected to 
      generate significant revenue, except during periods when property is 
      sold.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights for the First Quarter
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter of 2013, the Partnership:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Continued with the execution of the concept planning phase of its 
        overall investment strategy for the Ottawa Property.
      
			
        Continued to participate in the City of Ottawa&#8217;s 2014 Official Plan 
        review process to support and position the Property for future 
        expansions, to and inclusion within, Ottawa&#8217;s urban boundary. 
        Management continues to believe that the Ottawa Property is well 
        suited for an urban boundary expansion in 2014 from an employment 
        perspective and is a logical initial phase in a regional southwest 
        Ottawa development plan.
      
			
        Entered into a purchase and sales agreement with the City of Ottawa 
        for 0.2623 acre to complete a roundabout at the intersection of 
        Flewellyn and Eagleson roads that is replacing a stop sign controlled 
        intersection. The purchase and sales agreement is expected to close in 
        2013.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Overall, the Partnership is performing as expected by management and 
      consistent with the Partnership&#8217;s intention of holding its interest in 
      the Ottawa Property as an investment until time of sale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional Information
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in January 2010, the Partnership&#8217;s objective is to maximize 
      returns to limited partners through the acquisition, management, concept 
      planning, and eventual sale of two properties in Ontario; the Alliston 
      Property, sold in October 2012 and which consisted of two parcels 
      totaling 154.93 acres near the Toronto area in Alliston, and the Ottawa 
      Property, which consists of 300 acres adjacent to the southwest boundary 
      of Ottawa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc., part of 
      the Walton Group.

			(March 31, 2012 - $164,810).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The net loss incurred during the first quarter ending March 31, 2013, 
      was the result of other expenses of $319,392
			(March 31, 2012 - 
      $164,810). The increase in other expenses during the first quarter of 
      2013 was primarily due to interest expense incurred during the first 
      quarter of 2013 of $129,452 (March 31, 2012 - $nil). The interest 
      expense incurred during the first quarter of 2013 was in respect of the 
      Partnership&#8217;s $5.0 million mezzanine loan with Walton Finance Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The amount of revenues and expenditures incurred by the Partnership to 
      date are not, however, materially inconsistent with amounts originally 
      anticipated by management, given the Project&#8217;s current stage of 
      development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights for the First Quarter
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter of 2013, the Partnership commenced:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        construction of the stormwater ponds in the central area of the 
        project; and
      
			
        the engineering design for the Phase 2 of the project.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Due to the delays experienced in Phase 1 of the project, the timing of 
      cash flows is not consistent with the timing of cash flows originally 
      anticipated by management when preparing the prospectus. Despite the 
      delays, management believes that the overall project remains on track 
      for achieving its investment objectives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional Information
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in 2010, the Partnership owns a 136.5-acre residential project 
      in northwest Edmonton, Alberta. The project is being developed in three 
      phases and marketed under the name &#8220;Hawk&#8217;s Ridge at Big Lake.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the 
      development of the properties is managed by Walton Development and 
      Management (Alberta) LP, both of which are members of the Walton Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to show that 4 to 5 tcf is the gas required for one
train, not the amount being considered in Interoil deal)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRISBANE May 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's talks
with Interoil to develop the Elk and Antelope fields
could lead to an expansion of its $19-billion Papua New Guinea
liquefied natural gas (PNG LNG) project, an Exxon executive said
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not have a timeline for when a deal could be
finalised, but Mark Nolan, Exxon Mobil vice president for
development in the Middle East and Africa, signalled it may be
soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The expansion opportunities look attractive to us, so I
wouldn't expect we'd wait too long," Nolan said, speaking to
reporters at an industry conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said 4 to 5 trillion cubic feet is typically the
amount of gas required to expand an LNG plant by one train. LNG
plants are typically made up of several "trains," or
self-sufficient plants that chill gas into liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoil Corp announced on Friday that it had entered into
exclusive negotiations with Exxon.

      and 5.50% notes due February 2014. Pfizer may use funds that are not 
      immediately needed for these purposes to temporarily invest in 
      short-term marketable securities or repay a portion of its outstanding 
      commercial paper. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on 
      June 3, 2013, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS May 28 (Reuters) - Europe needs an EU-wide
framework if it is to tap into its shale gas reserves quickly
enough to reap the benefit, a senior executive at Chevron Corp
 said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European governments should also consider sharing any
profits with local communities in an echo of what is done in the
United States, where landowners benefit directly from shale gas
finds, Derek Magness, Chevron's general manager for Europe, Asia
and Middle East, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debate is intense in Europe about whether shale gas, by
lowering energy costs, can provide the kind of economic boost
that it has delivered in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a big unknown here," Magness said, saying that
Chevron was committed to exploring shale gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of available data for Europe is tiny compared
with the United States. In Poland, for instance, only one well
has been drilled in one concession, while for an area of a
similar size in the United States, there would be 4,600 wells,
Magness said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, he said, Chevron was drilling a fourth well in
Poland and hoped to drill two more this year. It also plans to
explore in Romania and is in talks with the Ukraine government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magness said he could not comment on ongoing negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAYING THE COURSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Chevron says it is staying, other companies, including
Exxon Mobil, have abandoned shale gas operations in
Poland. Some have cited uncertainty about the regulatory
environment, as well as poor drilling results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union's Executive Commission has said there is
sufficient EU-wide regulation in place for the exploration phase
of shale gas, though more might be needed to cover development.
It has said it will publish later this year a non-binding
framework to guide activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need that regulatory environment in place," Magness
said, arguing it could overcome confusion and share best
practice, with nations such as Britain providing a possible
model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose government is
advancing plans for its shale gas deposits, said at an EU summit
on energy last week that Europe could not afford to be left
behind as the United States gains a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magness said the question is "whether (the European Union)
can do it in a timely manner in order to take advantage of the
marketplace".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits for the United States have included encouraging
re-industrialisation, as the chemical industry, for instance, is
drawn by cheap energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Europe the situation is complex. Opposition from
environmental campaigners is strong and geology and geography
are very different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the cost will rise as prices fell so far in the
United States that shale gas developers suffered a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One catalyst in the United States has been the direct
financial benefit to landowners, which has overcome resistance,
whereas in Europe resources tend to belong to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magness said he had discussed with governments the idea of
handing some of the profits to communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would very much encourage the government to ensure a
portion of the profit would go to that community," he said. "At
least return it to the community in the form of a larger piece
of the budget."&lt;/p&gt;

			All members to gather in San Diego, CA at SB&#8217;13 for multi-stakeholder

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sustainable 
      Brands&#174; announces the addition of six new members to its Corporate 
      Member Group. Disney, Del Monte, SAP, Mattel, L&#8217;Or&#233;al and BASF join over 
      two dozen companies already committed to leveraging their unique role in 
      business and society by aligning multiple stakeholders along a path 
      towards a sustainable future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 30+ companies that comprise the Sustainable Brands Corporate Member 
      Group collectively represent over $750 billion in annual revenue. A 
      recent member benchmark study indicated that 83% of them were 
      consistently using sustainability as an innovation driver within one or 
      more product level brands and over 90% expect many or most of their 
      product brands will explore opportunities to leverage sustainability as 
      a value proposition in the near term. To accomplish this, a 3-point 
      collaboration agenda was established by the member group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      1. To design new ways to deliver and measure business value through 
      environmental and social innovation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      2. To explore and enable disruptive innovation that drives growth and 
      supports the shift to a sustainable economy
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      3. To better understand and drive the shift in consumer demand  
      behavior toward healthy, sustainable lifestyles and consumption
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Newest member L&#8217;Or&#233;al notes that collaborations like those found in the 
      Sustainable Brands Corporate Member Group help align organizations with 
      shared goals and help to identify sustainable solutions and accelerate 
      change. &#8220;We joined Sustainable Brands to have access to the network of 
      high value resources and sustainability professionals who share our 
      vision for growth and success that is sustainable, responsible and 
      inclusive,&#8221; states Pam Albaster, Senior VP of Corporate Communications, 
      Sustainable Development  Public Affairs at L&#8217;Or&#233;al USA. &#8220;The journey 
      toward a more sustainable future is a shared one and becoming a member 
      of Sustainable Brands will help all of us build successful programs 
      towards that goal,&#8221; adds Jennifer DuBuisson, Associate Manager Global 
      Sustainability at Mattel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All corporate members will convene in San Diego, CA next week for the 
      annual Sustainable 
      Brands Conference. These newest members will join Unilever, Johnson 
       Johnson, Coca-Cola, Ford, Target and others to update themselves with 
      the latest trends, drivers, strategies and tactics that are creating new 
      opportunity for environmental and social innovation, as well as to work 
      in partnership on initiatives that will help further their individual 
      and collective success. Through a new Sustainable Brands program, The 
      SB Collaboratory, individuals will form cross-brand, cross-industry 
      and cross-functional teams to produce impactful and actionable outcomes. 
      &#8220;The Collaboratory is a forum for exploring and establishing emergent 
      key tenets, capabilities and structures that will empower brands to 
      succeed by enabling new forms of value creation and consumption,&#8221; states 
      KoAnn Skrzyniarz, founder of Sustainable Brands. &#8220;The goal is to 
      identify specific obstacles, test hypotheses for eliminating them, 
      incubate ideas, and achieve results that can be shared with the 
      community, rather than just having more conversation. The SB Corporate 
      Member community is a dedicated group bringing the critical levels of 
      engagement and influence needed to drive the kind of significant systems 
      changes required to shift towards a sustainable economy.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;BRISBANE (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) $52 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) development in Australia is now 60 percent complete and plans are afoot to start engineering and design work for an expansion by the end of the year, a company executive said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron also continues to talk with third-party gas suppliers for a potential expansion of its $29 billion Wheatstone LNG plant, Roy Krzywosinski, managing director of Chevron Australia, told reporters at an industry conference in Brisbane on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wheatstone plant in Australia is about 10 percent complete, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company's plans to continue pursuing LNG capacity expansion come amid concerns that Australia's high cost structure will discourage further investment in the $190 billion LNG industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) last month shelved plans for its $45 billion Browse LNG project in Western Australia, saying it will consider a floating LNG plant after deciding the onshore development did not make economic sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorgon, which will have a capacity of 15.6 million tons of LNG per year, is currently on schedule to ship its first LNG cargo in early 2015. The expansion is expected to add another 5.2 million tons a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is building a plant with a capacity of 8.9 million tons at Wheatstone, but the site has government approval to grow to a 25 million-ton hub. Wheatstone is scheduled to ship its first cargo out in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krzywosinski, however, warned that Australia's high costs could impact the company's investment decisions going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing is a slam dunk... the issue of cost structure is a significant issue, especially if you have an international portfolio of competing priorities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're not going to dump more money into an existing investment if you have a better alternative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorgon LNG, which has seen a 40 percent cost hike, has about 65 percent of its LNG sold under long-term contracts, short of the 80 to 90 percent that LNG producers typically aim to have sold under long-term contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The closer we get to first LNG, the more valuable the volumes are going to be, so we're confident that we'll be able to market those incremental volumes," Krzywosinski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Rebekah Kebede; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 29 (Reuters) - A U.S. Congressman on Wednesday
called on the Department of Justice to investigate JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co's power trading in Michigan, as the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) considers whether to
sanction the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan Congressman Dan Kildee, a Democrat who sits on the
Committee on Financial Services, said in a letter to the DoJ
that it should pursue its own investigation into JPMorgan to see
if it manipulated electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has told shareholders it has been notified by FERC
staff that they intend to recommend that the five members of the
commission take action over an alleged manipulative trading
scheme in Michigan and California earlier this decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has denied that it manipulated power markets, and
has vowed to "vigorously defend" itself and its employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These allegations are serious charges, including traders
devising deliberate schemes to manipulate energy prices and top
bank executives lying under oath," said Kildee in the letter, a
copy of which was obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The people of Michigan, and the American public generally,
deserve a marketplace where all participants play by the same
rules. I urge the Justice Department to resolve this matter by
investigating these potentially illegal practices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli declined on
Wednesday to comment on Kildee's letter, but said that the FERC
notice to the bank is only a "statement of the staff's views,
and does not represent findings of the commission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added "we strongly disagree" with the FERC conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission has not accused the bank of market
manipulation. Federal regulators often notify targets of
investigations to give them a chance to show why enforcement
actions should not be brought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulator has, however, sanctioned the U.S. bank's
electricity trading unit for failing to disclose information
during the investigation. It imposed a six-month long
restriction on its power trading starting April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressure has also mounted on the bank since a May 2 New York
Times report cited a confidential FERC document saying
investigators had found evidence JPMorgan Energy Ventures Corp.
devised "manipulative schemes" in Michigan and California
between 2010 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alleged scheme saw authorities in California and
Michigan make "excessive" payments of around $83 million to
JPMorgan, the New York Times report said citing the FERC
document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff, who has stepped up
enforcement of rules and investigations into Wall Street banks'
trading practices during his time at the regulator, on Tuesday
submitted his resignation to President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will remain at the agency and continue to vote on
commission matters until a replacement is nominated and
confirmed by the U.S. Senate, a process that could take several
months. His term was due to expire at the end of June, and his
departure had been anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

			Walton Edgemont Development Corporation Reports First Quarter 2013 
      Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Edgemont Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announced today the Corporation&#8217;s results for the first quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First Quarter Financial Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended March 31, 2013, the Corporation recognized 
      revenue from lot sales of $3,554,900, costs of sales of $4,128,640, 
      other income of $2,579 and other expenses of $295,099 resulting in a net 
      loss before taxes of $866,260. The revenue generated during the first 
      quarter of 2013 was in respect of the sale of 21 lots which the 
      Corporation received commitments from the first release of Phase 1 lots. 
      The revenue recognition for those 21 lots was triggered by the receipt 
      of second deposits and substantial completion of onsite roads for those 
      lots. During the first quarter of 2012, the Corporation generated other 
      income of $7,033 and other expenses of $225,036 resulting in a net loss 
      before taxes of $218,003.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The gross loss recognized by the Corporation during the first quarter of 
      2013, as well as the construction delays experienced to date, are not 
      consistent with management&#8217;s initial expectations. The deviation from 
      the anticipated gross margin was a direct result of higher than expected 
      onsite and offsite construction costs being incurred upfront in the 
      project with Phase 1. These higher than expected costs are expected to 
      translate into additional losses for the remaining 70 Phase 1 lots that 
      were committed to by the homebuilders in March 2012, as well as the 
      remaining Phase 1 lots which were committed to by homebuilders 
      subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Notwithstanding the anticipated gross loss for Phase 1 of the project 
      and the delays experienced in the project to date, management is 
      cautiously optimistic that the overall investment objectives can be 
      achieved. This is based on an anticipated increase in the gross profit 
      for phases 2, 3 and 4, when compared against management&#8217;s initial 
      expectations. These remaining lots represent approximately 72% of the 
      total lots in the project. Management is advancing preliminary design of 
      future phases to obtain greater certainty of the servicing costs. The 
      overall pricing strategy for the project is also being updated which is 
      anticipated to result in an increase in overall revenue for the project 
      when compared to the original assumptions. This is supported by current 
      market prices and consumer demand as evidenced by the sales to date in 
      the project. Management will continue to assess the impacts of these 
      changes to the targeted internal rate of return and provide regular 
      updates to investors regarding the Corporation&#8217;s progress towards 
      achieving the overall investment objectives of the project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights for the First Quarter
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter of 2013, the Corporation:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Obtained registration of the Phase 1 subdivision for the properties.
      
			
        Held a community grand opening event when the showhomes were completed 
        and opened to the public.
      
			
        Signed an agreement with other landowners for cost sharing of mutually 
        beneficial offsite infrastructure, including watermains, sanitary 
        sewers and arterial roadways required to service the properties.
      
			
        Received the second deposits on 21 lots in Phase 1 from one of the 
        members of the home builder syndicate.
      
			
        Subsequent to March 31, 2013, the Corporation received second deposits 
        for a further 24 lots and the Corporation completed a second release 
        of 90 single-family lots for Phase 1.

framework if it is to tap into its shale gas reserves quickly
enough to reap the benefit, a senior executive at Chevron Corp
 said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European governments should also consider sharing any
profits with local communities in an echo of what is done in the
United States, where landowners benefit directly from shale gas
finds, Derek Magness, Chevron onshore Europe general manager,
told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debate is intense in Europe about whether shale gas, by
lowering energy costs, can provide the kind of economic boost
that it has delivered in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a big unknown here," Magness said, saying that
Chevron was committed to exploring shale gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of available data for Europe is tiny compared
with the United States. In Poland, for instance, only one well
has been drilled in one concession, while for an area of a
similar size in the United States, there would be 4,600 wells,
Magness said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, he said, Chevron was drilling a fourth well in
Poland and hoped to drill two more this year. It also plans to
explore in Romania and is in talks with the Ukraine government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magness said he could not comment on ongoing negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAYING THE COURSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Chevron says it is staying, other companies, including
Exxon Mobil, have abandoned shale gas operations in
Poland. Some have cited uncertainty about the regulatory
environment, as well as poor drilling results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union's Executive Commission has said there is
sufficient EU-wide regulation in place for the exploration phase
of shale gas, though more might be needed to cover development.
It has said it will publish later this year a non-binding
framework to guide activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need that regulatory environment in place," Magness
said, arguing it could overcome confusion and share best
practice, with nations such as Britain providing a possible
model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose government is
advancing plans for its shale gas deposits, said at an EU summit
on energy last week that Europe could not afford to be left
behind as the United States gains a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magness said the question is "whether (the European Union)
can do it in a timely manner in order to take advantage of the
marketplace".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits for the United States have included encouraging
re-industrialisation, as the chemical industry, for instance, is
drawn by cheap energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Europe the situation is complex. Opposition from
environmental campaigners is strong and geology and geography
are very different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the cost will rise as prices fell so far in the
United States that shale gas developers suffered a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One catalyst in the United States has been the direct
financial benefit to landowners, which has overcome resistance,
whereas in Europe resources tend to belong to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magness said he had discussed with governments the idea of
handing some of the profits to communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would very much encourage the government to ensure a
portion of the profit would go to that community," he said. "At
least return it to the community in the form of a larger piece
of the budget."

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Disneyland employee has been arrested on suspicion of possessing a destructive device following a small explosion in a trash can at the California theme park on Tuesday that prompted the evacuation of Mickey's Toontown, police said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Barnes, identified as a 22-year-old outdoor vending cast member at Walt Disney Co's Disneyland, was being held on $1 million bail, Sergeant Bob Dunn of the Anaheim Police Department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Barnes is cooperating with investigators and has indicated that this is an isolated incident with unanticipated impacts," Dunn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunn said a police search of the area where the explosion occurred turned up evidence of a dry ice explosion.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif./DALLAS (Reuters) - About 30 percent of shareholders of both Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Wednesday backed calls for more disclosure surrounding their use of hydraulic fracturing, the top two U.S. oil companies said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif./DALLAS May 29 (Reuters) - About 30
percent of shareholders of both Exxon Mobil Corp and
Chevron Corp on Wednesday backed calls for more
disclosure surrounding their use of hydraulic fracturing,  the
top two U.S. oil companies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The votes, which had about the same support last year, 
reflect sustained concern among a large portion of investors and
the general population about the practice, which has unlocked a
huge amount of oil and gas resources across North America but
led to environmentalist worries about water contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Executive John Watson told the annual meeting
of shareholders that his company's level of disclosure was
adequate, as he responded to a request from the fracking
proposal's supporter for more quantitative measures of safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fracking involves injecting chemical-laced water and sand to
break and prop open shale rock to unleash oil and gas. The
industry says it is safe when done properly, and the debate has
moved to Chevron's own backyard, California, where it is just
heating up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said 31 percent of its shareholders supported the
fracking proposal, compared with about 30 percent for Exxon.
Last year, a proposal for a report on fracking risks had support

Sow, an investor advocacy group that filed the Exxon resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another issue of great concern for environmentalists is
Arctic drilling, and rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc has
just gone through an accident-prone foray into offshore drilling
off Alaska's coast over the past year. Watson said Chevron was
still evaluating its opportunities in the Arctic region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the concerns are around costs," he said, speaking
to reporters after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few dozen shareholders gathered outside Chevron's
headquarters in San Ramon, California - just east of San
Francisco - with many of them decryling the influence of
corporate money in U.S. politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Dallas, before Exxon's meeting started, about half a
dozen police guarded its barricaded entrance, but there was only
one protester outside who came to voice his support for equal
benefits for employees in same-sex marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York State Common Retirement fund submitted a
proposal asking Exxon to amend its employment policy to
explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation
and gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York pension funds own about 14 million Exxon shares

			Chevron Highlights 2012 Performance and Future Growth at Annual 
      Meeting of Stockholders
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported the company&#8217;s 2012 
      operational and social performance and future growth plans at its 2013 
      Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s 2012 results demonstrate that we have the people, portfolio 
      and financial strength to deliver superior stockholder value,&#8221; said John 
      Watson, chairman of the board and CEO. &#8220;Our planned growth will increase 
      our capacity to deliver affordable energy, a cornerstone of economic 
      prosperity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson discussed Chevron&#8217;s strong 2012 financial and operational 
      performance, with earnings exceeding $26 billion and return on capital 
      employed (ROCE) approaching 19 percent. In 2012, the company marked its 
      25th consecutive year of annual dividend payment increases, 
      which included last year&#8217;s annual dividend increase of 13.6 percent. 
      Chevron announced another quarterly dividend increase of 11.1 percent in 
      April 2013. Watson also said that for the fourth consecutive year, 
      Chevron led its peers in five-year total stockholder return.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson reiterated Chevron&#8217;s long-standing dedication to safe, reliable 
      operations, noting that Chevron was an industry leader in safety in 
      2012. He also reinforced the company&#8217;s commitment to learn from 
      operational incidents and take definitive corrective actions. Watson 
      also discussed the partnerships Chevron has formed to address health, 
      education and economic development in the communities where the company 
      operates. Over the past seven years, Chevron has invested more than $1 
      billion in projects essential to sustainable communities, and last year 
      the company purchased $60 billion in goods and services around the 
      globe, providing meaningful stimulus for local economies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      George Kirkland, Chevron vice chairman and executive vice president for 
      Upstream and Gas, discussed Chevron&#8217;s strong queue of projects to meet 
      the world&#8217;s future energy needs. Chevron plans to invest $36.7 billion 
      in 2013, with 90 percent of that amount expected to fund upstream 
      activities. The company has invested nearly $111 billion over the past 
      five years to develop crude oil and natural gas resources around the 
      world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kirkland noted that Chevron Upstream had industry-leading performance in 
      both safety and financial performance in 2012. Earnings per barrel have 
      averaged almost seven dollars per barrel higher than the average of the 
      company&#8217;s peer group over the past three years. Cash margins also have 
      been the highest of its peers for three years and ROCE for the last two 
      years. Chevron is on track to deliver on its commitment to produce 3.3 
      million barrels of oil-equivalent per day by 2017, more than 98 percent 
      of which will come from fields that are online today or from projects 
      under construction or in detailed design. Over the next five years, 50 
      projects with a Chevron investment of more than $250 million each are 
      scheduled to start production, 16 of which have a net Chevron investment 
      exceeding $1 billion. Construction on the Gorgon liquefied natural gas 
      (LNG) project in Western Australia is over 60 percent complete, with 
      startup expected in late 2014. Start up of the Wheatstone LNG project, 
      also in Western Australia, is planned for 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Kirkland also discussed Chevron&#8217;s Downstream and Chemicals business, 
      which performed very well in 2012, marked by an improvement in ROCE of 
      more than 10 percentage points since 2009. Chevron Downstream and 
      Chemicals growth projects focus on lubricants and chemicals, including 
      the Pascagoula, Miss., base oil plant, which is scheduled to start up 
      later this year and is expected to position Chevron as the world&#8217;s 
      largest manufacturer of premium base oil. Chevron Oronite&#8217;s Singapore 
      manufacturing plant, already the largest in the Asia-Pacific, is 
      expanding further, with additional capacity scheduled to come online in 
      phases in 2014 and 2016.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Star-Studded Event to Be Held at Disney California Adventure Park 
      on June 22
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walt Disney Studios Chairman, Alan Horn, announced today that ticket 
      sales from the highly anticipated World Premiere of Disney/Jerry 
      Bruckheimer Films&#8217; &#8220;The Lone Ranger&#8221; will benefit the American Indian 
      College Fund. The event will take place on Saturday, June 22, at Disney 
      California Adventure Park in Anaheim, California. A giant red carpet 
      down the Park&#8217;s iconic Hollywood Boulevard will be lined with thousands 
      of park guests cheering for the film&#8217;s stars, filmmakers and the many 
      Hollywood celebrities in attendance. The Lone Ranger&#8217;s horse Silver will 
      make an appearance and an actual train engine built for the film will be 
      on display.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a terrific collaboration with the Native American community 
      throughout the production of Disney&#8217;s &#8216;The Lone Ranger,&#8217;&#8221; said Alan 
      Horn, Chairman of The Walt Disney Studios. &#8220;With the world premiere of 
      this exciting film at hand, we are pleased to commemorate the occasion 
      by supporting the American Indian College Fund.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Academy Award&#174; winner Gore 
      Verbinski, &#8220;The Lone Ranger&#8221; is a thrilling adventure infused with 
      action and humor, in which the famed masked hero is brought to life 
      through new eyes. Johnny Depp stars as a newly imagined Tonto and Armie 
      Hammer plays the masked lawman himself&#8212;the Lone Ranger.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tickets for the premiere event have been donated by Disney to the 
      American Indian College Fund, which will offer them for sale to the 
      public; tickets will be available for purchase at https://community.collegefund.org/the-lone-ranger, 
      starting today. Because Disney is also underwriting the entire cost of 
      the premiere, 100% of the revenues received by the American Indian 
      College Fund for the tickets will be used for scholarships and other 
      support for Native American students. Tickets are priced at $1000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fund President, Cheryl Crazy Bull, stated:&#160;&#8220;The Fund is pleased to be 
      the beneficiary of this event because our scholarships are an investment 
      in a healthier, more prosperous future for tribal students and their 
      families. We are poised to serve over 20,000 American Indian and Alaska 
      Native students attending the tribal colleges across this country. 
      Currently our scholarships serve less than 21% of those students so we 
      appreciate any opportunity to bring resources into our scholarship 
      program.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney California Adventure Park will be hosting the premiere and 
      sponsors will be offering opportunities for the guests in conjunction 
      with the event. Commenting on the premiere event, Tom Staggs, Chairman 
      of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said, &#8220;All of us at Disney Parks are 
      thrilled to host the world premiere of &#8216;The Lone Ranger&#8217; at Disney 
      California Adventure. Disney brings unforgettable stories and characters 
      to life in our movies and in our parks and resorts, so there&#8217;s no better 
      place than Disney California Adventure to start this trailblazing film 
      on its journey.&#8221;

      Visa Signature, a premiere sponsor, will have a fan pen on the red 
      carpet for the first 50 Visa Signature cardholders who show their card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Utah Office of Tourism and Film, a premiere sponsor, will provide an 
      opportunity for guests of the park to enter to win a trip to Utah and 
      premiere guests will enjoy a photo opportunity provided by the sponsor. 
      Many of the movie&#8217;s memorable scenes were filmed in the Monument Valley 
      area of southern Utah.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Christie Digital, a global visual technologies company with expertise in 
      film projection since 1929, is providing all the projection for &#8220;The

      the premiere, will be displayed at the event and will be available for

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates JPMorgan U.S. Government Money Market Fund 'AAAmmf'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AAAmmf' rating to the JPMorgan U.S. 
      Government Money Market Fund managed by J.P. Morgan Investment 
      Management Inc. (JPMIM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The main drivers for the assigned 'AAAmmf' rating are:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The fund's investment guidelines mandating overall credit quality, 
      diversification and maturity profile;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Minimal exposure to interest rate and spread risks;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The capabilities and resources of J.P. Morgan Investment Management 
      Inc. as investment adviser.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 'AAAmmf' rating reflects the fund's extremely strong capacity to 
      achieve its investment objective of seeking high current income with 
      liquidity and stability of principal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CREDIT QUALITY/DIVERSIFICATION
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund invests its assets exclusively in securities that are issued or 
      guaranteed by the U.S. government or by U.S. government agencies and 
      instrumentalities (which may bear adjustable rates of interest). In 
      addition, the fund may invest in repurchase agreements collateralized by 
      U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government securities. As of April 25, 2013, the 
      fund had $62.7 billion in assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under normal market conditions, the fund invests in securities rated at 
      least 'F1' by Fitch or equivalent or enters into repurchase agreements 
      with counterparties rated at least 'F1' or equivalent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These investment policies are consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating 
      criteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MATURITY PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund seeks to manage its market risk exposure by limiting its 
      dollar-weighted average maturity (WAM) and weighted average life to 
      maturity (WAL) to 60 and 120 days, respectively, consistent with Fitch's 
      'AAAmmf' rating criteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LIQUIDITY PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund's additional investment restrictions are aimed at maintaining 
      sufficient levels of daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' 
      redemption requests. In line with amended Rule 2a-7 under the Investment 
      Company Act of 1940, the fund must invest at least 10% of total assets 
      in daily liquid assets and at least 30% of total assets in weekly liquid 
      assets. As of this rating assignment, the fund fully met these liquidity

      JPMIM is a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Asset Management Holdings 
      Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      'A+/F1' by Fitch), a bank holding company. Fitch views JPMIM's 
      investment advisory capabilities, financial and resource commitments, 
      operational controls, corporate governance, and compliance procedures as 
      consistent with the 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the fund. As of March 
      31, 2013, JPMIM had approximately $1.5 trillion in assets under 
      management worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      RATING SENSITIVITY AND SURVEILLANCE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality or 
      market risk profiles of the fund. A material adverse deviation from 
      Fitch guidelines for any key rating driver could cause the ratings to be 
      lowered by Fitch. Furthermore, given the primary investment focus on 
      U.S. government securities, the rating may be sensitive to material 
      adverse changes in the U.S. government's financial condition and that of 
      the broader U.S. economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch receives weekly fund holdings information and other pertinent fund 
      data from the fund administrator to conduct surveillance against ratings 
      guidelines and maintain its money market fund ratings. For additional

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS May 29 (Reuters) - Fewer shareholders of Exxon Mobil
Corp on Wednesday cast votes in favor of the oil
company's executive compensation following a year when Chief
Executive Officer Rex Tillerson's total pay climbed 15 percent
to about $40 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy advisory firm ISS had recommended that shareholders
withhold support for CEO Tillerson's compensation, citing
Exxon's "modest" shareholder returns and the company's reliance
on awards that have less emphasis on performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year at the company's annual meeting, 71 percent of
Exxon's shareholders cast a non binding vote supporting the
compensation of the company's named executives, compared with 78
percent last year. The average support for so-called say-on-pay
results was 91 percent in 2012, according to ISS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson told reporters after the meeting that the decline
in support for his pay "wasn't a significant move" and meant
that 70 percent of Exxon's shareholders were happy with the
company's compensation practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's total shareholder return - or capital gains plus
dividends - for the year ended 2012 was about 5 percent,
compared with 16 percent for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500,
according to ISS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon contends that ISS's model inappropriately emphasizes
short-term stock performance and disregards the long-term
investing cycles for an oil company like Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Tillerson's total compensation as calculated by the
proxy firm rose 15 percent to $40 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Management says has lost 15 pct of May sales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Workers solder plant gates shut on wage demands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARACAS May 29 (Reuters) - A strike at the Venezuelan
division of Coca-Cola Femsa , Latin America's
largest Coke bottler, reached its ninth day on Wednesday as the
company said the stoppage had cost it 15 percent of its expected
sales for the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 50 workers protesting for higher wages soldered shut
the gates of the company's largest plant in the central-western
city of Valencia, preventing products and personnel from
entering or leaving the compound, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During the course of the strike, 15 percent of our sales at
a national level have already been lost, what has not been sold
will not be recovered," Mariana Parma, director of corporate
affairs at Coca-Cola Femsa Venezuela said, describing worker
demands as "crazy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company calls the strike "illegal" and "arbitrary" and
said some parts of the country are already facing shortages of
its products including Coca-Cola, bottled water and juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital of Caracas has not shown signs of shortages of
Coca-Cola Femsa products, though consumers are scrambling to
find basic goods ranging from corn flour to toilet paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was unable to reach strike leaders for a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa, a joint venture of Coca-Cola Co
 and Mexican company Femsa , this year
said 18 percent of its 2012 sales came from Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has 34 bottling plants in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Cisco asks Europe's second-highest court to annul EU
decision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Says EU Commission was wrong to approve creation of a
monopoly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Commission lawyer points to various rivals to Skype&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Case is one of several merger challenges at the Luxembourg
court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUXEMBOURG, May 29 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc,
the world's leading network equipment maker, asked an EU court
on Wednesday to annul the approval of Microsoft's 
purchase of Skype, saying EU regulators were wrong to allow the
creation of a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco's challenge at the Luxembourg-based General Court
follows the European Commission's approval of the $8.5 billion
deal in 2011. Microsoft was not required to make any concessions
for buying the Internet video and voice messaging company, which
Cisco argues has given Microsoft/Skype an unfair advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third of the world's voice calls are now on Skype while
over 280 million users use the service more than 100 minutes
every month, Microsoft chief operating officer Kevin Turner said
in March. Skype had 170 million users at the time of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is important as Internet-based voice and video has
become a vast market, with many consumers and corporates
abandoning traditional fixed-line and mobile as a result, and is
an area in which Cisco had hoped to expand its presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft acquisition "marked a tipping point in the
video communications market", Cisco's lawyer, Luis Ortiz Blanco,
told judges at Europe's second-highest court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The merger created an effective monopoly and condemned
comepttiors to a niche. The reasoning applied (by the
Commission) incurred numerous errors," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corneliu Hoedlmayr, a lawyer for the Commission, said
Cisco's arguments were unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The applicants have failed to provide evidence of
competitive harm," he told the court, citing the existence of
other rivals to Skype such as Google Talk and
Cyprus-based calling and messaging servicer Viber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other technologies are emerging. If these succeed, it may
render Skype a relic," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco is appealing together with Italian fixed-line and
Internet telephone provider and Skype rival Messagenet SpA.
Judges will rule in the coming months. Their verdict can be
appealed to the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest
court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last successful challenge to a Commission
merger-approval decision at the court was in 2002 in a case
involving the Sony Music and BMG record labels. In the vast
majority of cases, the court rules with the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco's challenge is one of four cases against the European
Commission's rulings in merger cases, underlining the increasing
willingness by companies to challenge decisions which they
disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Boerse last year filed an appeal against
the Commission's rejection of its merger with NYSE Euronext
 while UPS has also gone to court against a
regulatory veto of its proposed TNT buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryanair has similarly said it will fight the
Commission's veto of its plan to buy Aer Lingus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco's case is T-79/12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Disneyland employee was charged on Thursday with possessing a destructive device by prosecutors who said he was behind two small, dry-ice explosions at the California theme park earlier this week that prompted an evacuation of Mickey's Toontown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY May 30 (Reuters) - Struggling Mexican
homebuilder Homex  has hired J.P. Morgan
Securities to be its financial adviser as the company faces
mounting debt problems, Homex said on Thursday in a statement to
the Mexican stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

finances and sketch out alternatives aimed at turning the
company around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No further details were given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Homex said in its delayed annual filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that failure to meet
payments due on derivatives "arguably" constitutes an event of
default on debt owed by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homex at the end of December had a total of $900 million in
three bonds due in 2015, 2019 and 2020, according to its
fourth-quarter report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays' Mexico unit and Credit Suisse are suing Homex in
New York courts over missed payments on derivative positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homex, like domestic rivals Geo and Urbi
, has been struggling to make debt payments amid a
slump in home sales.&lt;/p&gt;

states that allow it for medical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a giant market in search of a brand," Shively said of
the marijuana industry. "We would be happy if we get 40 percent
of it worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2005 United Nations report estimated the global marijuana
trade to be valued at $142 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington state and Colorado became the first two U.S.
states to legalize recreational marijuana when voters approved
legalization in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shively is planning to lay out his plans, along with his
vision for a future in which marijuana will be legally imported
from Mexico, at a Thursday news conference in downtown Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of cannabis or marijuana remains illegal in much of
the world although countries mainly in Europe and the Americas
have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of it. A
larger number of countries have decriminalized or legalized
cannabis for medical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shively acknowledges that his business plans conflict with
U.S. federal law and are complicated by regulations in both
Washington state and Colorado. He said he is interested in
buying dispensaries that comply with local and state rules and
are less likely to attract the scrutiny of authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they want to come talk to me, I'll be delighted to meet
with them," he said of federal officials. "I'll tell them
everything that we're doing and show them all our books."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SKEPTICISM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington state's marijuana consultant, Mark Kleiman, said
he was skeptical of Shively's plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very hard for me to understand why anybody seriously
interested in being in the marijuana business, which after all
is against the federal law, would so publicly announce his
conspiracy to break that law," said Kleiman, a professor of
public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily Langlie, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Seattle, referred questions to the Department of Justice
headquarters. Department officials did not immediately return
calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington state Representative Reuven Carlyle, a Seattle
Democrat, sees promise in Shively's initiative. Any industry
emerging from the shadows will inevitably undergo consolidation
- and thereby simplify the task of regulators, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that an entrepreneur is publicly pushing the
envelope around a branding and value-based pricing opportunity,
I would say that's in the water in Seattle," said Carlyle,
chairman of the House Finance Committee. "That's in our DNA ...
We could have predicted that as much as the rain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shively said he has already acquired the rights to the
Northwest Patient Resource Center, a medical marijuana operation
that includes two Seattle store fronts. He added that he was
close to acquiring another dispensary in Colorado, as well as
two more each in Washington state and California, with the
owners given the option to retain a stake in their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've created the first risk-mitigated vehicles for
investing directly in this business opportunity," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shively said he ultimately plans to create separate medical
and recreational-use marijuana brands. Shively said he also
plans to launch a study of the effectiveness of concentrated
cannabis oil in the treatment of cancer and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Disneyland employee was charged on Thursday with possessing a destructive device, two days after a small explosion prompted evacuation of the Mickey's Toontown section of the California theme park, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disneyland vendor Christian Barnes is accused of being in possession of two water bottles filled with dry ice, which both exploded in the park on Tuesday, the Orange County District Attorney's Office said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second explosion, near a Toontown trash can, prompted the evacuation of that area of the park for about two hours, according to the district attorney's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes was taken into custody later that evening by Anaheim police, who discovered evidence of a dry ice explosion. Authorities had previously described only one explosion at the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes, a 22-year-old resident of Long Beach, California, faces a maximum of six years in prison if convicted on the single charge of "possession of a destructive device in a public place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Walt Disney Co. spokeswoman has said the incident appears to have been a prank and that the theme park was working closely with local authorities. She said the company was considering whether to suspend or terminate Barnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disneyland, located in Anaheim 35 miles southeast of Los Angeles, is Disney's original theme park and one of the top tourist attractions in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 57-year-old park attracted more than 16 million visitors in 2011, the most recent year for which statistics were available, according to the trade group Themed Entertainment Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toontown is a theme area aimed at younger children, who can visit the cartoon-style homes of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Grant McCool)&lt;/p&gt;

			Microsoft Leads the World in Two of Six IPTV Market Categories
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multimedia Research Group, the market leader in the Video and Media 
      ecosystem for more than 20 years, is excited to release its 
      comprehensive study IPTV Market Leader Report, 2013, which shows 
      that Microsoft is the only company to lead in more than one category on 
      a global level.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MRG's IPTV Market Leader Reports identify which IPTV systems and 
      software companies are leading each segment: access systems, video 
      headend systems, VOD server software, set-top boxes, middleware and 
      content protection/digital rights management. Data is also segmented by 
      region: North America, CALA, Western/Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and 
      MEA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Many of the changes in the IPTV realm are happening in Eastern Europe, 
      as that region continues to grow and regional vendors benefit &#8210; thus the 
      appearance of SmartLabs in the #1 spots for VOD, set-tops and 
      middleware," explained Norm Bogen, MRG's VP of Research. "Microsoft 
      continues to excel in North America, taking the top spots in VOD and 
      content protection due to its relationship with ATT. Microsoft also 
      leads in VOD for Western Europe, where it has large IPTV providers as 
      customers. Asia's ranks changed, with CASTIS taking the lead in VOD. 
      Finally, Anevia is leading VOD in the Middle East/Africa region for the 
      first time."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MRG is the only company to track and rank IPTV vendors for each of the 
      six categories, and has been doing so for many years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report features IPTV vendor rankings for each product category. In 
      addition, vendors that are working with the top 25 global service 
      providers are highlighted in order to better gauge future growth 
      prospects. The report also segments service providers by tier (1 &#8211; 5) 
      and identifies how many providers are in each tier where each vendor has 
      products deployed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      More than 100 vendors and 940 IPTV service providers are tracked in this 
      report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Analysts forecast the Global Network Management Software Market in the 
      Telecom Industry grow at a CAGR of 9.08 percent over the period 
      2012-2016. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is

      Network Management Software Market in the Telecom Industry has also been 
      witnessing the increase adopting of automated network management

      Key vendors dominating this space include CA Technology Inc., NetScout 
      Systems Inc., IBM Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Visual Network Systems 
      Ltd.

      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the Telecom team said: ''The 
      adoption of automated network management software is an emerging trend 
      witnessed in the Telecom industry. In line with this trend, vendors have 
      started offering automated network management software. Many forms of 
      automation are available in telecom network management. This software 
      helps telecom network service providers overcome the difficulties in 
      detection of network faults, network configuration auditing and 
      compliance analysis, and root cause analysis of network faults, and 
      alarms on the detection of network issues and problems. The automated 
      functions of network management software help network managers keep pace 
      with the dynamically-changing business environment. Thus, the increase 
      in the adoption of automated network management software is an emerging 
      trend that is expected to have a positive impact on the market during 
      the forecast period.''

&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft to pay $1 million up front to Vringo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Lawsuit focused on patents involving search engine
advertising&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Vringo unit had won $30 million verdict against Google,
others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, May 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has
agreed to settle a lawsuit accusing it of infringing patents
that enable Internet search engines to place advertisements most
effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vringo Inc, whose I/P Engine Inc subsidiary filed
the lawsuit in January, announced the settlement on Thursday.
Microsoft has agreed to pay $1 million and enter into a
licensing agreement as part of the agreement, according to
Vringo's U.S. regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed the accuracy of Vringo'
description of the settlement but declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
I/P Engine said Microsoft had used search technology based on
inventions by two employees of Vringo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit came after a jury in Virginia awarded I/P Engine
about $30 million in damages after fining companies including
Google Inc and AOL Inc for infringing the same patents
at issue in the Microsoft case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That verdict last November was seen as a disappointment for
Vringo, which had been seeking at least $696 million, and its
stock fell as much as 10 percent following the news. An appeal
is pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patents at issue were acquired by I/P Engine from Lycos
Inc, the once-popular search engine created in 1994. The two
inventors of the patents now work at Vringo, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the settlement, Vringo said Microsoft had also
agreed to pay 5 percent of any amounts Google pays to use the
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sum is subject to a cap, although Vringo said that would
not affect the company unless the amounts received from Google
exceed the judgment it won at trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also agreed to assign six patents to I/P Engine
for telecommunications, data management, and other technology
areas, Vringo said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vringo's shares were up 3.5 percent at $3.24 in midmorning
trading, while Microsoft rose 0.5 percent to $35.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is I/P Engine, Inc v. Microsoft Corp, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-688.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is bringing back the Windows "start" button, offering a stripped-down version among a slew of improvements aimed at winning over tablet users and placating PC customers alienated by Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is looking to re-energize sales of its latest Windows version, which has not made the splash with computer users it was hoping for. Executives say the plan is now to update Windows periodically, rather than waiting three years or so between big releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft has sold more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses since October, broadly in line with Windows 7 three years ago, the company must tackle a dwindling PC user base and its inability to make a mark in the exploding tablet market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shipments of traditional PCs - the most reliable gauge of Windows' popularity - are expected to fall almost 8 percent this year, while Microsoft's Surface has taken less than 2 percent of the tablet market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 was designed to be used both on touch-screen tablets and traditional PCs. But while touch-screen users tend to like the new "tile"-based interface, many mouse and keyboard users complained that the new design was confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirming speculation, Microsoft said the Windows 8.1 update will have a button in the bottom left corner of the screen that acts like the "start" button in previous versions of Windows. Although it will not be labeled "start", it features the Windows logo and takes the user straight to a grid of applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The work you are seeing us do here is continuing to advance the modern (interface), while really taking into account some of the things we've learned from people who still want to use the desktop, to make the transition easier," Antoine Leblond, corporate vice president of the Windows unit, said in an advance briefing on the Windows 8.1 update last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is only making features of the new software public on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FREE UPDATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 8.1, previously known by the code name "Blue", will be available for free to all Windows 8 users some time later this year. Microsoft will make a test version available at its annual developer conference on June 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 8.1 also includes a vastly improved "search" function, which allows a user to search for documents, apps, or items on the Internet from a single search bar, like a souped-up version of Apple Inc's Spotlight feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid by swiping down or pressing a button on-screen, which should make it easy for unfamiliar users to get to the app they want quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can also customize the start screen much more easily, changing sizes of app icon "tiles" or controlling which apps appear. For the first time, it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new-look interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 8.1 includes Microsoft's latest browser, Internet Explorer 11, and lets the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view. That feature was missing in the initial version of Windows 8, which was designed to make the most of limited screen space on a tablet but tended to disorient traditional mouse and keyboard users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users will also no longer have to switch to the old desktop view to make changes in their default settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they will still have to switch back to a traditional desktop set-up to use some programs such as Word or Excel, which have not been redesigned to function in the new Windows 8 style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE May 30 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil said on
Thursday it started ethylene production at a new chemical unit
in Singapore, marking the completion of a multi-billion dollar
expansion project at its Singapore petrochemical complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the start-up of a 1 million tonne per year (tpy) steam
cracker, the company will increase production at other
petrochemical units in the complex on Jurong Island over the
next few weeks, it said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansion adds production of at least 1.4 million tpy of
polymers and elastomers, which have already entered commercial
operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complex is now the ExxonMobil's largest globally and
will produce about 2.6 million tpy of petrochemicals aimed at
meeting regional demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project had been scheduled to start operation at the end
of 2011, but it was delayed due to its complexity and a weak
economic outlook, industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethylene is a feedstock for producing polymers used in
plastics production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders said there may be some short-term downward impact on
petrochemical prices from the start-up, although one
Singapore-based trader said ExxonMobil is likely to run the
ethylene through its own systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as the polymers margins are doing fine, Exxon
should not be flooding the market with ethylene," said the
Singapore trader.&lt;/p&gt;

      $13,719,000 class A-M and $5,753,300 class B-5 certificate will not be 
      rated by Fitch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the clear capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by 
      third party underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will act 
      as the master servicer and U.S. Bank Trust N.A. will act as the trustee 
      for the transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be 
      made to treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage investment 
      conduits (REMICs).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This transaction includes the use of Pentalpha Surveillance LLC 
      (Pentalpha) as representation  warranties (RW) breach reviewer for the 
      benefit of the trust. The securities administrator will instruct 
      Pentalpha to review any loan that satisfies the review trigger. 
      Pentalpha will review the loan using the breach determination review 
      procedures outlined in the transaction documents to identify failures 
      with respect to one or more of the breach determination procedures. If a 
      failure exists, Pentalpha will determine whether or not the failure is 
      material, based on materiality conditions outlined in the transaction 
      documents. Pentalpha will then provide the final results of its review 
      and determination to the securities administrator.

      JPMMT 2013-2 will be J.P. Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Corp.'s second 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2013. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime fixed-rate mortgage loans. The loans are 
      all fully amortizing. The aggregate pool included loans originated from 
      J.P. Morgan Chase Bank (19.7%), Guaranteed Rate, Inc. (16.6%), 
      Residential Pacific Mortgage (15.4%), Cobalt Mortgage, Inc. (10.2%), 
      PrimeLending, a PlainsCapital Company (7.4%), Opes Advisors, Inc. 
      (7.1%), Bank of Manhattan (5.7%) and other various mortgage lending 
      institutions, each of which contributed less than 5% to the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 544 loans with a 
      total balance of $442,543,301; an average balance of $813,499; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 69.4%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 4%. Rate/Term and cash out 
      refinances account for 63.5% and 8% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 773. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 98% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (46.5%), 
      Illinois (13%), and Washington (12.4%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists entirely of 
      30-year fixed rate mortgages (FRMs) to borrowers with strong credit 
      profiles, full documentation, low leverage, and significant liquid 
      reserves. A 69.4% CLTV provides a significant buffer against potential 
      home price declines. Strong borrower quality is reflected in the 773 
      weighted average (WA) original FICO, $372,144 WA household income and 
      $419,575 WA liquid reserves. In addition, third-party due diligence was 
      conducted on 100% of the pool and the results indicated strong 
      underwriting controls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Weak Representations and Warranties Framework: While the transaction 
      benefits from JPMCB and J.P. Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Corp. (JPMMAC; 
      rated 'A+/F1') as rep providers for more than 92% of the pool, Fitch 
      believes the value of the RW framework is significantly diluted by the 
      presence of qualifying and conditional language that substantially 
      reduces lender loan breach liability and the inclusion of sunsets on 
      three provisions. The sunset trigger has been simplified and 
      strengthened in this transaction. While the agency believes that the 
      high credit quality pool and clean diligence results mitigate the RW 
      risks to some degree, Fitch considered the weaker framework in its 
      analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Originators With Limited Performance History: The majority of the pool 
      was originated by lenders with limited non-agency performance history. 
      Although the significant contribution of loans from these originators is 
      a concern, Fitch believes the lack of performance history is partially 
      mitigated by the 100% third-party diligence conducted on these loans 
      that resulted in immaterial findings. Fitch also considers the credit 
      enhancement (CE) on this transaction sufficient to mitigate the 
      originator risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how 
      the ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than 
      assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national 
      levels. The implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some 
      of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that 
      the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the 
      surveillance of the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected 
      lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The 
      model currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For 
      one of the top 10 regions in the mortgage pool, 
      Chicago-Joliet-Naperville in Illinois (11.7%), Fitch's SHP model does 
      not project a decline in home prices. Fitch conducted sensitivity 
      analyses assuming sMVDs of 10%, 15%, and 20% for this identified 
      metropolitan area. The sensitivity analyses indicated no impact on 
      ratings for all bonds in each scenario.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In its analysis, Fitch considered placing a greater emphasis on recent 
      economic performance in determining market value declines. While Fitch's 
      current loan loss model looks to three years of historical data and one 
      year of projections, this does not incorporate recent notable economic 
      improvement. To reflect the more recent economic environment, a 
      sensitivity analysis was performed using two years of historical 
      economic data and two years of projections. The result of this 
      sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss 
      expectations for this transaction. This sensitivity analysis resulted in 
      a base sMVD of 13.2%, down from 14%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model projected 14% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      report titled ' J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust, Series 2013-2', which is

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Final Ratings to J.P. Morgan 
      Mortgage Trust 2013-2 Certificates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigns final ratings to sixteen classes 
      of mortgage pass-through certificates from J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 
      2013-2, a jumbo prime RMBS transaction. Concurrently we have withdrawn 
      our preliminary ratings on the certificates, which were assigned on May 
      23, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mortgage pool backing J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2013-2 is comprised 
      of 544 first-lien mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of 
      $442,543,300.75 as of the cut-off date. The loans in the pool are all 
      fixed-rate mortgages with 30-year maturities. None of the loans are 
      interest-only. The pool is characterized by substantial borrower equity 
      in each mortgaged property, as evidenced by the weighted average LTV 
      (69%) and CLTV (69%). The weighted average credit score of the mortgage 
      pool is 775, which is well within the &#8220;prime&#8221; mortgage range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction included a loan-level analysis of the 
      mortgage pools using our Residential Mortgage Default and Loss Model, 
      together with a review of the key transaction parties, results of loan 
      file reviews performed by independent third party firms and review of 
      the legal structure and key documentation. This analysis is further 
      described in our U.S. RMBS Rating Methodology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms JP Morgan Commercial Mortgage Finance Corp., Series 
      2000-C10
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed eight classes of JP Morgan Commercial 
      Mortgage Finance Corp. commercial mortgage pass-through certificates 
      series 2000-C10. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are the result of sufficient credit enhancement to 
      offset concentration risk and adverse selection with only nine loans 
      remaining in the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 1.8% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 8.6%, including losses already incurred. 
      The pool has experienced $63.1 million (8.6% of the original pool 
      balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated one loan 
      (14.4%) as a Fitch Loan of Concern; none of the loans are specially 
      serviced.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the May 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 97% to $22.2 million from $738.5 million at 
      issuance. There is one defeased loan (12.7% of the pool). Interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting classes G through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook for class E is expected to remain Stable. Class F 
      remains on Negative Outlook due to the high concentration and several 
      loans with single tenant exposure within the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes and assigns recovery estimates (RE) 
      as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.9 million class E at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10.2 million class F at 'Asf', Outlook Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.2 million class G at 'Dsf', RE 100%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Classes A1, A2, B, C and D have paid in full. Due to realized losses 
      classes H, J, K, L and M have been reduced to zero and remain at 'Dsf/RE 
      0%'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X 
      certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Eaton Collaborates with Portland General Electric to Power Smart Grid 
      Demonstration Project
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Diversified industrial manufacturer Eaton worked with Portland General 
      Electric (PGE) to develop an energy storage system and customized 
      solutions for the new Salem Smart Power Center, a five-megawatt (MW) 
      energy storage facility unveiled today in Salem, Ore. The 
      8,000-square-foot fully functional smart grid site will allow PGE to 
      demonstrate how the integration of renewable energy sources, including 
      wind and solar, and demand-response technology can increase the 
      reliability and efficiency of energy for business and residential 
      customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "PGE is working hard to pave the way for the smart grid in the region, 
      and Eaton&#8217;s collaboration with this important project will help Oregon 
      and the nation learn how to build intelligent energy resources for the 
      future while continuing to deliver long-term value for customers," said 
      Jim Piro, PGE president and CEO. "Eaton&#8217;s power system expertise helped 
      make the project possible, and we appreciate the dedication to 
      excellence they brought to this project.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Eaton has one of the largest and most experienced teams of power system 
      engineers in the industry. PGE drew upon this expertise for the design, 
      engineering, integration and testing of the Salem Smart Power Center. 
      Eaton also modified its award-winning Power XpertTM inverters 
      seamlessly into the site&#8217;s energy storage system. The inverters are 
      designed to maximize energy harvest from renewable resources and 
      transform energy into clean, reliable alternating current.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Eaton&#8217;s power management expertise and industry-leading solutions are 
      helping PGE advance the electrical infrastructure and test new smart 
      grid technologies with business and residential customers,&#8221; said Bill 
      Miller, global marketing director for Eaton Electrical Service and 
      Systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE&#8217;s Salem Smart Power project is part of the Pacific Northwest Smart 
      Grid Demonstration Project and involves more than 60,000 customers in 
      Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. To learn more about the

        Dell DVS Enterprise for vWorkspace reference architecture provides 
        flexible, cost-effective deployment of 500 to 5,000 virtual desktops 
        based on Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Dell Cloud Client Computing 
      today announced new end-to-end solutions to help simplify and speed the 
      deployment of desktop virtualization solutions for customers 
      implementing a Microsoft-based IT environment. Dell introduced 
      enhancements to its DVS 
      Enterprise for Windows Server 2012, which enables small to mid-sized 
      organizations to take advantage of existing Microsoft licensing 
      investments and deploy a combination of up to 600 VDI users or 1,040 
      remote desktop sessions (RDSH). The new updates include faster and more 
      flexible deployment of converged infrastructure, 10-seat proof of 
      concept, high-end graphics and support for Windows 8 and Microsoft 
      Office 2013. As an extension to higher seat count, Dell also released 
      the DVS Enterprise for 
      vWorkspace Reference Architecture based on Windows Server 2012 
      Hyper-V for customers looking for a flexible, cost effective solution to 
      support up to 5,000 virtual desktops, including advanced virtual machine 
      (VM) management functions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dell will showcase the new offerings at
			Microsoft 
      TechEd,
			Microsoft&#8217;s premier event for IT professionals and 
      enterprise developers, next week in booth #1201.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DVS 
      Enterprise for Windows Server 2012 is designed for small to
			mid-sized 
      organizations such as schools and universities that have existing 
      Microsoft and education licensing and purchasing agreements and are 
      interested in a limited-sized deployment, along with a mix of remote 
      desktop sessions and virtual machines at an affordable cost. This 
      end-to-end solution, which promotes rapid time to deployment, now offers 
      the following enhancements:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Converged Infrastructure Deployment Option: Supporting 
        Microsoft VDI workloads on its converged 
        infrastructure platform for the first time, Dell is offering a 
        pre-built, pre-configured version of DVS Enterprise for Windows Server 
        2012 validated with Dell 
        Active System. A key component of the solution is Active 
        System Manager, which extends the management capabilities beyond 
        the physical to the virtualized infrastructure and workloads. Because 
        it is pre-integrated, this form of deployment helps organizations 
        accelerate the implementation and configuration of VDI, maximize 
        efficiency, and deliver predictable and reliable VDI services to end 
        users.
      
			
				Small Business
				or VDI Proof of Concept (POC) Deployment 
        Option: Dell is also offering a 10-seat VDI solution based on DVS 
        Enterprise for Windows Server 2012, aimed at doctors&#8217; offices, 
        accounting firms, local law firms, retail shops, etc. It is also 
        suitable as a POC for larger organizations interested in trying out 
        VDI on Windows Server Hyper-V cost-effectively. The solution includes 
        a Dell 
        PowerEdge T110 II tower server, Dell ProSupport&#185;, Dell 
        Wyse thin clients and a setup guide.
      
			
				Virtualized High-End Graphics: With NVIDIA GRID and AMD 
        FirePro&#8482; graphics cards certified on Dell PowerEdge R720 running 
        Windows Server 2012, IT organizations can easily deliver a 
        high-fidelity, rich multi-media experience to virtual desktop users 
        through RemoteFX across LAN and WAN. Standard graphics users now have 
        the modeling and high-definition imaging capabilities needed to be 
        productive from a VDI session. With Microsoft RemoteFX coupled with 
        virtualized graphics technology, users can securely access multimedia 
        or graphics intensive 3D applications built on DirectX from any 
        location and on virtually any device, while providing IT departments 
        with the ability to centrally host and manage sensitive user data and 
        resources. When combined with powerful Dell Wyse endpoints certified 
        and optimized for Microsoft RemoteFX, organizations gain all the 
        advantages of desktop virtualization without compromising performance.
      
			
				Windows 8 and Microsoft Office 2013 Sizing: In addition to 
        Windows 7, Dell is now adding sizing guidance and support for Windows 
        8 Enterprise and Microsoft Office 2013 on DVS Enterprise for Windows 
        Server 2012 so organizations can plan Operating System migrations for 
        the long-term. With Windows 8 support, organizations can now increase 
        end-user satisfaction by providing seamless access to virtual desktops 
        using touch-enabled devices, such as Dell tablets or select Dell Wyse 
        thin clients running Windows Embedded 8 Standard. By embracing Windows 
        8 and RemoteFX technologies, Dell provides a robust end-to-end VDI 
        solution based on Microsoft RemoteFX.

			Dell DVS Enterprise for vWorkspace
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dell DVS Enterprise has been qualified for vWorkspace 
      8 software based on Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V, offering one more 
      option for Microsoft-centric customers looking for a flexible, 
      cost-effective and higher seat count deployments of up to about 5,000 
      virtual desktops. The new end-to-end, mid-market, reference 
      architecture, DVS

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Even before the chief U.S. power market regulator announced his resignation this week, the agency pursuing a contested probe against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) for alleged market manipulation had good reason to take its time building the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, already embroiled in a public legal battle with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) over disclosing certain emails, alerted investors earlier this month that it expected FERC to move against the bank for trading activities in electricity markets. That followed the leak of FERC's initial findings, raising expectations of near-term action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet former officials and legal experts say recent events could give FERC cause to build its case for several more months, taking time to evaluate the legal scope of its oversight after an unexpected set-back in court and to consider the next step in a high-profile case against Barclays (BARC.L) that has gone quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, to await the replacement for its chairman, who will step down after a period of unprecedented action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chairman Jon Wellinghoff, who joined the commission in 2006 just a year after Congress vastly expanded FERC's powers to pursue market manipulation after the Enron scandal, confirmed his resignation from the post on Wednesday. He will remain in the position until a replacement is confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While much of the enforcement work has fallen to former U.S. Attorney Norman Bay, Wellinghoff's leadership since 2009 has coincided with a series of high-profile actions and settlements against big powers in the electricity market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless you're facing irreparable loss, there is no need to hurry," said Susan Court, FERC's director of enforcement from 2005 through 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIME TO SETTLE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is one of several major FERC enquiries that have unnerved the U.S. power market, and added to a handful of regulatory woes facing JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Critics say the agency is overreaching; FERC officials say they are simply cracking down on market malfeasance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, political pressure is mounting: Michigan Congressman Dan Kildee, a Democrat who sits on the Committee on Financial Services, this week called on the Department of Justice to investigate the bank's power trading in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has acknowledged the probe, but says it "strongly disagrees" with the FERC conclusions and insists that it acted properly in all trades. A representative of the bank declined any further comment this week on the possible timing of FERC action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the bank has said it is readying for a long fight, a slower approach from FERC could allow for more time to coax the bank toward settlement talks - and spare one if its top executives, commodities chief Blythe Masters, public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more complicated cases do tend to take longer to work out and it is also a fact that most cases do settle," says former commissioner Marc Spitzer, who is now a partner at the law firm of Steptoe and Johnson LLP in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RULINGS CLUTTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-March, a federal court ruled that FERC overstepped its authority when it fined Brian Hunter of Amaranth Advisors LLC $30 million for the $6 billion in bad bets he booked on natural gas futures that precipitated the firm's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court found that FERC's punishment was out of bounds since Hunter made bets on natural gas futures - the domain of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, a further complication: the CFTC agreed to hand FERC most of its authority over the power market, but retained some jurisdiction over power trades on an "as-needed basis".

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK May 31 (Reuters) - Even before the
chief U.S. power market regulator announced his resignation this
week, the agency pursuing a contested probe against JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co for alleged market manipulation had good
reason to take its time building the case.&lt;/p&gt;

taking time to evaluate the legal scope of its oversight after
an unexpected set-back in court and to consider the next step in
a high-profile case against Barclays that has gone
quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, to await the replacement for its chairman, who will
step down after a period of unprecedented action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chairman Jon Wellinghoff, who joined the commission in 2006
just a year after Congress vastly expanded FERC's powers to
pursue market manipulation after the Enron scandal, confirmed
his resignation from the post on Wednesday. He will remain in

unnerved the U.S. power market, and added to a handful of
regulatory woes facing JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.
Critics say the agency is overreaching; FERC officials say they
are simply cracking down on market malfeasance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, political pressure is mounting: Michigan
Congressman Dan Kildee, a Democrat who sits on the Committee on
Financial Services, this week called on the Department of
Justice to investigate the bank's power trading in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has acknowledged the probe, but says it "strongly

properly in all trades. A representative of the bank declined
any further comment this week on the possible timing of FERC
action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the bank has said it is readying for a long fight, a
slower approach from FERC could allow for more time to coax the
bank toward settlement talks - and spare one if its top
executives, commodities chief Blythe Masters, public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more complicated cases do tend to take longer to work
out and it is also a fact that most cases do settle," says
former commissioner Marc Spitzer, who is now a partner at the
law firm of Steptoe and Johnson LLP in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RULINGS CLUTTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-March, a federal court ruled that FERC overstepped
its authority when it fined Brian Hunter of Amaranth Advisors
LLC $30 million for the $6 billion in bad bets he booked on
natural gas futures that precipitated the firm's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court found that FERC's punishment was out of bounds
since Hunter made bets on natural gas futures - the domain of
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, a further complication: the CFTC agreed to hand
FERC most of its authority over the power market, but retained
some jurisdiction over power trades on an "as-needed basis".
(Press release: link.reuters.com/zyv38t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I were FERC, I would want to make sure I'd settled this
question of authority before going too far with these cases,"
said Suedeen Kelly, head of the energy regulatory practice at
Akin Gump in Washington, who served more than six years as a
FERC commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ruling may have been particularly vexing for its case
against British bank Barclays Plc, which is based on
trading activity in both physical and derivative markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After issuing a recommendation last October to fine Barclays
$470 million for manipulating the California power market from
late 2006 to 2008, the case has yet to move forward to a formal
vote by commissioners. FERC declined to comment on its status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case against JPMorgan is not as advanced. First, FERC
