&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co said on Monday it will eliminate about 9,200 jobs at the former Washington Mutual Inc, which on September 25 became the largest U.S. bank to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cuts amount to more than 21 percent of the work force at Washington Mutual, which ended June with 43,198 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual had been the largest U.S. savings and loan before JPMorgan bought its banking assets for $1.9 billion in a transaction arranged by U.S. regulators. The holding company for Seattle-based Washington Mutual later filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 4,000 of the jobs will be cut by the end of January, and another 5,200 later, JPMorgan spokesman Christine Holevas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 5,200 workers will receive double their annual salaries retroactive to October 1, payable in a lump sum when their employment ends, Holevas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle will bear the brunt of the cuts, with 3,400 layoffs out of a total of 4,300 Washington Mutual employees in the city, JPMorgan said. Another 1,600 layoffs will be in the San Francisco area, and the remaining 4,200 will be elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most branch workers will keep their jobs. The combined company has about 5,400 branches, and JPMorgan has said it plans to close no more than 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holevas said JPMorgan has not decided the fate of Washington Mutual's headquarters building in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual collapsed under the weight of roughly $176 billion of home equity, adjustable-rate and subprime home loans on its books. It is one of 22 U.S. lenders to fail this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp, which is set to acquire Merrill Lynch  Co Inc before the end of the year, is also expected to cut about 10,000 investment banking jobs at the combined banks, CNBC reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri said in an e-mailed statement, "We are following the same review process to evaluate staffing levels used in every merger transition and we have nothing to announce."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America and Merrill shareholders are scheduled to vote on the merger on December 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan closed on Monday down $5.54, or 17.5 percent, at $26.12 on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Bank of America closed down $3.40, or 20.9 percent, at $12.85. Shares in Merrill closed down $3.09, more than 23 percent, at $10.19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank shares were among the biggest decliners on Monday on expectations the deepening global economic slump will cause credit losses and write-downs to soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Carol Bishopric, Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Monday cleared Chevron Corp (CVX.N) of liability charges arising from a violent clash on one of its oil platforms off the coast of Nigeria a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges stemmed from May 1998 when about 100 local villagers, protesting environmental damage and demanding compensation and jobs, staged a three-day occupation of Chevron's Parabe platform, nine miles off the coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, watched closely by multinational companies facing similar challenges in resource-rich countries, was brought by Larry Bowoto, a protester who was injured when Nigerian forces landed on Parabe to retake the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the month-long trial in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, the jury rejected claims that Chevron was liable for torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, assault, battery and negligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking outside the courtroom, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers said they would look at the possibility of appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was brought against San Ramon, California-based Chevron under the Alien Tort Claims Act, a law that dates back to 1789 and allows foreigners to sue over human rights abuses committed by or on behalf of U.S. organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark decision a decade ago found another California oil company, Unocal Corp, could be sued in a U.S. court for its alleged role in human rights abuses in Myanmar. Unocal settled in 2005, just weeks before agreeing to be bought by Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that Bowoto v. Chevron made it this far in the process is a victory in and of itself, because it means that we have demonstrated that there is a clear pathway in the U.S. court system for holding corporations accountable to the rule of law," Laura Livoti, founder of Justice in Nigeria Now, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) faces a similar trial in New York early next year on charges of human rights violations and racketeering in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hostage-taking is a regular hazard for oil companies working in the Niger Delta, where impoverished villagers complain they see no benefit from the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyer for the plaintiffs had argued that the forces who landed on Parabe were paid by Chevron. But the company countered that Nigerian forces were the only security option there, and giving them extra money and food and shelter in return was normal in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we sympathize with the challenges the people of the Niger Delta face every day, those challenges do not merit violence and hostage taking for ransom," Chevron spokesman Don Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Christie; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
While it had been reported that J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) was planning to
lay off as much as 10% of its workforce, very little in the way of official data
has hit the Street until this afternoon. Unfortunately for recently acquired
Washington Mutual, the job cuts will begin with 3,400 jobs at WaMu banking
operations in Seattle, according to The Seattle Post-Intelligencer. About 1,500
jobs will be cut by the end of January, with another 1,900 employees staying on
in transition jobs that will be cut over 2009, the newspaper said.

addition, 32,000 warrants (no 1) issued by ILOG in 2003, 16,000 warrants
(no 2) issued by ILOG in 2003, 46,000 warrants issued by ILOG in 2004,
48,000 warrants issued by ILOG in 2005, 64,000 warrants issued by ILOG in
2006, and 48,000 warrants issued by ILOG in 2007 were tendered in the
tender offers.

    These results indicate that 19,664,945 ordinary shares representing 95.37
percent of the voting rights and the share capital of ILOG, on an issued
and outstanding basis as of November 24, 2008, have been tendered into the
tender offers. On a fully-diluted basis, securities representing 87.26
percent of the voting rights and the share capital of ILOG have been
tendered. Therefore, the minimum tender condition has been satisfied and
IBM's tender offers were successful.

    Accordingly, IBM will accept all the ordinary shares and warrants tendered
into the tender offers and expects that the settlement of the tender
offers and the payment of the cash consideration in respect of the
tendered ordinary shares will occur on December 5, 2008.

    Having acquired more than 66.67 percent of ILOG's share capital and voting
rights on a fully diluted basis, IBM today announced that its tender
offers will be reopened for a subsequent offering period of ten French
trading days.

    The terms and consideration offered in the subsequent offering period will
be identical to that during the initial offering period. The payment of
the cash consideration for the ordinary shares and ADSs tendered during
the subsequent offering period will occur following the expiration of such
period. Amounts in respect of ordinary shares tendered during the
subsequent offering period will be payable in euros. Amounts in respect of
ADSs tendered during the subsequent offering period will be payable in
U.S. dollars calculated by using the open market spot exchange rate for
the U.S. dollar against the euro in the North American trading session on
the date on which funds are received by the receiving agent to pay for
the ADSs upon expiration of the subsequent offering period.

    The subsequent offering period for the tender offer in France will
commence on December 2, 2008 and expire on December 15, 2008. The
subsequent offering period for the tender offer in the United States will
commence on December 2, 2008 and expire at 12 noon, EST, on December 15,
2008. IBM currently expects that the AMF will publish the results of the
subsequent offering period on December 18, 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Cancer Deaths Due to Ecological Devastation, According to the
Cabrera Report
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
An increase in Chevron's potential environmental liability in Ecuador's Amazon
to $27 billion is &#8220;reasonable&#8221; given new scientific data about groundwater
contamination and hundreds of additional cancer deaths due to oil contamination,
according to a team of scientists who have reviewed the latest report by the
court-appointed expert. 

"The $27 billion number is reasonable when one considers the extent of the
damage caused by Chevron and the decades that the soil and water relied upon by
tens of thousands of people have been exposed to hydrocarbons," said Douglas
Beltman, a scientist at Stratus Consulting who, along with a team of scientists,
reviewed the expert&#8217;s report on behalf of the plaintiffs. 

Stratus Consulting has prepared damages assessments for several large clean-up
sites in the U.S. under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Justice and
various state agencies. Beltman said the Ecuador damages figure is lower than
estimates for large environmental clean-ups in the U.S., such as the Hanford
nuclear waste site in Washington State. 

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the Hanford site &#8211; which is one
third the size of the affected area in Ecuador -- will cost $53 billion to $63
billion to remediate, or more than twice the amount of the damages figure in the
Ecuador disaster, which is considered by some to be the worst oil-related
contamination in history. 

Beltman and Dr. Ann Maest, also a scientist at Stratus, said any clean-up funds
in Ecuador will have to be used to remediate soils, rivers, streams, and
groundwater over a 1,700 square mile area that contains the survivors of five
indigenous groups and tens of thousands of farmers who live off the natural
ecosystem. 

"If this were the U.S., the area would be considered unfit for human habitation
and would be fenced off until it could be remediated," said Maest. &#8220;Any clean-up
of such a large area with ecosystem damage will be a huge endeavor that will
take years.&#8221; 

The new number, submitted by the expert last week to an Ecuadorian trial court
in the final phase of a class action lawsuit against Chevron, is an increase
from the $16.3 billion damages figure submitted in a 4,000-page report to the
same court last April.&#160;It is based on new information provided by the parties to
remediate what some scientists consider to be one of the worst ecological
disasters on the planet. 

The expert found that the contamination in Ecuador was largely the product of
sub-standard practices used by Texaco from 1964 to 1990, when the company dumped
more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste over an area of rainforest roughly
the size of Rhode Island. Chevron now owns Texaco and will bear any liability in
the case, which is being tried in Ecuador at Chevron's request. 

The independent expert report was prepared by Richard Cabrera, an Ecuadorian
environmental scientist appointed by the court as a Special Master who has
worked mostly for oil companies in preparing environmental damage assessments.
He was assisted by a team of 14 scientific and technical experts who reviewed a
wide body of data submitted over five years of the trial, including more than
54,000 chemical sampling results from 94 of Chevron's former production sites
encompassing each of the six oil fields in the region used by Texaco. 

Cabrera, who was paid by the court for his work, had been paid by Chevron for
his work as an independent expert in an earlier phase of the case. At the time,
the oil giant never objected to his qualifications. 

In reviewing the trial evidence &#8211; the vast majority of it provided by Chevron --
Cabrera found that 100% of Chevron's former sites are extensively contaminated
with cancer-causing toxins and that an earlier clean-up Texaco claimed it had
completed was ineffective. (Two Chevron lawyers and seven former Ecuadorian
government officials were indicted recently in Ecuador on fraud charges relating
to that earlier remediation, which took place in the late 1990s.) 

The additional $11 billion in damages found by Cabrera includes:

* Compensation for excess cancer deaths from exposure to oil contamination is
now $9.527 billion due to updated demographic and health data that takes into
account population increases. Cabrera estimated 1,401 excess cancer deaths due
to the contamination caused by Texaco. The monetary estimate is based a value of
$6.8 million for each lost life, which tracks the method used by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.

* Roughly $3.2 billion to clean groundwater. In his first report, Cabrera had
excluded this category despite evidence that the groundwater is contaminated.
Groundwater is a source of drinking water and is considered a primary source of
exposure to toxins.

* Roughly $1 billion for clean-up of contaminated soils in and around the 916
waste pits abandoned by Texaco. In his previous report, Cabrera had used a soil
clean-up standard far more lax than is typically used in the U.S. The additional
funds are to remediate the soils to the stricter standard.

A final decision on Chevron's liability and damages will be made by the trial
judge, who is expected to rule sometime in 2009. However, courts in Ecuador
generally give wide deference to reports prepared by independent experts. 

A lawyer for the plaintiffs blasted Chevron for putting out false information
about the latest findings, and rejected allegations the plaintiffs improperly
influenced the report. 

&#8220;Not accustomed to being held accountable for its flagrant disregard for the
environment, Chevron is now attacking the very court that it once praised as
fair to avoid trial in the United States,&#8221; said Julio Prieto, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs. 

&#8220;Chevron&#8217;s attacks on the Cabrera report have no basis in science and show a
profound disrespect for the rule of law,&#8221; added Prieto. "There is no joy in
having the extent of this terrible human tragedy confirmed yet again by outside
experts."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 1 (Reuters) - An accelerated downturn in
commercial real estate next year may spark a wave of borrowers
pushing for easier terms on loans that are otherwise heading
into default, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Commercial property loans originated in 2005 to 2007 that
increasingly carried risky terms are likely to see a
significant increase in defaults in 2009 due to lack of credit,
falling property values and reduced cash flow, said Alan Todd,
head of commercial mortgage bond research at JPMorgan, in
published research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the slowing economy that is wreaking havoc on cash
flow expectations may also present mortgage companies with a
dilemma as borrowers confront them with the choice of either
easing loan terms to preserve value, or default. The number of
loans transferred to companies that specialize in troubled
mortgages has already risen significantly and will climb into
2010, Todd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Moral hazard may become an issue as borrowers begin to
claim 'dire straits' with the hope of having their loan terms
modified by the special servicer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), the No. 2 U.S.
shopping mall owner, said on Sunday it received a two-week
extension on the maturity of $900 million in Las Vegas loans as
it tries to negotiate a longer-term plan. Results of the
negotiations are closely watched in the $750 billion commercial
mortgage-backed securities market, which has been battered on
expectations a recession could boost bondholder losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The imminent default of two of the largest loans in CMBS
less than a year old, including one for the Promenade Shops at
Dos Lagos in a foreclosure-ridden area of California, this
month helped propel bond risk premiums to record levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Todd said he was most concerned about retail properties
since a recession and a "severely weakened consumer" with
limited access to credit will continue to curb retail sales.
Investors sold shares of retailers on Monday on expectations an
initial holiday-season spending surge would not last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Delinquencies on loans in CMBS remain low relative to
residential mortgage debt, but are rising at fast rates. In
retail, delinquencies increased to 0.4 percent in October from
a low of 0.08 percent in July 2007, more than twice the rise in
the multifamily sector and 151 percent of the jump for office
properties, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most important factor for CMBS value in 2009 will be
the availability of credit, which will prevent many loans with
aggressive terms such as high loan-to-value ratios from being
refinanced, Todd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Many of these loans will become a nightmare as a severely
slowing economy, significantly tighter credit requirements and
falling commercial real estate property prices force many
borrowers to default over the coming years, or to infuse equity
at the refinance date," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commercial property prices may fall as much as 40 percent
from peak-to-trough, Todd said. Prices are down 11.5 percent
from October 2007, he said, citing Moody's Investors Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the outlook, special servicers may adopt an "extend
everything" policy since liquidating assets in a distressed and
illiquid market may cause deeper losses, Todd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It has become increasingly obvious that commercial real
estate credit problems will finally materialize and intensify
in 2009," he said.

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO--(Business Wire)--
IQPC and Finance IQ announced the IFRS Summit Canada, taking place January
26-28, 2009 in Toronto, CA. 

IFRS Summit Canada provides the latest information needed for the transition of
all Canadian publicly accountable enterprises to file their financial statements
using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including all
necessary requirements, procedures and the roadmap to efficiently meet the 2011
implementation date. 

With participating organizations including AcSB, IFRIC, Microsoft, Agrium, TD
Bank Financial Group and Royal Bank of Canada, the event provides practical
advice, benchmarking opportunities and discussions about strategies for
implementing a detail-oriented, timely and efficient transition plan. 

The transition from GAAP to IFRS requires early and meticulous planning due to
the complexities involved and potential for impacts throughout the business. For
these reasons, some IFRS experts advise against delays. 

&#8220;You must start early so you can identify key issues and who should be
involved," writes Darla Sycamore on ifrscanadadevilisinthedetails.blogspot.com,
which is dedicated to exploring issues and problems with the implementation of
IFRS in Canada and the U.S. 

Sycamore continues: "There are many issues to be resolved prior to 2010.
Although the conversion date is January 1, 2011 for calendar year companies, it
will be necessary to run in parallel during 2010 to provide for a smooth
collection of the information for IFRS 1." 

&#8220;Companies are starting to move beyond the high-level discussions, and looking
for specific and practical advice," says Gordon Heard, Principal Advisor of The
Finance Group (www.ifrsincanada.com). &#8220;While the transition will be challenging,
those with a practical planning process are realizing the conversion will be
manageable.&#8221; 

Sycamore and Heard are pre-conference workshop leaders for the summit, and join
the expert speaking faculty in addressing operational challenges, providing
implementation tips with how-to sessions for practical procedures and offering
discussion opportunities with leading companies already using IFRS.

&lt;p&gt;  MARTINSRIED/MUNICH, GERMANY, Dec 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 

New protocol for lowest latency enhances enterprise disaster 
recovery/business continuity solutions


 Norcross, Georgia, USA, and
Martinsried/Munich, Germany. December  1, 2008. ADVA Optical Networking
successfully completed interoperability testing and qualification of its
FSP 3000 platform for a new version of IBM's mainframe clustering
protocol based on InfiniBand for the IBM System z(TM) Geographically
Dispersed Parallel Sysplex (GDPS(R)) environments. Parallel Sysplex
InfiniBand (PSIFB) has been introduced as the next-generation
high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect to further enhance
synchronization of System z servers and follow-ons. These links can be
extended over the ADVA FSP 3000 platform up to 100km and will be
transparent and support auto negotiation between hosts running single
data rate (SDR, 2.5Gbit/s) and double data rate (DDR, 5.0Gbit/s) link
speeds.

    "This qualification is the result of close cooperation with IBM,"
explained Christian Illmer, senior director of enterprise application
solution management at ADVA Optical Networking. "ADVA Optical Networking
has always focused on introducing technologies that support
high-bandwidth applications with the lowest latency for areas like
real-time stock trading, medical image analysis, server clustering and
more. For these areas, InfiniBand is a cost-effective solution, available
today, with proven technology. This work represents investment protection
for customers who already have ADVA Optical Networking solutions in IBM
mainframe environments."

    Today's announcement comes at a pivotal time when worldwide customers
continue to invest in the IBM System z mainframe, which powers the top 50
banks worldwide. Customer demand for the mainframe has enabled IBM's
System z to nearly double its share this decade, according to IDC's
high-end server quarterly tracker.

    ADVA Optical Networking has been qualified to use PSIFB to connect two
mainframes across distances of up to 100km, an advancement in throughput
from the 2Gbit/s data rate used in prior generations. Previously, IBM
used PSIFB solely inside the mainframe. To connect multiple mainframes,
conversion to another protocol like Inter System Channel Links (ISC) was
required. The use of PSIFB now eliminates latency caused by protocol
conversion. It also enables a more efficient transfer of data, more
timely delivery and more accurate synchronization of information between
mainframes.

    A GDPS-based installation is designed to be a comprehensive disaster
recovery and business continuity solution for large multi-site
enterprises. It combines the characteristics of high availability and
near-continuous operations to deliver high levels of service. It is based
on geographical clusters and data mirroring (point-to-point remote copy,
PPRC or Metro Mirror), including the latest 4Gbit/s Fibre Channel (FC)
and 10Gbit/s FC Inter Switch Link (ISL) technology. These technologies
form the backbone of a GDPS/PPRC solution, which is designed to manage
and protect IT services by handling planned and unplanned exception
conditions. GDPS/PPRC can also help maintain data integrity across
multiple volumes and storage subsystems.

    "InfiniBand-based links provide the ideal combination of high performance
and low latency for our GDPS/PPRC environment," explained Dr. Casimer
DeCusatis, distinguished engineer of the IBM System and Technology Group.
"These are must-have benefits when it comes to synchronous applications
for high-end clustering, business continuity, disaster recovery and grid
computing -- all of which are increasingly important services for the New
Enterprise Data Center."

    InfiniBand was introduced into the data center in the early 2000s and has
been used mainly in high-performance computing environments. Yet with the
steady adoption of more powerful business continuity, disaster recovery
and grid computing applications, many enterprises have turned to
InfiniBand as an enabler of latency-intolerant, bandwidth-intensive
applications across Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical
networks. Today, within the server, InfiniBand enables transport speeds
of up to 40Gbit/s; it is anticipated that in two years time, the speed
will increase to 120Gbit/s.

Here are highlights from Friday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:

Economic Data Mostly Turkeys

It is clear that we are in a very deep recession, and things are continuing to
deteriorate. At this time, investors need to focus on the least economically
sensitive equities with the strongest balance sheets. A high, well covered
dividend yield is a plus. 

Major drug companies like Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
(NYSE: BMY) fit that description. Consumer Staples firms like The Hershey
Company (NYSE: HSY) and Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE: KMB) also fit the
bill. 

SABESP Priced Absurdly Cheap

We are keeping our Buy recommendation on Companhia de Saneamento Basico do
Estadode S&#227;o Paulo, or SABESP (NYSE: SBS). The company posted reasonably
positive results for the third quarter of 2008, even though its operating
margins decreased. 

The short-term outlook remains positive, due to the September 2008 tariff
adjustment. Despite the recent depreciation in Brazilian real due to the global
financial crisis, we believe that soon the Brazilian real will strengthen and
that the company will benefit in the short term. Moreover, the regulatory
framework for water and sewage in Brazil in 2006 helped the company in making
all possible investments.

"There are some possibilities but I'm not going to speculate what they might be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his presentation at the Merrill Lynch Global Energy Large Cap Conference, Watson said Chevron has successfully rationalized other parts of its downstream business by selling marketing and lubricant production assets in South America, Africa and Europe that didn't fit the San Ramon, California,-based company's focus on the Pacific Rim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns or has ownership interests in 13 major refineries worldwide, 11 of which, including six U.S. refineries, supply the Asia-Pacific markets, Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two not included as serving the Asia-Pacific markets are refineries in Britain and South Africa, according to slides accompanying the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said on Tuesday
it had filed an application for anti-trust approval in China
for the company's $2.5 billion bid for top domestic juice maker
China Huiyuan Juice Group (1886.HK).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola said in a joint statement the review process with
the Ministry of Commerce was progressing and the company would
make a further statement if approval was obtained before March
23, 2009. It gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September, China Huiyuan said Coca-Cola would apply for
clearance from China's regulatory authorities for its takeover
of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola plans to seek approval for what would be the
largest foreign takeover of a local firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts and lawyers said the application would be closely
watched as it was the first case to test the nascent law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fears that the deal -- which critics warned would mark the
loss of a local champion to foreign control -- could be
derailed under the anti-monopoly regulations, have put pressure
on China Huiyuan. The stock has fallen more than 17 percent
from its peak on Sept. 3 after the deal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shares ended at HK$9.33 on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is likely to
post a huge fourth-quarter loss of $5.50 a share, while rival
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) could post a loss of $1.10 a share, an
analyst at UBS said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; UBS expects $4.0 billion in mark to market losses at
Goldman, and writedowns of about $800 million from its
investments at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd
(ICBC) (601398.SS) (1398.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although we lowered our estimates just a month ago, we
think capital markets conditions in November have turned out
worse than we anticipated and we expect both Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley to incur meaningful losses for the quarter," UBS
said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's investments in ICBC and private equity exposure
are expected to take a heavy toll on the former investment bank
as the value of those investments deteriorate. The value of the
Chinese bank's equity had declined significantly on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange in the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These mark-to-market hits will coincide with soft equity
trading, very light investment banking activity, and declines
in asset management and prime brokerage revenues," the
brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Morgan Stanley, the brokerage now expects a
fourth-quarter loss of $1.10 a share, compared with a profit
estimate of 20 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, SP Equity Research also forecast a loss of
$3.25 a share for Goldman Sachs, saying it expected writedowns
to mortgage, leveraged loan, and principal investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a research note dated Dec. 1, Credit Suisse forecast a
quarterly loss of $4 a share for Goldman Sachs, reflecting cost
of asset-price declines, less investment banking and lower
asset levels in prime brokerage and asset management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past few weeks, several analysts at brokerages,
including Fox-Pitt Kelton and Citigroup, have forecast that
Goldman will post a fourth-quarter loss, the first ever since
going public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke, who rates Goldman
"outperform" slashed her price target on the stock to $140 from
an earlier range of $175 to $200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANK HOLDING CO STATUS TO HURT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change to a bank holding company model will prove
costly for former investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, an analyst at Bernstein Research said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The regulators will force the two companies to employ less
leverage, maintain more liquidity, limit illiquid business
commitments and tightly control counterparty risk, analyst Brad
Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Federal Reserve is a more intrusive regulator than the
Securities and Exchange Commission and establishing the
commercial bank infrastructure to report to the Federal
Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the
New York State Bank authorities will be costly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the summer of 2007, Wall Street has been hammered by
a sharp pullback in debt markets, which began with mortgage
woes and escalated into a credit crisis slowing economic
activity around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding
companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve in September,
after Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK failed, Merrill Lynch MER.N
agreed to be bought and the financial markets spun out of
control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The conversion to bank holding companies, designed to
reassure investors, gives Morgan and Goldman full access to
Federal Reserve support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change, effectively killing off the investment banking
model that had dominated Wall Street for more than 20 years,
enabled Goldman and Morgan Stanley to take deposits, gain
easier access to financing and gave them more flexibility to
buy retail banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hintz rates Goldman Sachs "market-perform" and Morgan
Stanley "outperform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman Sachs were down 2 percent at $64.72 in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of
Morgan Stanley were up about 3 percent at $11.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Vinu Pilakkott, Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings places the following classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corp, pass-through certificates, series 2006-CIBC15 on
Rating Watch Negative: 

--$29.1 million class F at 'BBB+'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$26.5 million class G at 'BBB'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$21.2 million class H at 'BBB-'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$7.9 million class J at 'BB+'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$10.6 million class K at 'BB'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$7.9 million class L at 'BB-'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$2.6 million class M at 'B+'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$5.3 million class N at 'B'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$5.3 million class O at 'B-'; Rating Watch Negative. 

Fitch also revises the Rating Outlook on one class as follows: 

--$26.5 million class E at 'A-'; Outlook Negative. 

The classes have been placed on Rating Watch Negative due to the default and
subsequent transfer to special servicing of four loans (5.7%). Three of the
loans (2.2%) were considered Fitch Loans of Concern at the last review. The
Negative Rating Outlook of the E class reflects a potential decrease in credit
enhancement which may not support a 'A-' rating. 

The largest specially serviced loan, the Lightstone Portfolio (3.5%), is 60 days
delinquent and was transferred to special servicing in October 2008 due to
imminent default. The Lightstone Portfolio is secured by four anchored retail
properties located in Martinsburg, WV; Rome, GA; Hermitage, PA; and Cleveland,
TN. As of Year End 2007, the property had a cumulative servicer reported DSCR of
1.08x and an occupancy of 95%. The properties then declined as of March 31, 2008
to a DSCR and occupancy of 0.95x and 93.7%, respectively. The borrower has
approached the lender indicating that they would like to surrender the
properties and is cooperating in the appointment of a receiver. 

The second largest loan (1.1%) is secured by five multifamily properties located
in Indiana and Ohio. The loan is 90 days delinquent and was transferred in June
2008 due to payment default. Receivers have been appointed for all properties
and have taken over management. 

The third largest loan (0.7%) is a 410,307 sf distribution center located in
Columbus, OH. The loan is current; however, the borrower has become worried
about meeting his debt obligations. The loan was transferred to special
servicing in November 2008 due to the parent company's bankruptcy filing. 

The smallest loan (0.4%) is secured by an office building located in Reno, NV.
The loan is 90 days delinquent and was transferred in September 2008 due to
imminent default. 

The sponsor is in the process of selling the asset and the special servicer is
awaiting a written proposal. 

Fitch will resolve the rating watch status and revisit the outlooks of the
classes as more information on potential workout strategies and updated property
valuations are available. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the first holistic offering in the talent
management marketplace, combining world-class human capital software,
consulting services and information technology integration to enable
enterprises to implement globally integrated workforce and talent
management.

    The new offering, IBM Workforce and Talent Solutions, will help companies
become smarter and more integrated in all aspects of managing the human
capital lifecycle to create measurable improvements in people and business
productivity. Driving efficiency and effectiveness in people -- one of the
largest assets and costs in a business -- is increasingly important to
achieving competitive advantage and to manage the effects of the downturn
in the global economy. It is a combination of world-class human capital
consulting services, IBM software assets: Cognos, Lotus, IBM Research and
market leading human capital software: Saba and SuccessFactors.

    According to a recent study by IBM and the Human Capital Management
Institute, companies that apply effective and integrated workforce and
talent management strategy and practices demonstrate significantly better
financial performance compared to their industry peers.

    "IBM Global Business Services is taking what have long been disparate
parts of the human capital lifecycle, and we are pulling the pieces
together to give our clients an end-to-end capability to access key
employee data and manage workforces as a globally integrated talent
pool," said Tim Ringo, vice president and global leader, Human Capital
Management, IBM. "We add to this solution IBM's award-winning
collaboration and social networking software to create the next
generation of workforce and talent management, which is truly unique in
the marketplace."

    IBM's unique approach combines decades of experience from IBM's own HR
transformation with its proven client human capital consulting engagements
that helped produce measurable improvements in clients' business
performance.

    IBM Workforce and Talent Solutions offering takes a strategic view of an
enterprises' human capital technology and processes. Through our Human
Capital Healthcheck tool, IBM human capital experts assess where an
organization is on its journey to globally integrated workforce and talent
management and defines a strategy, technology and process roadmap for the
future. The solution builds on what is already in place in the enterprise
and implements the integrated solutions required to create an end-to-end
capability to access key employee data and manage workforces as a globally
integrated talent pool.

    Key components of IBM Workforce and Talent Solutions includes, workforce
analytics, e-recruitment, performance management, learning, succession
planning, compensation and rewards, workforce deployment and scheduling,
employee portal, collaboration and social networking, together with
targeted consulting services, such as change management, process
re-design, technology integration, program management and business
performance measurement.

    IBM Cognos 8 Workforce Performance underpins the overall solution giving
interactive insight into workforce data through dashboard analytic
reporting from multiple systems. IBM Lotus Connections' five components --
profiles, communities, blogs, dogear and activities -- provides a personal
profile/role based approach to managing talent as well the social network
necessary for collaboration and connections between individuals and the
knowledge employees need to be more productive.

    At the heart of the solution is IBM's partnership with two leading talent
management software partners: Saba and SuccessFactors, who provide the
applications that enable many of the core talent management processes. Key
to IBM Workforce and Talent Solutions, these applications will integrate
with IBM's social networking, portal, and business intelligence
capabilities.

    "The latest advances in collaborative human capital software such as Lotus
Connections, WebSphere Portal, and Cognos 8 Workforce Performance can help
deliver a talent management system that companies could only imagine a few
short years ago," said Larry Bowden, vice president, portals and mashups,
IBM Software Group. "The exciting part for our customers is the deep
partnership with IBM Global Business Services human capital team and the
experience they bring to transforming our clients business performance."

    Companies increasingly realize that an integrated approach to workforce
and talent management has a tangible business return on their investment.
However, many of today's companies lack the basic ability to get the right
people with the right skills in the right place at the right time.
Additionally, one of the largest problems that companies face is the need
to retain top talent and maximize the performance of increasingly diverse
global workforces. IBM Workforce and Talent Solutions focuses on the
expected business outcomes and ensures a clear linkage between investment
and expected returns. Revenue, profitability, efficiency, cost savings and
customer satisfaction are the most important outcomes that should be
produced by an integrated approach to workforce and talent management.

    With this offering the credo that "people are a company's greatest asset"
is being backed up by increasing focus and investment and consequently,
business performance. The ability to manage costs, drive productivity and
gain a competitive advantage through an adaptable and high-performance
workforce is a now a strategic imperative. Ultimately, IBM's focus is to
make the clear linkage between effective workforce and talent management
and business performance, and help companies capitalize on their
investment in people.

&lt;p&gt;Novell customers who plan to deploy Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server or
Microsoft Office SharePoint 2007 can now take advantage of tight integration and
interoperability with their existing Novell GroupWise investment.
EDMONTON &amp; COPENHAGEN, Denmark--(Business Wire)--
Omni, in association with its Scandinavian Distributor, Liga ApS, today
announced two Microsoft&#174; SharePoint&#174; integration options for Novell&#174; GroupWise&#174;
customers who want to leverage their existing Novell GroupWise technology
investments. Omni's Riva Integration Server provides transparent, server-side
synchronization of GroupWise and SharePoint appointments, tasks, address books
and issues -- without any modifications required to SharePoint or the GroupWise
clients. Option two is to use Riva to quickly and easily add GroupWise
WebAccess&#8482; Web Parts directly to the SharePoint Portal user interface. 

"SharePoint is the fastest-growing product in Microsoft's history," said Trevor
Poapst, Director of Global Marketing for Omni. "While other enterprise
information portals exist, Novell customers were telling us that they wanted
SharePoint integration for their existing Novell GroupWise investment rather
than having to incur the massive, and unnecessary, expense of a
"rip-and-replace" Microsoft Active Directory and Exchange migration. Omni's
integrations for GroupWise and SharePoint provide the same functionality as is
available for Outlook/Exchange -- without having to deploy Microsoft Active
Directory or Exchange." 

"Leading industry analysts such as Gartner Group, Forrester, Burton Group and
others have positioned SharePoint as the leading portal product," continued
Poapst. "The key business drivers behind the deployment of SharePoint and other
enterprise information portals, such as Novell's Teaming and Conferencing, work
to satisfy the need to centralize and secure business-critical information and
create a comprehensive framework for team collaboration, communication and
information-sharing. Omni has developed the critical bridge and interoperability
between Microsoft SharePoint and Novell GroupWise and opened up unprecedented
integration and collaboration possibilities for Novell customers. Our customers
appreciate the fact that they can use Novell eDirectory, Active Directory or
SharePoint Services authentication to provide transparent, single sign-on and

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
expected operations at its 150,000 barrel per day Los
Angeles-area refinery to return to normal later on Tuesday
after units were shut Monday morning due to a malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the units shut at the refinery in Torrance,

&lt;p&gt;Beverage Veteran Ronald D. Wilson to Lead Skinny Nutritional Corporation as
President and CEO
BALA CYNWYD, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Skinny Nutritional Corp. (OTC BB: SKNY.OB), the exclusive worldwide marketer and
distributor of Skinny Water&#174;, today announced that Ronald D. Wilson, former
Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company President and Chief Operating Officer,
has been named President and Chief Executive Officer of Skinny Nutritional Corp.
Wilson brings with him over 38 years in the beverage industry. 

&#8220;I&#8217;m excited about this opportunity to take Skinny Water to the next level,&#8221;
says Wilson. &#8220;In less than six months Skinny Water has been embraced by millions
of customers who are searching for great tasting flavored water that provides
functional benefits, and most importantly zero calories and zero sugar. As we go
forward, we&#8217;ll expand our flavor offerings, and look to use the Skinny trademark
in other beverage categories, such as ready-to-drink teas and coffees.&#8221; 

Wilson entered the soft drink industry in 1969 as route salesman for Pepsi-Cola,
and worked his way up to branch manager. He joined the Coca-Cola family in 1977
as a financial analyst with Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York. Over the
years, Mr. Wilson held various positions within Coca-Cola Bottling Company,
rising from division manager to Vice President/General Manager of the New Jersey
division. 

In 1985, he became the President and Chief Operating Officer of The Philadelphia
Coca-Cola Bottling Company. Mr. Wilson led the company to become the fourth
largest Coca-Cola bottler in the country. While at the helm, Mr. Wilson was also
President of The Coca-Cola Bottlers&#8217; Association and a Vice President of The Dr.
Pepper Bottlers&#8217; Association. 

He is currently the Vice Chair for the Board of Overseers at his alma mater,
Rutgers University, and is an advisor to Rutgers School of Business in Camden,
N.J. In October 2008, Mr. Wilson was inducted into the Beverage World Soft Drink
Hall of Fame. 

&#8220;The appointment of Ron Wilson as the President and CEO represents the
transition of the company from the start-up phase to a growth and operational
phase,&#8221; says Don McDonald, former President and CEO of Skinny Nutritional Corp.
&#8220;Ron&#8217;s experience and leadership will be invaluable, and we know he&#8217;ll take the
company to new levels of profitability.&#8221; 

McDonald will now serve as Chief Financial Officer of Skinny Nutritional Corp.,
and will focus on investor relations to introduce the company to a variety of
institutional bankers. 

&#8220;Ron Wilson&#8217;s tenacity for detail and years of beverage experience brings the
financial disciplines and leadership to build the Skinny brand into a beverage
powerhouse,&#8221; says Pat Croce, member of the Board of Advisors. &#8220;As an emerging
company, it&#8217;s a real triumph to get a veteran executive of this magnitude to
join our company.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds forecast cuts by UBS, others)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
shares fell Tuesday on speculation the bank's fourth-quarter
loss could be much larger than expected -- more than $2.5
billion -- fueled by the plunging value of many Goldman
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shares fell as much as 6 percent, rose briefly in
volatile trading, then settled at $64.78, off 1.5 percent. They
are down 70 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the past month, Goldman has been widely expected to
post its first quarterly loss since going public in 1999. But
poor market conditions got even worse last month as the U.S.
Treasury abandoned its proposal to buy hard-to-trade mortgage
securities and other debt from hard-hit banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Staite on Tuesday widened
his loss forecast for Goldman to $4.65 a share, or $2.3
billion, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Nov. 28. Staite
forecast that falling equity and debt values will trigger more
than $9 billion of writedowns. ((To see related story, click on
[ID:nN02151728]))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Within hours, veteran UBS brokerage analyst Glenn Schorr
forecast an even bigger loss -- $5.50 a share, or $2.7 billion
-- driven by writedowns approaching $5 billion. SP Equity
Research cut its forecast to a loss of $3.25 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a big change from a month ago, when the average Wall
Street forecast was a profit of $2.34 a share; six months ago,
the average estimate was a profit of more than $5.40 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, analysts' average forecast is a loss of $1.46 a
share excluding one-time items, according to Reuters Estimates.
Individual forecasts range from a profit of 23 cents at
Wachovia Securities to a loss of $5.50 at UBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The average loss forecast will only deepen as Wall Street
analysts try to estimate the impact of market weakness on a
range of assets held in Goldman's investment portfolio and by
its traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has long been the industry's most aggressive player
in deploying its capital into everything from power plants and
Japanese golf courses to ethanol makers and distressed debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a group, analysts turned bearish on Goldman at the end
of October, with industry watchers like UBS' Schorr and Merrill
Lynch's Guy Moszkowski predicting small losses.

&lt;p&gt;  CHICAGO, IL, Dec 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
RSNA -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) unveiled a powerful new combination of advanced
imaging and information archiving technologies that provides healthcare
and research organizations with complete and timely access to critical
imaging and diagnostic information at the point of care -- regardless of
the source, age or location of the information. IBM's new Healthcare
Image and Information Grid (HIIG) framework is built on open standards
and enables physicians to make better decisions based on more complete
information at the precise moment it is needed for a patient's care.

    The current enterprise imaging environment has escalated demand for a
scalable archive environment, robust imaging application architecture, and
the ability to access image studies base on a patient-centered view of
data. Further, imaging itself has moved far beyond the domain of
radiology, becoming pervasive across the entire healthcare industry. Up
until now, however, healthcare-delivery organizations have been challenged
to fully integrate emerging technologies with their diverse, existing
systems to improve patient care. IBM's HIIG framework answers that
challenge.

    HIIG is a services-oriented solution built on open standards and
interoperable services that provide healthcare organizations with
integrated tools as well as a roadmap for the development of
enterprise-wide image enabled medical archives. HIIG provides clients with
the ability to achieve this goal in today's heterogeneous healthcare
environment. HIIG is built on IBM's unique, award-winning, virtualized and
automated Grid Medical Archive Solution (GMAS) used to protect and share
critical medical and research data.

    "IBM is accomplishing an industry first by offering the most advanced
interoperable framework for healthcare systems with the IBM Healthcare
Information and Image Grid. This award winning solution will enable an
integrated view of patient documents and images across the enterprise to
be accessed in real time at the point of care," said Dan Pelino, General
Manager for IBM Healthcare and Life Sciences. "Through the HIIG, IBM is
committed to offering the right tools, solutions and services to transform
healthcare systems and create more value-focused healthcare."

    IBM GMAS SOFTWARE OFFERS INDUSTRY FIRST INNOVATION

    IBM also announced today new software features for the IBM Grid Medical
Archive Solution (GMAS), a high performance, grid-based storage solution.
Its new software component, GAM 2.1 will now support applications in
digital pathology, mass spectrometry and high throughput screening that
require ultimate performance and very reliable NAS storage.

    GAM was invented to manage and store huge amounts of archive data, such as
CT scans and mammograms, which are generally written only once and rarely
updated but must be frequently accessed. However, many healthcare and
research applications also produce vast amounts of transactional data
which needs to be captured, analyzed, shared, be actively written,
re-written and modified before it is archived or deleted. The new GAM 2.1
Distributed Gateway feature adds scalable NAS capability to GMAS for
transactional and research data, enabling exceptional performance and
support for up to 1 billion objects. This Distributed Gateway also acts
as a traditional GMAS gateway that can be used to archive and protect
data for life across any storage tier and location. As a result, medical
and research facilities can leverage GMAS for both research and
transactional as well as reference data while eliminating the complexity,
hassle and cost of managing multiple solutions. The GAM v2.1 Distributed
Control Node also adds more advanced control node software replication
features to improve image access and network performance while still
enabling universal data access from any location.

    New GAM 2.1 now supports IBM Blade Center and IBM System Storage N series,
continuing the GMAS track record of lowering long term total cost of
ownership. Clients can see a 100% increase in storage density, a reduction
of up to 30% in hardware costs and 35% savings in power and cooling. New
VMWARE ESX support also allows clients to see up to a 6 to 1 compression
of Gateways at the data center. IBM GMAS adds iSCSI support with IBM N
series storage.

    "IBM GMAS with GAM v.2.1 directly addresses our healthcare, life sciences
and research client's requirements for a single solution that can handle
both scalable NAS and long term reference data archive requirements across
the enterprise, all while lowering IT costs. This combination of unique
benefits we believe is unmatched in the industry today," said Hugh Rivers,
Business Line Executive, Healthcare and Life Sciences Solutions, IBM
Systems and Technology Group.

    Among the clinical and IT benefits offered by IBM GMAS are:

    Support for both transactional and reference data Improved application
uptime and reliability Proactive data protection for life with real time
failover and synchronization Petabyte scalability and improved enterprise
storage utilization Multi-site, multi-application and multi-tier operation
Decreased Total Cost of Ownership through automation and virtualization

    IBM GMAS is an integrated solution based on System Storage Grid Access
Manager, IBM Modular Servers, IBM System Storage and IBM GTS and Business
Partner Services.

    IBM GMAS provides flexibility for New York University Medical Center

    NYU Langone Medical Center, one of the world's premier academic medical
institutions for more than 167 years, needed to address the exponential
growth of its fixed content data. The Center implemented GMAS for its data
protection features and continuous operation, virtualization and automated
administration capabilities.

    "GMAS provides a more sophisticated and flexible solution for our growing
needs which has reduced our administrative and operational costs
significantly," said Chris Petillo, Senior Director Ancillary Systems at
NYU's Langone Medical Center. "IBM GMAS is an enterprise wide
'virtualized' storage platform that optimizes storage usage across all
applications, sites and storage tiers. We are very pleased with IBM's
implementation of this solution and with their continued commitment to
provide us with the newest technologies available."

    NYU's GMAS solution, which has an initial capacity of 120 Terabytes, was
installed in fewer than 6 weeks and currently stores images from Siemens
Medical Radiology Applications and is expected to expand to other medical
disciplines in the future.

    Pricing and Availability

    New features will be generally available on December 12, 2008.

    The Distributed Gateway will be available 2Q09.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A veteran banking analyst predicted on Tuesday a steeper-than-expected quarterly loss by Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), as a bad environment grew even worse last month and contributed to more than $9 billion of expected writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Staite of London-based Atlantic Equities forecast on Tuesday that Goldman will post a fourth-quarter loss of $4.65 per share, or $2.3 billion. That was the biggest loss predicted among analysts and more than three times as bearish as the current average forecast of $1.46 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffeted by plunging stocks and debt prices, Goldman could realize more than $9 billion in writedowns in the quarter, Staite estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Falling equity markets and extreme weakness in parts of fixed income is a really bad combination for Goldman," Staite told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman declined comment as Staite and other analysts reduced their estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's stock fell as much as 5.7 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday morning, and later pared losses to trade down 97 cents at $64.79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the weeks before Goldman releases fiscal fourth-quarter results, the consensus view is expected to fall as analysts reflect on the dramatic decline in stock and fixed income markets. Goldman is due to report earnings later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS AG's Glenn Schorr, who on October 31 was the first sell-side analyst to predict a loss, increased his loss forecast on Tuesday to $5.50 per share -- the new low among brokerage analysts -- from a loss of 40 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Markets turned considerably worse around mid-November," Staite said. "I would expect to see a lot more analysts cutting their numbers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was a bad year for Wall Street grew even worse last month, as stocks resumed falling and debt spreads widened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury's decision to abandon earlier plans to purchase hard-to-sell mortgage securities from banks pulled the rug out from under commercial and residential markets. Markets have also been hit with a series of very negative economic news, causing debt spreads to widen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, junk bonds, residential and commercial real estate securities prices all have fallen sharply. Staite expects Goldman to record $5.3 billion of mark-downs on these hard-hit assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank reported holding $38 billion of these assets at the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman would also be hurt by the sharp fall in equity markets, he said, generating losses in a $26 billion portfolio of private equity investments. These losses could amount to $3.8 billion, said Staite, a 15-year veteran who began covering of Goldman about a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's $7.1 billion investment in ICBC (601398.SS) suffered as shares in China's largest bank fell 29 percent during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual impact of these losses on Goldman's bottom line could be muted by hedges and by cutting bonuses, so that the net reduction of profit is closer to $4.5 billion, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People will be paid smaller bonuses because of this. They can claw back some of the bonuses accrued in the first three quarters to offset some of the mark downs," Staite said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from its core businesses also will be down sharply, he said, reflecting the absence of underwriting and slowdown of merger activity. Investment banking fees will fall by 25 percent from a weak third quarter, while asset management revenue is seen falling by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is always difficult to predict, but given the deterioration in the markets, it's clear they will make a meaningful loss," Staite said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is likely to post a huge fourth-quarter loss of $5.50 a share, while rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) could post a loss of $1.10 a share, an analyst at UBS said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS expects $4.0 billion in mark to market losses at Goldman, and write-downs of about $800 million from its investments at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC) (601398.SS) (1398.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we lowered our estimates just a month ago, we think capital markets conditions in November have turned out worse than we anticipated and we expect both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to incur meaningful losses for the quarter," UBS said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's investments in ICBC and private equity exposure are expected to take a heavy toll on the former investment bank as the value of those investments deteriorate. The value of the Chinese bank's equity had declined significantly on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These mark-to-market hits will coincide with soft equity trading, very light investment banking activity, and declines in asset management and prime brokerage revenues," the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Morgan Stanley, the brokerage now expects a fourth-quarter loss of $1.10 a share, compared with a profit estimate of 20 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, SP Equity Research also forecast a loss of $3.25 a share for Goldman Sachs, saying it expected write-downs to mortgage, leveraged loan, and principal investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a research note dated December 1, Credit Suisse forecast a quarterly loss of $4 a share for Goldman Sachs, reflecting cost of asset-price declines, less investment banking and lower asset levels in prime brokerage and asset management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, several analysts at brokerages, including Fox-Pitt Kelton and Citigroup, have forecast that Goldman will post a fourth-quarter loss, the first ever since going public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke, who rates Goldman "outperform" slashed her price target on the stock to $140 from an earlier range of $175 to $200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANK HOLDING CO STATUS TO HURT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change to a bank holding company model will prove costly for former investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, an analyst at Bernstein Research said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulators will force the two companies to employ less leverage, maintain more liquidity, limit illiquid business commitments and tightly control counterparty risk, analyst Brad Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Federal Reserve is a more intrusive regulator than the Securities and Exchange Commission and establishing the commercial bank infrastructure to report to the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the New York State Bank authorities will be costly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the summer of 2007, Wall Street has been hammered by a sharp pullback in debt markets, which began with mortgage woes and escalated into a credit crisis slowing economic activity around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve in September, after Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK failed, Merrill Lynch MER.N agreed to be bought and the financial markets spun out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversion to bank holding companies, designed to reassure investors, gives Morgan and Goldman full access to Federal Reserve support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change, effectively killing off the investment banking model that had dominated Wall Street for more than 20 years, enabled Goldman and Morgan Stanley to take deposits, gain easier access to financing and gave them more flexibility to buy retail banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hintz rates Goldman Sachs "market-perform" and Morgan Stanley "outperform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs were down 2 percent at $64.72 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Morgan Stanley were up about 3 percent at $11.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Vinu Pilakkott, Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Dec 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Anthem Worldwide, a Schawk (NYSE: SGK) Strategic Design Company,
announced that Anthem and its client, the Coca-Cola Company, were awarded
SILVER for the Coca-Cola Beijing Olympic Games packaging by Beverage
World's Best In Beverage Packaging, honoring the best in global beverage
package design.

    "We're very proud of our partnership with the Coca-Cola Company," said
Michael Coleman, managing director of the Chicago office of Anthem
Worldwide, "and honored that Anthem was engaged to help Coke create and
develop the package design system and standards for the company's special
packaging that was deployed before, during and after the Beijing Olympic
Games."

    Coca-Cola's road to Beijing began with its first Olympic sponsorship in
1928 and continued 80 years later with a 150-country Olympic marketing
blitz. In their largest effort ever, Coke turned to Anthem's parent
company, Schawk, Inc., and to Anthem to translate its Olympics
communications strategy to packaging. Faced with balancing the company's
visual identity standards with the International Olympic Committee's
standards, the "Coke Side of Life" campaign principles, as well as the
Beijing Olympics identity, Anthem found its own challenges of Olympic
proportions.

    With a team drawn from Anthem Worldwide offices globally, Anthem
collaborated with a consortium of Coke's global design partners to inspire
people to live on the "Coke Side of Life" coupled with the notion of
Olympic possibilities. The package guidelines and standards incorporated
brand elements drawn from East and West to position Coca-Cola as an active
participant in the Beijing games, not a passive sponsor. The guidelines
offered freedom for localization within a framework of global consistency
that was adopted by key regions around the globe.

    "This was a great opportunity to showcase Anthem's creative community from
around the world," said Chris Plewes, global executive creative director
of Anthem Worldwide. "In keeping with the Olympic spirit, our offices from
Asia Pacific, North America and Europe participated to deliver a true
'East meets West' design."

    "A critical element of the program's success was leveraging a wide range
of our Company's talents," said Anne Marie Pagliacci, executive vice
president, managing group director of Anthem Worldwide, "from strategic to
creative to executional. It's a real world example of a progressive
client's embrace of brand point management to deliver a compelling and
consistent brand experience. With millions of consumers engaging with the
Olympic packaging, Anthem helped Coke realize its bold, empowering and
positive vision for the Beijing games."

    Anthem Worldwide, a Schawk Strategic Design Company, is an integrated
global network that provides innovative solutions to articulate, unify and
manage brand impact. Anthem creates compelling brand experiences by

&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Private Equity Fund Services called &#8220;excellent&#8221; and &#8220;top notch&#8221;
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan was ranked as a top provider of private equity fund administration,
according to a key industry survey by Global Custodian magazine. 

J.P. Morgan received best-in-class recognition across 43 service categories,
securing more top ratings than any other administrator, according to the Global
Custodian 2008 Private Equity Fund Administration Survey. The firm was rated
&#8220;excellent&#8221; and &#8220;top notch&#8221; for the second year in a row by private equity fund
managers. &#8220;J.P. Morgan has somehow managed to improve on the already
astonishingly high scores of a year ago. In every service area, the averages are
either excellent or as close as makes no difference,&#8221; the magazine said. 

J.P. Morgan received the highest rankings for client service, fund establishment
and structuring, capital drawdowns, investment execution, accounting and
reporting to general and limited partners, distributions, regulatory reporting
and compliance, corporate secretarial and technology. 

&#8220;J.P. Morgan Private Equity Fund Services originated from J.P. Morgan Partners,
a premier private equity shop. We are gratified that we have maintained a deep
understanding of the client base, and have earned a reputation for exceptional
service delivery," said James Hutter, global business executive for J.P. Morgan
Private Equity Fund Services. &#8220;In these uncertain times, private equity firms
may want to hire a strong, global administrator, so they have more time to focus
on their core business.&#8221; 

J.P. Morgan was ranked particularly high for client service and relationship
management with one client saying: &#8220;I feel that I can rely on the manager of
[my] account to respond any time of the day, night or weekend.&#8221; &#8220;We felt very
confident when selecting [J.P. Morgan] and have since developed a very solid
working relationship,&#8221; another client said. 

J.P. Morgan provides services to more than 200 funds managing $200 billion in
alternative assets. It has offices in New York, London, Sydney, San Francisco,
Chicago and Dallas. This summer, J.P. Morgan also added capabilities in Jersey,
the administrative heartland of the London-based private equity industry. The
global bank offers cash management and foreign exchange as well as
administration.

&lt;p&gt;ARMONK, N.Y. &amp; OAKBROOK TERRACE, Ill.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE:IBM) and DeVry University today jointly announced the launch of a new
Enterprise Computing track within DeVry University&#8217;s Computer Information
Systems (CIS) bachelor&#8217;s degree program. The new track will provide students
with critical computing skills designed to meet the increased demands of IBM
clients and Business Partners. The new Enterprise Computing track is planned to
be available to DeVry University students beginning in March 2009. 

DeVry University, a member of the IBM Academic Initiative program, is the first
to incorporate multiple IBM Systems technologies into a single degree program
track. Through the Enterprise Computing track within DeVry University&#8217;s CIS
degree program, students can gain an understanding of end-to-end systems
solutions found in a modern data center, which can help set them apart from
their peers. With a solid technical understanding of multiple IBM technologies,
this will help DeVry University students be better equipped to compete in a
global economy that demands using the latest server technologies to help solve
business and energy challenges, such as dwindling IT resources and escalating
real estate and energy costs. 

This relationship between IBM and DeVry University is part of IBM's continued
commitment to work with leading colleges and universities to cultivate and grow
opportunities for enterprise systems application developers and programmers.
Launched in 2004, the overall IBM Academic Initiative offers a wide range of
technology education benefits through IBM's deep technology history -- from
IBM-supplied instruction to technology -- that can be scaled to meet the goals
of most universities. The IBM Academic Initiative for System z and Power Systems
programs works with schools to enable courses, labs, senior design projects, and
research in enterprise systems concepts. 

"IBM's clients and Business Partners are always looking for college graduates
who are educated in enterprise systems concepts and technologies," said Ross
Mauri, general manager, IBM Power Systems. "DeVry University&#8217;s courses will help
students develop skills unique to scalable midrange and mainframe platforms. As
an added feature, students will apply that knowledge by using IBM technology
through the use of supported labs, case studies, and design projects." 

&#8220;For DeVry University, the relationship with IBM enables us to continue to
revitalize interest in technology careers by leveraging IBM&#8217;s assets and
providing a career path for our graduates,&#8221; said David Pauldine, president,
DeVry University. &#8220;Within the next five to seven years, Baby Boomers will begin
retiring and DeVry University can help fill the pipeline with a pool of
qualified applicants for IBM, its customers and Business Partners. Our students
will be educated on IBM&#8217;s technology that currently runs the world&#8217;s top 50
banks and 22 of the 25 top U.S. retailers. Through this practical education in
Enterprise Computing, DeVry University&#8217;s graduates will be set apart from other
computer science graduates.&#8221; 

"The IBM Academic Initiative was established to address the need for maintaining
a vibrant workforce and attracting new talent," said Terry Patane, director of
IS recruiting, Costco Wholesale. "This approach creates a win-win-win
relationship between IBM, key clients and forward-thinking colleges and
universities. Costco's recent teaming with IBM to host the Academic Initiative
roundtable for DeVry University has opened new opportunities for Costco
recruiting, resulting in what we hope becomes a mutually beneficial
relationship." 

Many organizations can benefit from this new collaboration between IBM and
DeVry, including the extensive user group communities across Power Systems and
System z technology. One such group is the Large User Group (LUG), an
organization of high-end IBM Power Systems i users. This group comprised of over
100 IBM customers worldwide supports the new Enterprise Computing track being
offered by DeVry University as an excellent means of developing a new base of
talent for its members. The LUG membership represents many diverse industries
including retail, logistical services, financial services, real estate,
insurance and others, and a number of LUG members are included in the Fortune
500. 

IBM Academic Initiative faculty members worldwide can access more than 1,000
other hardware, software and services training resources at no cost by visiting
www.ibm.com/university/academicinitiative/. The IBM Academic Initiative most
recently launched a Facebook profile page of System z for students and
professors to connect, share mainframe news, contests, events, and job
opportunities. To be friends with System z or meet other System z friends, visit
the System z's Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com keyword: systemz

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The change to a bank holding company model will prove costly for former investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), an analyst at Bernstein Research said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulators will force the two companies to employ less leverage, maintain more liquidity, limit illiquid business commitments and tightly control counterparty risk, analyst Brad Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Federal Reserve is a more intrusive regulator than the Securities and Exchange Commission and establishing the commercial bank infrastructure to report to the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the New York State Bank authorities will be costly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve in September, after Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK failed, Merrill Lynch MER.N agreed to be bought and the financial markets spun out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hintz rates Goldman Sachs "market-perform" and Morgan Stanley "outperform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, in a research note dated December 1, Credit Suisse forecast a quarterly loss of $4 a share for Goldman Sachs, reflecting cost of asset-price declines, less investment banking and lower asset levels in prime brokerage and asset management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, several analysts at brokerages including Fox-Pitt Kelton and UBS have forecast Goldman will post a fourth-quarter loss, the first ever since going public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke, who rates Goldman "outperform" slashed her price target on the stock to $140 from an earlier range of $175 to $200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs closed at $65.76 Monday on the New York stock Exchange, while those of Morgan Stanley closed at $11.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anurag Kotoky in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FREEPORT, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Landowner Jolly Bay LLC, a company dedicated to responsible and sustainable
growth for Walton County and its residents, has filed a second lawsuit against
Walton County, Florida, pursuant to Florida Statute 163, in Walton County First
Judicial Circuit Court, in connection with the Board of County Commissioner&#8217;s
denial of its project in September based on an unadopted standard made up by
County staff after receiving public opposition to the project. The lawsuit seeks
monetary damages against the County for the unconstitutional taking of Jolly
Bay&#8217;s property and for violations of its constitutional rights, including
reimbursement of Jolly Bay&#8217;s attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. The lawsuit also
requests that the Court declare that the County unlawfully denied the project
based upon the unadopted standard and order the immediate approval of the
project. 

The Jolly Bay project is located &#189; mile from the northeast 331 bridge landing
off Jolly Bay Road and included an upscale recreational vehicle park, a bed &amp;
breakfast, a 73-unit condominium, a boat docking facility and commercial spaces.
Setting this project apart from other local projects, the plans had the project
situated on 17 acres of a 60-acre tract of land in order to preserve 43 acres of
natural beauty, and to ensure the integrity of, and compatibility with the
surrounding area. 

&#8220;Jolly Bay spent a lot of time and money working on the plans for an upscale
project that was continually brought before the planning department staff over a
two-year period before submittal of an application to ensure that the project
met all Walton County Comprehensive Plan and Land Development Code
requirements,&#8221; stated Dana Matthews, of Matthews and Hawkins, attorney for Jolly
Bay. &#8220;Despite those efforts, Jolly Bay now finds itself in the position of
having to sue to protect its constitutional rights and to seek millions of
dollars in monetary damages from the County and its taxpayers.&#8221; 

Jolly Bay LLC is represented by Dana Matthews, of Matthews and Hawkins, at
850-837-3662, who is available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;Combination of Unisys InfoImage and Microsoft SharePoint Enables Enterprises to
Enhance Productivity and Better Comply with Growing Disclosure Requirements
BLUE BELL, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Unisys Corporation (NYSE:UIS) today announced the Unisys InfoImage&#174; Connector
for Microsoft&#174; Office SharePoint&#174; Server 2007. Unisys InfoImage Connector is a
new solution developed by Unisys in collaboration with Microsoft that enables
Unisys customers to seamlessly connect Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007
and Unisys InfoImage document imaging and workflow solutions. 

Unisys InfoImage is used by financial services firms, government agencies, and
other organizations to process high volumes of loans, claims and tax forms in
digital form. Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 is a leading collaboration
and portal software suite. Unisys believes that combining these technologies
will enable users of both solutions to significantly enhance productivity and
improve their ability to comply with disclosure requirements. 

&#8220;Many of the world&#8217;s largest institutions already rely on the Unisys InfoImage
platform to process and manage millions of transactional documents every day,&#8221;
said Jeff Parker, president of independent analyst firm Directions on Microsoft.
&#8220;The new Unisys InfoImage SharePoint connector makes it easier for information
workers in these institutions to access and use content captured in an InfoImage
repository using the familiar Microsoft Office user interface.&#8221; 

Today on a global basis, disclosure laws governing records management and
archiving are significantly increasing the amount of data that organizations are
responsible for storing and managing, especially as insider and outsider
security threats and regulations increase. 

With this new solution, Unisys and Microsoft are enabling enterprises to easily
manage the increase in documentation and processes, freeing IT departments to
focus on other critical functions. Companies will be able to deploy business
applications that leverage the familiar and easy-to-use Office SharePoint
interface and the advanced imaging and workflow features of InfoImage. 

&#8220;Through its additional document management and workflow software, Unisys
InfoImage complements and enhances the core capabilities of Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server 2007,&#8221; said Kathleen Winder, Microsoft Director of SharePoint
and Fast Partner Marketing. &#8220;Integrated solutions such as this allow our
customers to increase productivity and collaboration, and streamline business
activities that, altogether, provide competitive advantages.&#8221; 

The InfoImage Connector for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 allows
enterprise users to effectively repurpose content and manage records across both
solution suites, regardless of where the content was created. The Connector can
be scaled horizontally or vertically to manage volume and optimize performance. 

&#8220;Organizations are dealing with critical issues around document proliferation,
management, storage, and operations efficiency. By combining the strengths of
Unisys and Microsoft, we are able to effectively address our clients&#8217; two
largest sets of documents and processes &#8211; transaction content and collaborative
content,&#8221; said Paul Barber, director, ECM Program, Unisys. &#8220;Enterprise Content
Management is software that organizations are using to improve their document
and process operations and realize the substantial benefits of cost reduction,
customer service improvements, and compliance enhancement. Organizations should
consider this powerful, yet low cost and high-value connection facility to
extend the content reach and improve productivity.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  REDWOOD CITY, CA, Dec 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Tectura Corporation, a worldwide provider of business consulting
services, is pleased to announce that it was chosen to be part of
Microsoft's Technical Adoption Program (TAP) for the latest Microsoft
Dynamics release -- Microsoft Dynamics(R) NAV 2009. TAP is designed to
provide a consistent experience for Microsoft partners to obtain
real-world customer feedback on Microsoft pre-release products. The goal
is to improve customer/partner experiences in evaluating and adopting
Microsoft technologies. Tectura is one of only eight Microsoft Dynamics
partners around the world asked to join Microsoft's software experts in
this initiative.

    One of the major goals of this TAP initiative was to test the new
Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 release along with one of Tectura's ISV
solutions. Each Microsoft Dynamics partner that was part of the TAP team
ran an upgrade project with a selected customer. Andreas Voss, product
manager for Tectura Germany, and his team, chose Tectura(R) Process
Manufacturing to be Tectura's TAP solution candidate. This industry
solution is successfully used by more than 180 clients around the globe;
the solution is Certified for Microsoft Dynamics and is continuously
updated to ensure it meets industry requirements.

    The TAP client candidate selected was a German company running Tectura
Process Manufacturing on Microsoft Dynamics NAV for the past 11 years.
Explains Voss, "Our client was already considering updating their ERP
solution. Plus, they wanted to improve the organizational processes within
the company. Integration between their ERP and Microsoft Office was one of
their goals. Upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 provided an
excellent opportunity to reach their objectives."

    The project began in December 2007. During a meeting in Copenhagen,
Microsoft presented the solution development status to the TAP partners
and asked them to work together on the planned release. What followed
were many hours of testing, dozens of meetings and numerous discussions.
The result? One of the most advanced ERP solution releases, tested by
real clients. A major functionality component is personalized role
centers. With 21 key job functions providing individual employees with
tools, alerts and efficiency capabilities the system helps people work
faster and smarter, giving businesses the flexibility to adapt to new
opportunities and growth. "It is easy for users to adapt to the
Role-Tailored views and business processes," said Voss. "Without juggling
applications employees can use their favorite programs -- including
Microsoft Office Outlook, Microsoft Office Excel, and more to access the
data they need to perform their tasks."

    "All the upgrade tools for our Tectura Process Manufacturing solution were
intensely tested," Voss continues. Technical topics, like migrating
objects to the new, role-based Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 client were as
important as the underlying business logic. "What we have done with the
Technical Adoption Program will make next steps for other partners who
must also update their solutions, much more streamlined," Voss says. "We
at Tectura are currently updating our other industry solution offerings.
What we have learned during the program will make the whole process more
efficient, and ultimately more valuable for our clients."

    "Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 is a major step within our ERP strategy,"
says Jan Sillemann, Director, Microsoft Dynamics NAV Global Product
Management. "Tectura was one of the selected Microsoft Dynamics partners
to join our development process at an early stage. We thank Tectura for
their commitment to our Technical Adoption Program. This enabled us to
develop a new ERP generation that is based on user need and real life
client feedback."

Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 release along with one of Tectura's ISV
solutions. Each Microsoft Dynamics partner that was part of the TAP team
ran an upgrade project with a selected customer. Andreas Voss, product
manager for Tectura Germany, and his team, chose Tectura(R) Process
Manufacturing to be Tectura's TAP solution candidate. This industry
solution is successfully used by more than 180 clients around the globe;
the solution is Certified for Microsoft Dynamics and is continuously
updated to ensure it meets industry requirements.

    The TAP client candidate selected was a German company running Tectura
Process Manufacturing on Microsoft Dynamics NAV for the past 11 years.
Explains Voss, "Our client was already considering updating their ERP
solution. Plus, they wanted to improve the organizational processes within
the company. Integration between their ERP and Microsoft Office was one of
their goals. Upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 provided an
excellent opportunity to reach their objectives."

    The project began in December 2007. During a meeting in Copenhagen,
Microsoft presented the solution development status to the TAP partners
and asked them to work together on the planned release. What followed
were many hours of testing, dozens of meetings and numerous discussions.
The result? One of the most advanced ERP solution releases, tested by
real clients. A major functionality component is personalized role
centers. With 21 key job functions providing individual employees with
tools, alerts and efficiency capabilities the system helps people work
faster and smarter, giving businesses the flexibility to adapt to new
opportunities and growth. "It is easy for users to adapt to the
Role-Tailored views and business processes," said Voss. "Without juggling
applications employees can use their favorite programs -- including
Microsoft Office Outlook, Microsoft Office Excel, and more to access the
data they need to perform their tasks."

    "All the upgrade tools for our Tectura Process Manufacturing solution were
intensely tested," Voss continues. Technical topics, like migrating
objects to the new, role-based Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 client were as
important as the underlying business logic. "What we have done with the
Technical Adoption Program will make next steps for other partners who
must also update their solutions, much more streamlined," Voss says. "We
at Tectura are currently updating our other industry solution offerings.
What we have learned during the program will make the whole process more
efficient, and ultimately more valuable for our clients."

    "Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 is a major step within our ERP strategy,"
says Jan Sillemann, Director, Microsoft Dynamics NAV Global Product
Management. "Tectura was one of the selected Microsoft Dynamics partners
to join our development process at an early stage. We thank Tectura for
their commitment to our Technical Adoption Program. This enabled us to
develop a new ERP generation that is based on user need and real life
client feedback."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new software to help organizations
automate their business processes, thereby lowering operating costs and
reducing paper consumption.

    Despite predictions that the spread of information technology would reduce
paper consumption, 90-95% of business information is still stored on
paper. Today people rely heavily on paper to perform everyday duties,
despite the high cost associated with lost documents, risk of document
obsolescence and labor inefficiency.

    For example, the average American office worker disposes of 100 to 200
pounds of office paper per year. Typical IT departments focused on
delivering software rely heavily on paper intensive processes such as word
processing, printing documents and paper-based sketches.

    In this era of globalization, companies are looking to transform business
processes, making the process of software delivery more automated,
collaborative and agile. New and enhanced IBM software will help
organizations reach their peak productivity and increase speed to market
by automating and enhancing inefficient, paper-driven processes.

    For example, the process of global software delivery emphasizes
documentation and the average size software applications can generate
hundreds of pages of textual requirements. IT teams are accustomed to
creating paper-based sketches, scribbling diagrams on paper, using
whiteboards, or text-driven word processing tools. When approached using
traditional methods, defining and managing project requirements is paper
intensive with geographically distributed stakeholders printing documents
and spreadsheets that can reach several hundred pages.

    With the new Jazz-based IBM Rational Requirements Composer documentation
becomes more visual, digitizing lines of text into diagrams. In addition,
IBM Rational Requirements Composer turns paper requirements into
storyboards similar to how movies are made. These storyboards can be
shared globally for in-house and outsourced teams to collaborate via the
web, thereby reducing the consumption of paper by an organization.

    Furthermore, IBM Rational Requirements Composer ensures a development
project is aligned with business objectives, reducing project failures
which cost organizations US $300 billion* annually. Currently 30% of
software development projects are consumed by poor requirements definition
and management, and reworking project requirements can cost an average
$7,600 per project**. IBM Rational Requirements Composer's collaborative
features can reduce risk by improving collaboration using Web 2.0-style
linking, tagging and conversations to drive consensus amongst all levels
of business and IT involved with a project. Using the IBM Jazz technology
platform, IBM Rational Requirements Composer improves access to a
project's requirements by all stakeholders, no matter where in the world
they may reside.

    "The mass of paperwork is too much for stakeholders to wade through," said
Emmet B. Keeffe, III, CEO and co-founder of iRise. "Through our work on
thousands of Fortune 1000 IT projects helping businesses visualize
applications before they're built, we know first hand that Rational
Requirements Composer will make the daunting requirements definition
process more visual and reduce paper consumption for our customers."

    IBM and its partners are delivering new software offerings based on the
IBM Jazz technology platform to help organizations automate and
collaborate to transform business processes. The Web 2.0 features of the
IBM Jazz technology platform helps break down the walls that inhibit
organizations from truly collaborating with partners, suppliers,
customers and their employees.

    For example, iRise is integrating its application visualization solution
and Ravenflow is integrating its visual requirements validation offering
with IBM Rational Requirements Composer to help organizations move away
from large text-only requirements documents. In addition, the new IBM
Rational Quality Manager helps businesses collaborate on quality assurance
standards, without the burden of paper, before ever releasing a product to
the public. Also, the new IBM Rational Team Concert helps globally
distributed teams collaborate using instant messaging, wikis and blogs to
deliver software in a coordinated and transparent manner.

    Automating paper-intensive aspects of the software delivery process is key
to reducing paper consumption for IT teams. With IBM's integrated software
delivery platform, IBM is helping organizations collaborate in real-time
without using paper. Without paper as a bottleneck for this business
process, greater automation and transformation can be achieved.

&lt;p&gt;Actuate&#8217;s BIRT Products Complement IBM Rational ClearQuest 7.1 Flexible
ReportingModel
SAN MATEO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Actuate Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTU), the leader in delivering Rich Internet
Applications Without Limits&#8482;, and an IBM (NYSE:IBM) Premier Business Partner,
today announced that Actuate&#8217;s commercial BIRT product line can now extend IBM
Rational ClearQuest reports to improve collaboration, creating better visibility
and control between software development teams and superior support for critical
business operations. 

Actuate congratulates IBM on the new levels of flexibility and insight that it
is providing for software development teams with the addition of new reporting
and charting capabilities in the upcoming release of Rational ClearQuest 7.1.
These capabilities make use of open source Eclipse BIRT (Business Intelligence
and Reporting Tools) technology, a top-level Eclipse Foundation project
initiated and co-led by Actuate. 

The BIRT project has delivered one of the most widely adopted business
intelligence and reporting technologies with over five million downloads. IBM is
a contributing member to the Eclipse BIRT project. BIRT-based reporting provides
an open, extensible reporting infrastructure for software vendors, such as IBM
Rational software. 

&#8220;With global project teams working in tandem to lower costs and improve software
quality, speed and agility are required to support mission critical business
processes,&#8221; said Scott Hebner, vice president, marketing, IBM Rational Software.
&#8220;We work with companies like Actuate to enhance the value of open source tools
so our customers have the support and products needed to deliver world-class
software applications.&#8221; 

The global nature of IT software development requires dispersed, multisite teams
to work on portions of projects, while staying aligned with overall project and
business objectives. This has created a need for corporations to gain visibility
and control across their IT projects and assets throughout the application
delivery processes. On an operational level, managers need to generate reports
throughout the software delivery process to ensure coordination and
prioritization across workgroups and compliance with internal and external
mandates. The BIRT-based reports within IBM Rational ClearQuest enable
businesses to initiate real-time governance processes throughout the stages of
software application delivery, so that organizations can respond more rapidly to
customer needs and business changes. Actuate and Rational customers will be able
to realize the impact of making software changes and keep configuration process
enforcements transparent, by enabling project teams to stay focused on
delivering high quality software on time. 

Support for IBM Rational ClearQuest is the latest in a series of Actuate
initiatives to ensure the success of BIRT developers, building on already
available resources including the BIRT Exchange online community
(http://www.birt-exchange.com), technical support, training and a complete line
of BIRT-based commercial products. Rational customers can take advantage of
Actuate&#8217;s value-added support for open source BIRT reporting to include
extensions such as AJAX-based interactivity for BIRT reports, ad-hoc reporting
with BIRT templates, spreadsheet reporting and report servers to help quickly
deploy BIRT reports. 

Actuate together with IBM&#8217;s Lawrence D Gerard, senior manager, code and release
management, IBM Rational recently co-hosted a webcast for the global Rational
user community on how to maximize the value of new BIRT reporting and charting
in IBM Rational ClearQuest 7.1. The on-demand version is now ready for replay at
www.actuate.com/ClearQuest. 

&#8220;The combination of BIRT-based reporting solutions with the IBM Rational suite
of products is a further demonstration of the close alignment between Actuate
and IBM,&#8221; said Nobby Akiha, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Actuate
Corporation. &#8220;Actuate&#8217;s ability to extend the value of Rational&#8217;s BIRT-based
reports will enable IT developers and business leaders to more efficiently
manage IT software projects and deployments, and ensure a quality IT software
service level.&#8221;

Here are highlights from Monday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:

Yes, We Are in a Recession

I wish I could say that I see a near-term bottom now, but I can&#8217;t. I think the
economy will continue to decline for at least the next six months. Focus your
equity investments on firms with strong balance sheets and for products with
stable demand for their products. Big drug companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:
PFE) and Abbott Labs (NYSE: ABT) would be good examples of these sort of firms.
Other places to hunt would be in the Consumer Staples and Electric Utility
sectors. 

SAP Still Feeling BOBJ Effects

SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) reported lower than expected revenues and earnings in third
quarter of 2008 due to the economic downturn and costs of its Business Objects
(BOBJ) acquisition. 

The company posted modest growth in Asia, Americas and Europe. The financial
crisis, which accelerated at the end of the third quarter, impacted SAP&#8217;s
business in all regions with an unprecedented sharp downturn in business
activity. Moreover, the willingness to look for larger acquisitions to help fuel
its growth, compared to its previous organic growth strategy is likely to hinder
the company&#8217;s stock performance in the near term. 

We continue to rate shares of SAP a Hold, however, as we believe that the
company has the resilience to ride through this downturn, although we believe
shares are in-line with our current valuation of the company. We have fixed our
target price at $35.75 based on the company selling at 16.32x our 2008 EPADS
estimate of $2.19 over the next six months. 

If SAP continues to move forward with an acquisition growth strategy, its P/E
may come close to resembling that of Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT) or
Oracle Corporation (Nasdaq: ORCL), although on a price/sales basis, SAP is
valued lower than these companies. Until the company can show it has the ability
to integrate the BOBJ acquisition, its shares will continue to be under
pressure.

&lt;p&gt;New Solution Helps Organizations Save Cost and Eliminate Risk of Project Failure
EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
iRise&#174;, the world&#8217;s leading visualization solutions company, today announced the
imminent availability of iRise Connect for IBM&#174; Rational Requirements Composer.
This integration, built on IBM&#8217;s open Jazz technology platform will make high
fidelity iRise visualizations instantly accessible from within the IBM Rational
Requirements Composer&#8482; product. As a result, IBM and iRise now provide a
complete requirements definition solution supporting a variety of elicitation
methods. This integration is designed to eliminate wasteful cost overruns and
delays by ensuring IT organizations are documenting and tracking the right
business needs &#8211; the first time. 

&#8220;Interactive, immersive software visualization is an important component to
solving the endemic problem with requirements on software projects,&#8221; said
Michael Loria, vice president of business development, IBM Rational Software.
&#8220;iRise is the market leader with this capability, having proven the benefits of
visualization across a broad set of industries and application types.&#8221; 

iRise Connect for IBM Rational Requirements Composer gives requirements
professionals the ability to embed live, high fidelity software visualizations
directly into the Requirements Composer product by leveraging iRise SmartView&#8482;,
a wrapper technology similar to popular YouTube video embedding. Using iRise
Connect, business analysts, business stakeholders, developers, projects managers
and other IBM users can interact with &#8216;live&#8217; visualizations and fully experience
simulated pages, scenarios and masters directly within the Requirements Composer
environment. The visualization assets are published in real time from iRise to
the Requirements Composer repository and can be linked into the web of
requirements artifacts. 

For the first time, fully functional, high fidelity visualizations now
complement other definition assets contained and managed in the Requirements
Composer environment, ensuring that the right application requirements are being
captured, defined, traced, collaborated on and managed throughout the project
life cycle. 

&#8220;The combination of software visualization from iRise with comprehensive
requirements management from IBM is a powerful weapon in the fight to eliminate
waste and cut risk on business application projects,&#8221; stated Emmet B. Keeffe
III, CEO and co-founder of iRise. &#8220;Fixing the requirements problem is a huge win
for IT organizations that develop custom or packaged applications. This complete
visualization, requirements definition and management solution is the best way
to eliminate the risk of project failure.&#8221; 

Software Visualization

iRise offers a powerful way for businesses to quickly visualize and &#8220;test
market&#8221; applications before a single line of code is written. For the first
time, business software definition professionals can validate what they need,
and then communicate their ideas to others using visualizations that replicate
the exact look, feel and behavior of the proposed solution, taking the guesswork
out of application definition. Just as computer-aided design (CAD) tools
transformed the automotive, aerospace and semiconductor industries iRise is now
transforming the global business application market. 

With thousands of projects completed successfully, the value of visualization
has proven to be enormous for businesses in highly competitive markets:

* Get to market twice as fast; 
* Eliminate 30% of project cost; 
* Ensure success of global sourcing strategies; and, 
* Dramatically shorten application consolidation projects.

iRise can be used to visualize any software that has a user interface: new Web
applications, portals, enhancements to existing systems, customizations to
packaged implementations, as well as mobile applications. 

Pricing and Availability

iRise Connect for IBM Rational Requirements Composer is targeted to ship in Q1
2009. Pricing for this product has not yet been determined. 

Pricing for iRise starts at $6,995 for iRise Professional Edition; a standalone
version of the popular team-based iRise Enterprise Edition. Mid-market pricing
is also available for smaller companies. iRise Professional Edition is available
for free 30 day trial by clicking here: http://www.irise.com/. 

To speed adoption, free iRise eLearning is available from the iRise Website. For

About iRise

iRise is the world&#8217;s leading provider of visualization software for business
applications. Visualization is quickly becoming a critical competitive advantage
for businesses to more effectively communicate their needs to technology teams
and give everyone involved the ability to fully experience applications before
they are built. Companies of all sizes like General Motors, UPS, Wachovia,
Manpower, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and many others use iRise to &#8220;test drive&#8221;
their applications before building, which accelerates time to revenue, improves
customer experience, and drives costs down. At iRise, our vision is that by
2020, all business software will be visualized before being built, the same way
that every car, airplane, and building is visualized today. Headquartered in El
Segundo, Calif., iRise is backed by Morgan Stanley Venture Partners, and
Deutsche Bank, and has sales offices across North America.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
production at its 150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area
refinery in Torrance, California, would be cut by an undisclosed
amount following a Monday morning unit shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We do anticipate some impact to production from Monday's
event," said Exxon spokeswoman Aarti Ramachandran.
"Unfortunately I won't be able to get into specifics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has also declined to disclose which unit at the
Torrance refinery had to be shut after malfunctioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramachandran did say the unit was completely shut and not on
standby, which allows for a quicker restart.

KIRKLAND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Electronic Evidence Discovery, Inc. (EED), a leading international provider of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has revised up its forecast for U.S. job losses in November to 400,000 after reports showing a dismal employment picture in the private sector, particularly in services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysts at Goldman had previously forecast a decline of 350,000 jobs.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fresh off strong Black Friday sales of its XBox 360 videogame consoles, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is "cautiously optimistic" about the holiday shopping season, a senior executive said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But things could get tougher next year, said Shane Kim, Microsoft's vice president of strategy and business development for the videogame business, as the economy gets sicker and people cut back spending even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video game business is on track to grow 20 percent this year, Kim told the Reuters Media Summit in New York, but "people are not projecting that kind of growth" for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who knows, maybe flat performance will be considered a remarkable achievement," Kim said. "It's difficult to predict the future," he said, adding that the gaming industry has traditionally fared well in economic downturns as people turn to stay-at-home entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While they may cut back on large purchases like automobiles or appliances, they're still looking for entertainment," said the executive, who focuses on strategic planning and partnerships for Microsoft's interactive entertainment business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft saw "record-breaking" sales of XBox 360 on the Black Friday weekend after the U.S. Thanksgiving day, which marks the start of the holiday shopping season. Sales were up 25 percent compared to last year's Black Friday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The XBox 360 also outsold Sony Corp's (6758.T) Playstation 3 by three units to one, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim said his unit is planning for "tough times" and assessing where costs could be saved because of the economic uncertainty. "A big objective for us is to deliver most entertainment value for the dollar," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anupreeta Das and Franklin Paul, editing by Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds closing prices, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Dec 3 (Reuters) - Mexican stocks rose on
Wednesday, led by gains in shares of top broadcaster Televisa
and fixed-line phone giant Telmex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark IPC stock index .MXX gained 1.74 percent to
20.147.01 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was halted about one half hour early as exchange
officials sought to verify a number of operations during the
day, a stock exchange spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said stocks gains were supported by increasing
investor confidence that Washington will approve a multibillion
 dollar bailout for automakers General Motors Corp  (GM.N) and
Chrysler LLC, as well as aid for Ford (F.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This will favor Mexico a lot because the Mexican
automotive industry totally depends on what happens in the U.S.
industry," said Gerardo Copca, an analyst at MetAnalisis
consultancy in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three of Detroit's automakers have major operations in
Mexico and local vehicle and parts exports account for around
one-fifth of Mexico's total exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also helping stocks were expectations that central banks in
the euro zone, Britain and Sweden will continue with aggressive
monetary policy easing that investors hope will help curb the
current global downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries that the United States is in a deep and prolonged
recession have weighed heavily on Mexican markets in recent
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Mexican Institute of Finance Executives' manufacturing
index sank to its lowest on record in November, suggesting the
country may be slipping into recession, the private financial
group said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The peso MXN=MEX01 weakened 0.58 percent to 13.654 per
dollar at the central bank's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In debt trading, the yield on the government's 10-year peso
bond MX10YT=RR fell 8 basis points to 8.86 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico did not buy back any local bonds in an auction on
Wednesday after investors offered to sell their assets at
above-market prices, the central bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the equites market, shares of Televisa (TLVACPO.MX)
gained 5.86 percent to 41.70 pesos while its stock in New York
(TV.N) gained 6 percent to $15.55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in dominant fixed-line telephone company Telmex
TELMEXL.MX added 5.84 percent to 12.15 pesos while its shares
on Wall Street TMX.N gained 5.31 to $17.85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top retailer Wal-Mart de Mexico (Walmex) (WALMEXV.MX) rose
1.03 percent to 37.15 pesos.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
real estate head Stuart Rothenberg told an industry group last
month that the firm had put more of its own capital at risk as
the commercial real estate market was peaking in mid-2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman had increased its equity stakes in the Whitehall
fund family it manages and had invested more of its own balance
sheet in commercial property when markets were booming,
Rothenberg told the Real Estate Board of New York on Nov. 6 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The firm was, for all intents and purposes, almost an
enlarged hedge fund for the past couple of years, where the
more (investing) we could do on balance sheet and the less we
could do in the funds, the more we did," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rothenberg's remarks came one week before he announced
plans to retire at year-end and were a rare example of a
Goldman executive discussing the company's business in a public
forum. The Real Estate Board session was open to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After rising for decades, property values began falling
last year as economic weakness and a global credit crisis began
to take their toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exposure to this weakening market could add to Goldman's
woes. The firm is already expected to report a fourth-quarter
loss of $2 billion, driven by falling prices for a wide range
of equity and fixed-income assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman did not return calls seeking comment. Rothenberg,
45, who joined Goldman 21 years ago and has run the real estate
unit since 2003, could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPPING THE ANTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the world's biggest commercial property investors,
Goldman's real estate division has raised more than $26 billion
from the bank, its executives and outside investors since 1991.
Nearly $8 billion was invested in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitehall participated in the buyout boom, acquiring real
estate companies when property prices peaked, such as the June
2007 purchase of Equity Inns Inc for $1.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last February, a Whitehall fund purchased American Casino 
Entertainment Properties, which includes the Stratosphere
casino in Las Vegas, for $1.2 billion from billionaire Carl
Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rothenberg, 45, told his audience that beyond Whitehall,
Goldman had been increasing its direct exposure to real estate
through principal investments, which means putting its own
balance sheet at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even within the Whitehall family, named for a Manhattan
street near Goldman's headquarters, the company was taking a
bigger piece of the action and taking on more risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The firm used to be 15 percent of the capital in each
fund, then 20 percent of the capital in each fund, and then
over the past few years it had been about 35 percent of the
capital in each fund," Rothenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm said in a recent regulatory filing that its
employees contributed 36 percent of the $14 billion committed
to five funds in 2007 and this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, "we were investing a lot on balance sheet, so
in each fund we carved out more and more so we could do them on
balance sheet and get more and more exposure," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those days are over, he said. Looking ahead, Rothenberg
said Goldman would focus on buying debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Right now our primary vehicle isn't as much our
traditional Whitehall equity fund or our traditional Goldman
Sachs Capital Partners. It's our senior loan fund; it's our
mezzanine fund," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitehall intends to put its $6 billion of equity to work
buying up distressed real estate assets, he said. Goldman
reported $3.9 billion of real estate investment exposure on its
books at the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Real estate has long been a huge money maker for Wall
Street, but in the past year sinking markets have created
humbling losses for the most aggressive players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in September, in no small
part because of exposure to devalued real estate investments
such as property developer Suncal Cos and Archstone-Smith, an
apartment building real estate investment trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N), one of the world's largest real
estate investors, earlier this year suffered a $150 million hit
from an investment in Crescent Real Estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Likewise, Whitehall is struggling with poor performance and
potentially big losses on recent investments. The firm marked
down equity in its $4.8 billion Whitehall 2007 fund by half,
The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt; * Three analysts see Q4 loss at Goldman, Morgan Stanley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Analysts expect big write-downs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Morgan Stanley shares down 3 pct; Goldman up 1 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds Merrill Lynch (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts expect
a tough fourth quarter for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N), laden with significant write-downs amid
challenging global markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The quarter will prove to be "ugly" for the companies, J.P.
Morgan Securities analyst Kenneth Worthington said and forecast
gross write-downs of about $3.5 billion at Goldman Sachs and
about $5.5 billion at Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley, however, will benefit by about $4 billion
due to the widening spread on its owndebt, he said. This is
more than the $0.5 billion benefit the analyst expects at
Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox-Pitt Kelton's David Trone and Merrill Lynch's Guy
Moszkowski were the latest to cut their outlook on the two
former investment banks, reflecting continued price correction
across many asset classes through November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has been widely expected to post its first
quarterly loss since going public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poor market conditions got even worse last month as the
U.S. Treasury abandoned its proposal to buy hard-to-trade
mortgage securities and other debt from hard-hit banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inspite of the tough operating environment, J.P. Morgan's
Worthington said he expects Goldman to perform better in the
longer term due to "a superior culture and ability to alter its
business mix." He rates the stock "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has numerous attractive investment opportunities
including various distressed and underpriced assets, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worthington said he expects Goldman to use any 'bank'
acquisition to build high net worth or commercial
relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Weexpect both GS and MS to be opportunistic in growing
their deposit franchises," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE WRTIE-DOWNS, BIG LOSSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past month, several analysts have forecast a loss
at Goldman and Morgan Stanley on the back of deteriorating
global capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worthington widened his fourth-quarter loss estimate on
Goldman to $5.14 per share from 58 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He forecast a loss of 46 cents a share for Morgan Stanley,
compared with his previous view of a profit of 28 cents per
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, prominent banking analyst Meredith Whitney said
U.S. banks will incur about $44 billion in write-downs and loss
provisions in the fourth quarter, adding that much of the U.S.
Treasury capital will be diverted to plug holes on their
balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the summer of 2007, Wall Street has been hammered by
a sharp pullback in debt markets, which began with mortgage
woes and escalated into a credit crisis, slowing economic
activity around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox-Pitt's Trone said he now expects Morgan Stanley to
write down $2.8 billion in the quarter, compared with his prior
estimate of $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill's Moszkowski said, "While it appeared that through
October Morgan Stanley could remain profitable, the market
decline in credit and mortgage products in November makes this
very unlikely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He cut his share-price target to $21 from $25, and
maintained his "buy" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Morgan Stanley were down 3 percent at $11.66 in
morning trade Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while
those of Goldman were up 1 percent at $65.69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Neha Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu

&lt;p&gt;Tiefseegebiet Neptun Block soll ausgewertet werden
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) gab heute bekannt, dass ihre
Tochtergesellschaft, ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Romania Limited,
einen Vertrag mit Petrom SA unterzeichnet hat, um die Erforschung der
Tiefseeabschnitte von Neptun Block an den k&#252;stennahen Gebiete von Rum&#228;nien zu

ExxonMobil und Petrom, die gr&#246;&#223;te rum&#228;nische &#214;l- und Gasgesellschaft und
Mitglied der OMV-Gruppe, stimmten der Kooperation bei einem seismischen
Akquisitions- und Auswertungsprogramm auf 3D-Basis von Neptun Block zu. Petrom

Gelegenheit, diese Erfahrung in einer neuen und viel versprechenden Region
anzuwenden.&#8220; 

Die Tochtergesellschaften von ExxonMobil suchen derzeitig nach

Libyen, Madagaskar, Nigeria, den Philippinen und den Vereinigten Staaten von
Amerika. 

&#8222;Petrom sieht einer Zusammenarbeit mit ExxonMobil mit Freude entgegen&#8220;, so
Johann Pleininger, Mitglied des Vorstandes von Petrom f&#252;r Erforschung und
Entwicklung. &#8222;Dieses gemeinsame Unternehmen mit ExxonMobil ist ein wichtiger
Schritt f&#252;r Petrom zur Erforschung des Potentials an Kohlenwasserstoff im
Schwarzen Meer.&#8220;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 3 (Reuters) - Fresh off strong Black Friday
sales of its XBox 360 videogame consoles, Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) is "cautiously optimistic" about the holiday shopping
season, a senior executive said on Wednesday at the Reuters

for the videogame business, as the economy gets sicker and
people cut back spending even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The video game business is on track to grow 20 percent this
year, Kim said at the summit in New York, but "people are not
projecting that kind of growth" for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Who knows, maybe flat performance will be considered a
remarkable achievement," Kim said. "It's difficult to predict
the future," he said, adding that the gaming industry has
traditionally fared well in economic downturns as people turn
to stay-at-home entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While they may cut back on large purchases like
automobiles or appliances, they're still looking for
entertainment," said the executive, who focuses on strategic
planning and partnerships for Microsoft's interactive
entertainment business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft saw "record-breaking" sales of XBox 360 on the
Black Friday weekend after the U.S. Thanksgiving day, which
marks the start of the holiday shopping season. Sales were up
25 percent compared to last year's Black Friday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The XBox 360 also outsold Sony Corp's (6758.T) Playstation
3 by three units to one, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim said his unit is planning for "tough times" and
assessing where costs could be saved. "A big objective for us
is to deliver most entertainment value for the dollar," he
said.

[STXNEWS/US]
 (Updates to late morning)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday
as news pointing to a deepening recession spurred investors to
buy defensive stocks, including the shares of biotechnology
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of soft-drink maker Coca-Cola (KO.N) rose more than
3 percent, making the stock a top boost to the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) , up 3.3 percent, led
the Nasdaq's advancers as investors bet that the incoming
administration of President-elect Barack Obama might be more
favorable to their prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another standout was hamburger chain McDonald's Corp
(MCD.N), whose shares rose more than 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rise in defensive stocks helped offset concerns sparked
by gloomy corporate outlooks from companies, including mining
company Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc (FCX.N) , which
suspended its dividend, cut its 2009 capital expenditure budget
and slashed its copper output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, ADP Employer Services said before the bell
U.S. private employers slashed the biggest number of jobs in
seven years in November, two days before the release of the
government's unemployment figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The ADP report is part of the reason the market opened
down and why people are moving toward defensive positions,"
said Peter Jankovskis, director of research at OakBrook
Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. "There are people bracing
for the November payrolls report on Friday. We are in a very
nervous market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 101.79 points,
or 1.21 percent, to 8,520.88. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX climbed 11.54 points, or 1.36 percent, to 860.35. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shot up 29.72 points, or 2.05
percent, to 1,479.52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market had rebounded on Tuesday, helped by reassuring
comments from General Electric (GE.N), but with the United
States officially mired in a year-old recession, stocks have
had only isolated rallies that have sputtered out, and the
benchmark Standard  Poor's 500 index is down 42 percent for
the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ADP data offered more evidence of the extent of the
recession, which began a year ago and has been marked by the
housing downturn and rising unemployment. A bleak jobs picture
creates a major headwind as the market attempts to recover from
lows going back nearly 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ADP also bumped up the number of jobs cut in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sentiment was also jolted by a report that showed the vast
services sector contracted further in November, sending the
non-manufacturing sector gauge of the Institute for Supply
Management to a record low. [ID:nN03324601]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides a boost from biotech shares, the Nasdaq also got a
lift from shares of big-cap technology companies after Cisco
Systems Inc (CSCO.O) said it did not plan layoffs at this
point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That reassuring view sent Cisco shares up 3 percent to
$15.78 and helped shares of Research In Motion RIM.TO
RIMM.O reverse an earlier slide triggered by its profit
warning. RIM shares were up 1.2 percent at $37.78 after falling
as low as $35.09 earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But slackening demand sent Freeport 18 percent lower to
$77.77. Aluminum producer Alcoa (AA.N), fell 5 percent to
$9.25

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts expect a tough fourth quarter for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), laden with significant write-downs amid challenging global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quarter will prove to be "ugly" for the companies, J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Kenneth Worthington said and forecast gross write-downs of about $3.5 billion at Goldman Sachs and about $5.5 billion at Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, however, will benefit by about $4 billion due to the widening spread on its own debt, he said. This is more than the $0.5 billion benefit the analyst expects at Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox-Pitt Kelton's David Trone and Merrill Lynch's Guy Moszkowski were the latest to cut their outlook on the two former investment banks, reflecting continued price correction across many asset classes through November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been widely expected to post its first quarterly loss since going public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor market conditions got even worse last month as the U.S. Treasury abandoned its proposal to buy hard-to-trade mortgage securities and other debt from hard-hit banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of the tough operating environment, J.P. Morgan's Worthington said he expects Goldman to perform better in the longer term due to "a superior culture and ability to alter its business mix." He rates the stock "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has numerous attractive investment opportunities including various distressed and underpriced assets, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worthington said he expects Goldman to use any 'bank' acquisition to build high net worth or commercial relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect both GS and MS to be opportunistic in growing their deposit franchises," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE WRTIE-DOWNS, BIG LOSSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past month, several analysts have forecast a loss at Goldman and Morgan Stanley on the back of deteriorating global capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worthington widened his fourth-quarter loss estimate on Goldman to $5.14 per share from 58 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He forecast a loss of 46 cents a share for Morgan Stanley, compared with his previous view of a profit of 28 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, prominent banking analyst Meredith Whitney said U.S. banks will incur about $44 billion in write-downs and loss provisions in the fourth quarter, adding that much of the U.S. Treasury capital will be diverted to plug holes on their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the summer of 2007, Wall Street has been hammered by a sharp pullback in debt markets, which began with mortgage woes and escalated into a credit crisis, slowing economic activity around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox-Pitt's Trone said he now expects Morgan Stanley to write down $2.8 billion in the quarter, compared with his prior estimate of $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill's Moszkowski said, "While it appeared that through October Morgan Stanley could remain profitable, the market decline in credit and mortgage products in November makes this very unlikely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cut his share-price target to $21 from $25, and maintained his "buy" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Morgan Stanley were down 3 percent at $11.66 in morning trade Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Goldman were up 1 percent at $65.69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Neha Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer announced the results of an observational study that showed patients
taking Lipitor&#174; (atorvastatin calcium) had a significant 13 percent reduction in
the relative risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event compared with patients
taking simvastatin (Zocor&#174;) therapy. The patients in this study did not have
evident cardiovascular disease and were newly initiated on either treatment.
This study was performed in conjunction with HealthCore, WellPoint&#8217;s health
outcomes research subsidiary. Results of this study, from one of the largest
U.S. managed care claims databases with more than 219,000 adult patients, were
published in the December issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings. 

The study examined data for patients 18-64 years old who had no prior statin use
or medical claims related to cardiovascular disease in the 12 months preceding
initiation of statin therapy. The average doses in the study were 29 mg of
simvastatin and 17 mg of Lipitor. 

&#8220;Observational data such as this, which reflect the use of medicines in
real-world clinical practice rather than in a controlled trial setting, may help
healthcare providers and managed care companies improve clinical outcomes for
patients,&#8221; said Terry A. Jacobson, Professor of Medicine, Emory University, and
director of the Office of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Grady Health
Systems. &#8220;The data suggests that statins with greater potency may result in
greater cardiovascular risk reductions. Economic assessments should be performed
to determine the potential impact of this study on cost of care to patients.&#8221; 

In addition to the significant reduction in the risk of overall cardiovascular
events, individual event rates of secondary endpoints, first heart attack and
hospitalizations for heart failure, were significantly lower for patients
initiating Lipitor compared with patients initiating simvastatin. There was no
significant difference between the groups for the secondary endpoints of stroke,
revascularization surgery or peripheral vascular disease. 

&#8220;This latest analysis adds to the wealth of real-world data from a number of
different medical database analyses that suggest that patients who are treated
with Lipitor may have a reduced risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event
compared with patients who use simvastatin,&#8221; said Dr. Michael Berelowitz, senior
vice president of Pfizer&#8217;s global medical division. &#8220;Findings such as these
should be taken into account by those who may assume that medicines in a
therapeutic class are interchangeable and provide similar outcomes.&#8221; 

As with all observational studies, the study is subject to certain limitations
and the findings should be regarded as hypothesis generating. 

About the study

This is one of the largest observational studies to date to examine
cardiovascular outcomes in patients without clinically evident cardiovascular
disease treated with different statins in routine clinical practice. 

The retrospective analysis examined administrative claims for statin
prescriptions filed between January, 2003 and December, 2005. The longer mean
treatment duration of patients who took Lipitor versus simvastatin (nine and
seven months, respectively) might have impacted the difference in cardiovascular
event reduction. 

A cardiovascular event was defined as the first inpatient or emergency room
admission for heart disease, heart attack, angina (chest pain), certain heart
surgeries, peripheral vascular disease, aortic aneurysm (swelling of the aorta),
stroke and transient ischemic attack. 

Since patients were not randomly assigned to each group, the two treatment arms
were adjusted based on certain risk factors, such as age, gender and
co-morbidities, and statistical adjustments were used to address residual
imbalances. LDL values prior to and after treatment were only available for
approximately five percent of the patients and this was not adjusted for in the
analysis. 

The results of this study complement the large body of evidence from multiple
clinical trials demonstrating the cardiovascular benefits of Lipitor in patients
without heart disease and are in alignment with findings from previously
published observational studies. 

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

Lipitor is a prescription medication. It is used in patients with multiple risk
factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low
HDL (&#8220;good&#8221; cholesterol) or smoking to reduce the risk of a heart attack,
stroke, certain types of heart surgery and chest pain. 

Lipitor is also used in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least one other
risk factor for heart disease such as high blood pressure, smoking or
complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce
the risk of heart attack and stroke. 

Lipitor is used in patients with existing coronary heart disease to reduce the
risk of heart attack, stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery, hospitalization
for heart failure, and chest pain. 

When diet and exercise alone are not enough, Lipitor is used along with a
low-fat diet and exercise to lower cholesterol. 

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant. 

Patients taking Lipitor should tell their doctors if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctors about all medications they take. This may
help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. The most
common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain and heartburn. They tend
to be mild and often go away.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank cut their
price targets on General Electric Co (GE.N), citing a tough
credit market and a weak economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We expect GE's earnings to decline more than peers in 2009
due to the impact of the continuing downturn in global credit
markets on GE's Capital business," Goldman analyst Terry
Darling said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He cut his price target on the conglomerate's stock to $18
from $23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We no longer anticipate a sharp recovery in 2010 earnings
as we expect improving GECS (GE Capital Services) earnings to
be offset by deteriorating shipments in GE's late cycle
infrastructure businesses where orders likely begin to soften
by the second half of 2009," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, the global bellwether said it expects
fourth-quarter earnings to be at the low end of its prior
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE also said it would scale back its hefty finance arm and
cut jobs across a range of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank analyst Nigel Coe cut his price target on the
stock to $18 from $22 to reflect rapid deterioration in global
capital-goods fundamentals and the likelihood that tight credit
markets will constrict demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coe said GE Capital earnings outlook will suffer from its
decision to shrink assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coe said there is much concern that GE Capital may require
further equity funding and kept his "hold" rating on the GE
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rapid deterioration in end-market fundamentals means
that GE can no longer deliver double-digit earnings industrial
growth, he wrote in a note dated Dec. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE shares closed at $17.61 Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Deepwater Neptun Block To Be Evaluated
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today its affiliate, ExxonMobil
Exploration and Production Romania Limited, has signed an agreement with Petrom
SA to help explore deepwater portions of the Neptun Block offshore Romania. The
Petrom agreement is ExxonMobil&#8217;s second major exploration venture announced in
the promising Black Sea in two weeks. 

ExxonMobil and Petrom, the largest Romanian oil and gas company and a member of
the OMV group, agreed to cooperate on a 3D seismic acquisition and evaluation
program of the Neptun Block. Petrom will operate the initial work program.
ExxonMobil will help fund the work program and provide expertise in evaluating
the deepwater seismic data. 

&#8220;We are pleased to assist Petrom in its Romanian offshore exploration program,&#8221;
said Elwyn C. Griffiths, Vice President, Business Development, ExxonMobil
Exploration Company. &#8220;ExxonMobil has considerable expertise in all facets of
deepwater exploration and we see this as an opportunity to apply that experience
in a new and promising region.&#8221; 

ExxonMobil affiliates are currently exploring for hydrocarbons in deepwater
locations around the world, including offshore Angola, Brazil, Canada,
Greenland, Indonesia, Ireland, Libya, Madagascar, Nigeria, The Philippines and

back more than 100 years. Operations have included oil production and refining,
and marketing of lubricants.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 3 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities said it was moving
to a more cautious stance on the European integrated oil sector
after the sector's outperformance in the last two months, and
it cut its price targets on seven oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The sector has outperformed the broader market by 19
percent since early October because of its defensive qualities
and the relative safety of the majors' dividends, the brokerage
said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In our view, the dividend trade -- where investors have
been buying the oils as 'bond proxies' -- has now been fully
played out, leaving little room for further outperformance," JP
Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price target changes reflect a cut to the brokerage's
crude oil price assumption for 2009 to $69 per barrel from $75,
it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While companies' balance sheets could support current oil
prices, the brokerage said, most of them would have to use up
much of their cash and start drawing on committed credit lines
to defend dividends and capital spending at oil prices around
$40 to $50 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said BG Group (BG.L) remained its top pick
because of its good volume growth, strong management, liquefied
natural gas profitability and valuation upside from offshore
Brazil exploration and production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it remained positive on StatoilHydro
(STL.OL) and Galp Energia (GALP.LS) while it was cautious on
OMV (OMVV.VI), Repsol (REP.MC) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the list of the price target changes, please

&lt;p&gt;Dec 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) Whitehall
family of real estate investment funds has been hit by the
property downturn and could post big losses on some investments
made at the market peak, the Wall Street Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Whitehall, best known for buying New York's Rockefeller
Center in 1996, has marked the equity value of the $4.8 billion
Whitehall 2007 fund to about 50 cents on the dollar, the paper
said, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The funds will likely struggle to make a profit on deals
such as its purchase of the Stratosphere, a Las Vegas casino, in
2008 and a string of hotel deals in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Whitehall funds have invested in a Manhattan development
site and numerous other properties that have all likely dropped
in value as prices for commercial real estate have fallen,
according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problems in Whitehall reflect those in Goldman, which is
on track to lose about $2 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter,
the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, some of Goldman's writedowns will come from its
investments in real estate, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not believe that the firm's transition to a
bank-holding company will have an impact on the firm's strategy,
including our real-estate activity," a bank spokeswoman told the
paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman could not be immediately reached for a comment by
Reuters.

&lt;p&gt; (recasts first paragraph, adds analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Dec 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O),
in its continuing push to compete in the critical area of
Internet search, tapped on Thursday a former senior Yahoo Inc
(YHOO.O) executive, Qi Lu, to head its online services group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software giant, which tried and failed to buy Yahoo
earlier this year, is looking to revamp its online search
strategy to better compete with the industry juggernaut, Google
Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said recently it does not want to buy Yahoo any
more, although it has left open the possibility of a search
deal with the company. Lu, who was responsible for development
of the Web search and monetization platforms at Yahoo, left the
company in August after 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internet search is seen as a crucial growth area for
Microsoft, as more and more software and services migrate from
computer desktops online. Google has parlayed its dominance as
the search engine leader into products that compete directly
with Microsoft, such as e-mail and online word processing and
spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst with Collins Stewart, noted
that Lu is the second high-profile former Yahoo search
executive to join Microsoft recently, with the first being Sean
Suchter. Microsoft's plans seem clear, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is recognizing that with their in house talent

highlights that if the Microsoft-Yahoo search deal happens, and
we believe it is very likely, a knowledge transfer will help
Microsoft to better prepare for a future transition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lu will begin work at Microsoft in January and report

advertiser and publisher solutions group, which will be
overseen by Lu in his new role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McAndrews, along with Microsoft online services group

have been candidates for the job that was given to Lu, Aggarwal
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft closed at

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York judge on Thursday dismissed a $2.5 billion lawsuit that challenged JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) purchase of Bear Stearns Cos, concluding that company officials acted appropriately in avoiding a "potentially cataclysmic" bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice Herman Cahn of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected claims by former Bear shareholders that the company's directors acted in bad faith in agreeing to a $10-per-share buyout, rather than holding out for a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also found in the consolidated class-action case that the plaintiffs failed to show that JPMorgan conspired with Bear's board, or "dominated" Bear's daily operations to such a degree that the merger became a foregone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear's board tried "to preserve some shareholder value while averting the uncertainty of a bankruptcy -- an event with potentially cataclysmic consequences for the broader economy as well as for shareholders," Cahn wrote in a 44-page ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said the fallout from letting Bear fail, and perhaps liquidate, "justified the inclusion of various merger protection provisions intended to increase the certainty of the consummation of the transaction with JPMorgan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately return calls seeking comment. JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear was forced to sell itself in a buyout arranged by the U.S. Federal Reserve after fleeing clients led to a liquidity crunch that drove the 85-year-old investment bank to the brink of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan originally agreed on March 16 to pay just $2 per share for Bear, but quintupled the price a week later after Bear shareholders objected. It was also allowed to take an immediate 39.5 percent stake in Bear, making it virtually impossible for unhappy shareholders to mount opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roughly $1.5 billion buyout closed on May 30, and the Fed agreed to backstop $29 billion in potential losses on Bear's balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cahn separately rejected the plaintiffs' claims that Jamie Dimon abused his dual role as JPMorgan's chief executive and as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in connection with the buyout talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dimon's alleged control (or even 'domination') of the negotiations is irrelevant to JPMorgan's aiding and abetting liability because the only pertinent inquiry is whether the independence of Bear Stearns' board was compromised," the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by Gary Hill and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp tapped on Thursday a former senior Yahoo Inc executive, Qi Lu, to head its online services group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software giant, which tried and failed to buy Yahoo earlier this year, is looking to revamp its search-ad strategy to better compete with the industry juggernaut, Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also has decided it does not want to buy Yahoo any more, although it has left open the possibility of a search deal with the company. Lu, who was responsible for development of the Web search and monetization platforms at Yahoo, left the company in August after 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will begin work at Microsoft in January and report directly to Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft hired Sean Suchter, another former Yahoo search executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said Brian McAndrews, the former CEO of aQuantive, which the company acquired last year for $6 billion, is leaving the company.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A shareholder lawsuit against the
merger of JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and the crippled
investment bank Bear Stearns Cos was dismissed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit sought damages from JPMorgan and former
directors of Bear Stearns, and asked that the federally
arranged merger be set aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Justice Herman Cahn of the New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan found that the Bear directors acted in good faith
in agreeing to a $10-per-share takeover. He found that their
efforts to "preserve some shareholder value while averting the
uncertainty of a bankruptcy" were warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a 44-page ruling, the justice also found that the
plaintiffs in the class-action case failed to show that
JPMorgan conspired with Bear's board or otherwise "dominated
Bear Stearns' daily operations" to such a degree that the
merger became a foregone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs included former Bear shareholders who
contended that the $10-per-share takeover price was too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lawyer for the plaintiffs and a JPMorgan representative
did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit is one of many spurred by the demise of Bear
Stearns earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The merger was arranged by the Federal Reserve, which
agreed to backstop $29 billion of losses that JPMorgan could
incur from taking on Bear's balance sheet. JPMorgan completed
the purchase on May 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds price on Goldman bonds, background on spreads)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 4 (Reuters) - Corporate bond research firm
Gimme Credit recommended buying Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
bonds in a research note on Thursday, saying the bank's fourth
quarter results, expected to be a $2 billion loss, have already
been priced into the bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gimme Credit analyst Kathleen Shanley also wrote that
Goldman bondholders "are feeling somewhat more comfortable
about Goldman's prospects than its shareholders, considering
the helping hand the firm has received."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's 6.15 percent notes due April 2018 traded
Wednesday at 599 basis points over comparable Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spread premium, which measures perceived credit risk,
on Goldman Sachs bonds have widened substantially over
benchmark Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shanley told Reuters Wednesday's spreads, while not as high
as the 676 basis points spread after Lehman Brothers went
bankrupt in September, "remain very wide by historical norms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in her note, Shanley argues those spreads could "could
tighten in coming months as financial markets begin to
stabilize."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The help Goldman has received in recent months includes
getting fast-tracked to become a bank holding company rather
than an investment bank; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
Inc's (BRKa.N) $5 billion investment; and a $10 billion
investment from the U.S. government under the TARP program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is set to announce its fourth quarter results on
Dec. 16 and report sharp losses driven by falling prices for a
wide range of equity and fixed-income assets.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW BEDFORD, MA, Dec 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Reynolds DeWalt Corporation, a leader in  cross-media communications, has
received G7 Master Printer status from the International Digital
Enterprise Alliance (IDEAlliance), the global leader in developing,
educating, and validating best practices in media, publishing, and
information technology. Reynolds DeWalt is one of just 300 companies
worldwide -- and the only one in Southeastern Massachusetts -- to achieve
the distinction.

    G7 Master status identifies printing companies, prepress service
providers, and agencies that have been trained to use the G7
Proof-to-Print Process, a calibration method that allows printers to
reliably achieve a close visual match from proof to press. Earning the
qualification signifies that a company uses the most modern technology
and techniques required to ensure color fidelity throughout the printing
process.

    "Achieving G7 Master status only affirms our dedication and desire to
follow the highest standards of the printing process to ensure the highest
quality product for our clients," said Peter DeWalt, president of Reynolds
DeWalt. "We commend our employees who pride themselves on their
uncompromised collaboration, unrivaled innovation, and reckless
imagination. With our new G7 certification, Reynolds DeWalt hopes to serve
its current and potential clients more successfully."

    "Through implementing G7 standards, Reynolds DeWalt will offer clients a
much more accurate representation of color from the proof through
production stages and will deliver consistency from production run to
production run and from facility to facility," added Scott Dubois, Vice
President of Cross-Media Services &amp; Marketing.

    Reynolds DeWalt's achievement of the G7 Master status followed three weeks
of intensive review by a G7 expert consultant, who measured and tested the
company's presses and evaluated their proofing system against known G7
standards. To maintain their G7 Master status, Reynolds DeWalt will
undergo a yearly re-qualification.

    Reynolds DeWalt is a leader in cross-media communications with services
that include brand development, business communication and collateral,
interactive media, and multi-channel campaigns. It is able to deploy its
services across geographical boundaries and time zones while assuring
close coordination with clients throughout the entire process. Family
owned and operated since 1948, Reynolds DeWalt provides a refreshing
alternative, combining a history of innovation with a commitment to
personal service and relationships.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, updates with more work planned)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 4 (Reuters) - Longer than expected emergency
repairs and upcoming planned work at Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N)
150,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Torrance, California,
boosted Los Angeles wholesale gasoline differentials 7.25 cents
per gallon on Thursday, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said on Thursday morning it had restarted units,
which sources have identified as the 100,000 bpd
gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracker and a coker, that
were shut on Monday for emergency repairs at the Los
Angeles-area refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon had hoped to have the units back in service by late
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has declined to identify the units shut on Monday,
but said they were ramping up to full production on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Thursday, Exxon warned Los Angeles pollution
regulators of planned flaring at the Torrance refinery
beginning on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokeswoman said the flaring would be due to
planned work expected to last four days on an unidentified unit
that would have minimal impact on production at the refinery.
The unit was not scheduled to be shut for the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to the emergency repairs done this week, the
Torrance refinery is doing on-going work to other coking units
at the refinery, sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said gasoline blended to meet California's strict
environmental standards sold at 6.5 cents per gallon under
NYMEX January RBOB gasoline on Thursday. It finished at 13.75
cents under RBOB on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details throughout, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUITO Dec 4 (Reuters) - An arbitration court in The Hague
will hear Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) claims that Ecuador breached
an oil contract more than a decade ago and should pay $1.6
billion in damages, the company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After years of trying to resolve the case in Ecuador
courts, Chevron said in a statement that the Permanent Court
for Arbitration in The Hague had confirmed jurisdiction over
the claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ecuadorean courts have continually delayed, refused to
rule, or ruled unjustly on seven commercial claims that Texaco
Petroleum filed against Ecuador between 1991 and 1993," Chevron
said in the statement, referring to its Texaco unit that once
operated in Ecuador. Chevron does not have any current
contracts with Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ecuadorean officials were not available to comment. 
However, the government has said that Chevron has filed claims
against Ecuador as a way of undermining a civil case in a local
court that seeks $27 billion in compensation for environmental
damage in the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, which peasants and Indians in Ecuador brought
in the early 1990s, contends that Texaco, which Chevron bought
in 2001, polluted the jungle and damaged their health by
dumping 18 billion gallons (68 billion liters) of contaminated
water from 1972 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has questioned the recommendation of a court expert
who said the company should pay up to $27 billion for
environmental damages. The plaintiffs said they expect a final
ruling on the case in 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Total Will Exceed $65 Billion

Bank already has increased commitments 33% this year to critically important
segments
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase announced today that it plans to lend an additional $5 billion to
non-profit and health care companies, higher-education institutions and
government units over the next year. That will bring the total commitments to
more than $65 billion. 

Already this year, JPMorgan Chase has increased its loan commitments 33 percent
to the segments from 2007. 

&#8220;These capital-intensive industries have faced tremendous challenges this year
when the auction-rate securities market shut down and then the fixed-rate loan
market froze up," said Todd Maclin, chief executive officer of Commercial
Banking at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. "We have expanded and will continue to expand
our lending to existing clients while beginning new relationships with others.
Lending to these organizations helps both them and our communities.&#8221; 

The firm continues to maintain disciplined lending standards, seeking to provide
the right mix and level of financing to meet a business' needs. 

A $900 million children's hospital

JPMorgan Chase provided the right prescription for a $900 million replacement of
Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago. The new 288-bed facility will support
1,100 pediatric specialists in more than 70 specialties. By the time ground was
broken in April of 2008, Children's Memorial had completed a $552 million bond
issue -- with both fixed and variable debt. Chase's Commercial Bank provided a
$196 million mixed-use credit facility in support of the variable-rate bonds. 

"Chase's bankers helped us get this enormous project out of the ground during a
time of financial turmoil," said Paula Noble, the hospital&#8217;s chief financial
officer. "We will be able to improve our research, take advantage of new
technologies, recruit more staff and, most importantly, help more children." 

The new facility is expected to open in 2012. 

A touchdown for new NFL stadium

The new Lucas Oil Stadium for the Indianapolis Colts football team was completed
just a few months ago. Earlier in the year, the Indiana Finance Authority
decided to replace the auction-rate securities that were issued to fund the
project with liquidity-backed, variable-rate demand bonds. Chase led a syndicate
of four banks that provided the liquidity required to complete the financing
plan &#8212; and provided $250 million of the $625 million line itself. 

The Authority sees the new stadium as an engine for economic development in
Indiana and was very appreciative of Chase's partnership. 

Chase Commercial Banking provides a range of services, including banking and
investment services and cash management, to companies with annual sales of
roughly $10 million to $2 billion. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan provides a full range
of targeted solutions and global expertise in capital markets, asset management
and retirement solutions. Together, the teams of dedicated and experienced
specialists identify client objectives to deliver tailored financial solutions
designed to help public sector, health care and non-profit clients better serve
their constituents. 

Through its expanded lending in 2008 and continued growth in 2009, JPMorgan
Chase will:

* Extend credit to entities that have or will have a significant banking
relationship with the firm 
* Seek opportunities to help clients manage through the economic turmoil in ways
that will benefit their communities and the economy 
* Maintain the current disciplined underwriting standards and hold limits

&lt;p&gt;Supporting Women in Business Most Effective Way To Grow Economy
N&#8217;DJAMENA, Chad--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil and Africare announced today that they have commenced work on a $1.75
million three-year project designed to empower rural women in southern Chad by
developing their entrepreneurial capacity in small business development and
income generation projects, obtaining micro-credit, and accessing markets. The
project will be the largest single contribution to-date under the ExxonMobil
Foundation&#8217;s Educating Women and Girls Initiative for a women's economic
development project. 

&#8220;We launched the Educating Women and Girls Initiative because an extensive body
of research demonstrated that expanding education and resources for women and
girls is one of the most effective ways to promote health and economic
development,&#8221; said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer, Exxon
Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). &#8220;As one of the largest direct foreign investors in
Africa, ExxonMobil understands it makes sense to foster economic growth and
improve health on the continent. It is good for our employees, our neighbors and
our customers.&#8221; 

The goal of the project in Chad is to strengthen the capacity of women&#8217;s
associations to initiate priority income-generating enterprises, increase access
to micro-credit and train rural women in entrepreneurship, financial management
and marketing skills. This project exemplifies the Educating Women and Girls
Initiative's focus on providing women with the training, access to financial
resources and support structures to improve their economic livelihoods and
strengthen economic development in the communities where ExxonMobil does
business. 

Mr. Julius E. Coles, president of Africare, expressed his sincere appreciation
to ExxonMobil for the company&#8217;s generous contribution to this important project,
which will change the lives of so many women and communities in Doba and
Bebedija Districts in southern Chad. &#8220;As a grassroots, community-led
organization, Africare will work in partnership with women and communities to
promote profitable enterprises and products that ensure continued income
security for the participating women entrepreneurs. It is anticipated that the
income generated from these economic units will be used to support the women&#8217;s
families and to be further invested in business,&#8221; he said. 

Stephane de Mahieu, general manager for ExxonMobil affiliate Esso Exploration
and Production Chad, Inc., said, &#8220;We are pleased to support this ambitious
project, which will have a positive impact on the lives of the women in and
around the oil field development area. ExxonMobil has a long history of working
with Africare and I look forward to doing so in Chad for the benefit of the
local communities.&#8221; 

One hundred women&#8217;s associations will be assisted, benefiting approximately
2,500 women, many of whom head households. These women have either never
attended or dropped out of school, lack employment opportunities, or have few
economic assets. Examples of business enterprises the rural women will establish
are bread baking, tailoring, cheese production, grain milling and arts and
crafts. 

Chad ranks 171 out of 177 in the 2006 United Nations Human Development Index and
more than three quarters of the population lives on less than one dollar per
day. Studies confirm that programs directed at educating women and girls yield a
higher rate of return than any other community investment available in the
developing world. Educated women are healthier and less likely to die in
childbirth than women with little or no schooling. The children of educated
mothers are more likely to have better nutrition and immunization rates and to
live longer and healthier lives. Educating women and girls has also been shown
to help improve sanitation, prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, and improve
household incomes and economic growth. 

About Africare

Africare is a leading non-profit organization specializing in African
development and aid. It is also the oldest and largest African-American led
organization in that field. Since its founding in 1970, Africare has delivered

&lt;p&gt;  CHICAGO, IL, Dec 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
With the help of IBM (NYSE: IBM), Merge Healthcare (NASDAQ: MRGE) is
providing doctors, radiologists and other medical professionals easier
access to medical images including x-rays, MRIs and CT scans. Medical
professionals can now view medical images using a mobile device or desktop
computer without waiting for medical imaging films, accessing a
specialized system or downloading cumbersome files. Merge Healthcare's
new technology can help medical professionals quickly view emergency
cases, consult with colleagues and forward critical findings.

    Merge Healthcare is making this technology breakthrough possible with
Cedara WebAccess(TM), a new solution created with the help of software
from IBM.

    Announced in conjunction with the Radiological Society of North America
conference in Chicago this week, the first applications based on Cedara
WebAccess will include systems that deliver medical images to an iPhone
or iPod touch, physician portals and other web-based solutions that
promise to decrease the medical profession's reliance on traditional
image delivery methods.

    Although healthcare professionals have invested in ways to expedite access
to medical images and reduce waste associated with paper reports and film,
today's imaging requires specialized systems or computers that can
accommodate large file downloads. Merge Healthcare's Cedara WebAccess
technology furthers this initiative by eliminating the need for
specialized systems and additional computer storage capacity.

    Breakthroughs in medical technology are achieved every day. To remain
competitive, medical device manufactures and services providers must react
quickly with new products. These companies rely on Merge Healthcare to
provide everything from essential software and development platforms, to
custom product development initiatives. Over the past 20 years, Merge
Healthcare's OEM division has developed software and systems for some of
the world's leading providers of medical imaging products and services.

    To manage these development efforts, Merge Healthcare uses two of IBM's
software change and configuration management products, IBM Telelogic
Synergy and IBM Telelogic Change. The relationship with IBM allows Merge
Healthcare to simplify the process of managing changes throughout the
life of software products and helps get the greatest value out of the
software they develop. With their unifying central change and release
management repository, Telelogic Synergy and Change ensure that all
processes for the development and delivery of software can be defined,
implemented, automated, visualized and managed collaboratively.

    According to Merge Healthcare OEM Division President Toni Wells, the
communication and management capabilities of the IBM software products
allow Merge Healthcare to maintain the product integrity, regulatory
compliance and time-to-market needs its customers demand. "The medical
field is highly dependent on software, which significantly enhances
delivery of patient care. Merge Healthcare OEM provides our customers with
the software functionality that differentiates their products from their
competitors," Wells explains. "We rely on Telelogic Synergy and Telelogic
Change to manage the complexity of the software we develop, and to ensure
that our global development teams operate as one, for the best result to
our customers. This software from IBM is part of our livelihood. It's our
DNA."

    About Merge Healthcare

    Merge Healthcare's solutions solve mission-critical issues for radiology
practices, outpatient imaging centers, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies
and device manufacturers worldwide. For additional information, visit

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
An integrated series of solutions will be required to manage increases in global
energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions that will result from population
growth and economic expansion, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) said today,
releasing the corporation&#8217;s Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030.

&#8220;The world needs to meet the ever-growing need for reliable and affordable
energy while minimizing the effects on the environment,&#8221; said Rex W. Tillerson,
chairman and chief executive officer. 

&#8220;ExxonMobil welcomes increased public discussion about how best to meet
economic, energy and environmental challenges and hopes this expanded Outlook
for Energy can be useful in increasing understanding of the challenges and
alternative solutions.&#8221; 

The Outlook for Energy is developed annually, and is the product of an ongoing
process that has been conducted over decades. The results are used to assist
ExxonMobil's business planning and to increase public understanding of the
world's energy needs and challenges. The outlook is developed through a detailed
analysis of approximately 100 countries, 15 demand sectors and 20 fuel types and
is underpinned by economic and population projections and expectations of
significant energy efficiency improvements and technology advancements. 

This year&#8217;s Outlook for Energy has been expanded to include a new section,
entitled the Energy Imperative, which contains a detailed examination of
integrated solutions that include improved energy efficiency, development of all
viable forms of energy, and technology and public policy options to manage
climate risk. 

As well, the report outlines ExxonMobil&#8217;s proactive approach to managing the
risks posed by rising greenhouse gas emissions and the corporation&#8217;s role in
reducing its own emissions as well as assisting consumers of hydrocarbon-based
fuels in reducing their emissions. 

Among this year&#8217;s findings:

* Driven by growing populations and expanding economies, global energy demand is
expected to increase by an average 1.2 percent per year between in 2005 and
2030, even assuming significant gains in energy efficiency. Global demand is
expected to increase 35 percent from the equivalent of 229 million barrels of
oil per day in 2005 to the equivalent of 310 million barrels per day in 2030.
This forecast is down slightly from the 2007 Outlook, which projected a 1.3
percent average annual growth rate. The changes are spread across various demand
sectors and reflect improved energy efficiency. 
* Oil, gas and coal will continue to provide the vast majority of the world&#8217;s
energy needs -- meeting close to 80 percent of global demand through 2030 -- due
to their abundance, affordability and availability. Nuclear energy will grow, as
emphasis on low-carbon fuels increases. Renewable fuels, such as wind, solar and
biofuels, will also grow rapidly. 
* Power generation will be the largest and fastest-growing energy-demand sector
through 2030. China, which today meets almost 90 percent of its power needs with
coal, will see its energy demand for power generation more than double by 2030,
surpassing U.S. demand by more than one-third. 
* Transportation, currently responsible for more than half of total oil demand,
is expected to grow substantially. From 2005 to 2030, demand in developed
countries is expected to be relatively stable, as increases in the number of
vehicles are offset by significant efficiency improvements. In contrast, demand
in developing countries is likely to more than double as economies grow and
rising prosperity enables a dramatic increase in personal vehicles. 
* Global carbon-dioxide emissions are projected to rise by close to 30 percent
between 2005 and 2030 even with improved energy efficiency and growth in nuclear
and renewable energy sources. While carbon-dioxide emissions are expected to
begin declining in the United States and Europe over the period to 2030, those
declines will be more than offset by larger increases in developing countries.
For example, by 2030, China is expected to have CO2 emissions comparable to the
United States and Europe combined.

&#8220;Providing affordable energy to meet growing demand is one of the world&#8217;s
foremost challenges in the next 20 years," said Tillerson. "We must invest in
the production of existing fuel sources, develop new sources of energy and
create new technologies that will reduce the environmental footprint of energy
production and use.&#8221;

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: This press release includes forward-looking statements.
Actual future conditions, including growth in energy demand, energy supply mix,
energy efficiency, and carbon-dioxide emissions could differ materially due to
changes in rates of economic growth; changes in technology; the development of
new energy supply sources; political events; demographic changes; and other
factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the
"Investors" section of our website (www.exxonmobil.com) and in Item 1A of our
most recent Form 10-K.

&lt;p&gt;  MOSCOW, Dec 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and leading power equipment manufacturer, ABB, have
signed a three-year contract for hosting services for ABB's SAP
information system in Russia.

    ABB chose to partner with IBM to meet its 24/7 system availability
requirements. As part of the hosting agreement, IBM will provide the
hardware and software to keep ABB's SAP information system in Russia up
and running, design and deploy the SAP system landscape and help ensure
day-to-day system operation and back-up. The solution will be based on
high-performance IBM System x servers and IBM System Storage DS4700 and
TS3200 tape library.

    "An increasing number of companies like ABB are turning to IBM to manage
their IT functions as the result of increasingly complex IT systems and
the need for high-quality services that meet regulatory requirements. The
contract with IBM will help ABB to optimize IT costs, and concentrate on
its core business, while scaling up to meet future business
requirements," explains Anton Myakishev, Manager of Business Continuity
and Hosting, IBM Russia.

    "ABB's substantial growth in Russia has resulted in a gradual
transformation of its business model. ABB's business today calls for 24/7
support. By outsourcing our SAP infrastructure and maintenance to a
highly qualified partner such as IBM, we will increase the availability
and reliability of the system, while also reducing costs compared to
in-house support. In addition, our in-house IT experts will now be
available to focus on other areas that require a more profound
understanding of the company's business," comments Vladimir Shevchenko,
CIO, ABB.

    The IBM contract was signed in October 2008.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is cautiously optimistic about holiday sales of its XBox 360 game console, but even flat sales in 2009 could be remarkable for the video game industry, a senior executive said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gaming industry is on track to grow 20 percent in 2008, said Shane Kim, vice president of strategy and business development for Microsoft's video game business. But, he added, "people are not projecting that kind of growth" for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're still cautiously optimistic as we enter full bore into the holiday season," Kim told the Reuters Media Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported a record-breaking 25 percent jump in sales of the XBox 360 on Black Friday weekend after the U.S. Thanksgiving day, which marks the start of the holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hopefully that momentum will continue," he said, adding that the XBox 360 also outsold Sony Corp's (6758.T) Playstation 3 by three units to one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kim noted that while the gaming industry has traditionally fared well in economic downturns as people turn to stay-at-home entertainment, it was difficult to predict what would happen this recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who knows, maybe flat performance will be considered a remarkable achievement," Kim said, declining to give a projection for 2009 growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim said his unit is planning for "tough times" and assessing where costs could be saved: "A big objective for us is to deliver most entertainment value for the dollar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While (consumers) may cut back on large purchases like automobiles or appliances, they're still looking for entertainment," said the executive, who focuses on strategic planning and partnerships for Microsoft's interactive entertainment business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft's interactive business unit will pursue more partnerships, such as the recent tie-up with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), and that it remains open to acquiring competitors to expand its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim also expects consolidation to continue among video game publishers, especially smaller companies that are looking to develop hit games even as they cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a number of mid-tier publishers behind the Electronic Arts ERTS.O and Ubisofts (UBIP.PA) and Activisions (ATVI.O) of the world who are struggling," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim is seeing somewhat of a return to compelling video games developed by smaller publishers, which could reduce the industry's dependence on sequels of blockbuster hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naysayers believe expensive gaming consoles like XBox will be rendered obsolete as gamers move to the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kim said, "This console generation will have a long life cycle. I think it's way premature to say there will never be another XBox." He added, however, that it takes a company significant investment to make a new box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very risky proposition to do something like that, let alone an expensive one," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Tiffany Wu and Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Anupreeta Das and Franklin Paul&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
cautiously optimistic about holiday sales of its XBox 360 game
console, but even flat sales in 2009 could be remarkable for
the video game industry, a senior executive said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gaming industry is on track to grow 20 percent in 2008,
said Shane Kim, vice president of strategy and business
development for Microsoft's video game business. But, he added,
"people are not projecting that kind of growth" for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're still cautiously optimistic as we enter full bore
into the holiday season," Kim told the Reuters Media Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft reported a record-breaking 25 percent jump in
sales of the XBox 360 on Black Friday weekend after the U.S.
Thanksgiving day, which marks the start of the holiday shopping
season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Hopefully that momentum will continue," he said, adding
that the XBox 360 also outsold Sony Corp's (6758.T) Playstation
3 by three units to one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Kim noted that while the gaming industry has
traditionally fared well in economic downturns as people turn
to stay-at-home entertainment, it was difficult to predict what
would happen this recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Who knows, maybe flat performance will be considered a
remarkable achievement," Kim said, declining to give a
projection for 2009 growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim said his unit is planning for "tough times" and
assessing where costs could be saved: "A big objective for us
is to deliver most entertainment value for the dollar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While (consumers) may cut back on large purchases like
automobiles or appliances, they're still looking for
entertainment," said the executive, who focuses on strategic
planning and partnerships for Microsoft's interactive
entertainment business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Microsoft's interactive business unit will pursue
more partnerships, such as the recent tie-up with Netflix Inc
(NFLX.O), and that it remains open to acquiring competitors to
expand its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim also expects consolidation to continue among video game
publishers, especially smaller companies that are looking to
develop hit games even as they cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are a number of mid-tier publishers behind the
Electronic Arts ERTS.O and Ubisofts (UBIP.PA) and Activisions

significant investment to make a new box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a very risky proposition to do something like that,
let alone an expensive one," he said.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
CRA International, Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAI): 

Agreement is One of Largest-Ever Antitrust Settlements in the U.S.

CRA International, Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAI), a worldwide leader in providing
economic, financial, and management consulting services, today announced that
the Company assisted counsel for Discover Financial Services with economic
antitrust analysis pertaining to a lawsuit seeking damages from Visa Inc. and
MasterCard Inc. for practices that suppressed third-party issuing on the
Discover Network and the acceptance of its cards. On October 27, 2008, Discover
announced that it had reached a $2.75 billion settlement agreement with Visa and
MasterCard in the third largest reported antitrust settlement in U.S. history. 

In October 2004, Discover filed a damages suit following the conclusion of a
Department of Justice lawsuit, which determined that by barring banks from
issuing cards on the Discover Network, Visa and MasterCard violated antitrust
laws. After four years, Visa and MasterCard agreed to settle the Discover suit
on the night before the trial was to begin. 

CRA International had been retained by Constantine Cannon and Kirkland &amp; Ellis
LLP to assist in analyzing the anti-competitive effects of the rules of Visa and
MasterCard in prohibiting their member banks from issuing Discover credit and
debit cards. CRA supported Discover&#8217;s expert economist, Professor Jerry A.
Hausman,MacDonald Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge, MA, and a CRA Senior Consultant. The CRA teamundertook
economic analyses of market definition, market power, and the impacts of Visa&#8217;s
and MasterCard&#8217;s rules on competition in the provision of credit and debit card
network services. CRA also analyzed the monetary damages to Discover. This
analysis contributed to determining the $2.75 billion settlement amount. 

Jeffrey Shinder, co-lead counsel for Discover Financial Services and managing
partner of Constantine Cannon&#8217;s New York office, said, "CRA's analysis was
invaluable to our case and helped us achieve one of the largest antitrust
settlements in U.S. history. We are extraordinarily satisfied with CRA's
economic analysis, as well as their depth of knowledge of the payments industry.
CRA contributed with great teamwork and with the depth and skill of its
economists." 

&#8220;Our consultants are regularly tapped by leading companies seeking economic
antitrust expertise,&#8221; said James C. Burrows, CRA&#8217;s President and Chief Executive
Officer. &#8220;We are pleased that our economic antitrust analysis in this matter
produced a positive result for our client.&#8221; 

CRA&#8217;s work in this matter was directed by Craig Romaine, CRA Vice President, and
Dr. Steven C. Salop, CRA Senior Consultant and Professor of Economics and Law at
the Georgetown University Law Center. Other key CRA senior staff assisting in
this effort included&#160;Spencer Graf, Stephen Kletter, and&#160;Mary Beth Savio.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM), Virtual Bridges and Canonical today announced general
availability of a Linux-desktop solution designed to drive significant
savings compared with Microsoft-desktop software by amplifying Lotus
collaboration software and Ubuntu to a larger user base through
virtualization.

    This solution runs open standards-based email, word processing,
spreadsheets, unified communication, social networking and other software
to any laptop, browser, or mobile device from a virtual desktop login on a
Linux-based server configuration.

    A virtual desktop looks like a traditional desktop but is not limited to a
single physical computer. Instead, many virtual Linux desktops are hosted
on a server. The combined solution includes:

    Virtual desktop provided by Virtual Bridges called Virtual Enterprise
Remote Desktop Environment (VERDE);  Ubuntu, the worldwide leading Linux
desktop operating system, from Canonical; and IBM Open Collaboration
Client Solution software (OCCS) based on IBM Lotus Symphony, IBM Lotus
Notes and Lotus applications. IBM Lotus Symphony is built on the Open
Document Format (ODF).

    Today's news builds on announcements throughout 2008 around delivering
Microsoft-alternative desktops in conjunction with our partners. This
solution is now a key component of IBM's financial services front office
transformation offering as well as part of the IBM public sector industry
solution framework.

    "When we look back several years from now, I think we'll see this time as
an inflection point when the economic climate pushed the virtual Linux
desktop from theory to practice," said Inna Kuznetsova, director, IBM
Linux Strategy. "The financial pressures on organizations are staggering
and the management of PCs is unwieldy. Today's virtual desktop is
delivering superior collaborative software, an innovative delivery
method, and an open-source operating system that is demanding clients'
consideration."

    Compared to Microsoft-based desktops, this virtual desktop solution,
including industry-leading components from IBM, Virtual Bridges and
Canonical, is estimated on average to deliver cost savings from:

    Licensing: cost avoidance of $500 to $800 per user on software license
for Microsoft Office, Windows and all related products (1);  Hardware:
cost avoidance of around $258 per user since there is no need to upgrade
hardware to support Windows Vista and Office 2007 (2);  Power
consumption: cost avoidance of $40 to $145 per user from reduced power to
run the configuration and $20 to $73 per user from reduced air
conditioning requirements from lower powered desktop devices annually (3);
and  IT services: 90 percent savings of deskside PC support; 75 percent of
security/user administration; 50 percent of help desk services such as
password resets, and 50 percent for software installations, which are
replaced by software publishing (4) 

    "With the benefits of open standards over a proprietary platform come the
freedom to select software in a heterogeneous environment," said Malcolm
Yates, vice president, Canonical. "Combining Ubuntu with IBM's Open Client
software applications we can break out of Microsoft dependencies
completely and significantly reduce total cost of ownership."

    Two Views of the Virtual Desktop

    From the end user's point of view, the virtual desktop combining solution
from IBM, Virtual Bridges and Canonical looks like a traditional desktop
but is not limited to a single physical computer. Instead of the software
and data being saved on a user's desktop, the hosted applications permit
the user to access the screen data. That means users can access their
computers on any network-connected device anywhere they happen to be.
Software fixes are automatically inherited to the user sessions without
anyone having to visit the decentralized access point. All the
applications that a user might need -- such as email, calendaring, word
processing and team collaboration -- are available.

    From the IT department's view, the difference between virtual and physical
desktop is significant. For this virtual system, all administrative
intervention is done on consolidated virtual machines in the data center
through deployment of standard images. When there is a software update
required, the IT manager can do it centrally. The IT manager can run
concurrent Linux desktop sessions from any x86 Linux server, such as a
blade server. Users can access their Linux desktop sessions from not only
endpoints running Linux, but Windows and Mac as well, which is critical as
users seek standard application environments across heterogeneous physical
desktops. The solution includes a seamless remote printing capability
without the need to maintain drivers.

    "The wave of virtualization has hit the datacenter but bypassed the front
office," said Jim Curtin, president and CEO of Virtual Bridges.
"Protecting the security of each desktop individually is a Herculean task
for most organizations. Today, understaffed IT departments can't afford
deskside visits and the help desk requests that accompany traditional
desktop maintenance. With a virtual desktop, centralized control means
the loss or theft of a laptop is no longer a corporate crisis. The IT
staff can instead focus on ramping up capacity and services as the
business demands."

    IBM Global Technology Services

    IBM services can help roll out this offering, as well as other customized
virtual desktops. IBM Virtual Infrastructure Access service helps
customers transform their distributed IT architectures into virtualized,
open-standards-based frameworks. It provides centralized IT services, and
robust application and desktop delivery. It combines hardware, software
and services to connect customers' authorized users to
platform-independent, centrally managed applications and full client
images running in virtual machines.

    The IBM Open Collaboration Client Solution

    The Open Collaboration Client Solution provides email, calendaring, word
processing, spreadsheets, presentations, unified communication, social
networking, team collaboration and portals, based on IBM Lotus Notes 8 and
IBM Lotus Symphony. The software is built on open standards, based on the
open-source Eclipse Rich Client Platform and supports Open Document Format
(ODF). For more information visit,
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/occs-overview/

    Virtual Bridges' VERDE

    VERDE is the first true Linux-only (host, guest and client) virtual
desktop infrastructure solution offering integrated connection broker,
robust KVM-based VM technology, multimedia and sound support, local
printing support and many other features typical only found in
Windows-based solutions. VERDE surpasses Windows-based VDI systems with
lower cost-of-ownership, ease-of-use, security, flexibility as well as
easier deployment and ongoing management.

    Availability and Pricing

    The virtual desktop is generally available now in most geographies and

&lt;p&gt;  OAK BROOK, IL, Dec 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In an effort to empower employees with free, comprehensive money
management tools, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Visa Inc. have launched the
country's largest employer-based financial literacy program. The
"McDonald's Practical Money Skills" program is being made available to
more than 500,000 restaurant-level employees throughout the majority of
McDonald's 14,000 U.S. restaurants.

    As part of this program, employees will receive a printed Wealth
Watchers(R) budgeting guide to track expenses and access to an
instructional video and web resource center at
www.practicalmoneyskills.com/mcdonalds with additional tools and
information. The materials, which are based on Visa's popular "Practical
Money Skills for Life" financial education program, are being made
available in both English and Spanish.

    "Empowering Americans with the knowledge they need to make informed
financial decisions is crucial," said Bill Sheedy, President, North
America, Visa Inc. "A challenge of this size requires an equally large
response, which is why we are proud to be working with McDonald's on this
innovative financial literacy program for their employees."

    "The McDonald's Practical Money Skills program is part of our ongoing
commitment to provide a wide-range of benefits to our employees," said
Steve Russell, Chief People Officer, McDonald's USA. "Providing
information and educating our employees about the importance of financial
responsibility has become increasingly important -- now more than ever."

    During these challenging economic times, the state of financial literacy
in America has become increasingly important. A survey released earlier
this year by the JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy
showed that a majority of high school seniors in American failed a test
on basic personal finance.

    In addition to the tools available through its work with Visa, many
McDonald's restaurants offer a number of other benefits to employees,
such
as:


--  McDonald's Insurance Program: Provides employees the option to
    participate in health, dental, prescription, life, vision, and short-term
    disability plans, to assist them in paying for healthcare expenses.
--  McDonald's Gold Card: A discount program that helps employees save
    money on everyday purchases at multiple retailers nationwide.
--  McResource Line: An Employee Assistance Program that provides help on
    work-life issues such as child care, transportation, and housing. It also
    provides assistance in financial areas including credit counseling, debt
    consolidation, financial planning and bill payments.
--  McDirect Shares(R), McSave(R), Credit Union and 401k Plans: Allow
    employees to invest and save money for their future.
    

    
Since 1996, Visa's free "Practical Money Skills for Life" and "What's
My Score" financial literacy programs have helped millions of Americans
master the fundamentals of budgeting, saving and the wise use of credit.
More than 20 state governments have officially distributed Visa's
personal finance educational programs to every public high school in
those states, at no cost to the taxpayers. As part of this ongoing
commitment to financial literacy, Visa has pledged to reach an additional
10 million people worldwide by 2013 with personal finance education.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp (6752.T) has sweetened its offer for Sanyo Electric Co 6764.T by 8 percent to about $8.6 billion, sources familiar with the matter said, but major shareholder Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rejected the offer and threatened to launch a counter bid.&lt;/p&gt;

That ratio dropped to 2.2 times by the end of September.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. bankruptcy trustee for
cash management company Sentinel Management Group Inc sued
hedge fund Citadel Investment Group LLC and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) this week, accusing them of helping Sentinel
insiders make fraudulent transfers on the eve of its
bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the lawsuit filed on Thursday in U.S. bankruptcy court
in Chicago, Sentinel's court-appointed trustee Frederick Grede,
said Citadel and Goldman helped the insiders cover-up a
long-running fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives for Citadel and Goldman declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sentinel, which managed about $1.6 billion of short term
investments for clients, filed for bankruptcy protection in
August 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit claims certain Sentinel insiders began a scheme
in 2003 to improperly commingle customer funds with Sentinel
assets, creating a massive $3 billion investment pool used to
leverage trades of risky securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit says the Sentinel insiders misused the customer
funds, which were supposed to be separated and put them in
unsuitable investments. Then, to try to cover up losses from
the scheme, the insiders began transferring assets and shifting
cash between accounts, the suit claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Sentinel Insiders' representations to customers about
the assignment or allocation of specific securities to their
(segments) were complete fabrications," the suit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "... So as to avoid discovery of their fraudulent
leveraging scheme, the customer statements reflected a false
cost basis for the risky securities that had been allocated to
the customer accounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The suit claims Citadel benefited from the insiders'
"desperate attempt to cover-up their underlying fraud," by
taking transfers that were intended to prevent Sentinel's
customers and creditors from detecting the fraud. According to
the suit, Citadel immediately transferred its trades to Goldman
and the two split profits from some of the Sentinel-linked
trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit is seeking to recover the fraudulent transfers for
the benefit of Sentinel's creditors. Such suits often arise
post-bankruptcy after creditors have had a chance to learn what
led to the bankrupt company's downfall.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sentinel roiled markets in August 2007 when it froze client
account withdrawals, saying the turbulent credit markets had
made it impossible to trade without taking losses. It filed for
bankruptcy days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since August 2007, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has filed civil fraud charges against the company,
as well as former Sentinel chief executive Eric Bloom and
former head trader Charles Mosley for what it said was their
roles in devising and carrying out a fraud that resulted in
Sentinel's clients losing several hundred millions of dollars.

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Uma s&#233;rie integrada de solu&#231;&#245;es ser&#225; necess&#225;ria para administrar os aumentos da
demanda por energia e as emiss&#245;es de g&#225;s de efeito estufa que resultar&#227;o do
crescimento da popula&#231;&#227;o e da expans&#227;o econ&#244;mica, afirmou hoje a Exxon Mobil
Corporation (NYSE:XOM), com o lan&#231;amento da publica&#231;&#227;o Panorama Energ&#233;tico:
Perspectivas para 2030.

&#8220;O mundo precisa atender &#224;s crescentes necessidades de energia confi&#225;vel e com
pre&#231;o acess&#237;vel, e, ao mesmo tempo, minimizar os efeitos sobre o ambiente",
disse Rex W. Tillerson, presidente e diretor executivo. 

&#8220;A ExxonMobil aplaude a amplia&#231;&#227;o da discuss&#227;o p&#250;blica sobre como enfrentar os
desafios ambientais, energ&#233;ticos e econ&#244;micos, e espera que essa nova publica&#231;&#227;o
do Panorama Energ&#233;tico possa ser &#250;til para aumentar o entendimento dos desafios
e as solu&#231;&#245;es alternativas.&#8221; 

Panorama Energ&#233;tico, publica&#231;&#227;odesenvolvida anualmente, &#233; o produto de um
processo cont&#237;nuo que vem sendo conduzido h&#225; d&#233;cadas. Os resultados s&#227;o
utilizados para ajudar o planejamento de neg&#243;cios da ExxonMobil e para aumentar
o entendimento do p&#250;blico sobre as necessidades e desafios energ&#233;ticos do mundo.
As perspectivas s&#227;o desenvolvidas atrav&#233;s de an&#225;lise detalhada de
aproximadamente cem pa&#237;ses, quinze setores de demanda e vinte tipos de
combust&#237;veis e &#233; sustentada pelas proje&#231;&#245;es econ&#244;micas e populacionais, al&#233;m das
expectativas de melhorias significativas da efici&#234;ncia energ&#233;tica e avan&#231;os
tecnol&#243;gicos. 

A nova publica&#231;&#227;o Panorama Energ&#233;tico foi ampliada para incluir uma nova se&#231;&#227;o
intitulada O Imperativo da Energia, que cont&#233;m um exame detalhado das solu&#231;&#245;es
integradas que inclui maior efici&#234;ncia energ&#233;tica, desenvolvimento de todas as
formas vi&#225;veis de energia e op&#231;&#245;es de pol&#237;ticas p&#250;blicas e tecnol&#243;gicas para

O relat&#243;rio tamb&#233;m descreve a abordagem proativa da ExxonMobil para administrar
os riscos apresentados pelas crescentes emiss&#245;es de g&#225;s de efeito estufa e o
desempenho da empresa na redu&#231;&#227;o de suas pr&#243;prias emiss&#245;es, al&#233;m de ajudar os
consumidores de combust&#237;veis de hidrocarboneto a reduzirem suas emiss&#245;es. 

Entre as conclus&#245;es desse ano est&#227;o:

* Conduzida pelo crescimento populacional e pelas economias em crescimento, a
demanda energ&#233;tica deve aumentar, em m&#233;dia, 1,2% por ano entre 2005 e 2030,
mesmo considerando os ganhos significativos em efici&#234;ncia energ&#233;tica. A demanda
global deve aumentar 35%, do equivalente a duzentos e vinte e nove milh&#245;es de
barris de petr&#243;leo por dia em 2005 ao equivalente a trezentos e dez milh&#245;es de
barris por dia em 2030. Esta previs&#227;o &#233; um pouco mais baixa do que aquela
apresentada no Panorama 2007, que projetou uma taxa m&#233;dia anual de crescimento
de 1,3%. As mudan&#231;as abrangem v&#225;rios setores de demanda e refletem maior
efici&#234;ncia energ&#233;tica. 
* Petr&#243;leo, g&#225;s e carv&#227;o continuar&#227;o a suprir a maior parte das necessidades
energ&#233;ticas do mundo - atendendo aproximadamente 80% da demanda global at&#233; 2030
&#8211; devido &#224; sua abund&#226;ncia, disponibilidade e pre&#231;o acess&#237;vel. A energia nuclear
dever&#225; crescer, na medida em que aumenta a &#234;nfase sobre os combust&#237;veis com
baixo teor de carbono. Os combust&#237;veis renov&#225;veis, como a energia e&#243;lica, solar
e os biocombust&#237;veis, dever&#227;o ter crescimento r&#225;pido. 
* O setor de gera&#231;&#227;o de energia ser&#225; o de maior e de mais r&#225;pido crescimento em
rela&#231;&#227;o &#224; demanda at&#233; 2030. A China, que hoje supre quase 90% das suas
necessidades energ&#233;ticas com carv&#227;o, ver&#225; sua demanda por gera&#231;&#227;o de energia
crescer em mais do que o dobro at&#233; 2030, ultrapassando a demanda dos EUA em mais
de um ter&#231;o. 
* O transporte, atualmente respons&#225;vel por mais de metade da demanda total de
petr&#243;leo, deve crescer substancialmente. Entre 2005 e 2030, a demanda nos pa&#237;ses
desenvolvidos deve permanecer relativamente est&#225;vel, na medida em que o aumento
do n&#250;mero de ve&#237;culos for suplantado por significativos aumentos na efici&#234;ncia.
De modo inverso, a demanda dos pa&#237;ses em desenvolvimento deve aumentar em mais
do que o dobro, na medida em que as economias crescerem e a maior prosperidade
permitir um aumento acentuado no n&#250;mero de ve&#237;culos particulares. 
* O aumento das emiss&#245;es globais de di&#243;xido de carbono est&#225; projetado para
atingir aproximadamente 30% entre 2005 e 2030, mesmo com o aumento da efici&#234;ncia
energ&#233;tica e o crescimento das fontes de energia nuclear e renov&#225;veis. Como as
emiss&#245;es de di&#243;xido de carbono devem ser reduzidas nos Estados Unidos e na
Europa no per&#237;odo at&#233; 2030, essas redu&#231;&#245;es dever&#227;o ser mais do que compensadas
por aumentos maiores nos pa&#237;ses em desenvolvimento. Por exemplo, at&#233; 2030 a
China deve ter uma taxa de emiss&#245;es de CO2 compar&#225;vel &#224;quela dos Estados Unidos
e da Europa combinadas.

&#8220;Oferecer energia economicamente acess&#237;vel para atender a demanda em crescimento
&#233; um dos maiores desafios dos pr&#243;ximos vinte anos&#8221;, disse Tillerson. &#8220;Precisamos
investir na produ&#231;&#227;o das fontes de combust&#237;vel existentes, desenvolver novas
fontes de energia e criar novas tecnologias que reduzir&#227;o o dano ambiental
causado pela produ&#231;&#227;o e uso da energia".

&lt;p&gt;Dec 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Leap Wireless
International Inc LEAP.O to "buy" from "neutral," saying it
expects the low-cost mobile carrier's fourth-quarter results to
be boosted by subscriber trade-downs from national carriers,
promotions and recent investments in core markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which has a price target of $43 on the
stock, added Leap Wireless to its Americas conviction list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it continues to expect outsized growth driven
by market expansion that roughly doubles Leap's footprint from
2007 to 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also sees a 20 percent growth in earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2009, despite
a pressured macro environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect cash-strapped consumers could opt for Leap's
value wireless service to cut down on their monthly bills," the
brokerage added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also said it expects MetroPCS Communications Inc
PCS.N to report strong fourth-quarter subscriber results, to
be released in early January, which may also provide a positive
catalyst for Leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up about 63 cents at $21.47 in
morning trade on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has announced that former Yahoo! (YHOO) executive Qi Lu
will oversee MSFT's Internet services business from his post as president of the
online services group. This move does not come as a surprise, as it has been
rumored for months. In addition, Brian McAndrews is leaving the company - which
could lead to his becoming the CEO at YHOO. Watch for speculation about MSFT's
interest in YHOO to start again, which should be expected as one company starts
to hire execs from another.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A number of headwinds will dampen earnings per share prospects for U.S. insurance brokers unless an improvement in insurance pricing takes place, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest headwind facing the industry is foreign exchange and it could lead to pressure on foreign profits over the next four quarters, analyst Matthew G Heimermann said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on quarterly average exchange rates, major foreign currencies have declined by an average of 12 percent relative to the levels of the past four quarters. The euro and sterling, which are more material to most insurance brokers, are down even more," Heimermann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said a likely increase in pension expenses and overall economic weakness could also hurt the insurance brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While reinsurance pricing gains, combined with continued expense and merger integration savings, should help mitigate these factors, EPS estimates for the entire sector appear relatively optimistic for us," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aon Corp AOC.N will likely generate the best near-term performance given its acquisition of Benfield, which should benefit from improvements in reinsurance pricing, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aon, the world's largest insurance broker, had made a recommended cash offer of 844 million pounds ($1.6 billion) for rival Benfield BFD.L in August, in a deal that would create the biggest reinsurance broker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heimermann said the opportunity for gains in earnings is also high at Marsh  McLennan Companies Inc (MMC.N) and Willis Group Holdings Ltd (WSH.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to believe Brown and Inc shares are expensive relative to growth prospects," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anurag Kotoky in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp tapped on Thursday a former senior Yahoo Inc executive, Qi Lu, to head its online services group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software giant, which tried and failed to buy Yahoo earlier this year, is looking to revamp its search-ad strategy to better compete with the industry juggernaut, Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also has decided it does not want to buy Yahoo any more, although it has left open the possibility of a search deal with the company. Lu, who was responsible for development of the Web search and monetization platforms at Yahoo, left the company in August after 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will begin work at Microsoft in January and report directly to Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft hired Sean Suchter, another former Yahoo search executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said Brian McAndrews, the former CEO of aQuantive, which the company acquired last year for $6 billion, is leaving the company. He was senior vice president of the advertiser and publisher solutions group, which will be overseen by Lu in his new role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft closed at $19.11, down 76 cents or 3.8 percent, while shares of Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo closed down 45 cents or 3.9 percent at $11.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gabriel Madway, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Une s&#233;rie de solutions int&#233;gr&#233;es sera n&#233;cessaire pour pouvoir g&#233;rer les hausses
de la demande mondiale en &#233;nergie et les &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre
r&#233;sultant de la croissance d&#233;mographique et de l&#8217;expansion &#233;conomique, Exxon
Mobil Corporation (NYSE&#160;:&#160;XOM) a indiqu&#233; aujourd&#8217;hui, avec la publication de son
rapport d&#8217;entreprise intitul&#233; Perspectives en mati&#232;re d&#8217;&#233;nergie&#160;: un regard &#224;
l&#8217;horizon 2030 (Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030).

&#171;&#160;Le monde doit r&#233;pondre au besoin en &#233;nergie fiable et abordable toujours
croissant, tout en minimisant les effets sur l&#8217;environnement&#160;&#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Rex W.
Tillerson, pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral. 

&#171;&#160;ExxonMobil incite &#224; une plus grande discussion publique sur comment r&#233;pondre
au mieux aux d&#233;fis &#233;conomiques, &#233;nerg&#233;tiques et environnementaux et esp&#232;re que
ces Perspectives en mati&#232;re d&#8217;&#233;nergie &#233;largies pourront servir &#224; mieux faire
appr&#233;hender ces d&#233;fis et les solutions alternatives.&#160;&#187; 

Le rapport Perspectives en mati&#232;re d&#8217;&#233;nergie, qui est &#233;labor&#233; tous les ans, est
le produit d&#8217;un processus continu qui dure depuis des dizaines d&#8217;ann&#233;es. Les
r&#233;sultats sont utilis&#233;s pour aider &#224; la planification d&#8217;entreprise d&#8217;ExxonMobil
et pour que le public comprenne mieux les besoins en &#233;nergie de la plan&#232;te et
les d&#233;fis auxquels elle doit faire face. Ces perspectives sont &#233;labor&#233;es gr&#226;ce &#224;
une analyse d&#233;taill&#233;e d&#8217;environ 100 pays, 15 secteurs de demande et 20 types de
combustibles. Il est aussi &#233;tay&#233; par des pr&#233;visions &#233;conomiques et
d&#233;mographiques et les attentes en mati&#232;re d&#8217;am&#233;liorations significatives de
l&#8217;efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique et d&#8217;avanc&#233;es technologiques. 

Les Perspectives en mati&#232;re d&#8217;&#233;nergie de cette ann&#233;e ont &#233;t&#233; &#233;largies et
comportent une nouvelle section intitul&#233;e les Imp&#233;ratifs en mati&#232;re d&#8217;&#233;nergie
(Energy Imperative), dans laquelle figure un examen d&#233;taill&#233; de solutions
int&#233;gr&#233;es, dont l&#8217;am&#233;lioration de l&#8217;efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique, le d&#233;veloppement de
toutes les formes viables d&#8217;&#233;nergie, ainsi que les options technologiques et de
politiques publiques pour g&#233;rer les risques climatiques. 

En outre, le rapport donne une vue d&#8217;ensemble de la d&#233;marche proactive
d&#8217;ExxonMobil en ce qui concerne la gestion des risques que pose l&#8217;augmentation
des &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre et le r&#244;le de l&#8217;entreprise dans la
r&#233;duction de ses propres &#233;missions, ainsi que l&#8217;aide qu&#8217;elle apporte aux
consommateurs de combustibles &#224; base d&#8217;hydrocarbures pour la r&#233;duction de leurs
&#233;missions. 

Parmi les conclusions de cette ann&#233;e&#160;:

* Men&#233;e par des populations en croissance d&#233;mographique et des &#233;conomies en
expansion, la demande mondiale en &#233;nergie devrait augmenter selon les pr&#233;visions
de 1,2&#160;% par an en moyenne entre le niveau de 2005 et 2030, m&#234;me si l&#8217;on
consid&#232;re qu&#8217;il y aura des gains significatifs en termes d&#8217;efficacit&#233;
&#233;nerg&#233;tique. La demande mondiale devrait augmenter selon les pr&#233;visions de 35&#160;%,
de l&#8217;&#233;quivalent de 229 millions de barils de p&#233;trole par jour en 2005 &#224;
l&#8217;&#233;quivalent de 310 millions de barils par jour en 2030. Ces pr&#233;visions ont
l&#233;g&#232;rement baiss&#233; par rapport &#224; celles des perspectives de 2007, lesquelles
projetaient un taux de croissance annuel moyen de 1,3&#160;%. Les changements
s&#8217;&#233;tendent &#224; divers secteurs de demande et refl&#232;tent une plus grande efficacit&#233;
&#233;nerg&#233;tique. 
* Le p&#233;trole, le gaz et le charbon continueront &#224; couvrir la grande majorit&#233; des
besoins mondiaux en &#233;nergie, r&#233;pondant &#224; pr&#232;s de 80&#160;% de la demande mondiale
jusqu&#8217;en 2030, en raison de leur abondance et disponibilit&#233;, et du fait qu&#8217;ils
sont abordables. L&#8217;&#233;nergie nucl&#233;aire va progresser, &#224; mesure que l&#8217;accent sera
mis de plus en plus sur les combustibles &#224; basse teneur en carbone. Les sources
d&#8217;&#233;nergie renouvelable (l&#8217;&#233;olien, le solaire et les biocarburants par ex.)
progresseront elles aussi rapidement. 
* La g&#233;n&#233;ration d&#8217;&#233;lectricit&#233; sera le secteur de demande en &#233;nergie qui
conna&#238;tra la croissance la plus forte et la plus rapide jusqu&#8217;en 2030. La Chine,
qui &#224; l&#8217;heure actuelle satisfait &#224; presque 90&#160;% de ses besoins en &#233;lectricit&#233;
avec le charbon, verra sa demande en &#233;nergie pour la g&#233;n&#233;ration d&#8217;&#233;lectricit&#233;
plus que doubler d&#8217;ici &#224; 2030, d&#233;passant la demande des &#201;tats-Unis de plus d&#8217;un
tiers. 
* Les transports, actuellement responsables de plus de la moiti&#233; de la demande
totale en p&#233;trole, devraient cro&#238;tre de fa&#231;on consid&#233;rable selon les
estimations. De 2005 &#224; 2030, la demande dans les pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s devrait &#234;tre
relativement stable, l&#8217;augmentation du nombre de v&#233;hicules &#233;tant compens&#233;e par
les am&#233;liorations significatives au niveau de l&#8217;efficacit&#233;. Par opposition, il
est probable que la demande dans les pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement doublera,
voire plus, alors que les &#233;conomies progresseront et que la prosp&#233;rit&#233; en hausse
permettra une augmentation consid&#233;rable du nombre de v&#233;hicules personnels. 
* On projette que les &#233;missions de CO2 &#224; l&#8217;&#233;chelle mondiale seront en hausse de
pr&#232;s de 30&#160;% entre 2005 et 2030 m&#234;me avec une meilleure efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique
et la croissance des sources d&#8217;&#233;nergie renouvelables et de l&#8217;&#233;nergie nucl&#233;aire.
Alors que les &#233;missions de CO2 devraient selon les estimations commencer &#224;
d&#233;cliner aux &#201;tats-Unis et en Europe sur la p&#233;riode allant jusqu&#8217;en 2030, ces
d&#233;clins seront plus que contrebalanc&#233;s par des augmentations plus importantes
dans les pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement. Par exemple, &#224; l&#8217;horizon 2030, on pense
que les &#233;missions de CO2 de la Chine seront comparables &#224; celles des &#201;tats-Unis
et de l&#8217;Europe r&#233;unis.

&#171;&#160;Fournir une &#233;nergie abordable pour r&#233;pondre &#224; la demande croissante est l&#8217;un
des d&#233;fis mondiaux les plus importants des 20 ann&#233;es &#224; venir&#160;&#187;, a confi&#233; M.
Tillerson. &#171;&#160;Nous devons investir dans la production de sources d&#8217;&#233;nergie
existantes, d&#233;velopper de nouvelles sources d&#8217;&#233;nergie et cr&#233;er des technologies
nouvelles qui r&#233;duiront l&#8217;empreinte environnementale de la production et de
l&#8217;utilisation d&#8217;&#233;nergie.&#160;&#187;

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) erkl&#228;rte heute bei der Ver&#246;ffentlichung ihres
Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030, dass eine Reihe von integrierten L&#246;sungen
erforderlich sei, um die globale Energienachfrage und die Treibhausgasemissionen
aufgrund des Bev&#246;lkerungswachstums und der wirtschaftlichen Expansion
kontrollieren zu k&#246;nnen.

&#8222;Die Welt muss die stetig wachsende Nachfrage nach verl&#228;sslicher und
erschwinglicher Energie erf&#252;llen, w&#228;hrend gleichzeitig die Auswirkungen auf die
Umwelt minimiert werden m&#252;ssen&#8220;, so Rex W. Tillerson, Chairman und Chief
Executive Officer. 

&#8222;ExxonMobil begr&#252;&#223;t die zunehmende &#246;ffentliche Diskussion dar&#252;ber, wie die
wirtschaftlichen, energie- und umweltbezogenen Herausforderungen am Besten
gemeistert werden k&#246;nnen, und hofft, dass dieser erweiterte Outlook for Energy
f&#252;r ein wachsendes Verst&#228;ndnis der Herausforderungen und alternativen L&#246;sungen
hilfreich ist.&#8220; 

Der Outlook for Energy wird j&#228;hrlich erstellt und ist das Produkt eines
fortlaufenden Prozesses, der schon seit Jahrzehnten durchgef&#252;hrt wird. Die
Ergebnisse werden dazu genutzt, die Gesch&#228;ftsplanung von ExxonMobil zu
unterst&#252;tzen und die &#246;ffentliche Wahrnehmung des weltweiten Energiebedarfs und
der Herausforderungen zu erh&#246;hen. Der Outlook wird mittels einer detaillierten
Analyse von ca. 100 L&#228;ndern, 15 Nachfragesektoren und 20 Brennstoffarten
erstellt und durch wirtschaftliche und bev&#246;lkerungsbezogene Vorausberechnungen
und Erwartungen von wesentlichen Verbesserungen der Energieeffizienz und
technologischen Fortschritten untermauert. 

Der diesj&#228;hrige Outlook for Energy wurde um einen neuen Abschnitt mit dem Titel
Energy Imperative erweitert, der eine detaillierte Untersuchung der integrierten
L&#246;sungen zu verbesserter Energieeffizienz, Entwicklung aller realisierbaren
Formen von Energie sowie die Technologie und Optionen der &#246;ffentlichen Ordnung
zur Kontrolle des Klimarisikos enth&#228;lt. 

Der Bericht behandelt auch den proaktiven Ansatz von ExxonMobil zur Kontrolle
der Risiken aufgrund steigender Treibhausgasemissionen sowie die Rolle des
Unternehmens bei der Senkung der eigenen Emissionen und in der Unterst&#252;tzung der
Konsumenten von Brennstoffen auf Basis von Kohlenwasserstoff zur Senkung von
deren Emissionen. 

Die diesj&#228;hrigen Ergebnisse enthalten unter anderem Folgendes:

* Aufgrund des Bev&#246;lkerungswachstums und der expandierenden Wirtschaft wird
erwartet, dass die globale Energienachfrage zwischen 2005 und 2030
durchschnittlich um 1,2 Prozent pro Jahr steigen wird, wobei wesentliche
Steigerungen in der Energieeffizienz schon hinzugerechnet sind. F&#252;r die globale
Nachfrage wird erwartet, dass sie um 35 Prozent von 229 Millionen Barrel &#214;l pro
Tag im Jahr 2005 auf 310 Millionen Barrel pro Tag im Jahr 2030 steigen wird.
Diese Vorhersage liegt leicht unter der Vorhersage des Outlook 2007, in dem eine
durchschnittliche j&#228;hrliche Wachstumsrate von 1,3 Prozent vorhergesagt wurde.
Die &#196;nderungen verteilen sich auf die verschiedenen Nachfragesektoren und
spiegeln die verbesserte Energieeffizienz wider. 
* &#214;l, Gas und Kohle werden weiterhin den Gro&#223;teil des weltweiten Energiebedarfs
mit ca. 80 Prozent der weltweiten Nachfrage bis 2030 erf&#252;llen, da sie noch
umfangreich vorhanden, erschwinglich und leicht verf&#252;gbar sind. Die Kernenergie
wird wachsen, da die Gewichtung auf Brennstoffe mit geringem CO2-Aussto&#223;
zunimmt. Erneuerbare Energien, wie Wind, Sonnenenergie und Biokraftstoffe,
werden ebenfalls schnell zunehmen. 
* Die Stromerzeugung wird bis 2030 den gr&#246;&#223;ten und am schnellsten wachsenden
Sektor mit Energiebedarf darstellen. China, das heute fast 90 Prozent seines
Energiebedarfs zur Stromerzeugung mit Kohle deckt, wird bis 2030 einen mehr als
verdoppelten Energiebedarf erleben, der selbst die Nachfrage der USA um mehr als
ein Drittel &#252;bersteigen wird. 
* F&#252;r das Transportwesen, das momentan mehr als die H&#228;lfte der gesamten
&#214;lnachfrage ausmacht, wird ein wesentliches Wachstum erwartet. Von 2005 bis 2030
wird f&#252;r die Nachfrage in den entwickelten L&#228;ndern erwartet, dass sie relativ
stabil bleibt, da die zunehmende Anzahl der Fahrzeuge durch wesentliche
Effizienzverbesserungen ausgeglichen wird. Im Gegensatz dazu wird sich die
Nachfrage in den Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern wahrscheinlich mehr als verdoppeln, da dort
die Wirtschaft w&#228;chst und zunehmender Wohlstand zu einem drastischen Anstieg der
privaten Fahrzeuge f&#252;hren wird. 
* F&#252;r die globalen CO2-Emissionen wird vorhergesagt, dass sie zwischen 2005 und
2030 trotz der verbesserten Energieeffizienz und dem Wachstum von Kernenergie
und erneuerbaren Energien um fast 30 Prozent ansteigen werden. W&#228;hrend f&#252;r die
CO2-Emissionen in den Vereinigten Staaten und Europa im Zeitraum bis 2030 ein
R&#252;ckgang erwartet wird, werden diese R&#252;ckg&#228;nge durch die st&#228;rkeren Zuw&#228;chse in
den Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern mehr als nur ausgeglichen. So wird beispielsweise f&#252;r
China erwartet, dass dort bis 2030 solche Mengen von CO2-Emissionen ausgesto&#223;en
werden wie in den Vereinigten Staaten und Europa zusammen.

&#8222;Die Bereitstellung von erschwinglicher Energie zur Erf&#252;llung der wachsenden
Nachfrage ist eine der weltweit wichtigsten Herausforderungen in den kommenden
20 Jahren&#8220;, so Tillerson. &#8222;Wir m&#252;ssen in die Gewinnung von bestehenden Energien
und die Entwicklung von neuen Energien investieren und neue Technologien zur
Senkung des CO2-Aussto&#223;es von Energieerzeugung und Energienutzung entwickeln.&#8220;

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Se necesitar&#225; una serie integrada de soluciones para controlar el aumento de la
demanda mundial de energ&#237;a y las emisiones de los gases responsables del efecto
invernadero que se generar&#225;n a partir del crecimiento demogr&#225;fico y la expansi&#243;n
econ&#243;mica, dijo hoy Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), en el lanzamiento de
Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030 (Perspectivas energ&#233;ticas: Con vistas a 2030)
de la corporaci&#243;n.

&#8220;El mundo necesita satisfacer la creciente necesidad de energ&#237;a confiable y
asequible al tiempo que se minimizan los efectos sobre el medioambiente&#8221;, dijo
Rex W. Tillerson, presidente y director ejecutivo. 

&#8220;ExxonMobil recibe de buen grado el creciente debate p&#250;blico acerca de los
beneficios de satisfacer los desaf&#237;os econ&#243;micos, energ&#233;ticos y
medioambientales, y espera que el ampliado Outlook for Energy sirva para
aumentar el entendimiento de los desaf&#237;os y de las soluciones alternativas&#8221;. 

Outlook for Energy se desarrolla anualmente y es el producto de un proceso
continuo realizado durante d&#233;cadas. Los resultados colaboran con la
planificaci&#243;n de negocios de ExxonMobil e incrementan el entendimiento p&#250;blico
de las necesidades y desaf&#237;os energ&#233;ticos del mundo. Las perspectivas se
desarrollan a trav&#233;s de un an&#225;lisis detallado de unos 100 pa&#237;ses, 15 sectores de
demanda y 20 tipos de combustible, y son respaldadas por las proyecciones
econ&#243;micas y poblacionales de importantes mejoras en el uso eficiente de la
energ&#237;a y avances tecnol&#243;gicos significativos. 

El Outlook for Energy de este a&#241;o fue ampliado e incluye una secci&#243;n nueva,
titulada Energy Imperative (Imperativo energ&#233;tico), que contiene un examen
exhaustivo de soluciones integradas, entre las que se mencionan un uso m&#225;s
eficiente de la energ&#237;a, el desarrollo de todas las formas viables de energ&#237;a y
opciones de pol&#237;ticas tecnol&#243;gicas y p&#250;blicas para controlar los riesgos
relacionados con los factores clim&#225;ticos. 

Asimismo, el informe describe el enfoque proactivo de ExxonMobil tendiente a
controlar los riesgos generados por las emisiones de los gases responsables del
efecto invernadero y el papel de la corporaci&#243;n en la reducci&#243;n de sus propias
emisiones. Tambi&#233;n se busca ayudar a los consumidores de combustibles
hidrocarbonatados a reducir sus emisiones. 

Entre los hallazgos de este a&#241;o, se encuentran:

* Empujada por el crecimiento demogr&#225;fico y la expansi&#243;n de las econom&#237;as, se
espera que la demanda mundial de energ&#237;a aumente en un promedio de 1,2% anual
entre 2005 y 2030, incluso considerando importantes ganancias en la eficiencia
de la energ&#237;a. Se espera que la demanda mundial aumente 35% desde el equivalente
de 229 millones de barriles de petr&#243;leo por d&#237;a en 2005 hasta el equivalente de
310 millones de barriles por d&#237;a en 2030. Este pron&#243;stico es ligeramente menor
que el del Outlook2007, que proyectaba una tasa de crecimiento anual promedio de
1,3%. Los cambios se extienden a lo largo de diversos sectores de demanda y
reflejan una mejor eficiencia de la energ&#237;a. 
* El petr&#243;leo, el gas y el carb&#243;n continuar&#225;n abasteciendo la amplia mayor&#237;a de
las necesidades energ&#233;ticas del mundo, con casi un 80% de la demanda mundial
hasta 2030, debido a su abundancia, rentabilidad y disponibilidad. La energ&#237;a
nuclear crecer&#225;, ya que se incrementa el &#233;nfasis en los combustibles bajos en
carbono. Los combustibles renovables, como el viento, el sol y los
biocombustibles, tambi&#233;n crecer&#225;n r&#225;pidamente. 
* La generaci&#243;n de electricidad ser&#225; el sector demandante de energ&#237;a m&#225;s grande
y de mayor crecimiento hasta 2030. China satisface hoy en d&#237;a casi el 90% de sus
necesidades de electricidad con carb&#243;n y su demanda de energ&#237;a para generaci&#243;n
de electricidad se duplicar&#225; para 2030, con lo que superar&#225; la demanda de EE.UU.
en m&#225;s de un tercio. 
* Se espera que el transporte, que actualmente es responsable de m&#225;s de la mitad
de la demanda total de petr&#243;leo, crezca marcadamente. Entre 2005 y 2030, se
espera que la demanda de pa&#237;ses desarrollados permanezca relativamente estable,
dado que el aumento en el n&#250;mero de veh&#237;culos se compensa con las importantes
mejoras en la eficiencia. En contraposici&#243;n, la demanda de los pa&#237;ses en v&#237;as de
desarrollo probablemente se duplique ya que las econom&#237;as en alza y la creciente
prosperidad permiten un aumento contundente en el n&#250;mero de veh&#237;culos
particulares. 
* Se pronostica un aumento de cerca del 30% de las emisiones de di&#243;xido de
carbono en el mundo entre 2005 y 2030, aun con el uso m&#225;s eficiente de la
energ&#237;a y el crecimiento de las fuentes de energ&#237;a renovable y nuclear. Si bien
se espera que las emisiones de di&#243;xido de carbono comiencen a declinar en
Estados Unidos y Europa en el lapso que nos separa de 2030, estas disminuciones
ser&#225;n m&#225;s que compensadas con grandes incrementos en los pa&#237;ses en v&#237;as de
desarrollo. Por ejemplo, para 2030, se espera que China tenga emisiones de CO2
comparables con las de Estados Unidos y Europa combinadas.

&#8220;Proveer energ&#237;a asequible para satisfacer la creciente demanda es uno de los
desaf&#237;os m&#225;s importantes del mundo en los pr&#243;ximos 20 a&#241;os&#8221;, dijo Tillerson.
&#8220;Debemos invertir en la producci&#243;n de fuentes existentes de combustibles,
desarrollar nuevas fuentes de energ&#237;a y crear tecnolog&#237;as nuevas que reduzcan la
huella ambiental de la producci&#243;n y el uso de la energ&#237;a&#8221;.

ADVERTENCIA: este comunicado de prensa incluye declaraciones prospectivas. Las
condiciones futuras reales, como el crecimiento de la demanda de energ&#237;a, la
mezcla de suministro de energ&#237;a, la eficiencia energ&#233;tica y las emisiones de
di&#243;xido de carbono podr&#237;an ser sustancialmente diferentes debido a los cambios
de las tasas de crecimiento econ&#243;mico, los cambios tecnol&#243;gicos, el desarrollo
de nuevas fuentes de suministro de energ&#237;a, sucesos pol&#237;ticos, cambios

&lt;p&gt;Apporter un soutien aux femmes entrepreneurs, le moyen le plus efficace de faire
avancer l&#8217;&#233;conomie
N&#8217;DJAM&#201;NA, Tchad--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil et Africare ont annonc&#233; aujourd&#8217;hui avoir entrepris un projet de
trois ans de 1,75 million USD destin&#233; &#224; mettre en capacit&#233; les femmes en milieu
rural dans le sud du Tchad en d&#233;veloppant leur esprit d&#8217;entreprise gr&#226;ce &#224; des
projets de formation de petites entreprises et de g&#233;n&#233;ration de revenus,
l&#8217;obtention de micro-cr&#233;dit, et l&#8217;acc&#232;s aux march&#233;s. Ce projet constituera la
plus grosse contribution unique &#224; ce jour dans le cadre de l&#8217;Initiative d&#8217;aide &#224;
l&#8217;&#233;ducation des femmes et jeunes filles (Educating Women and Girls Initiative)
de la Fondation ExxonMobil destin&#233;e &#224; un projet de d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique des
femmes. 

&#171;&#160;Nous avons lanc&#233; l&#8217;Initiative d&#8217;aide &#224; l&#8217;&#233;ducation des femmes et jeunes filles
parce que de nombreuses recherches ont montr&#233; que l&#8217;am&#233;lioration de l&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224;
l&#8217;&#233;ducation et aux ressources des femmes et des jeunes filles &#233;tait un des
moyens les plus efficaces de promouvoir la sant&#233; et le d&#233;veloppement
&#233;conomique&#160;&#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Rex W. Tillerson, pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral d&#8217;Exxon
Mobil Corporation (NYSE&#160;:&#160;XOM). &#171;&#160;&#201;tant l&#8217;un des plus importants investisseurs
&#233;trangers directs en Afrique, ExxonMobil comprend qu&#8217;il est logique d&#8217;entretenir
la croissance &#233;conomique et d&#8217;am&#233;liorer la sant&#233; sur le continent. Cela ne peut
qu&#8217;&#234;tre b&#233;n&#233;fique pour nos salari&#233;s, nos voisins et nos clients.&#160;&#187; 

Le but du projet au Tchad est de renforcer la capacit&#233; des associations
f&#233;minines &#224; cr&#233;er des entreprises prioritaires g&#233;n&#233;ratrices de revenus,
augmenter l&#8217;acc&#232;s au micro-cr&#233;dit et former les femmes en milieu rural &#224;
l&#8217;esprit d&#8217;entreprise, &#224; la gestion financi&#232;re et aux comp&#233;tences en marketing.
Ce projet illustre la priorit&#233; que l&#8217;Initiative d&#8217;aide &#224; l&#8217;&#233;ducation des femmes
et jeunes filles accorde &#224; la formation des femmes, leur acc&#232;s aux ressources
financi&#232;res et structures de soutien leur permettant d&#8217;am&#233;liorer leurs moyens
d&#8217;existence et au renforcement du d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique dans les communaut&#233;s
o&#249; ExxonMobil est pr&#233;sente. 

M. Julius E. Coles, pr&#233;sident d&#8217;Africare, a exprim&#233; sa sinc&#232;re reconnaissance &#224;
ExxonMobil pour la g&#233;n&#233;reuse contribution de la soci&#233;t&#233; &#224; cet important projet
qui va changer la vie de tant de femmes et communaut&#233;s dans les districts de
Doba et B&#233;b&#233;djia dans le sud du Tchad. &#171;&#160;&#201;tant un organisme populaire dirig&#233; par
les communaut&#233;s, Africare travaillera en partenariat avec les femmes et les
communaut&#233;s afin de promouvoir des entreprises et des produits rentables qui
garantissent une s&#233;curit&#233; de revenus continus pour les femmes entrepreneurs
participant au projet. On anticipe que les revenus issus de ces unit&#233;s
&#233;conomiques seront utilis&#233;s pour apporter un soutien aux familles de ces femmes
et &#224; d&#8217;autres investissements dans des entreprises&#160;&#187;, a-t-il indiqu&#233;. 

St&#233;phane de Mahieu, directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de la filiale ExxonMobil Esso Exploration
and Production Chad, Inc., a quant a lui d&#233;clar&#233;&#160;: &#171; Nous sommes heureux
d&#8217;apporter notre soutien &#224; cet ambitieux projet, qui aura un impact positif sur
la vie des femmes de la zone de d&#233;veloppement des champs de p&#233;trole et de ses
environs. ExxonMobil collabore depuis longtemps avec Africare et je me r&#233;jouis &#224;
l&#8217;id&#233;e de travailler avec eux au Tchad au profit des communaut&#233;s locales.&#160;&#187; 

Cent associations f&#233;minines seront aid&#233;es, ce qui b&#233;n&#233;ficiera &#224; 2&#160;500 femmes
environ, dont un bon nombre sont chefs de famille. Ces femmes, soit ne sont
jamais all&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;&#233;cole ou n&#8217;ont pas termin&#233; leur scolarit&#233;, manquent
d&#8217;opportunit&#233;s d&#8217;emploi, ou ont peu d&#8217;actifs &#233;conomiques. Des exemples
d&#8217;activit&#233;s commerciales auxquelles les femmes pourront s&#8217;employer sont la
fabrication du pain, la confection de v&#234;tements, la production de fromages, la
mouture du grain et l&#8217;artisanat. 

Le Tchad se place au 171e rang sur 177 de l&#8217;indice de d&#233;veloppement humain 2006
des Nations Unies et plus des trois quarts de la population vit avec moins d&#8217;un
dollar par jour. Des &#233;tudes confirment que les programmes dont l&#8217;objet est
l&#8217;&#233;ducation des femmes et des jeunes filles produisent un taux de rentabilit&#233;
plus &#233;lev&#233; que tous les autres investissements communautaires disponibles dans
le monde en d&#233;veloppement. Les femmes instruites ont une meilleure sant&#233; et ont
moins de risque de mourir en couches que les femmes qui n&#8217;ont aucune ou peu
d&#8217;instruction. Les enfants de m&#232;res instruites ont plus de chance d&#8217;avoir une
meilleure nutrition et des taux de vaccination plus &#233;lev&#233;s et que leur vie soit
plus longue et plus saine. Il a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; montr&#233; qu&#8217;instruire les femmes et
les jeunes filles contribuait &#224; am&#233;liorer l&#8217;hygi&#232;ne, &#224; &#233;viter la propagation du
VIH/SIDA et am&#233;liorait les revenus familiaux et la croissance &#233;conomique. 

&#192; propos d&#8217;Africare

Africare est un organisme &#224; but non lucratif de premier plan qui se sp&#233;cialise
dans le d&#233;veloppement et l&#8217;aide en Afrique. Il s&#8217;agit aussi du plus ancien et du
plus grand organisme africain-am&#233;ricain dans ce domaine. Depuis sa fondation en
1970, Africare a fourni plus de 710 millions USD en aide et soutien (plus de
2&#160;500 projets et des millions de b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires) &#224; 36 pays dans toute l&#8217;Afrique.
Africare, dont le si&#232;ge international se trouve &#224; Washington DC, a actuellement
des bureaux dans quelque 25 pays africains. Vous trouverez de plus amples
renseignements sur les programmes d&#8217;Africare sur le site www.africare.org. 

&#192; propos de la Fondation ExxonMobil

La Fondation ExxonMobil est la principale branche philanthropique d&#8217;Exxon Mobil
Corporation. La Fondation et la soci&#233;t&#233; prennent part &#224; diverses activit&#233;s
philanthropiques qui font progresser l&#8217;&#233;ducation, la sant&#233; et la science dans

&lt;p&gt;Unterst&#252;tzung von Gesch&#228;ftsgr&#252;ndungen von Frauen wirksamste Methode, um
Wirtschaftswachstum voranzutreiben
N&#8217;DJAMENA, Tschad--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil und Africare teilten heute mit, dass sie ein dreij&#228;hriges, 1,75
Millionen US-Dollar schweres Projekt begonnen haben, dessen Ziel die F&#246;rderung
von Frauen in l&#228;ndlichen Gebieten im S&#252;den des Tschad ist. Im Rahmen des
Projekts sollen die unternehmerischen F&#228;higkeiten der Frauen im Hinblick auf den
Aufbau von Kleinunternehmen gef&#246;rdert und Projekte zur Einkommensgenerierung,
der Erhalt von Mikrokrediten und der Zugang zu M&#228;rkten entwickelt werden. Dies
ist die bislang umfangreichste individuelle Hilfe f&#252;r ein
Wirtschaftsentwicklungsprojekt f&#252;r Frauen im Rahmen der von der ExxonMobil
Foundation ins Leben gerufenen Educating Women and Girls Initiative. 

&#8222;Wir haben die Educating Women and Girls Initiative gegr&#252;ndet, da umfangreiche
Forschungsarbeiten gezeigt haben, dass die Bereitstellung von mehr Bildung und
Ressourcen f&#252;r M&#228;dchen und Frauen eine der effektivsten Methoden zur F&#246;rderung
von Gesundheit und Wirtschaftsentwicklung ist&#8220;, so Rex W. Tillerson, Chairman
und CEO der Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM). &#8222;Als einer der gr&#246;&#223;ten
ausl&#228;ndischen Direktinvestoren ist sich ExxonMobil der Tatsache bewusst, dass es
sinnvoll ist, das Wirtschaftswachstum voranzutreiben und zur
Gesundheitsf&#246;rderung auf dem Kontinent beizutragen. Das ist gut f&#252;r unsere
Mitarbeiter, unsere Nachbarn und unsere Kunden.&#8220; 

Ziel des Projekts im Tschad ist es, die F&#228;higkeiten von Frauenvereinigungen zur
Gr&#252;ndung wichtiger einkommensgenerierender Unternehmen zu st&#228;rken und den Zugang
zu Mikrokrediten zu erweitern. Zudem umfasst es die Schulung von Frauen in
l&#228;ndlichen Gebieten in den Bereichen Gesch&#228;ftsf&#252;hrung, Finanzverwaltung und
Marketing. Das Projekt veranschaulicht die Aktivit&#228;ten der Educating Women and
Girls Initiative, zu denen die Bereitstellung von Schulungen und des Zugangs zu
Finanzressourcen sowie zu Hilfsstrukturen geh&#246;rt, mit dem Ziel, die
wirtschaftliche Existenz der Frauen zu verbessern und die Wirtschaftsentwicklung
in den Gemeinschaften zu st&#228;rken, in denen ExxonMobil t&#228;tig ist. 

Julius E. Coles, Pr&#228;sident von Africare, brachte gegen&#252;ber ExxonMobil seine
aufrichtige Anerkennung f&#252;r den gro&#223;z&#252;gigen Beitrag des Unternehmens zu diesem
wichtigen Projekt zum Ausdruck, das das Leben so vieler Frauen und
Gemeinschaften in den Gebieten Doba und Bebedija im S&#252;den des Tschad ver&#228;ndern
wird. &#8222;Als gemeinschaftsgef&#252;hrte Basisorganisation wird Africare mit Frauen
sowie Gemeinschaften zusammenarbeiten, um profitable Unternehmen und Produkte zu
f&#246;rdern, die ein dauerhaftes Einkommen der beteiligten Unternehmerinnen
gew&#228;hrleisten. Es wird davon ausgegangen, dass das anhand dieser
Wirtschaftseinheiten generierte Einkommen zur Unterst&#252;tzung der Familien der
Frauen verwendet und in weitere Gesch&#228;ftsm&#246;glichkeiten investiert werden wird&#8220;,
so Coles. 

Stephane de Mahieu, General Manager der ExxonMobil-Tochtergesellschaft Esso
Exploration and Production Chad, Inc., kommentierte: &#8222;Mit Freude unterst&#252;tzen
wird dieses ehrgeizige Projekt, das das Leben der Frauen in und um den
&#214;lfeldentwicklungsbereich positiv beeinflussen wird. ExxonMobil arbeitet bereits
seit langer Zeit mit Africare zusammen und ich freue mich auf das Projekt zur
Unterst&#252;tzung der &#246;rtlichen Gemeinschaften im Tschad.&#8220; 

Hilfe wird f&#252;r 100 Frauenvereinigungen bereitgestellt, wovon ca. 2.500 Frauen
profitieren werden, von denen viele der Haushaltsvorstand sind. Diese Frauen
haben entweder niemals die Schule besucht oder diese abgebrochen, verf&#252;gen &#252;ber
wenige Wirtschaftsg&#252;ter oder es gibt keine Besch&#228;ftigungsm&#246;glichkeiten f&#252;r sie.
Beispiele f&#252;r Gesch&#228;ftsunternehmen, die die Frauen in den l&#228;ndlichen Gegenden
gr&#252;nden werden, sind Brotbacken, Schneidern, K&#228;seproduktion, Getreidemahlen
sowie Kunst und Handwerk. 

Der Tschad belegt im Human Development Index der Vereinten Nationen von 2006 den
171. von insgesamt 177 R&#228;ngen. Mehr als drei Viertel der Bev&#246;lkerung lebt von
weniger als einem Dollar pro Tag. Studien belegen, dass Bildungsprogramme f&#252;r
Frauen und M&#228;dchen effektiver sind als alle anderen Investitionsma&#223;nahmen zur
Unterst&#252;tzung von Gemeinschaften in der Dritten Welt. Gebildete Frauen sind
ges&#252;nder und laufen weniger Gefahr, w&#228;hrend der Entbindung zu sterben, als
Frauen ohne oder mit wenig Bildung. Kinder gebildeter M&#252;tter werden mit gr&#246;&#223;erer
Wahrscheinlichkeit besser ern&#228;hrt. Die Immunisierungsraten sind h&#246;her und sie
k&#246;nnen ein l&#228;ngeres und ges&#252;nderes Leben erwarten. Des Weiteren tr&#228;gt die
Bildung von Frauen und M&#228;dchen erwiesenerma&#223;en zur Verbesserung der Hygiene, zur
Verhinderung der Ausbreitung von HIV/AIDS, der Steigerung von Haushaltseinkommen
und zum Wirtschaftswachstum bei. 

&#220;ber Africare

Africare ist eine f&#252;hrende gemeinn&#252;tzige Organisation, die auf Entwicklungshilfe
in Afrika spezialisiert ist. Au&#223;erdem ist sie die &#228;lteste und gr&#246;&#223;te
Organisation unter afroamerikanischer F&#252;hrung in diesem Bereich. Seit ihrer
Gr&#252;ndung 1970 hat die Organisation &#252;ber 710 Millionen US-Dollar f&#252;r mehr als
2.500 Hilfsprojekte und Millionen von Menschen in 36 L&#228;ndern in ganz Afrika
bereitgestellt. Der internationale Hauptsitz von Africare befindet sich in
Washington D. C. mit Zweigstellen in gegenw&#228;rtig ungef&#228;hr 25 L&#228;ndern. Weitere
Informationen &#252;ber die Programme von Africare sind erh&#228;ltlich unter
www.africare.org. 

&#220;ber die ExxonMobil Foundation

Die ExxonMobil Foundation ist der wichtigste philanthropische Zweig der Exxon
Mobil Corporation. Die Stiftung und der Konzern widmen sich einer Reihe
philanthropischer Aktivit&#228;ten zur F&#246;rderung von Bildung, Gesundheit und
Wissenschaft in den Gemeinschaften, in denen wichtige Gesch&#228;ftsbereiche von
ExxonMobil angesiedelt sind. Im Jahr 2007 stellten die ExxonMobil Corporation,
ihre Mitarbeiter und Pension&#228;re, Gesch&#228;ftsbereiche und Tochtergesellschaften und
die ExxonMobil Foundation weltweit 207 Millionen US-Dollar bereit, wovon 70
Millionen US-Dollar f&#252;r Bildung bestimmt waren. Weitere Informationen zu den

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N) is all but certain to pass up its option to take a nearly one-third stake in the world's biggest new refinery in India, as the dawning of a global recession darkens the outlook for the industry's margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. oil major has until June to decide whether or not to increase the 5 percent share it bought in Reliance Petroleum RPET.BO, which is building the 580,000 barrel per day export-oriented refinery in Jamnagar. A Reliance group official said on Friday that the plant had already begun trial runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that $300 million investment, made in 2006 at 60 rupees a share, is now barely profitable as energy markets collapse, and parent firm Reliance Industries (RELI.BO) has already geared up to go it alone as it faces the daunting task of selling more refined fuel into an oversupplied world market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't think they are keen on raising their stake," said a Reliance official, who declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Originally the intent was that they will add value and increase their stake. All value creation technology, capital etc have been arranged by us. Personally I don't see any value creation by them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, whose global refining operations are focused on Asia-Pacific, has about six months to exercise its option to buy an additional 24 percent share at a 5 percent discount to the market price, equivalent to about $1.5 billion after shares fell this year by two-thirds to 72.15 rupees on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Chevron has declined any official comment on whether or not it would take up the option, recent events suggest that it is being quietly abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, Reliance Industries has set up a global oil trading team from Houston to London to Singapore, suggesting that an earlier plan for Chevron to market the refinery's exports in the United States -- the details of which the two sides had struggled to agree -- may have finally fallen through, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Reliance's share of the new refinery -- which sits next to its first 660,000 bpd plant, built almost a decade ago -- would fall below 50 percent, something Chairman Mukesh Ambani may less comfortable with now that he no longer needs Chevron's stamp of approval to ensure funding and global respectability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Chevron's part, the dramatic collapse in oil prices and significant deterioration in refining margins has forced it to reexamine its business plans. The company has delayed announcement of its capex program to the end of January from this month as market conditions had changed "significantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has already pared assets that don't focus on its core Pacific rim business, including its fuel businesses in Western Africa, Nigeria, Brazil, the Netherlands and Uruguay, and suggested this week that more downstream deals could be on the cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I won't advertise any particular rationalization going forward on the refining side," John Watson, Chevron's executive vice president for strategy and investment, said this week in a presentation for Wall Street. "There are some possibilities but I'm not going to speculate what they might be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although Reliance's refinery is intended to have a global reach, its focus seems to be shifting to Africa, Europe and perhaps Latin America, not the U.S. market as originally envisioned when demand was booming three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXPLORATION THRUST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have warned for months that a "golden era" of historically high refining margins since 2005 -- the same year Reliance announced plans to build its new refinery -- is set to end soon as a tranche of new projects in Asia and the Middle East increase fuel supply just as a global recession shrinks demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron has to look at the overall outlook for the refining sector before taking a call on raising its stake. RPL is primarily a diesel refinery and diesel margins have come down and consumption has also tapered off," said Rohit Nagraj, a research analyst at brokerage Prabhudas Liladhar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World oil demand is set to shrink this year for the first time since the early 1980s, a Reuters poll found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Reliance's decision to build the most sophisticated refinery of its scale in the world will almost ensure it makes a profit, some analysts said Chevron is more likely to favor upstream oil developments -- even with crude trading near $40 a barrel -- as crude supply constraints may be more likely to emerge soon, and OPEC should help support prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there's a growing sense among analysts that the over $100 fall in prices since July may be setting the stage for another rally far sooner than a recovery in refining margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Slowing oil sector investment in 2009 sows the seeds of a sharp tightening in market fundamentals if major projects are delayed, the impact being felt three to five years hence after economic recovery regains a foothold," the IEA said last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Jonathan Leff)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 7 (Reuters) - Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS.N),
which last week dipped below their May 1999
initial-public-offering price of $53, cannot fall much further
and should eventually reach $80, Barron's said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bleak headlines and gloomy analyst reports have contributed
to the stock's recent travails, with much of the news focused
on predictions of grim fourth-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Wall Street Journal article, for example, predicted $2
billion in quarterly losses for Goldman, while influential
Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney said much of the capital
injected by the government into banks would be consumed by
write-downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Barron's thinks Sterne Agee analyst Ada Lee, who  
initiated coverage of Goldman three weeks ago with an $80
price target, has a point when she notes that the coming  
results are old news already. "I believe  over the long   
range, the fundamentals remain sound," Lee wrote.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The chief China economist of JPMorgan
Chase warned on Monday that any mismanagement of the yuan
exchange rate, towards excessive weakness of the currency,
could hurt Chinese financial markets and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Frank Gong also lowered his forecasts for the growth of
China's economy in the fourth quarter of this year and next
year, while expecting the government to take further steps to
boost the real estate and equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yuan CNF=CFXS slipped to a five-month low against the
dollar last week, hitting the bottom of its daily trading band
for the first time, as the currency market speculated that
China might engineer moderate depreciation of the yuan to
stimulate its slowing export sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gong said in an interview that he did not expect
extended weakness of the yuan, and that Chinese authorities
would be wrong to push it down significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gong predicted that in the next three months the yuan,
which was at 6.8813 to the dollar early on Monday afternoon,
would stay in a range of between 6.8 and 7.0. Between three and
12 months from now, it would appreciate around 3 percent, he
predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Depreciation of the yuan could trigger competitive
depreciation of other Asian currencies, which would not help
Chinese exporters, he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mismanagement of the renminbi could cause huge capital
outflows and destabilise the A-share market and property market
at a time when confidence is low," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chinese exporters are still outperforming. China should
not resort to devaluation and it would be a wrong policy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GROWTH FORECASTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gong said China's economy now risked a serious
slowdown, and growth might not bottom out until the second
quarter of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our view is near-term risks will be on the downside. We
have very low expectations for fourth-quarter growth.
Basically, we are looking for no growth on a quarter-to-quarter
basis for the fourth quarter," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gong cut his forecast for annual growth of China's gross
domestic product in the current quarter to 7.7 percent, from
8.2 percent predicted one month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He reduced his forecast for GDP growth in all of 2008 to
9.2 percent from 9.4 percent, and his prediction for next
year's growth to 8.0 percent from 8.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gong expects growth to hit a low of 6.8 percent in the
second quarter of 2009 before recovering to 7.7 percent in the
third quarter and 9.9 percent in the fourth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bounce-back in late 2009 would mainly be propelled by a
4 trillion yuan ($580 billion) economic stimulus plan announced
by the government last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And that may not be the end of the story. They are likely
to do more, especially on the consumption front," such as
taking steps to stimulate the property and equity markets, Gong
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the next three months, authorities are likely to
introduce measures such as tax rebates for home buyers, lower
downpayments required for the purchase of second homes, and
easier financing for property developers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government may also keep open the option of possibly
setting up a fund to help stabilise the stock market, Gong
added. "We have been supporting this idea for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC, which
closed at a two-month high of 2,090 points on Monday, should
find firm support at 1,700 points in coming months at least,
having factored in the bulk of negative economic news, Gong
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market should have already bottomed out. However, we
are not ruling out the possibility for the index to test a new
low again in the first quarter of next year" because of
negative news on corporate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Overall, recovery of the market will be very slow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Andrew Torchia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Elop, president of Microsoft's business division, is leading the company's entry into the "software as a service" market, which offers programs that are hosted online instead of downloaded to computer hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using the Web to host software like Microsoft Office, as well as Exchange e-mail and SharePoint collaborative software, Microsoft customers do not need to spend as much money on equipment and maintenance of computer servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we think is in five years, 50 percent of the use of Exchange and Sharepoint could be serviced from the cloud," Elop told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Between now and then, a year or two or whatever, if it's going to be tough economic times, that means we expect quite a lot of movement in that direction, a lot of people taking advantage of that," he added. "I think the economy will help it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's foray into online software services comes amid competition from Google Inc, whose Google Apps provide free Web services including calendar, collaboration, email and messaging software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has said it plans to upgrade its Office business software to include online versions of the popular Word and Excel programs. Elop said the company would soon announce a wide range of services, including free versions supported by advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect fully that the full range of Office utilities, from the most advanced to simpler lightweight versions, will be available with a range of options: ad-funded, subscriptions-based, traditional licensing fees, and so forth. So you should expect to see that full array," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop declined to specify when the services would be launched, but said "in 2009 you're going to see a lot of advance in this area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will likely make a profit from the new initiative within a year after the launch, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said that even the basic, free versions will trump Google Apps in capabilities, and that Microsoft will ensure that users can move Office documents in and out of the Web browser environment without any garbling to the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's advantage against Google is its rich set of software services, he said, adding that this is also a benefit as it competes with network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc, which is also expanding into the Web-based software business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop said recent meetings with customers showed strong interest in upgrading to online software applications, despite worries that a global recession would dampen technology spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We may have underestimated the extent to which customers will move in this direction," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tiffany Wu, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Oil mogul Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) is up more than 5% this afternoon,
benefiting from a 7% leap in the price of crude oil. However, not all the news
is good for the security. Before the open, Argus trimmed its price target for
the shares from $105 to $90. However, this new price target represents a gain of
roughly 15% during the next 12 months from the stock's current price target.
Considering the stock's recent technical performance, one has to wonder if this
12-month target is attainable.

El estudio destaca la oportunidad de migrar hacia sistemas de pago m&#225;s
eficientes. 
MIAMI--(Business Wire)--
La segunda edici&#243;n del estudio comisionado por Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) y
desarrollado por Nielsen, &#8220;Perspectivas de las PyMES en Am&#233;rica Latina&#8221;, revel&#243;
que el 50 por ciento de las micro, peque&#241;as y medianas empresas (PyMES)
encuestadas reportaron un crecimiento con respecto al a&#241;o anterior. En la medida
de este crecimiento, se vuelve m&#225;s relevante la separaci&#243;n de los gastos
personales de los del negocio. Las tarjetas Visa Empresarial son una forma de
pago eficiente que brinda a los due&#241;os de las PyMES una serie de beneficios,
incluyendo el acceso a cr&#233;dito, el cual puede ser un factor clave en el
crecimiento del segmento. 

&#8220;Las PyMES constituyen un segmento estrat&#233;gico para Visa&#8221;, se&#241;al&#243; Allen Cueli,
Director Ejecutivo de Soluciones Comerciales para Visa Am&#233;rica Latina y el

las PyMES en Am&#233;rica Latina, incluyendo sus h&#225;bitos de pago y financiamiento,
los retos y oportunidades a los que se enfrentan, as&#237; como registrar cambios con
respecto al 2007. 

La investigaci&#243;n tambi&#233;n destac&#243; los siguientes resultados:

* 40 por ciento de las PyMES reportaron que contin&#250;an utilizando su tarjeta de
cr&#233;dito personal para prop&#243;sitos del negocio, indicando una oportunidad para la
separaci&#243;n de estos gastos. 
* Aproximadamente el 76 por ciento de las PyMES encuestadas todav&#237;a realiza sus
pagos a trav&#233;s de m&#233;todos ineficientes como el efectivo y los cheques. 
* A nivel regional, la mayor&#237;a de las PyMES est&#225;n registradas como personas
naturales y no como personas jur&#237;dicas, lo que refleja una de las principales
caracter&#237;sticas de este segmento &#8211; la falta de separaci&#243;n entre la figura del
due&#241;o de la empresa y el negocio, y la tendencia a resolver los asuntos
empresariales como si fueran personales. 
* De acuerdo con el estudio, se report&#243; un incremento en la diversificaci&#243;n de
las fuentes de cr&#233;dito con respecto al a&#241;o anterior. La fuente principal de
cr&#233;dito de estas empresas son los pr&#233;stamos bancarios (54 por ciento), seguido
por las tarjetas de cr&#233;dito (31 por ciento), proveedores (25 por ciento) y
familiares o amigos (6 por ciento). 
* Existe una tendencia hacia una mayor formalizaci&#243;n en t&#233;rminos de c&#243;mo est&#225;n
registradas las PyMES y sus pol&#237;ticas de compras. Brasil cuenta con el nivel m&#225;s
alto de empresas registradas (73 por ciento), seguido por Colombia (36 por
ciento) y Argentina (31 por ciento). 
* Las PyMES han aumentado el uso de la tecnolog&#237;a para llevar sus negocios,
incluyendo el uso de tel&#233;fono celulares (64 por ciento), computadoras (55 por
ciento) e Internet (45 por ciento)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS.N), which
last week dipped below their May 1999 initial-public-offering
price of $53, cannot fall much further and should eventually
reach $80, Barron's said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bleak headlines and gloomy analyst reports have contributed
to the stock's recent travails, with much of the news focused
on predictions of grim fourth-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Wall Street Journal article, for example, predicted $2
billion in quarterly losses for Goldman, while influential
Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney said much of the capital
injected by the government into banks would be consumed by
write-downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Barron's thinks Sterne Agee analyst Ada Lee, who   
initiated coverage of Goldman three weeks ago with an $80 
price target, has a point when she notes that the coming   
results are old news already. "I believe  over the long    
range, the fundamentals remain sound," Lee wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Helen Chernikoff; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50 Percent of Surveyed SMBs Reported Annual Growth. The Study Highlighted the
Opportunity to Migrate Towards More Efficient Payment Methods. 
MIAMI--(Business Wire)--
The second edition of the study &#8220;SMB&#8217;s Perspectives in Latin America&#8221;
commissioned by Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and developed by The Nielsen Company,
revealed that 50 percent of Latin American micro, small and medium business
(SMBs) surveyed reported growth from the previous year. As these companies
continue to grow, they increasingly find it relevant to separate business and
personal expenses. Visa Business cards are an efficient payment method that
provides SMB owners with benefits, including access to credit, which can be a
key factor for the segment&#8217;s growth. 

&#8220;SMBs constitute a strategic segment for Visa,&#8221; said Allen Cueli, Senior
Business Leader of Commercial Solutions for Visa Latin America and the
Caribbean. &#8220;Visa delivers a variety of solutions that can help small and medium
businesses&#160;overcome challenges that&#160;were highlighted in the study. We provide a
broad portfolio of products,&#160;as well as educational tools&#160;such as online
seminars that contain relevant information that will help manage their costs and
grow&#160;their business.&#8221; 

The main objective of the study was to obtain an in-depth perspective of how
SMBs operate in Latin America, including their payment and financing habits, the
challenges and opportunities they face and measuring changes from 2007. 

The study also highlighted the following results:

* Forty percent of SMB owners surveyed reported that they continue to use their
personal credit card for business purposes, indicating an opportunity to
separate expenses. 
* Approximately 76 percent of SMBs surveyed still pay for their expenses with
inefficient payment methods such as cash or checks. 
* Regionally, the majority of SMBs surveyed are registered as individuals and
not as legal entities reflecting a key characteristic of this segment: the lack
of separation between the owner as an individual and the company, and the
tendency to take a personal approach to business matters. 
* According to the study, in the last year, there has been an increased
diversification in the types of financing sources that SMBs rely on. Their
primary sources of financing identified by respondents are bank loans (54%),
followed by credit cards (31%), provider credit (25%) and family and friends
(6%). 
* There is a trend towards greater formalization in terms of how surveyed SMBs
are registered as well as their purchasing policies. Brazil has the highest
level of formally registered companies with 73%, followed by Colombia with 36%
and Argentina with 31%. 
* SMBs surveyed are increasingly using technology to conduct business, including
the use of cell phones (64%), computers (55%) and the Internet (45%).

Visa offers a portfolio of business solutions specifically designed to meet SMB
payment needs as well as to help them expand their businesses. Visa Business
Credit, Visa Business Debit, and Visa Business prepaid cards can be strategic
allies for SMBs by offering a convenient method of payment, financial
flexibility through a credit line, access to a current account, promotions,
simplification by the consolidation of payments and a higher level of
organization of business expenses. 

The opportunity to use modern and efficient methods of payment is a reality for
SMBs but especially for small and micro-enterprises. Additionally, it reinforces
its commitment to provide SMBs with products and services that will allow them
to efficiently manage their finances and ultimately stimulate their growth. 

Methodology: The study surveyed a total of 1200 SMBs in five countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean (Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Peru)
conducted during the months of June to August of 2008 with the primary objective
of gaining an in-depth understanding of how SMBs operate, to further comprehend
the financial and payment habits they practice, to continue identifying the
challenges and opportunities they face from a financial perspective as well as
to compare their evolution to the research findings in 2007. This year&#8217;s study
includes additional cities in Mexico and Brazil allowing for a more accurate
representation of these markets. 

About Visa: Visa operates the world&#8217;s largest retail electronic payments network
providing processing services and payment product platforms. This includes
consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments, which are offered under
the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands. Visa enjoys unsurpassed

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Dec 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Tween girls and their moms may not agree on much but a new survey out
today shows that they do agree on what constitutes the best holiday gifts
and which brands both mothers and daughters feel best buying from.

    Tween Girls and Alpha Moms have fueled the success of today's top teen
stars straight to the top of the Billboard charts and box office and have
ignited sales of products like Nintendo Wii -- and they are flexing their
spending power this holiday season.

    In mid-November 2008, AK Tweens, through AllyKatzz.com, the country's
largest and only COPPA compliant safe social networking site for tweenage
girls, surveyed 108 members of their Online Street Team; girls aged nine
to 16, from across America. The open-ended questions asked what gifts
tween girls most wanted this holiday season. The girls' most frequently
cited responses were then presented to a select group of moms, at
Alphamom Labs (the research arm of the influencer site Alphamom.com) all
of whom are moms of tweenage girls of the same age range, for their input
on which gifts and brands chosen they most approved of and would purchase
on their behalf.

    The result? A top ten list of "Girl Pushed, Mom Approved" products and
brands that have captured the hearts and approval (and potentially the
pocketbooks) of both mothers and daughters, two of the most hyper-active
purchasing agents this holiday season. The lucky winners include Apple,
Disney, Nintendo, Target, Converse, Kohl's, Claire's, Nike, and the
Twilight franchise.

    "Girl Pushed, Mom Approved" Top Ten Gift List

    (#1 being most coveted by Girls, and approved by Moms)

    1. GIFT CARDS -- Of the girls' specific choices, Mom's favorites are
Barnes &amp; Noble, Target, iTunes and Claire's. Girls prefer these brands
because the stores sell items on their "gotta have" list (e.g. clothing,
entertainment and makeup). Moms picked these brands because they are
familiar with the retailers and the quality of their merchandise and
approve of their price points.

    2. MUSIC/CDS -- Of the girls' specific choices, Disney artists, The Jonas
Brothers, Miley Cyrus and the High School Musical cast rank highest with
moms because they know them, approve of their song content and believe
their songs are family-friendly.

    3. iPOD OR MP3 PLAYERS -- Apple is the hands down winner for both girls
and their moms, with the iPod Touch ($229) as the girls' most coveted,
followed by Nano ($149).

    4. CLOTHING -- Of the girls' specific clothing retail choices, moms
favored (in order) Old Navy, Kohl's and Limited Too for their large
selection of stylish clothing that remains age-appropriate and affordable.
For footwear, of the girls' specific choices, Moms favored Target as their
#1 retailer overall, and Converse and Nike as their favorite brands, based
again on price and availability of age appropriate selections, and in the
case of Converse and Nike, because Moms themselves have worn and/or are
still wearing the brand so they trust the quality and believe prices are
good.

    5. BOOKS -- Girls' top book titles were Twilight (by a wide margin), The
Clique Series, Dear Dumb Diary, Beacon Street Girls, Petty Little Liars,
Nancy Drew and Wicked. For moms, Twilight and Nancy Drew were the big
winners because moms are most familiar with these titles and/or they are
also reading/have read them.

    6. MOBILE PHONES -- Tween girls want mobile phones because it's their
lifeline to friends. Brand isn't important, but features and colors most
certainly are! Girls want full keyboards, texting and the color pink. Moms
are brand agnostic when it comes to their daughters' phones and instead
make their buying decisions based on their existing family mobile calling
plans.

    7. LAPTOPS -- Girls want them and moms approve and both overwhelmingly
choose Apple (Mac) at 23.2% -- well above Mac's national market share.
However, given the economy, this is the one category where while moms
approve, they aren't buying due to price.

    8. MAKEUP, PERFUME, HAIR ACCESSORIES -- Girls don't have a favorite brand
-- instead they have favorite stores where they shop for these items. Not
surprisingly, girls' top stores that moms approve of are the same
retailers they picked for gift cards -- Target and Claire's.

    9. VIDEO GAME SYSTEMS AND/OR GAMES (TIED FOR NINTH PLACE) -- Moms want
their daughters up on their feet -- of the girls' top choices, moms choose
Dance Dance Revolution, Wii Fit and PopStar Guitar. For video gaming
systems, moms and girls favored Nintendo Wii and DS. Moms pick Wii because
they like to play it themselves and they view it as a "family
system/gift." For specific games, moms approved of any non-violent game
that is appropriate for the entire family and encourages their girls to
do "happy" things like singing and dancing.

    DIGITAL CAMERAS (TIED FOR NINTH PLACE) -- Girls care about color, not
brands! Girls choose pink, lime green, blue and orange, and moms approved.

    10. DVDs -- As with music, Disney is the winner. Of the girls' choices,
Disney movies Camp Rock and High School Musical (1,2, &amp; 3) score the
highest with moms. Simply stated, Disney is the brand moms trust.

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Dec 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and researchers from Harvard University are launching a
new World Community Grid project to discover organic materials to create
a more efficient and lower cost solar cell. The path-breaking effort will
use idle computer power from volunteers to create large supplies of new
clean energy.

    Clean energy sources like solar could supply a vast amount of the world's
energy and help eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels, the cause of
global warming, if they were more efficient and could be developed at
lower cost to make them more widely available.

    Current silicon based solar cells are only about 20 per cent efficient and
cost about $3 per watt of electricity generated. A newer form of solar
powered cells being developed is plastic not silicon based. It holds great
promise because it is flexible, lightweight and most significant is much
less costly to produce.

    IBM will also pilot World Community Grid on a new IBM internal cloud, a
network of services and software, when the cloud is not being fully used
to provide more computing power to the grid. In the future, IBM plans to
expand this capability to clients of IBM cloud computing services if they
choose, so that they can become part of this humanitarian research.

    "World Community Grid members will make this research possible because of
the incredibly large amount of free computing power we will receive," said
Alan Aspuru-Guzik, the principal investigator and a professor in the
Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, at Harvard. "It would take
us about 100 days of computational time to screen each of the thousands of
compounds for electronic properties without the power of World Community
Grid. Yet with World Community Grid's free computing power, augmented by
cloud computing, the project is estimated to complete in 2 years what
would have taken 22 years to run on a regular scientific cluster."

    The research hopes to discover and isolate organic molecules that when
combined can convert more sunlight into electricity and thus produce solar
cells much more inexpensively.

    "IBM believes that this important new study powered by World Community
Grid could provide the planet with a smarter solution to the problem of
low cost solar technology," Stanley Litow, Vice President, IBM, Corporate
Citizenship and Corporate Affairs and President of the IBM International
Foundation. "This project marks an expanded direction to help our society
by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels to make a lasting impact by
hopefully finding new sources of clean energy."

    World Community Grid is the largest public humanitarian grid in existence
with more than 413,000-plus members who represent more than 200 countries
and links to more than one million computers. It is the volunteers that
help make the difference because as each one shares their computer time,
scientists are able to conduct their research faster. For example,


--  The Nutritious Rice for the World has already returned 10 million
transactions and 9,000 years of compute time.
--  The AfricanClimate@Home just completed its data collection and research
analysis will now begin. 
--  Help Defeat Cancer received a $2.5 million grant from NIH to further
deploy its system for cancer research.
--  FightAIDS@Home completed five years of HIV/AIDS research in just six
months.

    
To become of member of World Community Grid and donate unused computer
time, individuals register on www.worldcommunitygrid.org and install a
free, small, secure software program onto their computers. When computers
are idle, data is requested from World Community Grid's server. These
computers then perform the computations, and send the results back to the
server, prompting it for a new piece of work. A screen saver will tell
individuals when their computers are being used.

&lt;p&gt;  DENVER, CO, Dec 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Falcon Oil &amp; Gas Ltd. (TSX-V: FO) today announced that it has entered
into an amendment (the "Amendment") to its April 10, 2008 Production and
Development Agreement (the "PDA") with Exxon Mobil Corporation affiliate
ExxonMobil Hungary (Mako) Limited ("ExxonMobil") and MOL Hungarian Oil
and Gas Plc. ("MOL"). Under the Amendment, the parties agreed to three
principal matters: (1) the parties have agreed to use reasonable efforts
to combine their respective exploration licenses and mining plots to form
one unit consisting of all or part of the Mako Trough; (2) if ExxonMobil
and MOL elect to proceed to the Appraisal Work Program, the parties agree
to expand the area where wells may be located and apply a portion of the
US$100 million Appraisal Work Program expenditures basin-wide in a
combined work program, based on the optimum locations from a technical
basin-wide appraisal standpoint; and (3) if ExxonMobil and MOL elect to
proceed to the Development Work Program, the parties agree to apply 50%
of the US$75 million payment due to Falcon to the same expanded
basin-wide area in a combined work program.

    Amendment to the PDA

    Background to the PDA: As a result of the extensive technical data
developed by Falcon, on May 22, 2007 the Hungarian Mining Authority
granted to Falcon a production license (the "Production License"), which
covers a significant part of the Mako Trough. A substantial portion of
the remaining adjacent area in the Mako Trough is covered by licences,
which are held by MOL and currently operated by ExxonMobil (the "MOL
Area"). On April 10, 2008, Falcon announced the entering into of the PDA
among Falcon, ExxonMobil and MOL, covering a part of the Production
License (the "PDA Area"). ExxonMobil is the contract operator of both the
MOL Area and the PDA Area.

    The Amendment addresses three principal matters:

    (1) Formation of Unit: Falcon, ExxonMobil and MOL all recognize the
significant potential benefits, from an operating efficiency and technical
analysis standpoint, of combining all or a portion of their jointly-owned
interest into one unit. Therefore, they have agreed to commence technical
discussions and use reasonable efforts to combine all or a portion of
their respective interests in the Mako Trough. The Amendment provides that
Falcon, ExxonMobil and MOL will pursue discussions toward that objective,
beginning in the first calendar quarter of 2009.

    (2) Application of Work Commitment Budget: Falcon, ExxonMobil, and MOL are
continuing the Initial Work Program, Phase I of the PDA, on the PDA Area
without any modifications. The Amendment does not affect any aspect of the
ongoing Initial Work Program. If ExxonMobil and MOL elect to proceed to
Phase II of the PDA, the Appraisal Work Program, there will be no change
in the US$50 million which will be paid to Falcon at the time of such
election.

    Under the Amendment, a portion of the US$100 million expenditures which
ExxonMobil and MOL will be committed to spend in Phase II for drilling
wells and related expenditures, will now be applied on the basis of the
optimum well locations from a technical appraisal standpoint. Specifically
at least one well will be drilled on the PDA Area, with a minimum
expenditure of US$25 million and a maximum of US$40 million. The balance
of the US$100 million (the "Appraisal Program Balance") will be applied to
wells either on the PDA Area or within the MOL Area. All seismic and
technical data resulting from the Appraisal Work Program from both the PDA
Area and the MOL Area will be shared among the parties. The parties will
analyze all such data, discuss well locations, the combined work program
and related expenditures through the three companies' joint Operating
Committee, however, the final decision on location of such wells shall be
an ExxonMobil/MOL decision.

    (3) Reallocation of Third Payment: The Amendment further provides that
Falcon agrees to reallocate one-half of the US$75 million payment that is
due to Falcon if ExxonMobil and MOL elect to proceed to the Development
Work Program. Those funds (US$37.5 million) will now be applied in the
same manner as the Appraisal Program Balance to the optimum locations and
operations on a basin-wide technical basis, to be discussed by the
companies' joint Operating Committee, however, the final decision on
location of such wells shall be an ExxonMobil/MOL decision.

    Marc A. Bruner, Chairman and CEO of Falcon, stated, "We are pleased to
enter into the amended terms with ExxonMobil and MOL. The Mako Trough is
potentially an enormous resource, and Falcon regards these modifications
to the April agreement as a significant step forward in optimizing the
ultimate development of Falcon's assets. All parties have a single common
goal, and will greatly benefit from a combined work program."

    Update on drilling program in the Mako Trough

    Falcon is pleased to announce that the Foeldeak 1 well is expected to spud
in January 2009 with the purpose of testing the hydrocarbon potential of
the Szolnok formation as part of the Initial Work Program in the PDA Area.
This well is located approximately 1000 metres from the Mako 6 well.

AmberPoint and Microsoft have a large number of shared customers, including such
industry-leading companies as Cigna, Healthways, MedicAlert, Moodys, T-Mobile,
Trend Micro and Univ&#233;. 

&#8220;Our SOA systems rely heavily on Microsoft, including .NET, Visual Studio and
BizTalk Server, so it&#8217;s important to us that AmberPoint stays closely aligned
with Microsoft,&#8221; said Kevin Forbes, Chief Architect at Healthways. &#8220;We need
visibility and control across our complete environment, including components
running on Microsoft as well as other platforms. In terms of governance and
management capabilities, we benefit from the working relationship between
AmberPoint and Microsoft.&#8221;

can better understand system behavior, manage each transaction flowing across
their distributed environments, and implement policies that automate performance
management, remedy exceptional conditions and uphold security. Significantly,
they can do all this without special coding to the application components or
message tags. AmberPoint's non-invasive architecture allows SOA applications to
evolve and grow without constant recoding to system components. 

&#8220;AmberPoint invests heavily in our strategic relationship with Microsoft,&#8221; said
Gary Rinedollar, AmberPoint&#8217;s Vice President of Alliances. &#8220;In response to
customer demand, we continue to enhance our support for Microsoft SOA

&lt;p&gt;Dec 8 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its price
targets on Boeing Co (BA.N) and its suppliers Precision
Castparts (PCP.N) and Rockwell Collins (COL.N), citing further
expected 787 delays and fewer estimated aircraft deliveries in
2009 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Boeing is expected to announce further delays to its new
787 Dreamliner after taking into account the damage of a
two-month strike by its machinists and a number of production
problems nagging at the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect the impact of the well-reported issues Boeing
continues to experience on the 787 to delay first delivery
until mid-2010, and we are now looking for 25 deliveries that
year, down from 65 previously," analyst Joseph Nadol said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nadol, who rates Boeing "neutral," cut his price target on
the stock to $42 from $46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock is down more than 50 percent in 2008, but there
is room for only modest multiple expansion over the next year,
given the uncertainty over delivery timing and profitability of
the 787 Dreamliner program, and the relatively low growth
potential of Boeing's defense portfolio, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nadol cut his price target on Precision Castparts to $74
from $80 and on Rockwell to $41 from $43. He rates both the
stocks "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect Rockwell and Precision Castparts to trade at a
premium in part due to the fact that 787 work should be more
profitable for these two companies relative to others in
commercial aerospace," Nadol wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rockwell makes flight-deck display, pilot controls and
communication systems for 787. Precision Castparts makes engine
parts and fasteners for Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boeing shares closed at $39.53, while Precision Castparts
shares closed at $51.13 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Rockwell closed at $33.10.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 8 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut the Standard

earnings estimates, and said broad declines in jobs are going
to be seen across many industries.&lt;/p&gt;

from 1,125. The index closed at 876.07 Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unemployment rate is set to rise sharply in mining,

rates in these sectors have not yet reached those seen in prior
recessions, the brokerage said in a note dated Dec. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan cut its earnings view on SP 500 for 2008 by $5
to $71.50 a share, and for 2009 by $10 to $65.00, as part of
its U.S. equity strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said most of the adjustments were in sectors
severely affected by a deepening global recession and lower
commodity prices, like energy, materials, industrials and
technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In fact, this fits within our broader observations that
expectations remain too high in those sectors," JP Morgan
said.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) as the Bull of the
Day and Waddell &amp; Reed Financial (NYSE: WDR) as the Bear of the Day. In
addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Capella Education Company
(Nasdaq: CPLA), MCG Capital Corporation (Nasdaq: MCGC) and Volcano Corporation
(Nasdaq: VOLC). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) 

As a result of large non-US revenue base, IBMhas been better insulated from
recent weakness in the U.S. economy than many of its peers. IBM's Q308 results
indicate its strong position in emerging markets, which should continue to help
drive growth. 

Moreover, the company has focused on driving its bottom line through
cost-cutting efforts. The company's long-term prospects look brighter as it
maintains a strong position in the software and services market. 

We therefore maintain our Buy rating on IBM shares, but lower our target price
to $100.00, given the weak economic environment. 

Bear of the Day: Waddell &amp; Reed Financial (NYSE: WDR) 

Kansas-based Waddell &amp; Reed,one of the nation's oldest mutual fund asset
managers, offers investment management, investment product underwriting and
distribution, as well as shareholder services. 

A slowdown of sales momentum and a sharp decline in assets under management
(AUM) impacted asset-based fee revenue [in its most recent quarter], which led
to an overall decline in revenue across all channels. Assets under management
decreased 14.7% sequentially (though up 0.7% year-over-year) to $59.8 billion as
of September 30, 2008. 

We anticipate the decline in AUM to continue to hurt the top-line for the next
few months, in view of the continued downturn in the global markets. We have
reduced our FY08 and FY09 EPS estimates and downgraded our recommendation on the
shares to a Sell with a six-month target price of $10.75 per share. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Capella Education Company (Nasdaq: CPLA) 

Capella Educationis demonstrating robust revenue growth, primarily from strong
demand and by offering new programs and specializations. Also, earnings growth
since 2006 has been strong. 

Management completed the implementation of the Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) system during the third quarter of 2008. Initially, the transition
negatively impacted employee productivity; however, full operating efficiencies
should be generated in the fourth quarter of 2008. 

MCG Capital Corporation (Nasdaq: MCGC) 

MCG Capitalis a financial services firm that primarily provides capital to
support the internal growth and corporate development initiatives of the
small-to-medium sized private companies in domestic growth industries such as
media, communications, information services and technology. 

In its latest quarter, total revenue decreased 33.5% year-over-year. The company
reduced its workforce by 27% and intends to pay down the statutory minimum
dividend for 2009. It is now focused on opportunistic asset monetization to
preserve its net asset value, deleveraging its balance sheet and preserving
capital to enhance shareholders value. 

However, given current market challenges, we expect greater deterioration in the
originations in coming months. Further, with a substantial exposure to small and
midsized companies, MCGC remains quite susceptible to the economic downturn. We
maintain our Hold rating on the shares. 

Volcano Corporation (Nasdaq: VOLC) 

Volcanodesigns, develops, manufactures, and commercializes a broad suite of
intravascular ultrasound, or IVUS, and functional measurement, or FM, products
that it believes enhance the diagnosis and treatment of vascular and structural
heart disease. 

VOLC reported Q3 EPS that beat our estimate by $0.03 on revenue that exceeded
our forecast. We increased our FY08 revenue and EPS estimates and also increased
our FY09 revenue estimate. Management revised its GAAP and non-GAAP guidance for
FY08.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The chief China economist of JPMorgan Chase warned on Monday that any mismanagement of the yuan exchange rate, toward excessive weakness of the currency, could hurt Chinese financial markets and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Gong also lowered his forecasts for the growth of China's economy in the fourth quarter of this year and next year, while expecting the government to take further steps to boost the real estate and equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yuan slipped to a five-month low against the dollar last week, hitting the bottom of its daily trading band for the first time, as the currency market speculated that China might engineer moderate depreciation of the yuan to stimulate its slowing export sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gong said in an interview that he did not expect extended weakness of the yuan, and that Chinese authorities would be wrong to push it down significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gong predicted that in the next three months the yuan, which was at 6.8813 to the dollar early on Monday afternoon, would stay in a range of between 6.8 and 7.0. Between three and 12 months from now, it would appreciate around 3 percent, he predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depreciation of the yuan could trigger competitive depreciation of other Asian currencies, which would not help Chinese exporters, he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mismanagement of the renminbi could cause huge capital outflows and destabilize the A-share market and property market at a time when confidence is low," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chinese exporters are still outperforming. China should not resort to devaluation and it would be a wrong policy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GROWTH FORECASTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gong said China's economy now risked a serious slowdown, and growth might not bottom out until the second quarter of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our view is near-term risks will be on the downside. We have very low expectations for fourth-quarter growth. Basically, we are looking for no growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis for the fourth quarter," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gong cut his forecast for annual growth of China's gross domestic product in the current quarter to 7.7 percent, from 8.2 percent predicted one month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reduced his forecast for GDP growth in all of 2008 to 9.2 percent from 9.4 percent, and his prediction for next year's growth to 8.0 percent from 8.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gong expects growth to hit a low of 6.8 percent in the second quarter of 2009 before recovering to 7.7 percent in the third quarter and 9.9 percent in the fourth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bounce-back in late 2009 would mainly be propelled by a 4 trillion yuan ($580 billion) economic stimulus plan announced by the government last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And that may not be the end of the story. They are likely to do more, especially on the consumption front," such as taking steps to stimulate the property and equity markets, Gong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next three months, authorities are likely to introduce measures such as tax rebates for home buyers, lower downpayments required for the purchase of second homes, and easier financing for property developers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government may also keep open the option of possibly setting up a fund to help stabilize the stock market, Gong added. "We have been supporting this idea for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which closed at a two-month high of 2,090 points on Monday, should find firm support at 1,700 points in coming months at least, having factored in the bulk of negative economic news, Gong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market should have already bottomed out. However, we are not ruling out the possibility for the index to test a new low again in the first quarter of next year" because of negative news on corporate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, recovery of the market will be very slow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andrew Torchia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In order to expand its kids and family media business in Europe and extend its
brand leadership around the world, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) announced
that one of its subsidiaries has entered into agreements to acquire outstanding
shares of Jetix Europe N.V. (AMEX: JETIX; Reuters: JETIX.AS; Bloomberg:
JETIX.NA) for &#8364; 11 per share, which will bring Disney's ownership of the
pan-European kids entertainment company&#160;to approximately 96%. 

Completion of the transaction is expected to take place before the end of the
year. Following such completion, Disney intends to obtain ownership of 100% of
the shares in Jetix, including through statutory buy-out proceedings. In
addition, Disney and Jetix intend to seek termination of Jetix's listing on
Euronext Amsterdam. 

The acquisition will position Disney to better&#160;serve its large and growing Jetix
audience and distribution partners through improved programming, more targeted
branding, more integrated management,&#160;and implementation of company-wide
synergies. 

&#8220;Television continues to be a strong brand builder for Disney around the world
and this investment enhances our efforts to reach kids and families,&#8221; said Anne
Sweeney, co-chair, Disney Media Networks and president, Disney-ABC Television
Group. &#8220;By achieving operating efficiencies, we will have additional
opportunities to create more family-friendly programming and locally-produced
content across Europe.&#8221; 

Disney acquired its original interest in Jetix Europe (formerly Fox Kids
Europe), which reached 24 million subscribers, when it purchased Fox Family
Worldwide from News Corp. in 2001. 

About Jetix Europe

program distribution and consumer products businesses. Its programming, geared
towards kids age 6-14, currently reaches a combined 137 million television

Vulnerabilities
COLUMBIA, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Open source innovator and SNORT&#174; creator, Sourcefire, Inc. (Nasdaq:FIRE), a
leader in Enterprise Threat Management, announced that the Sourcefire&#174;
Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) has delivered rules to protect Sourcefire
customers and Snort users from all eight Microsoft vulnerabilities disclosed
today. These vulnerabilities impact Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office,
Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Developer Tools and Software, and
Microsoft Server Software. 

&#8220;With today&#8217;s disclosures, Microsoft has shipped more than 75 bulletins,
addressing hundreds of flaws this year alone. This highlights the need for
organizations to remain diligent about their network security,&#8221; said Matt
Watchinski, Senior Director of the Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team.
&#8220;Participating in the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) allows
Sourcefire to combine the earliest possible detection with leading solutions
that enable customers to take a proactive approach to security. This will be
increasingly important as threats continue to increase in 2009.&#8221; 

The Sourcefire VRT created, tested and delivered Snort rules designed to detect
attacks targeting the Microsoft vulnerabilities listed below. These new rules
are included in the latest Sourcefire Security Enhancement Update (SEU) released
today.

* Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-070 &#8211; Critical vulnerabilities in the ActiveX
controls for the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Runtime Extended Files could allow
remote code execution if a user browsed a Web site that contains specially
crafted content. 
* Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-071 &#8211; Critical vulnerabilities in GDI could
allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted WMF image file.
An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete
control of an affected system. 
* Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-072 &#8211; Critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft
Office Word and Microsoft Office Outlook could allow remote code execution if a
user opens a specially crafted Word or Rich Text Format (RTF) file. An attacker
who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of
an affected system. 
* Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-073 &#8211; Critical vulnerabilities could allow
remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using
Internet Explorer. 
* Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-074 &#8211; Critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft
Office Excel that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially
crafted Excel file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities
could take complete control of an affected system. 
* Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-075 &#8211; Critical vulnerabilities in Windows
Search could allow remote code execution if a user opens and saves a specially
crafted saved-search file within Windows Explorer or if a user clicks a
specially crafted search URL. An attacker who successfully exploited these
vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. 
* Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-076 &#8211; Vulnerabilities in Windows Media
components (Windows Media Player, Windows Media Format Runtime, and Windows
Media Services) could allow remote code execution. If a user is logged on with
administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the most
severe vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. 
* Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-077 &#8211; Vulnerability could allow elevation of
privilege if an attacker bypasses authentication by browsing to an
administrative URL on a SharePoint site. A successful attack leading to
elevation of privilege could result in denial of service or information
disclosure.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 9 (Reuters) - Two former JPMorgan Chase  Co

that they were improperly denied overtime pay, a federal judge
has ruled.&lt;/p&gt;

beyond a 40-hour work week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit also contends that when customers challenged
transactions executed by the brokers, the bank improperly
deducted the losses from the workers' commissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan spokesman was not immediately available to
comment on the ruling on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs are seeking compensation for unpaid overtime
wages and for the deductions from the commissions they say they
deserve. Their lawsuit seeks class-action status on behalf of
other employees at the New York-based bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan, in a
written decision dated Monday, denied a petition by JPMorgan to
dismiss the lawsuit. He said the plaintiffs could bring claims
under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and New York labor
law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge, however, threw out one of the plaintiffs' claims
for damages from alleged breach of their employment contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit was filed in December 2006 by Alan Krichman,
who worked at the bank as a financial adviser from July 2004 to
September 2005, and James Howell, who worked in a similar role
from August 2002 to April 2003.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments by Disney CFO, other details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Dec 9 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief
Financial Officer Tom Staggs said on Tuesday that hotel bookings
at its theme parks have partially rebounded due to deep
discounts at Walt Disney World, but TV ad sales face deepening
pressures from the global economic woes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs provided a few more details about the mounting
pressures on the entertainment conglomerate in the weeks since
it reported a steeper-than-expected earnings decline, but he had
little good news for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are operating as if we are going to see this condition
for some time. I'm not going to make any predictions but it
doesn't seem like it's (going to improve) tomorrow," Staggs told
the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said he and Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger planned
no "sweeping" companywide cutbacks and were "pleased" with cost
savings moves independently under way at the four businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said domestic hotel bookings were down about 6
percent in Disney's fiscal first and second quarters, an
improvement over the 10 percent drop the company forecast for
the same period on its Nov. 6 earnings conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He attributed the bump in advance bookings, mainly coming in
the second fiscal quarter, to discounts implemented the same day
Disney announced the grim forecast for its theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are certainly pleased with the uptake there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Park attendance was still running 4 percent behind last
year's first quarter, with international visitors counting as
"the strongest segment," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Near-capacity crowds during the holidays give Disney less
flexibility to cut costs in the current quarter, but "we can do
this as we move into the first part of the year," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'll tailor what we're doing in our parks, in the labor
force, to the demand that we see," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'TOUGH MARKETPLACE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs also provided more clarity about the company's
previous forecast for a drop in ad sales at its ESPN cable
sports networks, saying that sales were running "high single
digit percentages" behind last year in the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the company's ABC broadcast network, prices for scatter,
or spot, advertising were running 10 percent above upfront, or
advance, sales prices but volume was low in the current
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scatter pricing was down over last year's scatter prices,
however, and the uptake of options for second-quarter
advertising time were running "about 10 percentage points below
where we would like to see them," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC and its competitors had "a tough fall season" trying to
regain ratings after the prolonged Hollywood Writers Guild
strike halted new episodes and viewers migrated to cable news
during the election and financial meltdown, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are optimistic and hopeful about midseason but it's a
tough marketplace from an ad perspective," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ad sales at the company's owned-and-operated television
stations were pacing "mid-teen percentages" below the prior year
with the "softness more acute at local stations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also faces tough comparisons and selective
consumers in holiday DVD sales, where the weaker performing
"Prince Caspian" and "Wall-E" must match up against last year's
blockbuster "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" and
international Disney-Pixar hit "Ratatouille," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The DVD business is going to see some impact from the
downturn. How much remains to be seen," he said. "'Wall-E' is
doing well but we're not sure it will do the numbers that
'Ratatouille' did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company plans to invest more in terms of capital
expenditure in fiscal 2009 than it did the prior year, but will
cut back on share buybacks to preserve capital until the credit
market improves, Staggs said.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
This month, Hydrogen Advertising unveiled its latest business-to-business
campaign for Microsoft Online Services (MOS) &#8211; &#8220;The Right Tools. The Right

MOS, a suite of hosted communication and collaboration services that quickly
delivers high-performance benefits to organizations and businesses in any
category. 

Created to reach the technology decision makers at mid- and large-size companies
worldwide, &#8220;The Right Tools. The Right Team.&#8221; campaign demonstrates that
Microsoft Online Services deliver streamlined communications, simplified
management, and business-class security and reliability &#8220;right from the start.&#8221;
Hydrogen conveys this message through a spectrum of Formula One-themed marketing
tools and templates, including product data sheets, employee posters, direct
mail pieces, online banner ads, a microsite and an HTML email. The campaign is
also multi-lingual, translated for French-, German-, Spanish- and
Japanese-speaking channel partners and customers.

About Microsoft Online Services

The Microsoft Online Services is a set of hosted messaging and collaboration
solutions including Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft SharePoint Online,
Microsoft Office Live Meeting, and Microsoft Office Communications Online. These
online services are designed to offer businesses streamlined communication with
high availability, comprehensive security, and simplified IT management. When a
company subscribes to one or more of the services, it connects to the rich
interactivity of on-premises client and server applications with the flexibility
and scalability of Web-based services. Because Microsoft hosts the services, it
reduces a company&#8217;s need to maintain IT services on site. Many organizations
today are moving to this &#8220;software-plus-services&#8221; model, because it decreases
the need to manage hardware and software.

&lt;p&gt;ZURICH, Switzerland--(Business Wire)--
Today, Greater Zurich Area AG and Microsoft Schweiz GmbH have announced a
significant expansion of the Microsoft Development Center in Zurich,
Switzerland. 

Excellent infrastructure, proximity to world-class universities, political and
economic stability, as well as access to a multi-lingual and well-educated
talent pool of IT professionals and developers were the decisive factors for
Microsoft&#8217;s decision to increase the stake in Zurich as its location of choice
for the Development Center expansion. 

Core competencies at the Center are the development of key technologies of
Microsoft&#8217;s Office Communication Server. For example, the standardized
VoIP-based (Voice-over-IP) telephony software for Office Communication Server
2007 has been developed in Zurich for the most part. 

At today&#8217;s inauguration of the new premises in Zurich, Erich Gebhardt, Director
of the Microsoft Development Center in Zurich, said he expected his staff to
grow from currently 45 to 200 in the coming three years. 

&#8220;Software made in Switzerland is a reality with great quality,&#8221; said Gebhardt.
&#8220;It&#8217;s Microsoft Office made in Switzerland.&#8221; According to Gebhardt, the
significant expansion of the Development Center underlines Microsoft&#8217;s strong
commitment to the international IT location Zurich. &#8220;We firmly believe that
Zurich will become one of the top addresses for VoIP companies in the world in
the next 5 years.&#8221; 

As a single workplace of a Microsoft developer entails many more jobs among
suppliers&#8217; industries, the Development Center expansion has been welcomed with
great enthusiasm by international economic location promotion agency Greater
Zurich Area AG. 

&#8220;When a leading global corporation such as Microsoft opens one of its main
global Development Centers in the Greater Zurich Area, we see this as a great
compliment to the business location Greater Zurich Area,&#8221; said Willi Meier, CEO
of the Greater Zurich Area AG. &#8220;But when Microsoft further embarks on an
expansion course and significantly increases its headcount in the Greater Zurich
Area, it clearly sends a global message to the ICT community that is heard way
beyond Swiss borders.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;Latest In Long Series of Setbacks for Oil Giant Claims Amazon Watch
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
An increase in Chevron&#8217;s potential environmental liability in Ecuador to $27
billion is causing concern among Wall Street analysts and shareholders that the
oil giant has failed to set aside sufficient reserves and has not fully
disclosed its risk for what could be one of the largest civil judgments in
history, according to a group closely monitoring the trial. 

At 247WallStreet.com, which provides insight and commentary for U.S. and global
equity investors, analyst Paul Ausick expressed concern, writing: &#8220;[Chevron] has
made no estimate of potential losses in this case nor has it reserved any funds
to pay for damages, so it had better win.&#8221; 

The new $27 billion figure, revised last week from $16 billion primarily because
of new evidence about groundwater contamination and oil-related cancers, is the
latest in a series of setbacks for Chevron in the class action case. In October,
a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously denied
Chevron&#8217;s attempt to force Ecuador&#8217;s government to accept responsibility for the
contamination. In September, two Chevron lawyers and seven former Ecuadorian
government officials were indicted in Ecuador on fraud charges relating to a
purported remediation in the mid 1990s that was used to try to get the case
dismissed. 

Also in October, Ecuador&#8217;s bilateral trade preferences were renewed by the U.S.
Congress despite a concerted lobbying effort by Chevron to block their extension
as a way to influence the outcome of the Ecuador trial. The SEC earlier had
opened a probe of the company to determine compliance with disclosure
obligations relating to the case. 

The trial is in Ecuador at Chevron&#8217;s request after the case was filed in U.S.
federal court in 1993 by 30,000 plaintiffs alleging that Texaco (bought by
Chevron in 2001) created one of the worst oil-related contaminations on the
planet. 

Several institutional shareholders who own Chevron stock or follow the company
expressed concern about the company&#8217;s approach to its Ecuador problem:

* Shelly Alpern, who represents Trillium Asset Management in Boston, said the
announcement of the $27 billion claim, &#8220;is the latest in a series of setbacks
for Chevron related to the litigation.&#8221;

Alpern added: &#8220;We believe Chevron&#8217;s management thought it could keep this case
hidden from investors, a strategy that has backfired miserably because it failed
to recognize the magnitude of public interest in the case worldwide&#8230; It is time
for Chevron to rethink what can be gained by continuing to fight what seems to
be an increasingly inevitable and embarrassing judgment of enormous financial
magnitude.&#8221;

* Newground Social Investment released a statement referencing the $27 billion
figure that said: &#8220;Profligate and risky behavior of this sort must be reined in
&#8211; both for straightforward decency and human value considerations, but also
because it damages long-term financial liability.&#8221; 
* Jack Ucciferri, an investor with Harrington Investments in California, said in
reference to the damages claim: &#8220;It seems it is time for Chevron&#8217;s directors to
get this issue behind them and take the company in a new direction&#8230;
Unfortunately for [Chevron management]&#8230; this Ecuador liability of roughly $27
billion threatens to wipe out more than a full year of profit. And if that
number isn&#8217;t scary enough for shareholders, apparently Chevron has not reserved
any funds to cover that potential liability.&#8221; 
* Sanford Lewis, an attorney and expert in corporate disclosure rules, said
Chevron now has the &#8220;duty to update their shareholders on the late $11 billion
increase in projected liability. Also, since they have asserted these figures
are not a good estimate of their actual exposure, it seems to be high time for
the company to provide either a worst case or best estimate if their legal and
factual assumptions fail to be accurate.&#8221;

(Complete statements can be found at www.chevrontoxico.org) 

In private documents used as part of its Washington lobbying campaign, Chevron
had indicated several months ago that it was expecting a &#8220;significant adverse
judgment&#8221; in the case. &#8220;But the company has not disclosed that bleak assessment
in its public filings with the SEC as required by law,&#8221; said Mitch Anderson,
Corporate Accountability Campaigner at Amazon Watch, an environmental
organization that has been monitoring the trial. 

Chevron for the first time in May mentioned the long-running case in its SEC
filings but downplayed the risk claiming the expert report is not an &#8220;adequate&#8221;
basis for a damages claim and that the company could not estimate the potential
loss. &#8220;Such a statement contradicts what Chevron management is saying privately
in other forums about the nature of the actual risk,&#8221; said Anderson. 

The lawsuit charges that Texaco deliberately dumped billions of gallons of toxic
waste into Amazon waterways and abandoned more than 900 waste pits, creating a
public health catastrophe and decimating five indigenous groups over an area the
size of Rhode Island. Texaco was the sole operator of a concession in the area
from 1964 to 1990 that included 378 wells and oil production facilities. 

Chevron now claims it is the victim of an unfair trial process, but the
plaintiffs counter that the scientific evidence found by the court expert
indicates all 94 Chevron sites inspected during the trial are contaminated with
life-threatening carcinogens. A group of U.S. scientists who have reviewed the
damages assessment called the $27 billion figure reasonable compared to large
clean-ups in the U.S., and concluded that the methods used by the expert and his
team of 14 technical experts were sound. 

Since Texaco left the region, Ecuador&#8217;s state-owned oil company has taken over
the oil fields and significantly improved environmental standards, although
problems remain, according to the plaintiffs.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs analyst Daniel Harris

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Dec 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Shift4 Corporation, a supplier of secure payment processing services,
received validation from Visa's Payment Application Best Practices (PABP)
for its patent protected 4Go with SafeSwipe(TM) technology. Shift4's
web-based payment gateway DOLLARS ON THE NET(R) with 4Go(TM) makes
third-party point-of-sale (POS) and property management systems (PMS)
compliant with PAPB so merchants can quickly, accurately, and securely
process credit, debit, and gift card transactions.

    On July 1, 2010, all credit card processors and bank card acquirers must
ensure their merchants and agents use only PABP compliant applications.
With mandates already in place for Level 3 and Level 4 merchants to be
PCI DSS compliant or use PABP-compliant applications, Shift4's 4Go with
SafeSwipe validation is very timely for all merchants.

    "Today merchants have a low-cost solution that can quickly and easily
address their most critical payment system security and compliance demands
without any interruption of their current operations. With 4Go in play,
the merchant system never stores, processes, or transmits real cardholder
data, which greatly simplifies PCI and reduces the risk of cardholder
data being stolen or lost. Stated in most simple terms, they can't steal
what you don't have," said J.D. Oder II, Founder and CTO, Shift4
Corporation.

    4Go is a driver-based, cardholder data firewall that does not allow credit
card information to enter a POS/PMS system. It handles swiped and/or
manually keyed cardholder data through secured data channels and returns
false cardholder data to an underlying POS/PMS so that no actual
cardholder data exists in the systems' application's logs, database, or
transport mechanisms. The actual cardholder data is sent to Shift4's PCI
compliant data centers for secure storage outside of the POS/PMS system.

    Many of today's leading software providers are actively certifying their
systems with Shift4's 4Go technology and include:


--  AutoClerk: "We are proud to partner with Shift4 and integrate their
    4Go technology into the AutoClerk Property Management System software.
    When 4Go technology is used in conjunction with other Visa PABP validated
    applications, such as AutoClerk's Visa PABP validated software, the result
    is end-to-end PC data security for the hotelier.  Since a chain is only as
    good as its weakest link, this should prove to be a new high watermark in
    hospitality data security," said Gary Gibb, President, AutoClerk.

--  PAR Technology: "PAR Springer-Miller Systems is committed to providing
    our customers with the most secure and innovative data security
    technologies available today; therefore, we are pleased to integrate
    Shift4's 4Go into our suite of products," stated Chris Donahue, PAR
    Springer-Miller's Integration Product Manager.

--  SoftBrands: "We are excited to offer our customers a secure,
    enterprise-wide gateway solution from Shift4 that can reduce their burden
    of PCI compliance.  The integration of 4Go into the SoftBrands platforms
    gives hoteliers the confidence that their brand is protected because all
    cardholder information is stored in a safe environment and not at the
    property," stated Bob Lowe, Vice President Product Management Hospitality.
    

    
"This is a significant commitment on the part of our partners in an
effort to secure merchants, in addition to providing them with the tools
to better manage their business," stated John Mann, Vice President of
Sales, Shift4 Corporation.

    Other leading providers committed to integrating 4Go include Agilysys,
Radiant Systems, POSitouch, Squirrel Systems, and many more.

    "As a merchant advocate and participating member of the PCI Security
Standards Council, Shift4 continues to invest substantial resources to
protect credit card information. Our robust, enterprise-wide solution
DOLLARS ON THE NET with 4Go SafeSwipe delivers Real Security, an
environment where no cardholder data exists within the merchant system,
thereby limiting the PCI burden and risk of brand damage in the event of
a breach. With our 4Go solution in place, many more merchants will be
able to achieve and maintain compliance with PCI requirements," said Dave
Oder, President and CEO, Shift4 Corporation.

&lt;p&gt;New technology helps asset managers reconcile billing and collect owed fees
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan today launched a Separately Managed Account billing technology that
provides asset managers with a faster and more accurate way to collect fees they
are owed. The module, offered by J.P. Morgan Managed Account Solutions,
calculates all the billable events that occur in the SMA process at each of a
manager&#8217;s sponsor relationships, identifying all differences outside of a
flexible tolerance range and outputting the appropriate details that can then be
directed back to the sponsor for review and resolution. The automated billing
system also allows asset managers to independently calculate their expected
revenue from sponsors. 

J.P. Morgan developed the solution with Redi2 Technologies, a leading software
provider that exclusively focuses on fee billing solutions for the global
financial services industry, and Vestmark Inc., an enterprise software company. 

&#8220;In today&#8217;s competitive and volatile environment, asset managers are looking
closely at the bottom line and at new ways to bring in more revenue,&#8221; said Scot
Knight, executive director and product manager of J.P. Morgan Managed Account
Solutions. &#8220;This solution provides a detailed, accurate and efficient way to
ensure that they are collecting every penny that is due to them. It is the
latest in a long line of added-value services we offer to administer SMAs.&#8221; 

J.P. Morgan is a leading provider of outsourcing solutions for SMA managers and
sponsors. The firm offers an integrated suite of services designed to allow
investment managers, sponsors and overlay managers to outsource their
operational and administrative SMA infrastructure. The firm's full-service
customized platform provides complete coverage including account workflow,
reconciliation, trade support, billing and performance reporting.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Dec 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Actimize, a leading provider of transactional risk management software
for the financial services industry and a NICE Systems company, today
announced it has expanded its IBM partnership embedding IBM technology in
its risk management platform to further help financial institutions
monitor and investigate financial crimes.

    Actimize has implemented and embedded IBM's InfoSphere Global Name
Recognition (GNR) technology within the Actimize enterprise risk
management platform to enhance its analytical capabilities. GNR is an
enterprise tool designed to help organizations understand, analyze and
process multi-cultural names to provide name processing and matching
capabilities for mission critical and corporate wide applications. Based
on 20 years of computational linguistic research, GNR relies on
intimately understanding a name, its patterns and real-world usage as
opposed to key-based technologies that match on alphanumeric keys which
represent a name.

    Actimize risk management analytics help financial institutions manage
fraud risks associated with moving money and processing transactions more
efficiently, while assisting such firms to comply with 'know your
customer' and other anti-money-laundering regulatory requirements.

    Financial crimes come in many flavors. While firms obviously need to
evaluate each customer, counterparty and transaction carefully for
potential fraud, they must also comply with regulatory requirements to
uncover money laundering, terrorist financing and market manipulation.
Many countries have adopted strict rules requiring firms to understand
fully who they do business with and the sources of their clients' and
counterparties' monies. The challenge lies in properly matching across
vastly different cultural and language barriers within a robust financial
crime fighting, enterprise platform.

    The IBM InfoSphere GNR technology will help Actimize's sophisticated
analytical models focus more closely on the names of different customers,
citizens, criminals and other individuals by examining and comparing them
to different known names of good and bad entities. It works by analyzing
name order, multiple titles or prefixes, cultural spelling variations,
possible transposition errors, nicknames and more. Once the Actimize
solution, utilizing IBM's GNR, identifies a match, Actimize routes the
transaction either as approved or blocked or forwards an alert to the most
relevant investigator for further action.

    "Actimize and IBM have worked together for several years delivering
mission critical solutions," says Amir Orad, EVP and CMO at Actimize. "Our
transactional monitoring analytical solutions are used to uncover money
laundering, fraud and suspicious securities trading. With GNR, we'll be
able to deliver even more value to our customers."

    "During this current financial crisis, new types of fraud are emerging
which present both operational and financial risks, further threatening
the reputation of our banking and financial markets clients," says Martin
Goulet, IBM Financial Services Sector Risk Solutions. "Providing the right
balance of detective and preventive controls is a real challenge. The
Actimize Risk Management Platform, with our embedded InfoSphere Global
Name Recognition (GNR) software, delivers a highly competitive compliance
and fraud risk mitigation solution to help combat financial crimes."

    About Actimize

    Mitigating transactional risk across enterprise silos, Actimize is a
leading provider of software solutions for anti-money laundering,
brokerage compliance and fraud prevention. Built on a patented, scalable
and extensible analytics platform, Actimize solutions enable financial

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK &amp; ROME, Italy--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc (Pfizer) and Sigma-Tau Industrie Farmaceutiche Riunite S.p.A
(Sigma-Tau), a privately owned Italian pharmaceutical company, announced today
that they have entered into a license and supply agreement under which,
following applicable regulatory submissions and approvals, the companies will
market Eurartesim&#174;, a novel fixed dose artemisinin-based combination therapy
(ACT), in Africa. 

Eurartesim&#174; (dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine), a Phase III product candidate,
aims to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults and
children, while reducing the potential for re-infection. The product candidate,
developed jointly by Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and Sigma-Tau, is
expected to be filed for registration with the European Medicines Agency and the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2009. Eurartesim&#174; has already been granted
orphan drug status by both the European and U.S. regulatory authorities. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all uncomplicated malaria be
treated with ACTs. This policy is designed to reduce drug resistance which has
rendered the most widely used monotherapies, such as chloroquine, useless in
many parts of the world. 

Malaria continues to be an endemic disease in sub-Saharan Africa and is one of
the leading causes of infant mortality. The WHO estimates 881,000 deaths
worldwide due to malaria in 2006, of which more than 90 percent occurred in
Africa. 

&#8220;Pfizer is excited about our collaboration with Sigma-Tau,&#8221; said Jean-Michel
Halfon, president and general manager, Emerging Markets, Pfizer Inc. &#8220;The
effective treatment of malaria, a preventable and treatable disease, is an
essential need for patients in many countries in Africa and around the world.
This agreement to make Eurartesim&#174; available supports Pfizer&#8217;s vision to serve
the needs of patients in developing countries and to improve global access to
essential medicines.&#8221; 

Under the agreement, Pfizer and Sigma-Tau will ensure access to this novel
medicine in Africa in collaboration with the various local stakeholders.
Following applicable regulatory submissions and approvals, Pfizer will market
the drug in the public and private sectors locally in Africa, and Sigma-Tau will
be responsible for the institutional sector. Further details of the financial
terms were not disclosed. 

&#8220;Sigma-Tau is delighted to announce this alliance with Pfizer. By combining our
respective resources and expertise, we are confident we will powerfully tackle
one of the greatest public health threats of all time,&#8221; said Ugo Di Francesco,
Vice President and Chief Executive Officer at Sigma-Tau. &#8220;Sigma-Tau is firmly
committed to providing its contribution to the eradication of malaria.
Throughout the past century and until 1964, when the last case of malaria was
reported in Italy, our country fought, and finally won, the tough battle against
malaria (&#8220;malaria&#8221; is, after all, an Italian word). Through the development of
new, effective treatments such as Eurartesim&#174;, we like to think that the same
results can be achieved in countries, especially in Africa, where malaria
continues to be an endemic disease.&#8221; 

"Currently, quality ACTs are practically non-existent in the private market in
Africa, where many people get their anti-malarials&#8221; said Chris Hentschel, CEO
and president of Medicines for Malaria Venture. &#8220;The Pfizer and Sigma-Tau
alliance has the potential to make a huge impact in getting this life-saving
medicine to those in need. As the co-developer of this medicine, we are
delighted by this alliance because, ultimately, the measure of our success will
be how many lives we can save."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc (Pfizer) and Sigma-Tau Industrie Farmaceutiche Riunite S.p.A
(Sigma-Tau), a privately owned Italian pharmaceutical company, announced today
that they have entered into a license and supply agreement under which,
following applicable regulatory submissions and approvals, the companies will
market Eurartesim&#174;, a novel fixed dose artemisinin-based combination therapy
(ACT), in Africa. 

Eurartesim&#174; (dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine), a Phase III product candidate,
aims to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults and
children, while reducing the potential for re-infection. The product candidate,
developed jointly by Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and Sigma-Tau, is
expected to be filed for registration with the European Medicines Agency and the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2009. Eurartesim&#174; has already been granted
orphan drug status by both the European and U.S. regulatory authorities. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all uncomplicated malaria be
treated with ACTs. This policy is designed to reduce drug resistance which has
rendered the most widely used monotherapies, such as chloroquine, useless in
many parts of the world. 

Malaria continues to be an endemic disease in sub-Saharan Africa and is one of
the leading causes of infant mortality. The WHO estimates 881,000 deaths
worldwide due to malaria in 2006, of which more than 90 percent occurred in
Africa. 

&#8220;Pfizer is excited about our collaboration with Sigma-Tau,&#8221; said Jean-Michel
Halfon, president and general manager, Emerging Markets, Pfizer Inc. &#8220;The
effective treatment of malaria, a preventable and treatable disease, is an
essential need for patients in many countries in Africa and around the world.
This agreement to make Eurartesim&#174; available supports Pfizer&#8217;s vision to serve
the needs of patients in developing countries and to improve global access to
essential medicines.&#8221; 

Under the agreement, Pfizer and Sigma-Tau will ensure access to this novel
medicine in Africa in collaboration with the various local stakeholders.
Following applicable regulatory submissions and approvals, Pfizer will market
the drug in the public and private sectors locally in Africa, and Sigma-Tau will
be responsible for the institutional sector. Further details of the financial
terms were not disclosed. 

&#8220;Sigma-Tau is delighted to announce this alliance with Pfizer. By combining our
respective resources and expertise, we are confident we will powerfully tackle
one of the greatest public health threats of all time,&#8221; said Ugo Di Francesco,
Vice President and Chief Executive Officer at Sigma-Tau. &#8220;Sigma-Tau is firmly
committed to providing its contribution to the eradication of malaria.
Throughout the past century and until 1964, when the last case of malaria was
reported in Italy, our country fought, and finally won, the tough battle against
malaria (&#8220;malaria&#8221; is, after all, an Italian word). Through the development of
new, effective treatments such as Eurartesim&#174;, we like to think that the same
results can be achieved in countries, especially in Africa, where malaria
continues to be an endemic disease.&#8221; 

"Currently, quality ACTs are practically non-existent in the private market in
Africa, where many people get their anti-malarials&#8221; said Chris Hentschel, CEO
and president of Medicines for Malaria Venture. &#8220;The Pfizer and Sigma-Tau
alliance has the potential to make a huge impact in getting this life-saving
medicine to those in need. As the co-developer of this medicine, we are
delighted by this alliance because, ultimately, the measure of our success will
be how many lives we can save."

&lt;p&gt;  ZURICH, SWITZERLAND, Dec 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Ringier AG, Switzerland's largest publishing house, has deployed a
unified communications solution built on fully-integrated technologies
from Nortel(1) (TSX: NT)(NYSE: NT) and Microsoft Corp.

    Unified communications will enable Ringier to accelerate the flow of
information across the company, helping its journalists get world news
out faster. The solution also helps to reduce operating costs, increase
productivity and simplify the Ringier IT environment.

    "We expect to see productivity increase, especially for our journalists,
by as much as 20 percent by using integrated communication tools from
Nortel and Microsoft," says Hansjoerg Grolimund, project leader and head
of collaboration and communication, Ringier AG. "As market leaders,
Nortel and Microsoft offered a complete, one-stop shop solution as well
as the services and support we sought. The one-click desktop access for
video, VoIP, presence and instant messaging provides real value to
editors and journalists who can work more efficiently from anywhere and
keep in touch with critical resources at all times."

    Ringier chose unified communications from the Innovative Communications
Alliance (ICA), an industry partnership between Microsoft and Nortel to
deliver industry-leading unified communications solutions to enterprises.
The solution was chosen because it was simpler than competitors, not
requiring third-party components to deliver features such as VoIP, voice
mail, e-mail, instant messaging or Web conferencing. By integrating these
capabilities, unified communications gives users the ability to have one
telephone number that can ring to multiple devices including their Nortel
desktop phone, the Microsoft PC Mobile Client or mobile phone. Other
features include presence awareness and the ability to click-to-call
users from any Microsoft device. Nortel Global Services was used
alongside Swisscom's comprehensive design and implementation verification
services to minimize the risk of the combined deployment and to leverage
the broad expertise Nortel gained from worldwide deployments with
Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007.

    "By merging its separate communications and collaboration tools into a
single, unified communications environment, Ringier's information
technology tools are less complex to use and easier to manage," said
Thomas Marfurt, country leader, Nortel Switzerland. "In 2009, Ringier
plans to have 3,000 employees in Switzerland using the new solution.
Nortel will continue to work with Ringier to maximise the network's
availability, redundancy, ease of management, configuration and security."

    The Ringier unified communications environment is built around Microsoft
Office Communications Server 2007 and Nortel's flagship Communication
Server (CS) 1000 and provides a broad range of end devices to fit the
needs of the very different workplaces in a media company. Microsoft
Office Clients for mobile worker, LG/Nortel 8500 series phones and over
1000 Nortel IP Phones are planned to maximize communication flows in
Ringier. Swisscom, a Nortel Gold Solutions partner, is leading the
project with Nortel unified communications consulting services to enable
early adoption and a fast deployment of new technology to the customer.

&lt;p&gt;  HAIFA, ISRAEL, Dec 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM's (NYSE: IBM) Research Department has partnered with Samsung
Electronics to develop a cutting edge solution that facilitates the reuse
of embedded software using a component-based development approach. With
consumer electronics software becoming increasingly complex and new
variations in product lines becoming the defacto, consumer electronics
companies are urgently looking for better ways to reuse the software they
produce. By introducing the use of modeling and standards for components
and architectures of product lines, the new technology developed by IBM
researchers and Samsung can enable consumer electronics manufacturers to
boost productivity, lower software development costs, and reduce the
total time to market.

    "The best way to meet these demands for mass customization is through the
introduction of software engineering methodologies and tools that will
enable the industry to benefit from higher levels of automation and
interoperability," explained Julia Rubin, Manager of Model Driven
Engineering Technologies at the IBM Haifa Research Lab. "By creating a new
component market, the consumer electronics industry can be transformed
from a production arena to an integration discipline."

    The collaboration between Samsung and IBM is part of IBM's First of a Kind
program for new research innovations. The program brings IBM Researchers
together with other companies to create industry-changing, first of a kind
technologies. Samsung experts joined forces with IBM researchers to
develop the component modeling technology. The two companies worked
closely to improve the modeling language and tooling, and ultimately
produce the new solution.

    Printers are an example of a consumer electronics product line with a
variety of models that could benefit from software reuse and simplified
customization. A single printer model may have a number of variations,
each with different combinations of features and functions. These
variations in components include color or black and white printing,
scanners, faxes, copiers, and more. Much of the software for each of
these printer models is identical, while other individual component
variations need to be developed and managed before manufacturing the
different models.

    "Incorporating smarter mechanisms such as model validation and code
generation has the potential to significantly improve the development
process," noted Dr. Jagun Kwon, Senior Engineer at Samsung Electronics
Software Laboratories in Korea. "The new development environment provided
obvious benefits and was relatively easy to learn for anyone already
familiar with component modeling."

    The new technology has a potential to reduce the cost of creating,
modifying, and maintaining consumer electronics product lines by improving
the productivity of consumer electronics software development and
decreasing time to market. Much of this savings will come from the
efficient re-use of existing components in new products, the integration
of off-the-shelf components into new product lines, and the standardized
interfaces available with model driven development.

    Combining the composition of software components with product-line
requirements, The new IBM technology works as a plugin to the familiar
Rational development environment and is based on the UML standard modeling
framework. Developers can automatically generate various product artifacts
including build scripts and production-level code for each variation of a
product. It also facilitates the move from legacy components and
methodologies to model-driven development with the benefits of software
development at a higher level of abstraction and with increased
automation.

    In addition to the new research collaboration, IBM recently took a
detailed look at the electronics industry and has developed a report
titled, "Rebooting the Electronics Industry," which illustrates ways
electronic companies can operate efficiently in the new economic
environment. The current economic environment is challenging global
business leaders to aggressively rethink their strategies. Across the
electronics industry, effects are likely to be quite different,
reflecting the enormous diversity of the industry itself. From consumer
electronics to medical devices, industry sub-segments will have to
respond -- each in its own way -- to lower consumer spending and stricter
access to capital while continuing to value the necessity to innovate. To

Here are highlights from Monday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:

ASM Int'l a Semicon Play to $10

ASM International N.V. (NASDAQ: ASMI) is an OEM [original equipment
manufacturer] of both front-end and back-end semiconductor manufacturing
equipment. 

Last June, Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) offered to buy two of ASM's
units for $400 million to $500 million. ASM has so far shunned all offers and
the deal appears off for now. 

DeVry a Good Buy in This Climate

Headquartered outside Chicago, Illinois, DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV) is a provider of
post-secondary education in North America. Management continues to execute well
with the company reporting positive enrollment trends since its turnaround in
fiscal 2006. In addition, management is executing a five-year strategic plan
that focuses on four growth priorities in order to drive growth while
maintaining the company&#8217;s financial strength. 

Finally, the ongoing real estate optimization strategy and incremental
acquisitions are adding to the company&#8217;s earnings potential. Therefore, the Buy
rating is maintained. 

Capella Eductn Sings a New Tune

Capella Education Company (NASDAQ: CPLA) is demonstrating robust revenue growth,
primarily from strong demand and by offering new programs and specializations.
Also, earnings growth since 2006 has been strong. 

Management completed the implementation of the Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) system during the third quarter of 2008. Initially, the transition
negatively impacted employee productivity; however, full operating efficiencies
should be generated in the fourth quarter of 2008. 

Buy IBM Shares Up to $100

As a result of large non-US revenue base, IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) has been
better insulated from recent weakness in the U.S. economy than many of its
peers. IBM's Q308 results indicate its strong position in emerging markets,
which should continue to help drive growth. 

Moreover, the company has focused on driving its bottom line through
cost-cutting efforts. The company's long-term prospects look brighter as it
maintains a strong position in the software and services market.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 9 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities began coverage of
the European auto sector with a cautious view for the near
term, but said it expected attractive entry points as early as
the first quarter of 2009 once certain negative equity
fundamentals played out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Western European car sales or seasonally adjusted annual
rate (SAAR) of sales could continue to see sequential declines
through the first quarter of 2009, analyst Ranjit Unnithan
wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAAR is a closely tracked indicator of auto industry
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also expects fourth-quarter earnings as well as
dividend outlook for 2009 to be weaker than consensus
expectations for the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global automakers have been cutting production and
investment with the industry facing an uncertain future as
tight credit conditions and deepening consumer uncertainty
cripples sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unnithan, however, said that relatively strong industry
balance sheets should help the sector weather this downturn
better than previous downturns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry restructuring would also prove to be a key
investment driver for the sector, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Restructuring is unlikely until the second half of next
year, but has the potential to add 100-200 basis points to
operating margins, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also initiated Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) with an
"overweight" rating and a share price target of 30 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The near-term newsflow on Daimler could be negative
(earnings miss, dividend cut) but the new E-Class arriving in
the second quarter of 2009 should provide a boost to earnings
during the second half, he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst rated Renault SA (RENA.PA) and PSA
Peugeot-Citroen (PEUP.PA) "underweight".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At Renault, the risk of a dividend cut looms and leverage
could end up being the worst among mass market carmakers,"
Unnithan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peugeot does not have any major launches from an earnings
perspective and is also likely to see deteriorating leverage,
he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Peugeot were down 2 percent at 12.90 euros, while
those of Daimler were up 3 percent at 25.30 euros at 1012 GMT.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Nokia (NOK1V.HE)
to "neutral" from "sell," saying emerging market risks are now
better understood and earnings estimates and the management's
outlook are more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company's smartphone product portfolio is recovering,
reducing product risk in 2009, analyst Tim Boddy said in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While macro uncertainty remains high, we believe that
Nokia's 'survivorship premium' is likely to expand if the
outlook worsens further," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry conditions are now so bad that any further
deterioration is likely to benefit the world's top cellphone
maker as its rivals struggle to survive, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He raised his price target on the stock to 10.5 euros from
9.5 euros. Shares of Nokia were trading at 11.18 euros by 0913
GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Dec. 4, Nokia said sales of mobile phones were shrinking
faster than expected as consumers were cutting back on
spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its second warning in three weeks, Nokia also said
handset market volumes were expected to fall by at least 5
percent next year, something many analysts, including Boddy,
were already expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman analyst made no change to his bearish 2009
outlook for a sharp decline in handset volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nokia had said it expects to win back market share in
smartphones, where it has lost ground to Research In Motion
RIM.TO and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

&lt;p&gt;Worldwide Precision Tool Maker Improves Design Cycle Times and Product Quality
Using ENOVIA SmarTeam and CATIA
V&#201;LIZY, France--(Business Wire)--
IBM and Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS) (Paris: DSY)&#160;(NASDAQ:DASTY) (Euronext Paris:
#13065, DSY.PA), a world leader in 3D and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)
solutions,announced today that ISCAR, a worldwide supplier of precision carbide
metal working tools, has chosen their ENOVIA SmarTeam and CATIA Product
Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions. By using ENOVIA SmarTeam to create a
unified environment for managing its CATIA digital design data, ISCAR is
enabling all users across departments, from engineering to manufacturing, to
participate in collaborative product development processes. 

ISCAR, part of the IMC Group, is leveraging the DS PLM solution to accelerate
design cycles and enhance product quality by improving management of its rich 3D
design data and streamlining design approvals. ISCAR&#8217;s success to date
illustrates the value of a combined CATIA and ENOVIA SmarTeam solution for
large-scale, sophisticated engineering environments, requiring high stability,
scalability and extended functionality for their concurrent design requirements.


To achieve these design-related goals, ISCAR chose to deploy ENOVIA SmarTeam&#8217;s
collaborative engineering solution to support advanced CATIA
design-to-manufacturing processes. The new concurrent design environment will
span all CATIA V5 and SmarTeam seats across the company&#8217;s sites worldwide. 

&#8220;We chose ENOVIA SmarTeam for its excellent integration with CATIA,&#8221; said Moshe
Rudko, manager, Engineering Information Technology (EIT) division, ISCAR. &#8220;By
expanding our 3D design solution to gain greater control and efficiency, we
shorten our design cycles and improve product quality by closing the product
development loop through to integrated downstream manufacturing processes.&#8221; 

Most ISCAR design and production engineers are CATIA users. ENOVIA SmarTeam is
facilitating real time collaboration, product and knowledge re-use, usage of
up-to-date data and automation of downstream manufacturing operations, such as
integration with the computerized numeric control (CNC) system that controls the
robots on plant floor. ISCAR is taking advantage of the industry-leading,
seamless CATIA &#8211; ENOVIA SmarTeam solution, the revision life cycle management
expressed in CATIA icons and commands, and the ENOVIA SmarTeam links management
that facilitates complex design-in-context designs. 

"For ISCAR, key challenges involve maintaining profitability while delivering a
product on time without losing focus on product innovation and quality. These
are all major challenges for leading industrial companies, said Angel L. Blanco
Diaz, PLM solutions leader, IBM. &#8220;ISCAR understands the business benefits that
advanced design collaboration can bring. We are confident that our solution will
make an ongoing contribution to companies across all industries as they sharpen
their competitive positioning and market leadership for next year.&#8221; 

&#8220;The ENOVIA SmarTeam &#8211; CATIA solution is the best solution on the market for
powerful, rapidly implemented, collaborative management of CATIA data,&#8221; said
Andy Kofoid, vice president, ENOVIA, Dassault Syst&#232;mes. 

Yael Software, a DS Value-Added Reseller with particular expertise in CATIA and
ENOVIA SmarTeam implementations, is helping ISCAR with all aspects of the
implementation and user training.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ivory Investment Management LP, which owns 1.5 percent of shares of Yahoo Inc, urged the Internet company to sell its search business to Microsoft Corp, saying such a deal could more than double Yahoo's value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivory proposed in a letter to Yahoo's board that it salvage a deal with Microsoft, which had failed earlier this year to buy Yahoo after offering as much as $33 a share. The software company had also tried to buy Yahoo's search business, but was turned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares were trading at $12.67 pre-market on Wednesday, up 4 percent from their Nasdaq close on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe a search deal with Microsoft could deliver value to Yahoo shareholders of $24-29 per share, or more than double yesterday's closing price of $12.19," Ivory Managing Partner Curtis Macnguyen wrote in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We envision a deal whereby Microsoft would acquire all of Yahoo's search assets and enter into a perpetual agreement for Microsoft to be the search provider for all Yahoo properties," the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yahoo spokeswoman declined to comment. Microsoft has repeatedly said it was no longer interested in buying all of Yahoo but has left open the possibility of a search deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivory, which has 21.4 million shares of Yahoo, said Yahoo could get an upfront payment of more than $15 billion from Microsoft for the search business, and retain 80 percent of the advertising revenue generated through searches on its sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal could increase Yahoo's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by more than $500 million a year, Ivory said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft could also save $800 million by combining their search operations and getting rid of duplicate costs, Ivory said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company urged immediate action in the face of Google's dominance in the Web search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This deal would offer Microsoft the unique opportunity to immediately gain critical mass to better level the playing field with Google, while it would simultaneously allow Yahoo to both receive a sizable upfront cash payment and increase its prospective cash flow," Ivory said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tiffany Wu; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Repeats for more subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Dec 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Thursday cut its
growth forecast for China next year to 6 percent, the lowest
prediction from any major bank, after a batch of extremely weak
trade data across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said China could stage a powerful revival in
2010, recovering to grow at 9 percent provided the government
delivers effective monetary easing and fiscal stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These forecasts build in a more dramatic slowdown in the
near term in China than in our previous forecasts, but we
continue to see more room there for policy makers to restore
growth later in 2009," Goldman economists wrote in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank had previously called for 7.5 percent expansion next
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The forecast for 6 percent growth next year comes in well
below the 8 percent median estimate of a dozen institutions
polled by Reuters last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would also mark the country's weakest growth since 1990
when the economy was disrupted by trade sanctions imposed after
the Tiananmen crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese media have reported that Beijing is determined to
"protect eight" next year, referring to the 8 percent growth that
is widely thought necessary to absorb the millions of people
entering the country's labour force every year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bermuda-based insurer XL Capital Ltd (XL.N) has hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser to explore possible alternatives, it said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement, XL said that "as can be expected in the current environment, the company is continuing to explore value-enhancing opportunities available to it" and was being assisted by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of XL dropped $1.89, or nearly 33 percent, to close at $3.90 on the New York Stock Exchange, prior to its statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said that the mark-to-market decline on its investment portfolio in the weeks since the end of the third quarter appears to be similar to the decline it had posted for entire the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It noted, however, that changes in credit spreads and interest rates in the coming weeks could affect the decline it eventually reports for the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XL also said it expects to report about $200 million to $220 million in net investment fund affiliate losses from its alternative investment portfolio for the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more MA news and our DealZone blog, go to www.reuters.com/deals)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal and Paul Thomasch; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on capital budget, background on execs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Dec 10 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said
on Wednesday Patricia Yarrington will replace Steve Crowe as
chief financial officer when he retires at the end of this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yarrington, 52, has been at Chevron since 1980 and is now
treasurer and a director for Chevron Phillips Chemical Co, a
joint venture with ConocoPhillips (COP.N). She also serves on
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's Economic Advisory
Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crowe, 61, a 36-year veteran of the company, spent his
first year as CFO in 2005, leading the acquisition of rival
California oil company Unocal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yarrington's first major test as CFO is likely to be
establishing a 2009 capital spending budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Due to significant changes in market conditions, Chevron
delayed its capex announcement until the end of January from
this month, but still expects spending to be steady compared
with this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It spent $15.8 billion on capex in the first nine months of
2008 out of a $22.9 billion program unveiled last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pierre Breber, 44, vice president of finance for Chevron's
Global Downstream business, will succeeds Yarrington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares closed up 3.8 percent to $78.44 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is laying
off some 200 staff in London this week as part of a 10 percent
cut in global headcount first reported in October, two people
familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which had a record 32,569 employees in August,
declined to confirm the actual number of job losses and did not
say how many employees it had in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is part of the 10 percent headcout reduction
previously announced," a Goldman Sachs spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources familiar with the situation said the overall 10
percent cut includes a 5 percent reduction in its global
workforce undertaken each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than 240,000 jobs have been lost in the financial
industry since August 2007 and Goldman has not been able to
avoid a global slowdown in investment banking activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) recently
became bank holding companies, and analysts expect the
regulatory cost will be high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say their new regulator, the Federal Reserve, is

(SEC), and commercial banks have to report to the Fed, the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the New York State Bank
authorities at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week brought fresh announcements of job cuts from

&lt;p&gt;Gift Cards Take the Guesswork Out of Gift Giving; Tips Help Americans Maintain
Budget Control
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
This holiday season, it&#8217;s popular to be practical, according to a new study
commissioned by Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) that suggests consumers are sticking to a
budget and relying on gift cards to help take the guesswork out of giving. 

More than ever, gift givers are putting themselves in the recipients&#8217; shoes and
trying to identify gifts that will be appreciated and put to good use, ensuring
their money is well spent. The majority of U.S. consumers surveyed said it was
&#8216;very important&#8217; to give a gift that their recipients will find useful (73
percent). Notably, 8 out of 10 respondents indicate they would give a gift card
because recipients would be able to choose the gifts they want. 

Giving the Gift of Choice

The survey revealed that gift cards provide valuable flexibility for shoppers
and recipients alike:

* 82 percent of respondents consider it appropriate to give a gift card that can
be used for purchases anywhere, offering recipients the ability to spend the
card on goods and services from the merchants they choose. That compares to only
45 percent of respondents who felt it appropriate to give a check as a gift. 
* The majority of those surveyed agree they would buy a gift card this holiday
season because they&#8217;re convenient for gift givers (79 percent) as well as
recipients (85 percent). 
* Nearly three-quarters said they would give a gift card because they are an
easy way for the gift-giver to track spending (70 percent) and because they are
less expensive to ship (73 percent). 
* And when it comes to buying gifts, an overwhelming majority of U.S. consumers
surveyed felt it was important to give something they can afford (91 percent).
As consumers look to closely manage holiday spending, gift cards can help to
better track and stay within a holiday shopping budget. 
* Additionally, nearly half of those surveyed say asking for a gift card this
holiday season makes good sense, as they feel other items on their list might be
too expensive (46 percent) or too difficult for someone else to buy (49
percent).

&#8220;This year, Americans are signaling greater pragmatism in their shopping
decisions&#8212;even when it comes to purchasing gift cards,&#8221; said Jason Alderman,
director of financial education at Visa Inc. &#8220;While we know that the convenience
of gift cards makes them a popular item for both shoppers and recipients, it&#8217;s
interesting to note that people are buying gift cards because they can use them
to manage spending and stick to a budget.&#8221; 

Unlike gift cards that can be used only at a single location, Visa Gift cards
are accepted at millions of locations worldwide&#8212;allowing recipients to buy what
they want, when they want. Visa Gift cards are also covered by Visa&#8217;s Zero
Liability1 policy which offers protections against lost or stolen cards, as well
as for unauthorized purchases&#8212;a level of security not afforded by cash or gift
certificates. Consumers can purchase Visa Gift cards in person, online, or by
phone. For more information, visit www.visa.com/gift. 

Practical Budgeting Tips for Practical Shoppers

To help consumers better track holiday spending, Visa offers a free online
Holiday Budgeting Center. This resource is available through its award-winning
financial education program, Practical Money Skills for Life,which can be
accessed at www.practicalmoneyskills.com/holiday. 

&#8220;Whether you&#8217;re planning on giving gift cards or other items that recipients can
use this holiday season, making a budget and sticking to it is essential to
ensure that holiday cheer doesn&#8217;t turn into a New Year&#8217;s financial hangover,&#8221;
Alderman added. 

Listed below are five important things to keep in mind when preparing a holiday
budget:

* Needs vs. Wants: Given that some financial planners say you should spend no
more than 1.5 percent of your annual income ($750 per $50,000 of annual income)
on holiday expenses, take a hard look at what you typically spend during the
holidays and then estimate how much you can really afford to spend. 
* Make a List&#8212;Check it Twice: Once you know how much you can afford to spend
overall, record everyone on your gift list and set an amount you expect to spend
on that person. If you overspend in one area, you must reduce costs in another. 
* Shop Online: Shopping online will not only help you save time and gas, but if
you plan ahead, you will find many free shipping deals on internet shopping
sites. Since many merchants offer the same items at different prices, comparison
shopping online will also help you avoid spending more than you need to and
pocket the savings. 
* Avoid Last Minute &#8220;Panic&#8221; Shopping: Plan ahead by making a list of everything
you need to do and plot it out on a calendar so you are not scrambling at the
last minute and making more expensive decisions due to lack of time or choices. 
* It&#8217;s the Thought That Counts: Have an open conversation with friends and
family about setting more conservative price limits on gifts for each other. Or,
instead of spending on each other, join together to put your gift budgets toward
helping those who may be less fortunate.

Consumers can find these tips along with other useful tools, including a
budgeting calendar, a Gift Register and Budgeting Tool and a Holiday
Entertainment Planner on the Holiday Budgeting Center. The site also features a
holiday shopping tips video podcast by personal finance expert, best-selling
author and award-winning journalist, Jean Chatzky.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading&#160;(GSET)&#160;announced today a new functionality for
matching orders within its SIGMA X liquidity pool. 

The&#160;SIGMA&#160;X-Cross enables customers to match their orders at scheduled points
during&#160;the trading day. Crosses will initially occur once a day, at 10:30AM EST.
An afternoon session will be added in the near term. 

This new&#160;functionality will take full advantage of the latent liquidity already
resting in SIGMA X, which is consistently ranked as the largest U.S. dark pool
(Tabb Group, 2008). X-Cross will harness&#160;liquidity from Goldman Sachs&#8217;
algorithms and its ATS order book, creating opportunities for customers to find
liquidity. 

&#8220;X-Cross adds a brand new dimension to the SIGMA X experience,&#8221; said Rishi
Nangalia, Managing Director and Global Head of Business Development for GSET.
&#8220;Many of our clients have already benefited from finding liquidity in SIGMA X.
The timed crosses and the inclusion of our existing flows will make it easier
for them to source even more liquidity across a broad universe of symbols.&#8221; 

For customers trading baskets of stocks, X-Cross will offer the ability to set
net cash and beta-adjusted neutrality constraints. These parameters will
automatically control exposure and manage execution risk for portfolio trading
users. 

Customers can enter X-Cross orders via the REDIPlus&#174; execution management system
or FIX. REDIPlus customers will be alerted of an upcoming cross through the
REDIHub, a central message center within the application. Similarly, FIX users
can elect to receive automated&#160;X-Cross reminders via AOL IM&#174; alerts and via
email. Once the&#160;X-Cross session&#160;begins, the number of shares matched
is&#160;optimized based on the risk constraints submitted by users. 

SIGMA X experienced substantial growth in 2008, and now averages 300 million
shares per day. 

About GSET

Goldman Sachs Execution &amp; Clearing, L.P., through its GSET platform, provides
clients with the necessary execution tools and services to manage the entire
investment process, from pre-trade analysis to post-trade consulting. Clients
access our global offering via REDIPlus and FIX, available for trading global

&lt;p&gt;Learning Village Sets New Standard for Teaching and Learning
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt has been named Microsoft's 2008 "Education Partner of
the Year." At the annual Microsoft U.S. Public Sector Partner Executive Summit,
held in Palm Beach, FL, Microsoft recognized Houghton Mifflin Harcourt as a
leading global education company that has made significant contributions to
teaching and learning. 

Over the past year, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Microsoft have worked
collaboratively to bring to market a new K&#8211;12 enterprise learning solution
called Learning Village, a content-agnostic solution that opens up opportunities
for educators to integrate all of their content, applications and resources from
one central location. Learning Village delivers curricula, content and resources
in a unified, personalized and relevant environment for teachers,
administrators, parents and students&#8212;providing a central point for
communication, collaboration, teaching and professional development. 

The integration of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's Learning Village with the
Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server gives educators and students web-based access
to district-approved educational resources that help students succeed in school.
This collaboration leverages the significant investment that schools have
already made in their instructional resources and technology infrastructure, and
also transforms the process of delivery&#8212;creating a stronger connection between
content, curriculum and learners. 

"Learning Village is successfully setting new standards in instructional
innovation and delivery for leading school districts," said Scott Kirkpatrick,
executive vice president at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. "More than anything else,
educators tell us that to deliver individualized, effective instruction, they
need the time to plan that instruction. By centralizing resources in one place,
Learning Village helps educators make well-informed instructional decisions, and
promotes collaboration and sharing of best practices." 

Impacting academic achievement, as well as teacher, student and parent
accountability, are key objectives behind the relationship between Houghton
Mifflin Harcourt and Microsoft. "Together, Microsoft and Houghton Mifflin
Harcourt are committed to incorporating technology into K&#8211;12 instruction in ways
that build strong communities of learning," said Anthony Salcito, general
manager for Microsoft U.S. Education. "The release of Learning Village on
Microsoft SharePoint is a significant milestone. This type of partnership
enables transformative ways of engagement among the greater school communities
and all the stakeholder touch points."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ivory Investment Management LP, which owns 1.5 percent of shares of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), urged the Internet company to sell its search business to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), saying such a deal could more than double Yahoo's value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivory proposed in a letter to Yahoo's board that it salvage a deal with Microsoft, which had failed earlier this year to buy Yahoo after offering as much as $33 a share.

Microsoft has repeatedly said it was no longer interested in buying all of Yahoo but has left open the possibility of a search deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivory, which has 21.4 million shares of Yahoo, said Yahoo could get an upfront payment of more than $15 billion from Microsoft for the search business, and retain 80 percent of the advertising revenue generated through searches on its sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal could increase Yahoo's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by more than $500 million a year, Ivory said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft could also save $800 million by combining their search operations and getting rid of duplicate costs, Ivory said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company urged immediate action in the face of Google's (GOOG.O) dominance in the Web search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This deal would offer Microsoft the unique opportunity to immediately gain critical mass to better level the playing field with Google, while it would simultaneously allow Yahoo to both receive a sizable upfront cash payment and increase its prospective cash flow," Ivory said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tiffany Wu; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
The shares of General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) have shrugged off some
negative brokerage comments this morning to rally with the rest of the broad
market. Before the open, UBS analyst Jason Feldman lowered his rating on the
shares from "buy" to "neutral," stating that GE's infrastructure orders are
likely to slow. Furthermore, while the funding situation at GE Capital Finance
appears stable for now, there's considerable uncertainty around the size of
credit losses next year and the timing of an eventual recovery. In comments to
clients, he stated, "We don't expect GE shares to outperform until investors
regain confidence in financial service companies and/or until we get greater
visibility for a recovery in infrastructure orders."

&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
Fusion-io, the leader in enterprise solid-state storage architecture and
high-performance I/O solutions, today announced that its ioDrive, the world&#8217;s
most advanced enterprise solid-state data storage technology, has become the
first solid-state storage solution to achieve IBM ServerProven designation. The
IBM ServerProven program is designed to provide customers with additional
product choices by performing compatibility tests with a variety of non-IBM
products. 

The ioDrive is a PCI-Express-based, direct-attached storage solution that has
100 times the capacity density and 10 times the capacity per dollar of DRAM. The
technology makes it possible to have terabytes of near-memory-speed storage
within each node, bringing a new level of cost effectiveness to systems
requiring extremely large memory and high-performance I/O for applications. 

&#8220;Proven compatibility is vital to our customers,&#8221; said Don Basile, CEO of
Fusion-io. &#8220;We are pleased at the continued momentum we see in our relationship
with IBM, as is demonstrated by being awarded the company&#8217;s ServerProven
designation. Fusion-io has achieved a number of industry firsts, including being
the first to develop a truly PCI-e-based solid-state storage product with our
ioDrive, and being the first to bring protective RAID technology to solid state
with our Flashback protection. Fusion-io was also the first to work with IBM to
achieve 1,000,000 IOPS, and we are now the first solid-state solution provider
to achieve this important ServerProven designation from IBM.&#8221; 

Independent lab testing has verified that the ioDrive can achieve more than
100,000 mixed transactions (IOPS). Fusion-io worked with IBM on its Project
Quicksilver to easily achieve over 1,000,000 IOPS by presenting multiple
ioDrives as a shared storage solution to accomplish RAID-like speeds. 

&#8220;IBM is excited to work with Fusion-io on innovative technologies that bring
value to our clients,&#8221; said David Weber, IBM Program Director, Wall Street
Center of Excellence. &#8220;With these technologies, we expect to significantly
improve the performance of specific applications such as database queries and
business intelligence, as well as dramatically reduce power and space costs &#8211;
all of which have become even more important in today&#8217;s challenging business
environment.&#8221; 

The ioDrive is currently available in capacities of 80 GB, 160 GB and 320 GB.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 10 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Axsys
Technologies Inc AXYS.O, a provider of surveillance and
imaging solutions, to "underweight" from "neutral"on valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "A premium valuation is justified, but we believe the
premium is now excessive," analyst Paul Coster said in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coster believes that the company's fundamentals are solid
and that it is well-positioned for the economic downturn owing
to its exposure to diverse U.S. defense and homeland security
programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He, however, said the company may have to invest more in
sales and marketing to grow its surveillance solutions product
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Until there's demonstrable pay-off from this investment,
and a cyclical tailwind, we are reluctant to chase the
valuation multiple up," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which cut its price target on the stock by
$3 to $56, expects Axsys to underperform the mean of the
coverage universe in the  near term. Axsys develops
high-performance surveillance cameras and imaging systems for
the aerospace and defense industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Axsys were down nearly 13 percent at $58.50 in
morning trade on Nasdaq. They had touched a low of $57.76
earlier in the day and were among the biggest percentage

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The landmark project between IBM (NYSE: IBM) and the University of
Washington to develop new strains of rice that could produce crops with
larger and more nutritious yields is now set to analyze data on the genes
-- three months ahead of schedule. The research will focus on analyzing
data that has been prioritized as promising by both the University of
Washington in Seattle and the International Rice Research Institute in
the Philippines.

    Researchers will now begin to analyze the results while data continues to
be collected on the rest of the proteins, according to IBM.

    "While headlines about rice shortages have declined, the problem is still
very real," said Stanley S. Litow, IBM Vice President of Corporate
Citizenship and Corporate Affairs. "More than 400,000 volunteers have
already contributed 9,000 years of computer time to this project, and
individual computers have processed more than 10 million transactions."

    "Improving strains of rice to yield larger, more resilient, and
nutritionally-optimized harvests will positively impact the lives of
billions of people. This is a first-of-a-kind solution that demonstrates
how a smart application of technology can offer a game-changing solution
that can potentially create a greater change in society and how it deals
with food issues."

    The project is studying the structures of the proteins that make up the
building blocks of rice. This will help identify the function of those
proteins and enable researchers to identify which proteins could help
produce more rice grains, ward off pests, resist disease or hold more
nutrients. In the end, this project will create the largest and most
comprehensive map of rice proteins and their related functions, helping
rice researchers pinpoint which plants should be selected for
cross-breeding to cultivate better crops.

    "The community response to this project has been phenomenal. IBM's World
Community Grid exceeds our expectations of computational power and makes
scientific dreams a reality," said Michal Guerquin, project lead at the
University of Washington.

    IBM's World Community Grid is a virtual supercomputer created by
individuals who donate their unused computer time to tackle complex
calculations to accelerate scientific research. World Community Grid is
collecting data for 30,000 to 60,000 different protein structures.

    Anyone with a computer and Internet access can be a part of the solution.
To donate unused computer time, individuals register on
www.worldcommunitygrid.org and install a free, small, secure software
program onto their computers. When computers are idle, data is requested
from World Community Grid's server. These computers then perform the
computations, and send the results back to the server, prompting it for a
new piece of work. A screen saver will tell individuals when their
computers are being used.

    World Community Grid, the largest public humanitarian grid in existence,
has 430,000-plus members who represent more than 200 countries and links
to more than one million computers.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 10 (Reuters) - Ivory Investment Management

&lt;p&gt;Exploited Vulnerability Could Allow Full System Access and Control
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Palo Alto Networks today announced that its Threat Research Team discovered one
of the six critical vulnerabilities communicated in Microsoft&#8217;s Patch Tuesday
security bulletin this week. 

Prompting the highest vulnerability rating, Microsoft credited Palo Alto
Networks exclusively with the discovery of Word Memory Corruption Vulnerability
(CVE-2008-4026). The vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Word handles
certain Word files. 

An attacker could deliver a seemingly innocent document to a user via email, IM
or as a download from a Website. If opened, the execution would enable an
attacker to take complete control of an affected system, allowing them to then
install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full
user rights. The vulnerability exists in both the Microsoft Office 2003 and 2007
versions. 

This vulnerability continues a string of discoveries &#8211; five of which have been
rated critical &#8211; that Palo Alto has discovered and worked with Microsoft to
ensure users are protected. 

Palo Alto Networks&#8217; family of next-generation firewalls protects enterprises
from any exploits that take advantage of these vulnerabilities, as well as a
broad range of other threats. The Palo Alto Networks Threat Research Team is
active in the research community, aggressively pursuing both new vulnerability
research and mitigation of all types of threats.

&lt;p&gt;  BELLEVUE, WA, Dec 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Global enterprises today recognize the tremendous business value of
unified communications. However, it is an industry-wide challenge to
identify an appropriate strategy, roadmap and integration path necessary
to achieve breakthrough cost efficiencies and productivity enhancements,
while leveraging existing investments in PBX technology. Unify2, a
Bellevue, Wash.-based company providing consulting services, has been
launched by a team of Microsoft veterans to address these challenges.

    Unify2 founders have played a pioneering role in the unified
communications space, with more than 30 years combined experience in
development of Microsoft Real-Time Collaboration products including
Office Communication Server (OCS) 2007. The company's CEO holds the
original patent for enterprise instant messaging technology, and the
Unify2 team has driven significant aspects of the Microsoft unified
communications platform's evolution, from overall architecture and
roadmap, to core technical specifications and integration, to driving
interoperability testing with all of the leading PBX vendors.

    Unlike other service providers specializing in individual segments of
unified communications, Unify2 combines expertise across the entire
unified communications space, including IP telephony, instant messaging,
presence, and web and video conferencing -- with customers benefiting
from Unify2's comprehensive view of the industry and deep technical
expertise across multiple platforms. Several Fortune 500 companies,
including global consulting firms and corporations with large, complex
deployments, have already turned to Unify2 to help them define and
implement their unified communications strategy.

    "Thanks to Microsoft's entry into enterprise voice, we are witnessing a
significant inflection point in enterprise communications, one that will
radically transform enterprise business processes over the next decade, in
much the same way that email started to transform business processes in
the mid-1990s," said Sonu Aggarwal, CEO of Unify2. "Enterprises are
seizing this opportunity to transform their communications and business
processes, and are starting to drive significant improvements in business
agility, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction."

    Unify2 Launches Video Manager

    Following its early success, Unify2 has developed Video Manager(TM), a
video management component of Unify2's planned product suite for enhancing
the enterprise experience with OCS 2007. Video Manager provides
administrators fine-grained control for managing video communications in
an OCS 2007 environment. Video Manager is being released to multiple
enterprise customers who have identified it as an important solution to
optimize use of their network resources.

    Unify2 offers its services on a worldwide basis, and will launch a
European office in Germany in February 2009. More information on Unify2
is online at www.unifysquare.com.

&lt;p&gt;Trend Toward Sponsored Level I ADR Programs Anticipated for 2009;

More DR Programs From Non-Traditional Markets Also Expected
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Depositary receipts (DR) reached unprecedented levels of liquidity in 2008 and
are expected to be strong globally in 2009, according to a J.P. Morgan year-end
report published today. In the first 11 months of 2008, DR trading volumes
increased 53% compared to the same period last year, reaching 131 billion DR
shares. During the same period, DR values increased 28% to $3.9 trillion.
Additionally, U.S. investment in non-U.S. equities increased to an all-time high
of 24% of total equity holdings* vs. 21% in 2007. 

Other key findings from J.P. Morgan&#8217;s annual DR report include:

* New DR programs were created by 93 issuers during the first 11 months of the
year, increasing the total number of sponsored DR programs to 2,125. 
* GDRs (Global Depositary Receipts) represented 92% of IPO (initial public
offering) capital raised during the first 11 months of 2008, while ADRs
(American Depositary Receipts) represented 8%. 
* Companies from &#8220;BRIC&#8221; (Brazil, Russia, India, China) nations dominated new DR
programs, representing 53% of new DR issuers in 2008, and 52% of capital raised
in DR form.

Capital raised in DR form globally fell markedly to $14.5 billion in the first
11 months of 2008, as compared to $57.3 billion for the full-year 2007, and
$42.6 billion in 2006. The J.P. Morgan report also shows that U.S. institutional
investors currently hold $765 billion in DR form, down from $850 billion in
2007. Nonetheless, the current level is more than twice the amount held five
years ago, when the value of institutional DR holdings was $309 billion. 

&#8220;Not surprisingly the DR market has not been immune to the overall global
financial crisis; as our figures demonstrate, new sponsored DR issuances are
down markedly and capital raising activity has decreased substantially,&#8221; said
Claudine Gallagher, global head of J.P. Morgan&#8217;s DR business. &#8220;At the same time,
however, we have seen tremendous volume in the DR market, particularly in the
last three months, and we have a very solid queue of issuer IPOs ready to launch
once the global markets are less turbulent.&#8221; 

Regional Trends in 2008

* Asia -- the DR continued to be an attractive means to raise capital, with 88%
of the primary and secondary DR offerings from established DR markets in this
region, such as India and China. Solar energy was the most dominant sector in
Asia in terms of capital raising, accounting for 41% of total DR offerings, all
as secondary offerings. 
* Europe and the Middle East -- DR capital raisings were dominated by Global
Investment House of Kuwait, which raised $1.15 billion in GDRs through its IPO
on the LSE. Another notable new entry from the Middle East was Commercial Bank
of Qatar, which raised over $690 million. Russia remained a key market in
Europe, as GlobalTrans Investment raised almost $500 million in DRs, the world&#8217;s
third-largest IPO in 2008. Commonwealth of Independent States countries
accounted for 11% of global capital raised via DRs. 
* Latin America -- Brazil remained the dominant DR market, which represented
four out of nine DR entrants for the region. All capital raisings from the
region came from Brazil in 2008, most notably Vale&#8217;s secondary offering of $11.6
billion ($3.9 billion of which was raised via ADRs). There was also renewed
interest in Colombia, with three new ADR programs in 2008, although none were
launched for capital raising.

Market Outlook for 2009

* &#8220;BRIC&#8221; countries will continue to be key players in the DR markets. 
* Renewed interest is expected from the Middle East markets. Other
non-traditional DR markets, such as Vietnam, are expected to emerge. 
* The global DR market is likely to trend toward sponsored Level I ADR programs.
New SEC rules now make it easier for non-US companies to set-up Level I
programs, which provide a platform for these companies to raise capital in the
U.S. (via Level III ADR programs) when funding needs arise. 
* An increase in M transactions using ADRs as acquisition currency. Recent
transactions indicate that many non-U.S. companies are viewing the U.S. as an
attractive opportunity to acquire companies at deeply discounted values. To
date, GDRs have never been used as acquisition currency. 
* Continued evolution of &#8220;Local DR&#8221; structures, i.e., DRs that are used to tap
equity investors in markets such as Hong Kong and India. These DRs provide
locally-denominated investment vehicles for investors in such markets.

&lt;p&gt;Pillar Axiom&#8482; Certified for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V to Deliver
Industry&#8217;s Highest Utilization Rates and Best Guarantees
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Pillar Data Systems, a leading provider of Application-Aware Storage Systems,
today announced its Window Server certification and application compatibility
with Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, Microsoft&#8217;s newest server
operating system with built-in, hypervisor-based virtualization. The Pillar
Axiom Storage System and Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V work together so customers
can more efficiently run multiple operating systems in parallel on a single
server and more fully leverage the power of x64 computing. 

With the Application-Aware Pillar Axiom, performance is dynamically adjusted for
those applications that require it, and storage utilization is greatly increased
due to the system&#8217;s innovative architecture. Pillar customers will see storage
utilization rates at 80 percent or higher, backed by the company&#8217;s unique
guarantee program. Combining Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V with the Pillar Axiom
allows customers to more fully utilize the capacity and computing power of their
existing physical servers. The resulting virtual infrastructure enables better
server utilization and availability, power and space savings, and the ability to
more effectively create an affordable disaster recovery solution. 

&#8220;Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V delivers a cost-effective way for IT organizations
to adopt and implement virtualization technology, which in turn enables them to
rapidly provision and improve the utilization of server resources &#8211; resulting in
a more optimized infrastructure,&#8221; said David Greschler, director of integrated
virtualization marketing, Microsoft Corporation. &#8220;The Application-Aware
capability from Pillar extends these benefits by enabling customers to
prioritize the way data is stored and retrieved so storage resources are used as
efficiently as possible, helping to further reduce their total cost of
ownership.&#8221; 

Pillar, a Microsoft certified Gold Partner, was the first to include physical
space and utilization rates to best measure overall storage efficiency, and is
the only vendor to guarantee performance, utilization, and per system
availability. The Pillar Axiom storage system can sustain utilization rates well
above 80 percent without any negative impact to performance. 

The Pillar Axiom&#8217;s ability to consolidate network storage for SAN and NAS within
the same storage enclosure makes it the ideal storage solution for any data
center. The Axiom&#8217;s ability to be provisioned similarly to how virtualized
servers are provisioned makes it the ideal storage solution in virtualized
environments. 

Pillar Data recently surveyed more than 1,000 users and found the underlying
problem with virtualization projects is that they often require customers to
purchase additional storage capacity to alleviate the utilization and
performance degradation associated with virtualization. Problems typically occur
when virtual machine performance is hindered by a server-to-storage I/O
bottleneck. Traditional storage architectures cannot effectively manage the
random I/O patterns created by virtual machines. The Pillar Axiom was designed
differently and excels under extreme and varied workloads because of its
patented Quality of Service functionality. The Pillar Axiom&#8217;s ability to
dynamically assign or re-assign priorities to applications that companies deem
most important improves overall storage performance, while reducing the I/O
bottleneck seen in legacy storage systems.

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, Dec 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Friends Provident today announces that it has appointed IBM (NYSE: IBM)
to manage its IT requirements and deliver its future infrastructure
services in a 10 year deal worth over GBP 200 million. The deal will
generate potential annual cost savings for Friends Provident initially of
around GBP 6 million a year which are expected to increase over the term
of the contract.

    Friends Provident outlined in its strategic review, in January 2008, its
aim to make savings of GBP 40m, over a two-year period, from its operating
cost base and to consider alternative sourcing strategies. The company
announced at its interim results (7 August) and its Q3 interim management
statement (31 October) that it has made significant progress towards this
target. The contract with IBM will assist in achieving further significant
cost reductions by, among other things, increasing standardization,
implementing rigorous processes, using shared infrastructure and offshore
resources.

    The agreement, which supports Friends Provident's strategy, includes every
aspect of the technology infrastructure including software, hardware and
services. It also provides an opportunity for all hardware to be refreshed
and in future the ability to provide mainframe capacity on demand through
IBM's cloud computing technology.

    Trevor Matthews, chief executive officer of Friends Provident, said, "I am
delighted to be entering into this contract with IBM at this very
important time in the rebuilding program for Friends Provident. This is a
big step forward in achieving our targeted GBP 40 million of annual cost
savings by the end of 2009. The cost savings we will realize under this
contract will help to make Friends Provident a leaner, fitter and more
efficient business without compromising the market leading levels of
service we are renowned for. By partnering with IBM, one of the world's
leading technology providers, we will gain access to the latest
processing power and the expertise to improve our service and technology
further. It sets us up very well for the future and is further evidence
of the forward progress we are making."

    Bruce Ross, General Manager, IBM Global Technology Services, UK and
Ireland, said, "Consolidating the whole spectrum of technologies from
hardware, software and services into a single service-based contract will
allow us to enhance integration and improve flexibility across the
enterprise in order to support Friends Provident's evolving business
requirements. The resulting on-demand infrastructure will provide a
platform on which Friends Provident can focus on its core value
proposition and the provision of excellent service to its customers."

    Friends Provident is working closely with IBM to plan the transition
process and transfer of responsibility for delivery of IT services. This
process will be completed by March 2009 and will involve the transfer of
around 200 employees to IBM. This transaction will result in IBM recording
a signing of approximately GBP 150 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  INGOLSTADT, GERMANY and STUTTGART, GERMANY, Dec 10
(MARKET WIRE) -- 
Media-Saturn IT Services GmbH, the information technology (IT) service
company of Media-Saturn Group, and IBM (NYSE: IBM) have signed a
five-year outsourcing contract. The contact is worth double-digit million
Euro and includes the complete outsourcing of the data centers at
Media-Saturn's locations in Ingolstadt and Munich, which have been
operated centrally up to now.

    With the new IT outsourcing contract, Media-Saturn will continue its
strategy to focus resources on their core competencies and to outsource
selective services to external providers. IBM will become the services
provider for the operation of Media-Saturn's data centers in Ingolstadt
and Munich. During the upcoming year the data centers will be moved to
IBM's state-of-the-art data center in Frankfurt. For example, the
financial and logistic systems of Media-Saturn will be managed out of
there. In addition, a virtualization concept is a central component of
the outsourcing contract.

    "Managing a data center is not one of our strategic IT core competencies.
Furthermore Media-Saturn Group's proceeding expansion demands growing area
or data centers and an appropriate infrastructure," said Wolfgang Lux,
member of management board of Media-Saturn Group and responsible for IT.
"With IBM we found a partner who will support our plan."

    During the upcoming year, IBM will transfer Media-Saturn's applications to
IBM's data center in Frankfurt and will be responsible for system
management. An additional component of the agreement is that IBM is will
convert all of Media-Saturn's relevant systems to IBM hardware.

    "Media-Saturn was looking for a compelling, high-value technical
solution," said Michael Diemer, IBM General Manager, Global Technology
Services in Germany. "IBM's in-depth knowledge of the industry and
experience with global clients made us a good partner for them."

    About Media-Saturn-Holding GmbH

    With a net revenue of 17.1 billion euros and a headcount of more than
49,000 in 2007, Media Markt and Saturn are Germany and Europe's Number One
electrical goods retailers. The success enjoyed by the two retail brands,

The current market turmoil has been particularly brutal in the oil space, with
all sub-sectors getting down to levels not seen in years. While expectations of
softening oil demand over the coming quarters and broad credit-market concerns
have been the primary reasons for the sector&#8217;s woes, the sell-off has by all
measures been overdone. 

We believe that the large-cap integrated oil companies offer compelling values.
Our best picks remain Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX)
and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP). These stocks are currently trading at multi-year
lows, exceptionally cheap both in relative as well as absolute terms, and offer
more upside potential than downside risk. These companies have fortress balance
sheets (Exxon is AAA rated and has more cash on its balance sheet than debt),
generate strong cash flows, and pay out growing dividends.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said on Thursday the U.S. bank has had a "terrible" November and December, blaming the "normal culprits:" mortgages, credit, and high yield bonds and loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"November itself has been a terrible trading month ... (and) December so far is pretty terrible," Jamie Dimon told CNBC. "It will be a tough quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said he was referring to the trading, loans and mortgage segments of the largest U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the CEO said U.S. housing prices -- which spawned the current credit crisis -- could fall another 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, in a speech after receiving the "Legend in Leadership Award" of the Yale School of Management Chief Executive Leadership Institute, Dimon said the housing crisis was unfixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the ceremony, which took place at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York, Dimon said the company could have to make further write-downs if the recession became worse than expected, but added the bank was prepared to face any scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do those numbers and they are not pretty", Dimon said and added: "We are going to be prepared for whatever" happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the CNBC interview, he said that, "if we're lucky," the market could start to recover after two more quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon added that it does not currently make sense for two major investment banks to merge, adding that acquiring a brokerage unit is not a strategic imperative for JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's remarks on the bank's fourth quarter hammered the bank's shares, which represented the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average. JPMorgan shares ended down 10.68 percent at $29.94 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Spicer and Juan Lagorio; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds CEO comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ben Klayman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO Dec 11 (Reuters) - Creation of a market-based
energy policy would help secure U.S. energy supplies and
support an economic recovery, Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief
executive of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those policies would include a stable tax, legal and
regulatory framework, access to resources for production,
respect for the sanctity of contracts and promotion of free
trade and investment, Tillerson said in a speech in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A long-term, growth-oriented policy approach, coupled with
the American people's support for increased access to domestic
energy supplies, would enable the energy sector to contribute even
more to the U.S. economy," Tillerson told several hundred
executives at a downtown Chicago hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil and other oil and gas producers have called on
the U.S. government to open areas such as the eastern Gulf of
Mexico, offshore regions on the East and West Coasts and new
portions of Alaska for exploration of new energy reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Environmental groups and many Democrats have opposed
measures that would open new coastal areas and the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to drilling, citing the
potential for damage to sensitive ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President-elect Barack Obama has said he would support
limited expanded offshore drilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson said opening new U.S. areas for production would
also increase government revenue from oil and gas leases,
royalties and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He pointed to the development of the Internet as the route
to take for the development of U.S. energy policy -- the
private sector pushing innovation with some federal backing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The chief of the world's largest publicly traded oil company
said that Exxon's 5-year, more than $125 billion spending plan had
yet to be affected by the global financial crisis and a drop in
crude oil and natural gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said this year's capital spending would be about $25
billion, in line with the company's long-term plan to spend $25
billion to $30 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't see a need to make any cuts at this point,"
Tillerson told reporters after the speech, similar to remarks he
made in late October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson also said the price of a barrel of oil --
currently at almost $48 -- is within the range the company uses
for its internal planning. He sees a similar range for 2009, but
did not disclose its parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson added that gasoline prices in North America and
Europe will remain under a lot of pressure as weakness in the
economy continues to sap demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said he favors a carbon tax to curb greenhouse gas
emissions -- rather than a cap and trade system using pollution
credits -- because the tax is more effective, less costly and
easier to administer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CEO said the industry is taking a "wait-and-see" approach
the expected energy policies of the incoming Obama administration.
There is a clear interest in alternative forms of energy, but
Tillerson said he hopes the new administration is realistic in its
choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We must not think in terms of quick fixes over the next
few months or the next one or two years," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Thursday its Aromasin cancer drug was no better than tamoxifen at achieving disease-free survival after 2.75 years among postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the results were from a trial called TEAM designed to compare the two medicines over a period of 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aromasin failed the first co-primary goal of the study by not extending the period of survival without progression of disease after 2.75 years. Some 9,775 patients, receiving either Aromasin or tamoxifen as initial therapy, were studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Aromasin was associated with an 11 percent reduction in risk of disease progression or death, the difference was not considered statistically significant. The results were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from a second planned analysis in the trial, of disease-free survival after five years of therapy, is expected in late 2009, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aromasin is a member of a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors. It is currently approved among postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who have already used tamoxifen for two to three years, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamoxifen is a SERM, or selective estrogen receptor modulator, that is available as a generic and used to treat both early and advanced breast cancer, and for prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Dec 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: NWK), a leading innovator in
VoIP technologies, announced today that its VX Series gateways for
unified communications (UC) now provide robust integration with Microsoft
Active Directory (AD) and other Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) solutions.

    Directory integration provides significant benefits to customers migrating
to a converged data/voice infrastructure, such as Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007 (OCS). These benefits include:


--  use of AD or LDAP as a single point-of-administration, allowing
    customers to perform all moves, adds, and changes in one place;
--  the ability to flexibly define call-routing rules using AD or LDAP
    fields; and
--  simplification of phased technology migrations by identifying which
    end-users are being served by Microsoft OCS, the PBX, Cisco Call Manager,
    etc., at any given time.
    

    
Customers can leverage the directory integration features of the VX
Series UC Gateway in numerous ways. Using information from AD, customers
can add enterprise mobility applications to the UC solution. For example,
customers can automatically route incoming calls to an end-user's cell
phone or local SIP device when the OCS Communicator client is unavailable.
The VX gateway can also route incoming faxes directly to end-users'
Microsoft Exchange mailboxes.

    "The ability to use AD to drive voice and fax functions in a converged
environment saves administrators and end-users significant time and
effort, while also enabling companies to implement all kinds of useful
call management rules," said Talbot Harty, Chief Development Officer at
NET. "By delivering robust AD and LDAP integration in our VX Series UC
Gateways, we provide customers migrating to Microsoft OCS and other UC
solutions with significant business value."

    The VX Series UC Gateway's robust AD and LDAP support also provides
advantages to resellers and integrators by making it easier for them to
install, configure, and maintain convergence solutions.

    "Directory integration provides real value to customers by providing a
consistent method for managing call routing based on Active Directory when
implementing unified communications solutions such as Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007," said Jeff Zaremba, Sr. Director of
Collaboration Technologies at Avanade. Avanade, which is majority owned by
Accenture, was founded in 2000 by Accenture and Microsoft Corporation.
"Additionally, it provides flexibility in migration by allowing customers
to migrate over time as their business requirements dictate. For Avanade,
directory integration enables us to implement more sophisticated solutions
for our customers with less time, effort, and technical complexity."

    More information about the VX Series UC Gateways and the application of
directory integration to a variety of real-world business scenarios is

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 11 (Reuters) - Creation of a market-based
energy policy would help secure U.S. energy supplies and
support an economic recovery, Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief
executive of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Those polices would include a stable tax, legal and
regulatory framework, access to resources for production,
respect for the sanctity of contracts and promotion of free
trade and investment, Tillerson said in a speech in Chicago,
according to a company statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A long-term, growth-oriented policy approach, coupled with
the American people's support for increased access to domestic
energy supplies, would enable the energy sector to contribute
even more to the U.S. economy," Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil and other oil and gas producers have called on
the U.S. government to open areas such as the eastern Gulf of
Mexico, offshore regions on the East and West Coasts and new
portions of Alaska for exploration of new energy reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Opening up new U.S. areas for production would also
increase government revenues from oil and gas leases, royalties
and taxes, Tillerson added.

&lt;p&gt;Results Presented During the CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium
(SABCS)
SAN ANTONIO--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer today announced&#160;results from a first planned analysis of the TEAM
(Tamoxifen, Exemestane, Adjuvant, Multicenter) trial. TEAM was originally
designed in 2001 as a comparison of 5 years of upfront AROMASIN&#174; (exemestane
tablets) vs. tamoxifen. In 2004, based on results of Intergroup Exemestane Study
(IES) the TEAM trial design was revised; the tamoxifen arm was converted into a
tamoxifen/AROMASIN sequencing arm. This analysis presented at SABCS represents
the first of two co-primary endpoints that will be reported from this trial. The
first co-primary endpoint compares early events by measuring disease-free
survival (DFS: disease progression or death) at 2.75 years in 9,775 patients
randomized to initial therapy with either tamoxifen or AROMASIN. 

The analysis&#160;of DFS at 2.75 years demonstrated an 11 percent reduction in the
risk of DFS events in favor of AROMASIN (HR=0.89; 95% CI, 0.77-1.03). This
difference was not statistically significant (p=0.118). A second planned
analysis of DFS after five years of therapy is expected in late 2009. Results
from TEAM trial sub-studies were also presented at SABCS. 

&#8220;The TEAM data contribute to the growing knowledge of the role of aromatase
inhibitors in the treatment of early breast cancer,&#8221; said Dr. Steve Jones,
medical director, U.S. Oncology Research, Houston and Texas Oncology, Dallas,
TX. &#8220;Clinicians take into account patient profile, clinical evidence and
guidelines when determining the optimal treatment regimen for patients, and
should consider these new data as treatment strategies are evaluated.&#8221; 

Additional TEAM Study Results

* Additional secondary analyses demonstrated a:

* 15 percent reduction in the risk of recurrence-free survival(RFS) events in
favor of AROMASIN (HR=0.85; 95 percent CI, 0.72-1.00; p=0.049) 
* 19 percent improvement in the time-to-distant metastasis in favor of AROMASIN
(HR=0.81; 95 percent CI, 0.67-0.98; p=0.026)

* When adjusting the primary DFS analysis accounting for discontinuation rates
and patients who switched prior to 2.5 years, an analysis showed a 17 percent
reduction in the risk of DFS events at 2.75 years in favor of AROMASIN (HR=0.83;
95 percent CI, 0.71-0.97; p=0.021)

* Treatment discontinuation rates for tamoxifen and AROMASIN were 29.5 percent
and 18.9 percent, respectively 
* 754 patients in the tamoxifen arm switched prior to 2.5 years

* The most common side effects reported in the TEAM trial were consistent with
the expected safety profile of these agents. Side effects were coded by NCI CTC
(version 2), and included for tamoxifen and AROMASIN (all grades), respectively:
hot flashes (33 percent, 28.5 percent); arthralgias (9.2 percent, 18.4 percent);
fatigue (16 percent, 16.8 percent); pain (13.2 percent, 14.6 percent); infection
(13 percent, 11.9 percent) 
* The incidence of bone-related side effects for tamoxifen and Aromasin,
respectively, were:

* Osteoporosis (2.2 percent, 4.9 percent) 
* Spine/wrist/hip fractures (0.5 percent, 0.6 percent)

TEAM Sub-studies

* Data from the TEAM Pathology study support the prognostic value of PgR in ER+
early breast cancer 
* Results from additional TEAM sub-studies (bone, cognitive function, quality of
life and physical activities) were also presented

About the TEAM Trial

TEAM is a randomized, open-label, multinational trial in 9,775 postmenopausal
women with hormone sensitive early breast cancer. The TEAM trial represents an
international collaboration of investigators in 9 countries who conducted the
trial following protocols representative of local clinical practice. 

TEAM was originally designed in 2001 as a comparison of 5 years of upfront
AROMASIN&#174; (exemestane tablets) vs. tamoxifen. In 2004, based on results of IES
the TEAM design was revised; the tamoxifen arm was converted into a
tamoxifen/AROMASIN sequencing arm. The modified design includes two co-primary
endpoints comparing DFS in a pre-planned pooled analysis:

* At 2.75 years in patients randomized to initial therapy with either tamoxifen
or AROMASIN (presented at SABCS 2008) 
* In patients treated with AROMASIN for 5 years versus patients who received
sequential therapy of tamoxifen for 2.5-3 years followed by AROMASIN for a total
of 5 years

Secondary endpoints included overall survival, time to new primary breast
cancer, recurrence-free survival, time to new primary cancers (other than
breast) and safety and tolerability. The TEAM trial includes 19 prospectively
planned observational and translational research sub-studies. 

&#8220;Aromasin has had an important impact on the treatment of women with breast
cancer since its approval,&#8221; said Dr. Ray Urbanski, senior medical
director/Oncology Group Lead. &#8220;We are proud of our heritage in breast cancer,
and continued commitment to develop new treatment options to meet the unmet
needs of these patients.&#8221; 

About Aromasin&#174; (exemestane tablets)

Aromasin is the only aromatase inhibitor indicated for sequential therapy in
postmenopausal women with HR positive early breast cancer after 2-3 years of
tamoxifen for a total of 5 years of adjuvant therapy. The use of Aromasin in
this setting is supported by the landmark IES trial. Aromasin is also indicated
for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose
disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important Aromasin&#174;(exemestane tablets)Safety Information

AROMASIN should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
estrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers. In
patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving AROMASIN than
either tamoxifen or placebo.

interest income pressure and ongoing credit deterioration,"
analyst Glenn Schorr said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst halved his fourth-quarter earnings estimate for
the company to 15 cents a share from 33 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schorr said the worsening macro environment pointed to a
rise in credit costs and estimated a 24 percent increase in the
company's provision expense in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we expect government initiatives to kick in at some
point, we expect conditions to remain difficult for some time,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan were trading down 5 percent at $31.80 in
the afternoon session on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the alerts, please double click on [ID:nWNAB1926]

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) expects to achieve its
2009 targets for profit and operating margin despite a
deepening recession, Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Speaking at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services
Conference, Saunders said the world's largest card network
would benefit as growth outside the United States offsets a
domestic slowdown, amid a "secular shift" toward credit and
debit cards and away from cash and checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; San Francisco-based Visa on Oct. 29 targeted annual growth
of 20 percent or more in adjusted earnings per share, and
adjusted operating margin in the mid-to-high 40 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's no question that even in the most draconian of
scenarios that we will achieve our guidance," Saunders said.
"We've had continued global growth in a very difficult
economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average expect Visa to post profit per share of
$2.69 in 2009, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saunders said cardholders are keeping a tighter rein on
their wallets and purses, though card usage remains strong,
especially debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's fair to say that transaction growth remains fairly
robust, though they're spending less," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that "I'm planning for the worst, because I don't
know exactly where it's going to bottom out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like smaller rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N), Visa is not
directly exposed to rising customer defaults because it does
not issue cards itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large card issuers include American Express Co (AXP.N),
Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Capital One Financial Corp
(COF.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Visa closed Wednesday at $53.16 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The company in March raised $19.7 billion in an
initial public offering, with shares priced at $44 each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Fixes typo in first paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 11 (Reuters) - Imagine running the world's
largest credit card network, and not having your own plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's what happened to Visa Inc (V.N) Chief Executive
Joseph Saunders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He spoke Thursday morning at a Goldman Sachs financial
services conference in New York, and had come from San
Francisco, Visa's headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, his credit cards didn't make the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm supposed to start off, and say that I'm very happy to
be here, and I guess I am. But it's 4:15 in the morning as far
as I'm concerned, and I lost my wallet on the way here,"
Saunders said. "It's rather embarrassing when somebody steals
my credit cards." The comment prompted laughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saunders began his presentation at 7:15 a.m EST (1215
GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saunders did not elaborate. Visa did not immediately return
a call seeking further comment.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
As reported in this morning's Opening View, the bulls in the options arena
donned Mickey Mouse ears yesterday, honing in on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:
DIS). More specifically, the Dow dynamo saw more than 61,000 calls cross the
tape &#8211; nearly 7 times its average daily volume of fewer than 9,000 contracts. 

Most of yesterday's optimistic option activity centered on Disney's
soon-to-expire December 17.50 call, with roughly 29,000 contracts changing
hands. Peak call open interest in the front-month series resides at the overhead
25 strike, though, home to about 13,700 contracts.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daniel Fineren&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA Dec 11 (Reuters) - The opening of the Golden Pass
liquefied natural gas terminal in the United States will likely
be delayed by hurricane damage, while Britain's South Hook LNG
terminal now looks set to open in early 2009, an executive from
ExxonMobil (XOM.N) said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There has been some damage and there is more likely than
not to be a delay ... it's just not clear how long that will
be," ExxonMobil's president of LNG market development, Tom
Cordano, said of the Golden Pass project in Texas which had been
expected to be completed in mid-2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He could not say whether the hurricane damage sustained
earlier this year would push the start up into 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The team is working very hard to assess that damage and the
impact it is going to have on the schedule," he said on the
sidelines of a conference in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The South Hook terminal in Wales -- joint venture between
Qatar Petroleum, Exxon and France's Total (TOTF.PA) -- had been
expected to open the first half of this year but Exxon said in
May it would likely be the second half of 2008 before it would
start taking cargoes of the super-cooled gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our sense right now is early 2009," Cordano said when asked
when the South Hook facility was now likely to open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain has two functioning LNG import facilities but more
are being built to help meet growing demand for imported gas as
Britain's own production declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; South Hook and BG Group's (BG.L) nearby Dragon LNG terminal,
which had also been scheduled to open before this winter but has
not yet started taking cargoes, are seen as key to keeping
Britain well supplied with heating fuel during peak winter
demand days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Golden Pass terminal near Sabine Pass is expected to be
70 percent owned by Qatar Petroleum, with ExxonMobil and
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) each owning a share of the rest,
according to the terminal website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LNG for the terminal in Texas is expected to come mainly
from Qatar's Ras Laffan 3 and Qatargas 3 projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Martin Roberts and Edward

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) was today named the top company for climate change
strategy and practices, in a report released by the Ceres investor
coalition. The report issued today analyzes climate change governance
practices at 63 of the world's largest retail, pharmaceutical,
technology, apparel and other consumer-facing companies
(http://www.ceres.org).

    "This is recognition of IBM's longstanding dedication to managing its
involvement with energy and climate change," said Wayne S. Balta, vice
president, Corporate Environmental Affairs and Product Safety at IBM.
"From how we run our operations to what we provide to our clients, IBM is
committed to leadership in energy efficiency and climate protection across
the breadth of its business."

    Last month IBM was also positively evaluated among 24 IT companies by
Gartner and WWF Sweden for the way the company manages climate change
across its business operations, involving what Gartner termed
environmental basics, supply chain basics, carbon basics, carbon delivery
and carbon champions (http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=792412).

    IBM's longstanding commitment regarding climate protection is backed by
almost two decades of measuring energy efficiency and assessing climate
impact. The results have been significant. For example:

    Between 1990 and 2007, IBM saved 4.6 billion kWh of electricity
consumption, avoided nearly 3.1 million metric tons of CO2 emissions
(equal to 45 percent of the company's 1990 global CO2 emissions) and
saved over $310 million through its annual energy conservation actions
alone. IBM's procurement of renewable energy and RECs increased from 11
million kWh in 2001 to 455 million kWh in 2007, which accounted for 8.5%
of IBM's total 2007 global electricity purchases. To further extend these
achievements IBM set a "2nd generation" goal to reduce CO2 emissions
associated with IBM's energy use 12% between 2005 and 2012 through energy
conservation, use of renewable energy and funding RECs.

    IBM also shares its results in a transparent manner. IBM was one of three
manufacturing companies to report its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under
the U.S. Department of Energy voluntary reporting program since its
inception in 1995, and has reported through the Carbon Disclosure Project
(CDP) since its inception in 2003. IBM is also a member of the CDP's new
Supply Chain Leadership Collaboration to promote the management and
reporting of GHG by companies in the supply chain. IBM's voluntary
collaborations with external organizations in government and the NGO
community further underscore the company's proactive approach to climate
protection.

    IBM is also leveraging its own operational work on energy and climate
change as part of its call for a "smarter planet" wherein greater
intelligence is infused into the way the world works. In particular, IBM's
products and services are addressing not only IT's own direct impact upon
energy consumption and CO2 emissions, but also the ways in which IT can
help solve the world's energy and climate challenges. Ranging from energy
efficient hardware, energy management software and data centers to
intelligent electric utility networks, support for solar development,
carbon management, intelligent transportation systems and more, IBM's
initiatives are responding to this global challenge consistent with the
company's core value of "innovation that matters."

    In addition, IBM contributes its technology, expertise and innovation to
better understand and manage the impacts of climate change. For example,
IBM and The Nature Conservancy are partnering on 'Water for Tomorrow'
(http://www.ibm.com/ibm/ibmgives/grant/environment/great_rivers_partnership.shtm
)
-- an initiative in which the two organizations are creating simulation,
three-dimensional visualization and scenario forecasting tools to
facilitate more sustainable management of the world's great river basins.
The system will provide access to wide-ranging data on climate, rainfall,
land cover, vegetation, and biodiversity, and enable users to better
understand how policy decisions impact water quality and ecosystem
service.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
A new IBM (NYSE: IBM) study revealed that concern over food safety has
dramatically increased in markets around the world. The new study shows
that over the last two years in China, distrust with food retailers and
manufacturers has grown even more than it has in the United States (U.S.)
and United Kingdom (UK). The study, titled "Full Value Traceability,"
examines Chinese consumer values and confidence related to food and
product safety.

    Product contaminations and food recalls have become more commonplace
across the globe. Melamine -- a toxic chemical widely used to make
plastics and glue -- was recently found in Chinese infant formula and
sickened more than 294,000 people, according to reports from China's
Ministry of Health. The scope of the problem quickly multiplied to
include a wide range of products containing milk sourced from China. As a
result, sales of staple products, such as milk, chocolate, ice cream,
candy and more, have plunged worldwide. Food safety and traceability
issues are addressed this week in a guest blog post by Guy Blissett,
co-author of the study, on the "Building a Smarter Planet" blog.

    According to the new IBM telephone survey of 300 consumers across China,
the rise in recalls and contaminations has eroded consumer confidence in
food and product safety, as well as with the companies that manufacture,
distribute and sell these products. 84 percent of Chinese consumers
claimed that their level of concern about food safety has increased over
the last two years. In contrast, IBM's recent survey of 1,676 consumers
in the U.S. and UK found that 50 percent and 47 percent of respondents
respectively have indicated an increased concern about food safety during
that same time period.

    Mounting Distrust of Food and Product Safety

    The majority of Chinese consumers do not trust either the manufacturer (65
percent) or the retailer (59 percent) in the event of a recall. Many
Chinese consumers, compared to their Western counterparts, are just
forming brand associations as they search for new, sophisticated, trendy,
higher-value products and services.

    Consumers in the U.S. and UK are generally more trusting of food
manufacturers and retailers and believe they will handle food recalls more
responsibly. In the U.S. and UK, only 39 percent of respondents cited a
lack of trust in manufacturers, while 25 percent said they are wary of
retailers in the event of recalls.

    Chinese and U.S./UK consumers shared very similar views on wanting to know
more about the products they buy. 65 percent of Chinese consumers and 68
percent of U.S./UK consumers expressed more interest in uncovering
information about product sources and background. This relates to a key
finding of the IBM 2008 CEO Study which emphasizes the rise of "the
informed and collaborative customer."

    Increased Preference for Environmental Sustainability

    China's middle-class is expanding in total volume and increasingly more
disposable income. Economic growth in China is fostering the development
of the informed, enlightened and empowered consumer. The combination of
increased purchasing freedom and choice is empowering Chinese consumers,
and they are demanding safety and quality.

    As a result, awareness and understanding of environmental factors is
increasing, and 65 percent of Chinese consumers are willing to pay more
for environmentally sustainable food.

    Tracing Food Product Origins

    Consumer demand and support for socially and environmentally responsible
corporations are viewed positively by consumer products companies, but an
overwhelming majority admit they don't understand their customers'
expectations. A 2008 Retail report by the IBM Institute for Business Value
of 6,000 grocery customers found that 73 percent of U.S. grocery customers
felt no loyalty to the store. IBM research shows that providing more
information to consumers will help them feel better about their decisions
and can boost customer loyalty and advocacy.

    The Power of Full Value Traceability (FVT)

    Full Value Traceability (FVT) solutions offer consumer product companies a
way to trace ingredients, packaging and products through all stages of
production, processing and distribution. Through the use of transparent
traceability systems, consumer product companies can ensure and honor
their commitments to consumer safety.

    "Consumer Product companies have a responsibility to protect their
brands," said J. Chris Harreld, of the Institute for Business Value, IBM
China. "A part of that responsibility involves winning and earning the
trust of consumers. IBM can help businesses implement integrated
traceability solutions to collect transparent and trustworthy information
to track a product from farm all the way to fork."

    Key recommendations for consumer products companies to achieve a fully
transparent system include:

    Leverage traceability to empower and protect the brand -- FVT addresses
both protection and empowerment of the brand. Traceability improves a
company's ability to deliver creditable information, which contributes to
overall brand trust. 
 
 Integrate the physical and informational supply
chain -- consumer product companies that can capture, store, analyze, and
communicate information about product sourcing, processing and movement
across their supply chain will have a strategic advantage in the
marketplace. 
 
 Proactively engage the stakeholders -- reaching beyond
direct supply chain participants to engage a broad set of stakeholders
will move consumer product companies away from the traditional defensive
posture toward a whole value chain perspective that is opportunistic and
expansive.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today introduced its newest cloud service for Web
conferencing, Lotus Sametime Unyte 8.2 (www.sametimeunyte.com). IBM also
announced a new distribution partnership with InterCall to deliver Lotus
Sametime Unyte's intuitive online meeting capability to InterCall
customers worldwide.

    By extending the capabilities of its Web conferencing service to the
global market, IBM is meeting a groundswell of demand for cloud services.
As more companies are investing in collaboration technology, Lotus
Sametime Unyte brings an affordable, easy to use option for businesses
that need to work together across cities and continents, just as they
would in the same room. The added support for open document formats, such
as Lotus Symphony, along with support for nine languages ensures
companies in emerging and established markets can collaborate simply by
paying a monthly subscription.

    The partnership with InterCall brings together two worldwide leaders in
the conferencing and collaboration space, as market indicators show a
growing business demand for online collaboration services. InterCall is
the latest service provider to bolster its portfolio with a cloud-based
solution from IBM, enabling businesses of all sizes to use the Lotus
Sametime Unyte Web conferencing service to collaborate anywhere on the
globe. The integrated Sametime Unyte services will be available to
InterCall users on January 1, 2009.

    The marketing and sales partnership, combined with Lotus Sametime Unyte's
improved global network and language support, opens the door for
enterprises and SMB customers around the world to take advantage of IBM's
easy to use conferencing services. Lotus Sametime Unyte can be accessed
through any Web browser with no downloaded software required, making it a
more audience-friendly alternative to other online services.

    "Our relationship with a trusted partner like IBM helps us put simple, yet
powerful Web conferencing solutions into the hands of users around the
globe," said Scott Etzler, president of InterCall. "Lotus Sametime Unyte's
easy-to-use collaboration tools fit perfectly with our mission to provide
products that help customers increase their productivity and eliminate
communication inefficiencies."

    "Sametime Unyte delivers the reliability businesses expect from IBM, while
offering the inherent ease of access and pricing associated with cloud
services," said Sean Poulley, vice president, online collaboration
services, IBM Lotus. "At a time when companies are becoming more
environmentally aware and focused on reducing travel expenses without
slowing their growth, IBM's new partnership with InterCall shows how we're
helping businesses 'go global' at a minimal cost."

    The new release of Sametime Unyte has network acceleration enhancements
that allow faster access to the service from anywhere on the globe. In
keeping with its efforts to bolster collaboration across the globe,
Sametime Unyte is now available in nine languages: French, German,
Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese and
English. By enabling these businesses to communicate in real-time with a
worldwide network of employees, partners and customers, Sametime Unyte
can help growing businesses become global trading partners.

    IBM has also integrated Sametime Unyte with Lotus Notes and Lotus
Sametime, allowing users working by email or instant messaging to join a
Web conference with a single click of a button. The newest features also
include a participant "waiting room" to gather attendees before the call;
improved alerts for meeting organizers; new support for the FireFox 3.0
browser; as well as the ability to share or publish PDF and ODF files, in
addition to PPT, DOC and XLS files.

    Online collaboration technology can be a growth catalyst for SMBs, such as
Padgett Communications, a provider of audience response systems. Using
software to measure participant reactions at corporate events, meetings
and media events, Padgett Communications maintains a global customer base
with a staff of 25 full-time employees.

    "Lotus Sametime Unyte gives us the ability to show our clients how our
audience response system works through a visual demonstration, rather than
just telling them about it," said Lauren Traviesa, director of business
development, Padgett Communications. "We have drastically reduced the
costs of travel for our sales and support team, which is a huge windfall
of cost-savings that we're able to pass along to our customers. If our
customers have questions about our service, we can connect directly to
them with the push of a button, from any computer in our office, at home,
or on the road."

    For Martin Memorial Health Systems, a network of not-for-profit healthcare
facilities comprised of two hospitals, three MediCenters, and numerous
clinics spanning a 35-mile stretch of Florida's east coast, the
common-sense benefits of Web conferencing are apparent.

    "Even before the cost of gas went sky-high this summer, I appreciated the
reduced travel between facilities just because it added more time to my
day," said Chuck Cleaver, assistant vice president of finance, Martin
Memorial Health Systems. "With Lotus Sametime Unyte, I can meet with all
the key players in our finance operations, and see the same documents that
are on their screens, without leaving my office and without needing help
from our technical support team."

&lt;p&gt;Dec 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its price targets on
America's paper producers, saying their production cuts to
match falling demand was not enough to prevent a further drop
in prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analyst Richard Skidmore wrote in a note to clients that
industry fundamentals are deteriorating across the paper and
containerboard grades in 2008 and the outlook for wood products
remains bleak, given the challenges in the U.S. housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skidmore cut his earnings estimates for the companies by 15
percent for the fourth quarter of 2008 and by 28 percent for
2009. This is the second time he cut his estimates in a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We estimate downtime to cost $200-$300 per ton, which will
negatively impact fourth-quarter results and possibly early
2009 if the weakness continues as we expect," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the analyst upgraded Domtar Corp (UFS.TO) (UFS.N)
to "neutral" from "sell," saying the stock was reasonably
valued at its current level, but cut his price target on its
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Paper Co (IP.N), which is taking an estimated
720,000 tons of downtime in the fourth-quarter, has seen the
largest price target cut of about $3 on its stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following is the list of price target cuts made on the

&lt;p&gt; (Rewrites with Goldman Sachs, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Olesya Dmitracova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 11 (Reuters) - Financial industry job vacancies
that have opened in London in November fell to their lowest
monthly number since the credit crisis began and will likely
drop further, helped in part by a new Goldman Sachs retirement
rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 3,780 financial, or City, jobs opened up in November, a
decrease of 59 percent from a year earlier and fewer than the
previous low of 5,166 vacancies recorded last December, hiring
company Morgan McKinley said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Thesiger, who heads Morgan McKinley's parent company
Imprint, said hiring will drop further over Christmas and New
Year, beyond the usual seasonal slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new rule at Goldman Sachs (GS.N), if it has the intended
effect, will keep more positions closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the Goldman plan, employees will have to wait longer
to qualify for its retirement package, a spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The employees nearing retirement age will have to clock up a
combined 60 years in age and years of service -- allowing, for
instance, a 47-year-old with 13 years' service at the company to
retire -- up from the 55 years aggregate now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The plan is designed to bring us in line with industry
practice and to encourage people to stay at the firm longer,"
the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Competition for City jobs peaked last month, with twice as
many new candidates as new vacancies, Morgan McKinley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since August 2007, financial companies worldwide have laid
off about 260,000 people [ID:nLB618000].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, sources told Reuters Goldman will lay off 200
staff in London this week as part of a 10 percent cut in global
headcount reported earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The average City salary also fell in November to stand at
46,516 pounds ($69,430), down 2 percent on last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan McKinley, which hires mainly for investment banks,
hedge funds and asset managers, based the figures on records of
new vacancies and new candidates registering with the company in
November. It worked out statistics for the full market using its
market share.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded U.S. tobacco
sector to "neutral" from "attractive," saying fundamentals for
tobacco companies are likely to weaken in 2009.
 The deteriorating macro environment and rising unemployment
along with a likely federal cigarette excise tax increase will
weigh on industry volume and profit next year, analyst Judy
Hong said in a note dated Dec. 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The analyst estimated a hike of 61 cents per pack in
federal excise tax (FET) in March, which could lead to a 7
percent industry-wide volume decline next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rising unemployment rate could cause moderate
downtrading and limit the companies' ability to take
significant pricing on top of an FET-related price increase,
Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She cut her price targets and 2009 earnings estimates for
U.S. tobacco stocks by about 9 percent on average. She cut her
target on Lorillard Inc (LO.N) by $8 to $71, and on Reynolds
American Inc (RAI.N) by $4 to $47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Hong expects moist smokeless tobacco category
growth to remain healthy and premium brands' share decline to
moderate due to a higher promotional spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International tobacco fundamentals are also expected to
remain relatively resilient, helped by healthy pricing and cost
saves, while currency will be a drag, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She named Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) and
Lorillard as her top picks, and said she views Lorillard as an
attractive acquisition target over time. She rates both the
stocks "buy".

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) expects to achieve its 2009 targets for profit and operating margin despite a deepening recession, Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference, Saunders said the world's largest card network would benefit as growth outside the United States offsets a domestic slowdown, amid a "secular shift" toward credit and debit cards and away from cash and checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Visa on October 29 targeted annual growth of 20 percent or more in adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted operating margin in the mid-to-high 40 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no question that even in the most draconian of scenarios that we will achieve our guidance," Saunders said. "We've had continued global growth in a very difficult economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expect Visa to post profit per share of $2.69 in 2009, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saunders said cardholders are keeping a tighter rein on their wallets and purses, though card usage remains strong, especially debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's fair to say that transaction growth remains fairly robust, though they're spending less," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that "I'm planning for the worst, because I don't know exactly where it's going to bottom out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like smaller rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N), Visa is not directly exposed to rising customer defaults because it does not issue cards itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large card issuers include American Express Co (AXP.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Visa closed Wednesday at $53.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.

company's shares offer the most compelling risk-reward in the
large-cap entertainment group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Near-term stock price appreciation for the owner of MTV

it invests in new programming, but the risks are largely priced
into the shares, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the secular overhang regarding MTV ratings should
recede as the network laps the declines beginning in June 2009
or finds success in the new programming approach, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman maintained a "buy" rating on the stock, which
closed at $16.07 Wednesday on Nasdaq. The stock has shed 63
percent over the past year.

front-line travel agents across more than 160 countries, Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) has
been named the &#8220;World&#8217;s Leading Credit Card&#8221; by the 2008 World Travel Awards
(WTA). 

The World Travel Awards honors leading travel-related organizations in worldwide
and regional categories, which range from airlines, hotels, beaches and cruise
lines to credit cards, car rental companies and hotel reservation services. Visa
and other payment brands were evaluated against criteria including scope of
distribution, convenience and overall services. 

&#8220;Visa is honored to be recognized once again by one of tourism&#8217;s most
prestigious awards programs,&#8221; said Vicente Echeveste, Global Travel and Tourism
Lead at Visa Inc. &#8220;Through our continued partnership with the tourism industry,
we&#8217;re focused on promoting sustainable growth by delivering payment systems that
offer value to travelers, businesses and communities.&#8221; 

"Visa has been the favored card for international tourism for more than a
decade, despite intense competition,&#8221; said Graham Cooke, president and founder
of the World Travel Awards. "We&#8217;re pleased to recognize the consistent and
unsurpassed value that Visa delivers to travelers and tourism providers
worldwide.&#8221; 

A longtime supporter of tourism industries throughout the world, Visa offers a
network of more than 29 million merchant outlets and 1.6 billion cards in
circulation worldwide. As a result of Visa&#8217;s strategic partnerships with many
global merchants and corporations, Visa cardholders can benefit from
extraordinary values on travel and entertainment promotions. For example,
Visa.com provides Visa cardholders with retail, travel and entertainment offers
from hundreds of merchants in key destination markets or by designated category
around the world. These extensive merchant and marketing relationships, as well
as Visa&#8217;s unsurpassed acceptance around the world, have fostered growth in the
retail, travel and entertainment categories. 

Visa received this designation last week at the 15th annual WTA ceremony at
Beaches Turks &amp; Caicos Resort and Spa, Providenciales in the Caribbean. This is
the 11th consecutive year Visa has won this award.

&lt;p&gt;Helps senior finance to anticipate performance gaps, revise targets, and manage
and fund strategic initiatives in turbulent times
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Cognos, an IBM (NYSE: IBM) company together with IBM Global Business Services
(GBS) today announced a new blueprint to help companies manage and evaluate cost
containment, profit and capital programs, and associated funding alternatives
aligned with short and long-term objectives. The Strategic Investment Management
Blueprint &#8211; a pre-defined analytical model &#8211; blends software and services
together, providing CFOs and senior finance executives with the analytical tools
necessary to improve strategic investment management and decision support in an
increasingly volatile business environment. 

Finance departments are expected to define, manage, and optimize a portfolio of
strategic initiatives that drive business outcomes within realistic internal
funding constraints across the enterprise. For example, a shared service for
Finance and Accounting will reduce annual General and Administrative (G)
spending which in turn will help fund the purchase of new manufacturing
equipment to reduce product cost and increase profits. 

&#8220;Global organizations benefit immensely with increased long-term visibility into
operations, especially when data they&#8217;re viewing is actionable,&#8221; said Steve
Kowalke, advisor to the Cognos Innovation Center for Performance Management and
former vice president and treasurer, Target Corporation. &#8220;In a time when
surprises are becoming increasingly common, senior finance officials need the
most robust solutions like this blueprint to track progress of initiatives with
respect to goals and objectives, and also to show what&#8217;s in store for the
long-term.&#8221; 

The IBM Cognos Strategic Investment Management Blueprint blends IBM Cognos 8
software including planning, dashboards, reporting, and analytical reports with
services through the application of Intellectual property assets from IBM Global
Business Services. 

The blueprint is a performance management accelerator designed to expedite
time-to-value and further drive customer success. Senior finance executives can
better manage and fund strategic programs with the help of this blueprint
because it:

* Facilitates integrated business planning over an organization&#8217;s strategic time
horizon 
* Provides a dynamic dashboard to monitor and assess the gap between targets and
forecasts 
* Enables the planning and evaluation of multiple strategic programs and their
associated funding initiatives 
* Enables M planning and evaluation 
* Facilitates comparison and analysis of &#8220;what-if&#8221; scenarios 
* Enables commitment and execution tracking of capital investments linked to
strategic programs 
* Automates the workflow and process management aspect of ensuring the
organization stays focused on these strategic programs

&#8220;In these uncertain times brought on by a worldwide capital market crisis,
companies are struggling to evaluate, fund and manage strategic profit and
growth programs,&#8221; said William Fuessler, global leader, financial management
service line, IBM Global Business Services. &#8220;By blending analytical software and
services, this unique blueprint can help companies anticipate performance gaps,
revise long-range targets and manage and fund strategic programs to make
necessary course corrections. The timing is right for a tool like this; access
to funding in the capital markets and corporate lenders is challenging at best,
and organizations have more pressure than ever to achieve communicated financial
outcomes.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Guess?, Inc. (NYSE: GES), Plains Exploration and Production (NYSE: PXP), U.S.
Bancorp (NYSE: USB), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) and H Block, Inc.
(NYSE: HRB).

Here are highlights from Wednesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:

Guess? Gets Figured Out

Guess?, Inc. (NYSE: GES) reported better-than-expected third quarter results on
the top and bottom lines. However, the company's guidance for the fourth quarter
was below consensus expectations. 

For the fourth quarter, Guess now expects revenue of $500-$540 million and EPS
of $0.50-$0.55. This compares to our previous estimates of $546 million and
$0.68 per share. The company's results are being negatively affected by slowing
economic growth and a stronger US dollar. 

Plains E: Plenty More to Pump

We are maintaining our Buy recommendation on Plains Exploration and Production
(NYSE: PXP), but are decreasing our target price from $91.00 to $55.00 per
share. 

The credit crunch and soft commodity environment has been detrimental to E
players stock prices, as the industry has slid more than 50% YTD. However, after
its Piceance/Permian Basin asset divestiture, PXP will enter 2009 with $1.3
billion of liquidity, strong production growth from its Texas, Flatrock and
Haynesville assets and a very favorable hedging program securing more than 80%
of its production. 

U.S. Bancorp Grows, but Slower

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, is one of the
nation's top 10 financial holding companies with a market cap worth in excess of
$50 billion. In recent years, USB has been an active acquirer on the processing
side of the business, while bank acquisitions have been limited. 

USB's core 3Q08 results came in ahead of our expectations, driven by an increase
in loans and earnings assets. Growth in higher spread assets and a liability
sensitive balance sheet in a declining rate environment have helped the company
to sail through the current economy. 

Procter &amp; Gamble a Safe Bet

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (NYSE: PG) management is committed to a growth
strategy based on (1) driving volume through product innovation and increasing
penetration into developing markets and (2) expanding profitability by focusing
on higher margin categories. 

The plan is meeting with success in terms of top-line expansion, volume growth,
and higher earnings. Though the Gillette acquisition was accretive to earnings
in fiscal 2008, the gross margin was negatively impacted by increased commodity
and energy costs. 

H Block Valued Squarely

H Block, Inc. (NYSE: HRB) is a leading provider of tax preparation, financial
advice, investment, mortgage and business services. The company is the largest
provider of tax preparation services in the world, serving taxpayers primarily
in the U.S., Canada, and Australia through more than 13,000 retail outlets and
via its digital tax solutions. 

We reiterate our Hold rating on shares of HRB following the release of Q2
financial results. Although the fallout from the mortgage business implosion
will likely be felt for some time to come, and we continue to have significant
concerns regarding other aspects of HRB's business, we believe that negative and
positive aspects of the company's outlook are now roughly balanced.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) as the
Bull of the Day and CEMEX S.A. de C.V. (NYSE: CX) as the Bear of the Day. In
addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tower Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:
TWGP), AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) and Benchmark Electronics, Inc. (NYSE: BHE). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) 

Procter &amp; Gamble&#8217;s management is committed to a growth strategy based on (1)
driving volume through product innovation and increasing penetration into
developing markets and (2) expanding profitability by focusing on higher margin
categories. 

The plan is meeting with success in terms of top-line expansion, volume growth,
and higher earnings. Though the Gillette acquisition was accretive to earnings
in fiscal 2008, the gross margin was negatively impacted by increased commodity
and energy costs. 

Taking advantage of recent market weakness that drove P's stock to an
attractive valuation level, the stock was upgraded to a Buy. The target price of
$72.50 is based on a 20 P/E on trailing 12-month earnings. 

Bear of the Day: CEMEX S.A. de C.V. (NYSE: CX) 

Currently, CEMEXis the third-largest cement company in the world, the fourth
largest aggregates producer, and the largest ready-mix producer. The company is
diversified by nation and region, and has a good growth record. It is a dominant
force in Mexico, Spain, the U.K. and the U.S. 

We are keeping our Sell rating on CEMEX. The company posted weak results in the
third quarter of 2008, together with a 74% year-over-year decline in net income.
The continued weak cement volumes in Spain and the U.S. are problematic. 

The short-term outlook for the company remains highly uncertain based on the
downtrend in the residential, industrial/commercial sector, and the
infrastructure sector as well due to the fall in the real estate prices
throughout the world. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Tower Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: TWGP) 

Tower Group&#8217;score 3Q08 results came in at $0.79 per share, two cents ahead of
our expectations, aided by a 21% rise in net premiums earned with growth
exhibited from the Northeast and from the successful expansion into California,
Texas, and Florida (this trend should continue into 2009). 

The acquisitions of Castlepoint Holdings and Hermitage Insurance Group are
expected to close before the end of 1H09. However, the pending integration of
these acquisitions precludes us from adjusting our Hold rating on the shares of
this company. Although we believe the company remains well-positioned to
continue growing premiums at a rapid clip, we think the company&#8217;s aggressive
expansion plan in the softening market should in all likelihood experience a
worsening within its combined ratios. Further, modest levels of subprime paper
in the investment portfolio adds a level of uncertainty over the near term. 

AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO) 

AutoZone is a leading retailer of automotive parts and accessories. The company
has significant cash flow and plans to expand its square footage growth.
AutoZone has maintained a mid-single-digit square footage growth rate by opening
new stores every year. 

Although, the company is suffering from sluggish same-store sales, falling gas
prices will eventually neutralize it. However, category management efforts and
supply chain initiatives undertaken by the company are likely to be offset by
higher staffing costs. 

Benchmark Electronics, Inc. (NYSE: BHE) 

Benchmark Electronicsprovides electronics manufacturing services (EMS) on a
turnkey basis. The company specializes in engineering services -- including
product design, printed circuit board layout, prototyping and test development. 

With the Computing segment fading faster than expected, Benchmark Electronics is
expected to face decelerating revenue growth in the coming quarters. Citing an
early wind-down of mature projects, the company again reported a disappointing
third quarter and offered a weak guidance for the fourth quarter as well.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS Dec 11 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N) said on
Thursday it had cut runs at its 115,000 barrels-per-day
Fos-sur-Mer refinery since Friday due to the week-long strike at
the Fos-Lavera oil hub, a spokesman at its French branch told

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is laying
off some 200 staff in London this week as part of a 10 percent
cut in global headcount first reported in October, two people
familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which had a record 32,569 employees in August,
declined to confirm the actual number of job losses and did not
say how many employees it had in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is part of the 10 percent headcout reduction
previously announced," a Goldman Sachs spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources familiar with the situation said the overall 10
percent cut includes a 5 percent reduction in its global
workforce undertaken each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than 240,000 jobs have been lost in the financial
industry since August 2007 and Goldman has not been able to
avoid a global slowdown in investment banking activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) recently
became bank holding companies, and analysts expect the
regulatory cost will be high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say their new regulator, the Federal Reserve, is
more demanding than the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), and commercial banks have to report to the Fed, the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the New York State Bank
authorities at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week brought fresh announcements of job cuts from

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bermuda-based insurer XL Capital Ltd
(XL.N) has hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser to explore
possible alternatives, it said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a statement, XL said that "as can be expected in the
current environment, the company is continuing to explore
value-enhancing opportunities available to it" and was being
assisted by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of XL dropped $1.89, or nearly 33 percent, to close
at $3.90 on the New York Stock Exchange, prior to its
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said that the mark-to-market decline on
its investment portfolio in the weeks since the end of the
third quarter appears to be similar to the decline it had
posted for entire the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It noted, however, that changes in credit spreads and
interest rates in the coming weeks could affect the decline it
eventually reports for the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; XL also said it expects to report about $200 million to
$220 million in net investment fund affiliate losses from its
alternative investment portfolio for the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For more MA news and our DealZone blog, go to

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) will accelerate
investment in China as opposition to foreign investment eases
and the need for funding rises, an executive said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Kevin Zhang, a managing director for Goldman Sachs (Asia),
said he was focusing on opportunities in China's growing
consumer sector as well as renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will continue to accelerate our pace of investment in
China," Zhang told reporters. "In the 15 years that I have been
with Goldman, this is possibly the best investment environment
I have seen," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executive did not provide any value for Goldman's
planned investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zhang was speaking on the sidelines of an event marking a

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) is weathering the broad-market storm better
than its fellow financial components on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. JPM is
down just 31.4% year-to-date, compared to losses of more than 60% for American
Express (AXP) and Bank of America (BAC). Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) has plunged
more than 74% in 2008. 

In fairness, these comparisons are not the most rigorous; plenty of stocks are
outperforming Citigroup this year. However, it merits mentioning that JPM seems
to be the most resilient of its peers. After all, this is the storied financial
institution that was called upon to rescue its ailing comrades Bear Stearns and
Washington Mutual when they faced near-certain collapse.

&lt;p&gt; Dec 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut the six-month price
targets on the stocks of a clutch of oil-field services
companies, saying it expects lower exploration spending by oil
majors due to current commodity prices and the ongoing turmoil
in the credit markets.

 Also, Goldman downgraded shares of onshore drilling
contractor Patterson-UTI Energy Inc (PTEN.O) to "sell" from
"neutral" and said it sees 30 percent potential downside to its
six-month price target.

 "Even though most investors are already bracing for a
significant decline in the U.S. rig count, we do not believe
that the magnitude of decline that we are forecasting is fully
discounted in Patterson's stock," the brokerage said.

 Goldman, which earlier in the day predicted that oil could
drop as low as $30 in the first quarter of 2009, has a
"neutral" coverage view for the oil-field services sector.

 "We recognize that the stocks are already down 65 percent
from the peak but we see the potential for further downside in
the near-term as commodity prices fall to near 'cash costs' in
the first quarter of 2009," a team of Goldman analysts led by
Daniel Boyd wrote in a research note to clients.

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures fell sharply Friday
as global equities slumped amid the failure of an automaker rescue package
in the U.S. Senate and with Goldman Sachs predicting oil prices could fall
to $30 a barrel.

 "The auto bailout plan dying in the Senate is weighing on all markets,"
said Tom Bentz, analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. "Yesterday's
late pullback is looking like another failure on the upside."

 Oil's retreat came a day after a 10 percent spike amid a weakening
dollar and expectations that OPEC producers will agree to cut more output
at a Dec. 17 meeting in Algeria.

 NYMEX January crude oil options expire on Dec. 16, a day before OPEC
meets. The January contract expires on Dec. 19.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) slashed its
commodity price forecasts on Friday, citing a collapse in global
economic growth and demand because of the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. bank which earlier this year predicted an oil price
CLc1 spike to $200 a barrel now expects to see crude average
$45 a barrel next year. [ID:nSP354465]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forecasts for industrial metals aluminium MAL3 and copper
MCU3 traded on the London Metal Exchange were cut
substantially to $1,410 and $2,950 a tonne next year from $2,310
and $5,230, respectively. [ID:nLC362836]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As time goes on, evidence continues to mount that the
collapse in September and October oil and other commodity demand
was not only a transient impact of the credit paralysis,"
Goldman said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But instead a prelude to the wider damage that the sharp
deterioration in credit conditions has inflicted on economic
activity around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fears of worse to come for the global economy can be seen in
the problems of the global auto industry, particularly in the
United States where the U.S. Senate rejected a bailout of the
sector under threat of collapse. [ID:nLC192827] [TOPWRAP]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman expects economic activity to bottom in the middle of
2009 and a return to year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter
of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand levels have fallen far below restricted supply levels
and large surpluses will need to be controlled by sharp output
cuts, fuelled by tumbling prices in the spot market, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The need to address large surpluses means spot rather than
long term prices will dominate action next year, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In some markets, particularly the industrial-related
markets, such as steel, petrochemicals, base metals and
petroleum refining, this process is already under way," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In other markets such as oil and gas the process is only
just beginning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONTRASTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The intensity of the global credit crunch threatens to push
oil prices below $40 a barrel in the near term, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We now expect oil demand to decline by 1.7 million barrels
a day in 2009, driven by a 1.0 million barrels a day decline in
the OECD countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As inventories reach full storage either further OPEC cuts
will be required to balance the market or prices will need to
decline further to force non-OPEC producers to shut-in
production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To rebalance the oil market, Goldman said an additional 2
million barrels a day of OPEC supply cuts and 600,000 barrels a
day reduction from non-OPEC producers will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story for industrial metals also involves larger
surpluses as prospects for metals-intensive sectors such as
construction and transport get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that fundamentals are strongest for zinc and
weakest for aluminum, where inventories are set to climb to
extraordinary levels," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aluminium stocks in London Metal Exchange warehouses at
above 1.9 million tonnes are at their highest since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, Goldman thinks demand for agricultural products
will be relatively insulated, even though it has drastically cut
forecasts for corn and wheat. [ID:nLC407434]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Expected challenges to acreage expansion in the upcoming
planting seasons, suggests less downside from current levels and
the potential for a moderate price rebound in late 2009."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global gross domestic product growth would have be outright
negative in 2009 to see a real fall in demand, the bank said.
"Further, grain stocks remain at critically low levels, creating
a much quicker recovery path."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In precious metals, Goldman expects investors looking for
safety from the financial and economic crisis and a weaker
dollar will boost prices of gold and silver. [ID:nLC373780]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gold is used by investors as a hedge against financial
turbulence and as an alternative currency to the dollar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For table of forecasts click on [ID:nLC476863]

&lt;p&gt;Dec 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Caterpillar Inc
(CAT.N) to "sell" from "neutral," citing capital spending cuts
due to the commodity downturn and the lack of available loans
for construction projects and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also cut its price target on the stock to $32
from $38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caterpillar, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, is the world's largest maker of heavy construction and
mining equipment and also has a financial products segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't expect Caterpillar earnings to bottom until the
second half of 2010 and recent gains on stimulus optimism is
likely to be more than offset by the reality of cuts in mining
and oil  gas capex," analyst Terry Darling wrote in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though mining and oil  gas are estimated to contribute to
only about 30 percent of the company's revenue, they account
for 50 percent to 60 percent of its gross profit, Darling said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With risk that CAT's spreads could widen further, we
believe the refinancing of another $3 billion to $4 billion of
debt by year-end 2009 is likely to be costly," Darling said,
adding it may provide another headwind to earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit loss provisions for CAT Financial are also likely to
grow as loan and lease default rates rise, used equipment
values decline, and economic conditions deteriorate further,
Darling added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst, who also sees a risk of backlog cancellations
for the company, said funding costs for CAT and CAT Financial
have increased sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company dropped 6 percent to $39.70 in
pre-market trade Friday.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase
 Co (JPM.N) said on Thursday the U.S. bank has had a
"terrible" November and December, blaming the "normal
culprits:" mortgages, credit, and high yield bonds and loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "November itself has been a terrible trading month ...
(and) December so far is pretty terrible," Jamie Dimon told
CNBC. "It will be a tough quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said he was referring to the trading, loans and
mortgage segments of the largest U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking ahead, the CEO said U.S. housing prices -- which
spawned the current credit crisis -- could fall another 20
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later, in a speech after receiving the "Legend in
Leadership Award" of the Yale School of Management Chief
Executive Leadership Institute, Dimon said the housing crisis
was unfixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the ceremony, which took place at the Waldorf Astoria
Hotel in New York, Dimon said the company could have to make
further writedowns if the recession became worse than expected,
but added the bank was prepared to face any scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do those numbers and they are not pretty," Dimon said
and added: "We are going to be prepared for whatever" happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the CNBC interview, he said that, "if we're lucky," the
market could start to recover after two more quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon added that it does not currently make sense for two
major investment banks to merge, adding that acquiring a
brokerage unit is not a strategic imperative for JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon's remarks on the bank's fourth quarter hammered the
bank's shares, which represented the biggest drag on the Dow
Jones industrial average. JPMorgan shares ended down 10.68
percent at $29.94 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer and Juan Lagorio; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' energy equity research team, which predicted a crude oil spike to $200 a barrel earlier this year, slashed on Friday its 2009 forecast to just $45 as demand deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team led by Arjun Murti, who made waves in 2005 by calling crude's ascent to $100, also said prices would bottom out early next year and that a shift from "demand destruction" to "supply destruction" would ultimately revive oil's rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate report, Goldman's commodities research team also cut its 2009 forecast to an average $45 and predicted world oil demand would fall by 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) and help drive oil prices down to $30 a barrel in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect that an additional 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of OPEC supply cuts will be required in 2009, along with a 600,000 bpd reduction in Non-OPEC production, in order to rebalance the market," the team led by Jeffrey Currie wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both groups saw prices recovering in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murti's team predicted a return to positive demand growth and shrinking non-OPEC supply would lift prices to $70 a barrel by 2010 and to $105 by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not believe oil markets are on-track for a decade-plus period of weakness like seen in the 1980s and 1990s," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil has collapsed more than $100 from its July peak as the dawning of a global recession drives demand lower in major economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts and officials are warning that a prolonged period of cheap prices could set the stage for another rally if new investment is halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil prices fell more than $2 a barrel to below $46 on Friday after a bailout plan for struggling U.S. auto makers stalled this week's tenuous recovery from a four-year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Leff and Jane Merriman; Editing by Clarence Fernandez/James Jukwey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 12 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
Federated Investors Inc (FII.N) to "underweight" from
"neutral," saying the impact of a zero interest rate
environment will hurt fees and revenue for the U.S. asset
manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan analysts expect the Federal Reserve to lower
its policy rate to zero percent by January in its attempt to
avert a prolonged recession and to revive the struggling credit

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with prices, details throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE/LONDON Dec 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' (GS.N)
energy equity research team, which predicted a crude oil spike
to $200 a barrel earlier this year, slashed on Friday its 2009
forecast to just $45 as demand deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The team led by Arjun Murti, who made waves in 2005 by
calling crude's ascent to $100, also said prices would bottom
out early next year and that a shift from "demand destruction"
to "supply destruction" would ultimately revive oil's rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a separate report, Goldman's commodities research team
also cut its 2009 forecast to an average $45 and predicted world
oil demand would fall by 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) and
help drive oil prices down to $30 a barrel in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect that an additional 2 million barrels per day
(bpd) of OPEC supply cuts will be required in 2009, along with a
600,000 bpd reduction in Non-OPEC production, in order to
rebalance the market," the team led by Jeffrey Currie wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But both groups saw prices recovering in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murti's team predicted a return to positive demand growth
and shrinking non-OPEC supply would lift prices to $70 a barrel
by 2010 and to $105 by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not believe oil markets are on-track for a
decade-plus period of weakness like seen in the 1980s and
1990s," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil has collapsed more than $100 from its July peak as the
dawning of a global recession drives demand lower in major
economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts and officials are warning that a prolonged
period of cheap prices could set the stage for another rally if
new investment is halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. oil prices CLc1 fell more than $2 a barrel to below
$46 on Friday after a bailout plan for struggling U.S. auto
makers stalled this week's tenous recovery from a four-year low.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail)

 LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
said on Friday it has cut its forecasts for base metals because
of the sharp deterioration in global industrial output and the
worsening demand outlook in 2009.

 The three-month forecast for aluminium MAL3 traded on the
London Metal Exchange was cut to $1,300 a tonne from $2,020
previously, copper to $2,700 from $3,835, nickel to $8,000 from
$11,095 and zinc to $1,080 from $1,310, it said in a note.

 "Although the rebalancing process is already underway with
deep cuts in mine and smelter production...we expect substantial
surpluses across most metals to continue to pressure prices
lower from current levels in the short-to-medium term," it said.

 Many producers have been forced to cut output and postpone
future projects in response to the slump in demand and as the
drop in metal prices has put pressure on marginal costs.

 The bank said it believes the fundamentals are strongest for
zinc, which is used to galvanise steel, and the weakest for
aluminium. 

 "Historically, zinc demand has tended to fair better during
economic downturns," it said.

 It expects demand for aluminium in 2009 to fall 1.7 percent
year on year.

 Aluminium is used transportation and construction, two
sectors heavily hit by the global economic slowdown.

 Goldman slashed its 2009 average price forecasts for
aluminum, copper, nickel and zinc to $1,410 a tonne, $2,950,
$8,980 and $1,150, from $2,310, $5,230, $12,735 and $1,475
respectively.

 "We anticipate that declining borrowing costs, tightening
supplies and some stabilization in demand will lead to
sequential improvement in prices by late in the year, but
anticipate that large surpluses and high inventories will
largely persist," it said.

 Following is a table of new and old three, six and twelve
month price forecasts. All prices are dollars per tonne.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said it is
raising its near-term gold and silver forecasts on expectations
for a weaker dollar, and as interest in the precious metal as a
haven from risk continues to underpin prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank said it has raised its three-month gold forecast to
$700 an ounce from $690, its six-month price view to $785 from
$730 and its 12-month forecast to $795 from $710.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It sees silver at $10.04 an ounce in three months, up from a
previous forecast of $9.90, at $11.08 an ounce in six months,
against $10.30, and at $10.30 in 12 months, against $9.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are raising our gold price forecasts in line with
Goldman Sachs economists' currency revisions toward a weaker
U.S. dollar outlook," the bank said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have long held that gold trades inversely with the U.S.
dollar, which historically has explained over 90 percent of gold
price movements," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gold, which is often bought as a currency hedge, often
benefits from weakness in the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The current turmoil in the financial markets and worries
over the outlook for the global economy are also likely to boost
the precious metals' appeal as a haven from risk, Goldmans
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that the pervasive negative sentiment
surrounding most financial assets may continue to support gold
prices at the margin," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spot gold XAU= was quoted at $817.20/819.20 an ounce at
0925 GMT, while silver XAG= was at $10.19/10.27 an ounce.

&lt;p&gt;Results Presented During the CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium
(SABCS)
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer today announced&#160;results from a first planned analysis of the TEAM
(Tamoxifen, Exemestane, Adjuvant, Multicenter) trial. TEAM was originally
designed in 2001 as a comparison of 5 years of upfront AROMASIN&#174; (exemestane
tablets) vs. tamoxifen. In 2004, based on results of Intergroup Exemestane Study
(IES) the TEAM trial design was revised; the tamoxifen arm was converted into a
tamoxifen/AROMASIN sequencing arm. This analysis presented at SABCS represents
the first of two co-primary endpoints that will be reported from this trial. The
first co-primary endpoint compares early events by measuring disease-free
survival (DFS: disease progression or death) at 2.75 years in 9,775 patients
randomized to initial therapy with either tamoxifen or AROMASIN. 

The analysis&#160;of DFS at 2.75 years demonstrated an 11 percent reduction in the
risk of DFS events in favor of AROMASIN (HR=0.89; 95% CI, 0.77-1.03). This
difference was not statistically significant (p=0.118). A second planned
analysis of DFS after five years of therapy is expected in late 2009. Results
from TEAM trial sub-studies were also presented at SABCS. 

&#8220;The TEAM data contribute to the growing knowledge of the role of aromatase
inhibitors in the treatment of early breast cancer,&#8221; said Dr. Steve Jones,
medical director, U.S. Oncology Research, Houston and Texas Oncology, Dallas,
TX. &#8220;Clinicians take into account patient profile, clinical evidence and
guidelines when determining the optimal treatment regimen for patients, and
should consider these new data as treatment strategies are evaluated.&#8221; 

Additional TEAM Study Results

* Additional secondary analyses demonstrated a:

* 15 percent reduction in the risk of recurrence-free survival(RFS) events in
favor of AROMASIN (HR=0.85; 95 percent CI, 0.72-1.00; p=0.049) 
* 19 percent improvement in the time-to-distant metastasis in favor of AROMASIN
(HR=0.81; 95 percent CI, 0.67-0.98; p=0.026)

* When adjusting the primary DFS analysis accounting for discontinuation rates
and patients who switched prior to 2.5 years, an analysis showed a 17 percent
reduction in the risk of DFS events at 2.75 years in favor of AROMASIN (HR=0.83;
95 percent CI, 0.71-0.97; p=0.021)

* Treatment discontinuation rates for tamoxifen and AROMASIN were 29.5 percent
and 18.9 percent, respectively 
* 754 patients in the tamoxifen arm switched prior to 2.5 years

* The most common side effects reported in the TEAM trial were consistent with
the expected safety profile of these agents. Side effects were coded by NCI CTC
(version 2), and included for tamoxifen and AROMASIN (all grades), respectively:
hot flashes (33 percent, 28.5 percent); arthralgias (9.2 percent, 18.4 percent);
fatigue (16 percent, 16.8 percent); pain (13.2 percent, 14.6 percent); infection
(13 percent, 11.9 percent) 
* The incidence of bone-related side effects for tamoxifen and Aromasin,
respectively, were:

* Osteoporosis (2.2 percent, 4.9 percent) 
* Spine/wrist/hip fractures (0.5 percent, 0.6 percent)

TEAM Sub-studies

* Data from the TEAM Pathology study support the prognostic value of PgR in ER+
early breast cancer 
* Results from additional TEAM sub-studies (bone, cognitive function, quality of
life and physical activities) were also presented

About the TEAM Trial

TEAM is a randomized, open-label, multinational trial in 9,775 postmenopausal
women with hormone sensitive early breast cancer. The TEAM trial represents an
international collaboration of investigators in 9 countries who conducted the
trial following protocols representative of local clinical practice. 

TEAM was originally designed in 2001 as a comparison of 5 years of upfront
AROMASIN&#174; (exemestane tablets) vs. tamoxifen. In 2004, based on results of IES
the TEAM design was revised; the tamoxifen arm was converted into a
tamoxifen/AROMASIN sequencing arm. The modified design includes two co-primary
endpoints comparing DFS in a pre-planned pooled analysis:

* At 2.75 years in patients randomized to initial therapy with either tamoxifen
or AROMASIN (presented at SABCS 2008) 
* In patients treated with AROMASIN for 5 years versus patients who received
sequential therapy of tamoxifen for 2.5-3 years followed by AROMASIN for a total
of 5 years

Secondary endpoints included overall survival, time to new primary breast
cancer, recurrence-free survival, time to new primary cancers (other than
breast) and safety and tolerability. The TEAM trial includes 19 prospectively
planned observational and translational research sub-studies. 

&#8220;Aromasin has had an important impact on the treatment of women with breast
cancer since its approval,&#8221; said Dr. Ray Urbanski, senior medical
director/Oncology Group Lead. &#8220;We are proud of our heritage in breast cancer,
and continued commitment to develop new treatment options to meet the unmet
needs of these patients.&#8221; 

About Aromasin&#174; (exemestane tablets)

Aromasin is the only aromatase inhibitor indicated for sequential therapy in
postmenopausal women with HR positive early breast cancer after 2-3 years of
tamoxifen for a total of 5 years of adjuvant therapy. The use of Aromasin in
this setting is supported by the landmark IES trial. Aromasin is also indicated
for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose
disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important Aromasin&#174;(exemestane tablets)Safety Information

AROMASIN should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
estrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers. In
patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving AROMASIN than
either tamoxifen or placebo.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Dec 12 (Reuters) - Himin Solar Energy Group, the
country's top maker of solar water heaters, secured a near $100
million investment from Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and China's CDH
Ventures, the three parties said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Himin's president, Huang Ming, said the funds would be used
to help fuel the company's fast growth and further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This investment along with Himin's own funds will be used
mostly in research, to expand our domestic market and invest in
new areas," Huang told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Himin and its two new investors are planning to take the
company public on China's A share market, said Huang, who gave no
timetable for a possible listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The timing of a listing is not entirely up to us," said
Huang, who pointed to a long line of some 300 companies waiting
for regulatory approval to list domestically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal was initially announced in early 2008, but was
delayed by the financial crisis, said Huang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and CDH would each take half of the investment, which
was valued at just under $100 million because of currency
changes, said the parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Huang said the company targetted $4.23 billion in
sales in five years, at least a threefold increase from last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese producers already account for more than
three-quarters of world output of the systems, which use the
sun's energy to heat water for daily use, rather than to generate
electricity, as better-known and more sophisticated photovoltaic
(PV) cells do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The solar heaters are the only form of renewable energy --
outside of hydroelectric power -- that is competitive in China
without subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($=6.84 yuan)

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Dec 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has paid
$120 million for a 25 percent stake in Chinese cement maker
Hongshi Group, the China Business News reported, citing a Hongshi
official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Talks of the stake purchase started in October, 2005, and the
transaction obtained Chinese government approval this October,
said the Chinese-language newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hongshi, set up in 2002, is now the biggest cement maker in
China's eastern Zhejiang province, with an expected 3 billion
yuan ($438 million) in sales this year, the article said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs managing director Kevin Zhang said last week
that the Wall Street Bank would accelerate investment in China as
opposition to foreign investment eases and the need for funding
rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs recently made a $100 million joint investment
with China CDH Ventures in Himin Solar Energy Group, China's top
maker of solar water heaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's cement industry is likely to benefit from the
government's 4 trillion yuan ($584.6 billion) economic stimulus
package focused on infrastructure construction and social
welfare.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's push to recover from 11-year lows could hit major speed bumps this week as investors fret about the U.S. automakers' fate and the Federal Reserve holds its last scheduled policy meeting of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market's other big test will be the start of the quarterly reporting season for investment banks when Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are expected to report heavy losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, U.S. President-elect Barack Obama's economic stimulus could reach $1 trillion over two years, far larger than previous estimates, according to a Wall Street Journal report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama aides, who were considering a half-trillion dollar package two weeks ago, now consider $600 billion over two years "a very low-end estimate," the paper said citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. auto industry's fate has been a major weight on the market after Thursday's collapse of U.S. Senate legislation that sought to avert a possible bankruptcy by one or more of the nation's three automakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without government aid, investors fear that a failure of any of the three -- General Motors Corp (GM.N), Ford (F.N) or Chrysler -- would exacerbate the year-long recession and drag other companies under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The automakers employ nearly 250,000 people directly and 100,000 more jobs at parts suppliers could hinge on their survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the White House said it was willing to consider using some of the $700 billion initially approved by Congress to shore up the financial system to help the beleaguered auto industry. But it gave no indication when that help might come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A White House spokeswoman said early Sunday that she didn't expect an announcement on an auto industry rescue plan before President George W. Bush returns to the U.S. from his trip to Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems ... they're going to keep the carmakers on life support in the intensive care unit until the new administration takes over," said William Stone, PNC Wealth Management's chief investment strategist in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the other hand, maybe that doesn't help the market, either, because you will still sit there with the other uncertainty that you've got to put away the bad someday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bid for auto industry aid comes at the worst time as the United States prepares for President-Elect Barack Obama to be sworn in on January 20, succeeding Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, concerns about the automakers' fate rattled investors, causing Wall Street to gyrate between gains and losses in a choppy session.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats column initially sent late on Friday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 14 (Reuters) - Wall Street's push to recover
from 11-year lows could hit major speed bumps this week as
investors fret about the U.S. automakers' fate and the Federal
Reserve holds its last scheduled policy meeting of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market's other big test will be the start of the
quarterly reporting season for investment banks when Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are expected to report
heavy losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. auto industry's survival hangs in the balance
after a measure that sought to avert a possible bankruptcy by
one or more of the nation's Big Three automakers collapsed in
the U.S. Senate on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without government aid, investors fear that a failure of
any of the three -- General Motors Corp (GM.N), Ford (F.N) or
Chrysler -- would exacerbate the year-long recession and drag
other companies under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The automakers employ nearly 250,000 people directly and
100,000 more jobs at parts suppliers could hinge on their
survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, the White House said it was willing to consider
using some of the $700 billion initially approved by Congress
to shore up the financial system to help the beleaguered auto
industry. But it gave no indication when that help might come.
For details, see [ID:nLC248861]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A White House spokeswoman said early Sunday that she didn't
expect an announcement on an auto industry rescue plan before
President George W. Bush returns to the U.S. from his trip to
Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems ... they're going to keep the carmakers on life
support in the intensive care unit until the new administration
takes over," said William Stone, PNC Wealth Management's chief
investment strategist in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On the other hand, maybe that doesn't help the market,
either, because you will still sit there with the other
uncertainty that you've got to put away the bad someday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bid for auto industry aid comes at the worst time as
the United States prepares for President-Elect Barack Obama to
be sworn in on Jan. 20, succeeding Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, concerns about the automakers' fate rattled
investors, causing Wall Street to gyrate between gains and
losses in a choppy session. But a rally in technology shares
helped spark a late recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 64.59 points,
or 0.75 percent, to end at 8,629.68 on Friday. The Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 6.14 points, or 0.70 percent, to
879.73. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 32.84
points, or 2.18 percent, to 1,540.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the week, though, the .DJI , the Dow dipped 0.1
percent. In contrast, the SP 500 rose 0.4 percent and the
Nasdaq finished the week up 2.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW LOW CAN THE FED GO?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides the auto sector's upheaval, the Fed's policy
meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday could give investors pause
amid signs the U.S. central bank is running out of room to cut
interest rates. The Fed may soon have to try other means to
revive the economy, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed is widely expected to lower the benchmark fed
funds rate by a half-percentage point to just 0.5 percent from
1 percent on Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day
meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors will be looking at how far they will cut, and
even more important is what kind of communication they would
do regarding the future course of policy," said John Praveen,
chief investment strategist of Prudential International
Investments in Newark, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two weeks ago, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said
the Fed could directly buy "substantial quantities" of
longer-term securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or
government-sponsored agencies to lower yields and stimulate
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Markets are going to be looking for how they are
conducting policy forward and what are they going to say about
quantitative easing," Praveen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RIVERS OF RED INK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As one of Wall Street's worst years comes to a close,
investors will brace themselves for Morgan Stanley's and
Goldman Sachs' results this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect a tough fourth quarter for the two banks,
and Goldman is widely expected to post its first quarterly
loss since going public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It could be tougher sledding as far as write-offs go,"
said PNC's Stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley is likely to wind up in the red for the
second time in the past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the SP 500 hit its bear market low on Nov. 21, the
U.S. stock market has increasingly showed signs of shrugging
off even the bleakest of news as investors bet that the
downturn could not possibly get much worse. Some believe an
economic revival is likely by 2009's second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the SP slid on Nov. 21 to its bear market intraday
low of 741.02 -- a level last seen in 1997 -- the benchmark
index has gained almost 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the year, the Dow is down 34.9 percent, while the SP
500 is off 40.1 percent and the Nasdaq is down 42 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CPI AND HOUSING STARTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The week's economic calendar is sparse, but some reports
will command attention: November industrial production on
Monday; the U.S. Consumer Price Index and housing starts, both
for November, on Tuesday, as well as the December reading on
Mid-Atlantic business activity from the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia and the latest weekly jobless claims, both on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall CPI is expected to show a 1.3 percent drop in
November, according to economists polled by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a year-over-year basis, overall CPI is seen up 1.5
percent, the Reuters poll showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More weakness on the housing front is forecast, with
housing starts likely to slip to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 740,000 units in November from October's record low of
791,000, according to the Reuters poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  For a full economic diary, see [ECI/US]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the thin roster of Fed speakers this week is Richard

&lt;p&gt;SlideShare Ribbon for Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 Enables Users to Share and
Discover Presentations With the World&#8217;s Largest Online Presentation Sharing
Community
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
SlideShare today announced the availability of a Microsoft Office PowerPoint
2007 add-in that creates a SlideShare Ribbon tab within the Microsoft Office
PowerPoint 2007 User Interface.Once installed, the unique Microsoft Office
ribbon user interface within PowerPoint lets users access many of SlideShare&#8217;s
presentation sharing services.

The add-in can be downloaded for free
fromhttp://www.slideshare.net/developers/apps/pptribbon.Once installed,
SlideShare users can access their SlideShare presentations, discover community
presentations and view community usage metrics for their presentations, all from
within Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007.

SlideShare worked with the Microsoft Developer and Platform Evangelism group to
discuss requirements and obtain guidance on using Microsoft tools and
technologies such as the Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Office to implement
the add-in.

&#8220;The SlideShare Ribbon simultaneously brings cloud-based social sharing into
PowerPoint, and SlideShare to the desktop. If you're making a presentation, you
can search SlideShare, download PowerPoint presentations for inspiration, and
re-upload your finished work, all without ever opening a browser.Smart
presenters will find that these new desktop features make them more productive
and help them leverage the power of community to hone their message and expand
their audiences,&#8221; said Rashmi Sinha, SlideShare&#8217;s CEO.

The SlideShare ribbon marks a new way of thinking about how desktop applications
can work with cloud-based services, and how cloud-based services can leverage
desktop software better. This hybrid approach provides a unique user experience,
enabling the social web to seamlessly integrate into a familiar and broadly
adopted software application. Before the availability of this add-in, SlideShare
enabled PowerPoint presentations to be shared on the web; with this new feature,
sharing can occur from the desktop itself.

&#8220;Expanding the reach of PowerPoint to create a seamless experience into
SlideShare&#8217;s presentation sharing community bridges the power of the best client
software and the reach of the web&#8217;s most effective sites to empower users,&#8221; said
Jamin Spitzer, director of platform strategy at Microsoft.&#160;&#8220;By taking a software

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 15 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) plans
to shut the 120,000 barrel per day gasoline-producing fluidic
catalytic cracker No. 3 at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery
for a four-week overhaul from early February into early March,
sources familiar with the project said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon Mobil spokesman declined to discuss planned
maintenance at the 503,000 bpd Baton Rouge refinery, which is
the second-largest in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Baton Rouge refinery has two FCCs, which can each
process up to 120,000 bpd of feedstock into motor fuels. FCC
No. 2 will continue to operate while FCC No. 3 is shut.
Planning for the overhaul of FCC No. 3 has been going on for
years, according to the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the FCC is shut, workers will also correct problems
with the wet gas scrubber that serves both FCCs, the sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Particulates, primarily the catalyst used in the FCCs, have
increased in the past year because of degradation of parts of
the wet gas scrubber, which is supposed to remove the
material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon is also rebuilding a cooling tower that serves the
alkylation unit at the refinery. The cooling tower was
destroyed when Hurricane Gustav hit Baton Rouge with winds over
90 miles per hour (145 kph) on Sept. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Construction of the new cooling tower is expected to finish
by next spring.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hollywood studio DreamWorks received warm reviews on Monday for its Broadway debut "Shrek the Musical," which pits it against rival Walt Disney Co. on the Great White Way as theaters ride out the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 15 (Reuters) - Hollywood studio DreamWorks
received warm reviews on Monday for its Broadway debut "Shrek
the Musical," which pits it against rival Walt Disney Co. on
the Great White Way as theaters ride out the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Based on the 1990 book about a green ogre and a princess
and the 2001 Oscar-winning animated film -- the first of the
DreamWorks trilogy -- "Shrek the Musical" takes on Disney shows
"The Lion King," "Mary Poppins" and "The Little Mermaid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The maiden Broadway venture of DreamWorks Theatricals ...
is definitely a cut above the most recent offerings from its
creators' direct competitor in cartoon-inspired musicals, Walt
Disney," wrote The New York Times' Ben Brantley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Unlike that company's 'Tarzan' and 'Little Mermaid,'
'Shrek' has the virtues of a comprehensible plot and
identifiable characters," he said. "But it seems to me that if
'Shrek' had more generally heeded its own advice about
substance versus surface, it might have come closer to casting
the spell that lets Broadway shows live happily ever after."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Tarzan" lasted just 14 months due to poor reviews and
ticket sales, and "The Little Mermaid" opened in January to
replace the 13-year-old "Beauty and the Beast." "Mary Poppins"
has grossed more than $100 million since opening in 2006 and
"The Lion King" has made $600 million in 11 years on Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as the financial crisis grips the world and productions
prepare to compete for the fewer discretionary dollars, Disney
is offering a free ticket to children under the age of 18 with
the sale of an adult ticket for shows between Jan. 6 and March
13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said it generated more than $2 million in sales in
the past two weeks and on Monday announced that it would extend
the offer for another week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AUDIENCES FLAT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, according to trade group The Broadway League,
productions are grossing more than last year, although
attendance is flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said nearly 12.3 million Broadway tickets were sold in
the 12 months to the end of May, producing $937 million in
gross revenues -- a figure dampened by a 19-day stagehands
strike in late 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strike has made it difficult to compare ticket sales,
but the league said gross sales have totaled $518.9 million
from the June 1 beginning of the season through mid-December,
compared to a league "guesstimate" -- as if there had been no
strike -- of $493.4 million for the same period in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Shrek the Musical" is also competing for younger audiences
against the recently opened "Billy Elliot the Musical," based
on 2000 Oscar nominated film about a British boy from a
coal-mining town who dreams of becoming a ballet dancer. "Billy
Elliot" received rave reviews that boosted ticket sales to more
than $1 million a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Post and the Daily News both gave "Shrek the
Musical" three stars out of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe Dziemianowicz of the Daily News described the show as
"fine, not great," while Barbara Hoffman of the Post wrote: "It
takes nearly all of Act 1 before 'Shrek the Musical' starts to

&lt;p&gt;SAN ANTONIO--(Business Wire)--
GlobalSCAPE, Inc. (AMEX: GSB), a leading developer of file transfer solutions,
today announced the release of Mail Express&#8482;, a Microsoft Outlook plug-in that
facilitates the transfer of large attachments. Mail Express resolves a common IT
issue in which large attachments may not be deliverable due to e-mail size
restrictions imposed by the sending or receiving mail server. Mail Express also
reduces the IT workload by eliminating the need to create ad hoc FTP logins for
end users. 

With Mail Express, attachments exceeding a configurable total size threshold are
automatically and seamlessly replaced in the e-mail message with a link. When
the recipient opens the e-mail message and clicks the link, Mail Express
delivers the files to the recipient and sends a delivery confirmation message to
the sender. 

Mail Express also provides substantial benefits for mail system administrators
by establishing a single point of accountability and auditing for attachments
sent from Microsoft Outlook. In addition to specifying size thresholds for Mail
Express delivery, administrators can configure Mail Express to deliver only
certain types of files (for example, by file extension) and can audit attachment
transmissions and deliveries. 

&#8220;GlobalSCAPE is pleased to release Mail Express following strong, positive
market feedback from our November pre-announcement of this solution,&#8221; stated
Greg Hoffer, GlobalSCAPE Vice President of New Products. &#8220;We have rebranded the
solution as Mail Express to clearly signal the arrival of a powerful e-mail
plug-in that complements our industry-leading file transfer solutions. With Mail
Express, the GlobalSCAPE portfolio now includes client, server, software as a
service, and e-mail solutions for facilitating file transfers. We look forward
to sustaining our leadership in this market space and extending Mail Express to
other e-mail solutions.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;ANAHEIM, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
UNITE HERE Local 11 has launched www.disneyisunfaithful.org, a blog created to
document how Disney is being unfaithful to workers, communities and customers
around the world. The website exposes Disney&#8217;s deteriorating wages for employees
and the impact this has on the Anaheim and Orlando economies, it reveals
environmental practices by the company, and exposes exorbitant CEO salaries and
expenses as well as the negative impact on families of Disney&#8217;s proposed cut to
hotel workers&#8217; benefits. 

The blog is meant to be an interactive site that invites Disney&#8217;s fan base,
employees and cultural critics to share their stories. 

The blog discusses how Walt Disney once famously declared that &#8220;Disneyland is a
work of love. We did not go into Disneyland with the idea of making money.&#8221; Walt
truly believed that treating his employees fairly and humanely was crucial to
his vision of the &#8220;happiest place on earth.&#8221; It claims that the company that
carries Walt&#8217;s name is not upholding the values that he espoused. 

2,300 employees of the Disneyland Hotels, including bellmen, dishwashers, room
attendants, and cooks, have been working without a contract since February 2008.
Many hotel workers who have given years to the company will be faced with
increased difficulty in obtaining healthcare for their families due to the
company&#8217;s proposals. These proposals include increasing both cost and
eligibility requirements for benefits like health-care, vacation and seniority.
Thousands of low-wage workers and their children would suffer as a result. 

Jean Bustamante, a Server at the Yamabuki Restaurant at the Disney owned
Paradise Pier Hotel in Anaheim says, "I am a single mother of two children. My 7
year old son has Cerebral Palsy as well as many other disabilities. With the
company's proposal of &#8220;casual regular&#8221; he would surely lose his much needed
health insurance. As a 15-year employee, even when I work 6 days a week, I still
don't average 30 hours. How can Disney deny how much this proposal will hurt my
family?" 

When business slows down, the company cuts employee hours. Currently, even with
less than 30 hours, workers can still qualify for health insurance, holidays and
vacations. With the new company proposal, many would become Casual Regular and
lose many benefits. 

UNITE HERE Local 11 represents over 15,000 hotel, food service, laundry, airport
and stadium workers in the Los Angeles area.

&lt;p&gt;LIMA Dec 15 (Reuters) - Traffickers hid 2.8 tonnes of cocaine in thousands of pounds of smelly bird droppings, Peruvian police said on Monday after uncovering the latest ruse to conceal drug shipments. Cocaine exporters in Peru, the world's No. 2 producer after neighboring Colombia, counted on the stench of the dung, which is sold as a high-end organic fertilizer, tricking dogs trained to find drugs at ports of entry. Guano, as the dung is known in Spanish, is rich in nitrates and phosphorous and has a strong ammonia smell. The cocaine was hidden in 400 bags of guano that together weighed 20 tonnes and was bound for Europe. The organic products camouflaged the cocaine by neutralizing it to avoid detection, police said after a five-month investigation that led to the seizure at a warehouse in Lima about 10 days ago. Five people were arrested, including a Colombian man, police said. Guano accumulates as white mounds on the desert islands where birds such as pelicans live along the coasts of Peru and Chile. It was once one of the world's most valuable commodities, and Bolivia, Peru and Chile fought over its control in the 1879-1883 War of the Pacific.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In a move to provide businesses worldwide with consistent tools for
measuring aggregate risk in the financial world and provide a real-time
view of market exposure, the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Data Governance Council is
seeking input from banks and financial institutions, corporations,
vendors and regulators to create a standards-based approach to risk
reporting.

    Today, organizations have inconsistent methods and vague language for
disclosing operational, market, and credit risk. These inconsistencies
make regulatory oversight both extremely difficult and complex. The first
step to enabling new transparency of risk and exposures in the financial
services industry is semantic clarity -- a precise method for consistently
describing and reporting risk across all organizations. Such transparency
could provide a new macro-economic tool and greater fiscal accountability
for regulators, investors and Central Banks worldwide, making it easier to
identify toxic assets on the books, mitigate fraud, help prevent wide
scale fiscal crisis and rebuild confidence in financial systems.

    The IBM Data Governance Council is exploring the use of Extensible
Business Reporting Language (XBRL), a software language for describing
business terms in financial reports, to risk reporting. XBRL could be
used to provide a non-proprietary way of reporting risk that could
potentially be applied worldwide. It is already widely used for financial
reporting throughout Europe, Australia and Japan. The widespread use of
this standard ensures adequate skills and understanding among firms and
regulators.

    "Creating a risk taxonomy using XBRL will provide a vocabulary and a
common language allowing everyone to understand what risk means, and
that's the first step in making it easier to calculate and report," said
Steve Adler, chairman of the IBM Data Governance Council. "When we have
semantic clarity around the way organizations describe risk, incidents,
events, losses, claims, exposures, forecasts and reserves, it gets easier
to aggregate loss information, analyze it with standard actuarial
methods, compare past exposures to present conditions and opportunities,
and forecast potential outcomes."

    According to the Council, an XBRL Taxonomy of Risk could serve as a
fundamental building block to enable interoperability and standard
practices in measuring risk worldwide. Such standards could potentially
enable Central Banks to manage vast databases of loss history and trend
analyses that could better inform policymakers and member banks helping to
minimize risk and produce better returns.

    "XBRL is gaining widespread adoption among global capital markets, banking
and securities regulators, and plays an important role in market reforms
by contributing to transparency and process enhancements," said Anthony T.
Fragnito, chief executive officer, XBRL International, Inc. "XBRL
International is pleased to be a part of this important initiative by the
IBM Data Governance Council."

    The Council is immediately seeking proposals and discussion on this topic
to help drive a year-long effort to create a proposed specification for
XBRL for risk reporting. Initial discussions about this specification will
take place February 26-27, 2009 in New York City at a meeting to be
attended by the Enterprise Data Management Council, the Financial Services
Technology Consortium, XBRL International, XBRL.US, and U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission staff.

    "This is an opportunity for both improving the effectiveness of the risk
management function and the quality of reports," said Dan Schutzer,
executive director of Financial Services Technology Consortium. "XBRL for
risk reporting also holds the potential for cost-reduction through the
development of consistent, clear and comprehensive reporting standards."

    The IBM Data Governance Council is a group of 50 global companies,
including Abbott Labs, American Express, Bank of America, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Bank of Montreal, Bell Canada, Citibank,
Deutsche Bank, Discover Financial, Kasikornbank, MasterCard, Nordea Bank,
Wachovia, and the World Bank, among others, that have pioneered best
practices around risk assessment and data governance to help the business
world take a more disciplined approach to how companies handle data.

    Data governance helps organizations govern appropriate use of and access
to critical information such as customer information, financial details
and unstructured content, measuring and reporting information quality and
risk to enhance value and mitigate exposures. IBM's work in this area
supports and furthers the company's Information on Demand strategy, that
has delivered results through consistent earnings growth, hundreds of new
customer wins, strategic acquisitions and industry-first software
offerings.

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, Dec 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The UK Border Agency (UKBA), responsible for securing the United Kingdom
borders and controlling migration in the United Kingdom, today announced
it has signed IBM (NYSE: IBM) as the Strategic Systems Integration
Partner for its Immigration Case Work (ICW) Program.

    The first phase of the new three-year contract awarded to IBM, with
options to extend for a further 4 years, is the beginning of a new
strategic partnership between IBM and the UK Border Agency. Working in
conjunction with UKBA, IBM will provide consulting and systems
integration services and deliver the overall design of the new IT system
to support the applications process for visas and immigration.

    UKBA states the ICW is key to delivering its objective to streamline
immigration processes, promote new ways of working and make substantial
improvements to IT.

    Head of Immigration at the UKBA, Matthew Coats, said, "I am delighted that
IBM has been appointed as systems integrator for the ICW program. I look

capability. The ICW program is integral to our work as we carry out the
biggest shake up of the immigration system for a generation. It will help
us to make fast and fair decisions and manage migration for the benefit of
the British public."

    Graham Perrott, Public Sector Leader, IBM Global Business Services, said,
"Following Project Semaphore, part of the Government's e-Borders program,
this agreement extends an already successful relationship with UKBA. As a
globally integrated organization, we've been able to draw upon similar
contracts won around the world."

    The contract was signed in December 2008.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) near-term earnings are likely to remain under pressure from worsening consumer and corporate credit said a Merrill Lynch analyst, who forecast a fourth-quarter loss and cut his rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank's shares were trading down 6.3 percent at $28.92 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost 29 percent of its value since January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not believe the Street has rationalized the true impact of expected economic woes on consumer credit, and particularly what that means for JPM earnings," analyst Guy Moszkowski wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moszkowski sees JPMorgan building reserves in a continually worsening credit environment driven by a climbing unemployment rate and cut his rating to "underperform" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Wall Street analysts have cut their fourth-quarter profit view on JPMorgan citing significantly increased credit reserve builds and asset mark-to-market losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Moszkowski, who expects another $2.8 billion mark-to-market loss at the bank, reversed his fourth-quarter estimates to a loss of 11 cents a share from his prior view of 25 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, the bank had reported net markdowns of $3.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While there is little doubt that JPMorgan will emerge from the current crisis in a good competitive position, it is increasingly clear that credit costs in the U.S. will get much worse, particularly in cards and commercial lending," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 11, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had warned of a "terrible" fourth quarter, blaming mortgages, credit, and high yield bonds and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts polled by Reuters expect the company to earn 35 cents a share, excluding items, for the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore, Editing by Dinesh Nair)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to "neutral" from "buy" on concerns about weak consumer spending in the near-term, and risk of the stock's valuation premium coming down if iPhone sales fall short of expectations in the first half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brokerage, which has a price target of $115 on the stock, removed Apple from its Americas buy list as it expects the company to face a tougher environment in the March and June quarters as consumer demand takes another leg down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shipments of MacBooks, iPod nanos, and iPhone were all slightly lower than what was expected going into the (December) quarter," analyst David Bailey wrote in a note to its clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The near-term outlook is not very positive, as it is unlikely that Apple will launch a new product category at the MacWorld conference in early January, taking away a potential catalyst for the shares and causing Apple to try to generate demand in a tough environment without the benefit of a new offering in the first part of 2009, Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the analyst reiterated his longer-term view that Apple's ability to innovate will keep it ahead of the competition and drive share gains in its existing product categories and allow it to be first to market in newer categories like Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Apple were down more than 2 percent at $96.11 before the bell Monday.

&lt;p&gt;  IRVINE, CA, Dec 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
eEye Digital Security (www.eeye.com), an expert in integrated security
and threat-management solutions, today announced the general availability
of SecureIIS(TM) v 3.0. Offering proactive Microsoft IIS Web-server
protection, the latest version of SecureIIS features SQL injection
protection for which users can enable and select defense levels from an
action menu.

    SecureIIS operates within Microsoft IIS to actively inspect all incoming
requests at each stage of data processing. This allows the technology to
prevent potentially damaging network traffic from penetrating servers and
compromising Web-based applications, whether the traffic is encrypted or
unencrypted.

    "This capability is critical because vulnerabilities in software
applications are responsible for the vast majority of network security
breaches and data loss," said Morey Haber, VP of Business Development for
eEye Digital Security. "In particular, Web-server applications like
Microsoft IIS are consistently targeted because of the ease of application
deployment and potential flaws inherent with coding and configuration
mistakes."

    These flaws aid in the creation of some of the most damaging worms that
cause compromised Websites and Microsoft IIS directory vulnerabilities.
With proper network protection from SecureIIS, users are able to repel
common and nefarious attacks.

    "When we were hit with an exploit, I was looking at our server logs and
realized something was amiss," said Lisa Davis, IT Specialist for the Iowa
Department for the Blind. "I shut our router down until I could figure it
out, and what I learned was that SecureIIS saved us from a very serious
attack. A number of organizations in our area were infected from the same
vulnerability. SecureIIS notified me that something unusual was going on
and blocked it in the meantime. That's the beauty of behavior-based
security."

    Key Features of SecureIIS 3.0


--  SQL Injection Protection - filters common commands and characters to
    stop SQL injection attacks.
--  PCI DSS Compliance - meets the requirements for Payment Card Industry
    DSS v1.2 for a web application firewall by providing an in-line solution
    that can protect against the latest threats even when no application
    mitigation is available.
--  Application Layer Protection - inspects requests from the network and
    kernel levels as well as processing levels in between.
--  IIS ISAPI Integration - monitors data processed by IIS and blocks
    requests at any point that resembles a class of attack patterns.
--  Zero Day Protection - inspects Web-server traffic for issues such as
    buffer overflows, parser evasions, directory traversal and other attacks to
    block entire classes of attacks, including those not yet discovered.
--  Non-Intrusive Protection - offers protection without affecting service
    levels on Web servers and provides improved performance when Web servers
    come under attack.
--  Third-Party Application Protection - stops attacks launched against
    third-party Web server applications or custom Web scripts.
--  Protection Over SSL Encrypted Sessions - stops attacks on encrypted
    sessions based on the ability to analyze the content of HTTPS sessions
    before and after SSL encryption.
    

    
"Because Web servers often provide a portal to the internal network,
they require a more formidable and customized level of protection," Haber
said. "SecureIIS offers this level of protection by going beyond what
standard network firewalls and intrusion detection systems can provide."

    Pricing and Availability

    Secure IIS is currently available at $995 per copy. For more information,

Moszkowski wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moszkowski sees JPMorgan building reserves in a continually
worsening credit environment driven by a climbing unemployment
rate and cut his rating to "underperform" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several Wall Street analysts have cut their fourth-quarter
profit view on JPMorgan citing significantly increased credit
reserve builds and asset mark-to-market losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Moszkowski, who expects another $2.8 billion
mark-to-market loss at the bank, reversed his fourth-quarter
estimates to a loss of 11 cents a share from his prior view of
25 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the third quarter, the bank had reported net markdowns
of $3.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While there is little doubt that JPMorgan will emerge from
the current crisis in a good competitive position, it is
increasingly clear that credit costs in the U.S. will get much
worse, particularly in cards and commercial lending", the
analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Dec. 11, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had warned
of a "terrible" fourth quarter, blaming mortgages, credit, and
high yield bonds and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts polled by Reuters expect the company to earn 35
cents a share, excluding items, for the fourth quarter.

&lt;p&gt;  BANGALORE, INDIA, Dec 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a five-year IT outsourcing agreement with
Madhav Nagrik Sahakari Bank, one of the leading co-operative banks in the
state of Rajasthan in India. As part of the agreement, IBM will host and
manage the IT infrastructure to help the bank focus on its aggressive
expansion plans while reducing its huge capital expenditure.

    Signed in the third quarter of 2008, this agreement is the first of its
kind for IBM in Rajasthan. IBM is focused on the small and medium
businesses including those based in small towns like Sirohi, where the
bank is headquartered.

    Madhav Nagrik Sahakari Bank plans to increase its presence from the
existing network of 25 branches in Rajasthan. The bank is also dedicated
to offering services like Internet banking, mobile banking and ATM
facilities to its customers, who are pre-dominantly from semi-urban and
rural areas. The end-to-end managed services being provided by IBM will
enable the bank to achieve its growth plans while garnering a greater
level of trust and satisfaction from its loyal customer base.

    "In this age of technology driven banking, even co-operative banks like
ours are taking a leap in providing the best of banking experience to our
customers," said Mr. Mukesh Modi, Managing Director, Madhav Nagrik
Sahakari Bank. "Our association with IBM, the world's leading IT services
company, would not only help us focus more on our aggressive growth plans
but at the same time ensure a higher degree of customer satisfaction."

    Nipun Mehrotra, Vice President and General Manager, Global Technology
Services, IBM India and South Asia remarked, "Our engagement with Madhav
Nagrik Sahakari Bank reiterates IBM's commitment to helping organizations
who are looking to grow their business. By offering our IT services to the
bank, we will not only help them cut their IT expenditure but also ensure
they are able to focus on their core business and expansion plans. We will
continue to expand our geographical reach and work with more clients like
Madhav Bank."

    This agreement with IBM also helps the bank overcome a key challenge of
getting high-quality IT experts in small towns like Sirohi, which has a
population of about 55,000. With IBM hosting the bank's entire IT
infrastructure from its own data centers, the bank will be able to
leverage the same world-class expertise that serves many of its larger
enterprise as well as global clients.

    About Madhav Nagrik Sahakari Bank:

    Madhav Nagrik Sahakari Bank is a licensed urban co-operative bank having
25 branches in the state of Rajasthan including in the capital city of
Jaipur. The bank, which completed 35 years of operation, has over 172,000
customers and has been dedicated to their socio-economic development. The

&lt;p&gt;Materials will Focus on 3D and Underfill Technologies
MARLBOROUGH, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials (NYSE:ROH), a leading supplier of materials
for semiconductor packaging, has entered into a joint development agreement with
IBM to develop, as well as evaluate, new materials for emerging packaging

packaging technologies. Rohm and Haas and IBM will also develop new materials
for wafer-level and capillary underfill applications. 

&#8220;We are excited about the opportunity to collaborate closely with a genuine
leader in the semiconductor market,&#8221; said David Schram, president of Packaging

require the development of novel, enabling materials and processes to address
many new technical barriers, including through-silicon vias and packaging
high-performance silicon devices,&#8221; said Leo Linehan, Advanced Packaging business
development and marketing director for Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials. &#8220;IBM
continues to be a major innovator in the area of packaging technology, and
through this new partnership with IBM we will ensure that Rohm and Haas is a
leading supplier of advanced packaging materials for the industry.&#8221; 

&#8220;Building 3D systems of stacked chips with very high density of interconnections
will require new innovation in materials,&#8221; said Jean Trewhella, director of
IBM&#8217;s packaging research and development center, an organization comprising of
engineers from both the IBM Research and IBM Microelectronics divisions. &#8220;We
look forward to further advancements in IBM&#8217;s 3D technology through a formal
joint development alliance with Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials.&#8221; 

Claudius Feger, senior manager for electronic and optical packaging at IBM
Research, added, "We are now continuing our long established working
relationship with Rohm and Haas into the area of emerging packaging materials.
We believe that the results of our collaboration will not only benefit both
companies but also the packaging industry as a whole." 

The joint collaboration will be performed at IBM&#8217;s T. J. Watson Research Center
in Yorktown Heights, NY, and at Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials&#8217; Technology
Center in Marlborough, MA.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded ATT Inc (T.N)
to "neutral" from "buy" and cut its price target on the company
to $30 from $33, citing negative pension impact and weakness in
enterprise revenue across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage lowered its 2009 earnings per share estimates

percent, which we estimate to be a $0.19 drag on 2009 EPS,"
Jason Armstrong wrote in a note to clients dated Dec 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ATT runs the second largest pension plan in the United
States, which subjects the company's earnings per share stream

to be down 6.9 percent and 6.8 percent year over year,
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given general enterprise caution and negative employee
trends, we expect volume growth to slow," Armstrong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also lowered his voice Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

&lt;p&gt;First Commercial Service in the U.S. That Bundles Offers, Transaction Alerts and
a Locator Service; Chase Visa Customers First to Enjoy Visa Mobile 
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa (NYSE:V), a global leader in payments, today announced that Visa Mobile,
its advanced mobile payment-related services, are now operational on mobile
devices powered by Android, the Open Handset Alliance&#8217;s open source platform for
mobile devices, including the T-Mobile G1&#8482; phone. 

Chase (NYSE: JPM) Visa credit and debit cardholders will have exclusive access
to the Visa Mobile application for a limited time. The application will allow
select Chase Visa cardholders to receive notifications about transaction
activity on their accounts; obtain offers from a wide array of merchants; and
use the integrated Google mapping technology to quickly find nearby
participating merchants or ATMs that accept Visa. 

&#8220;Visa is thrilled to make these applications available to mobile users and offer
the first commercial service in the U.S. that bundles offers, transaction alerts
and a locator service into one easy-to-use application,&#8221; said Tim Attinger, Head
of Global Product Innovation at Visa Inc. &#8220;Combining technologies from
innovative companies like Visa, Google, and other members of the Open Handset
Alliance delivers consumers convenience and value in their everyday mobile
lives.&#8221; 

Fourteen leading national merchants are supporting the initial launch of Visa
Mobile on Android by providing offers to Visa cardholders, including
1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Bonefish Grill, eBags.com, eMusic.com, FragranceNet.com, Jos.
A. Bank, Lenovo, Overstock.com, Planet Hollywood, Restaurant.com and Shoes.com.
Visa cardholders will be able to receive special offers from these merchants
directly to their Android powered mobile device, including discounts and
coupons. Google mapping technology guides consumers to nearby locations of
merchants sending them offers. 

&#8220;The mobile channel represents an exciting opportunity for Chase to deliver
added value, services and information to our card holders,&#8221; said Rob Rosenblatt,
general manager, Chase Card Services. &#8220;Chase is delighted to serve as Visa&#8217;s
initial launch partner delivering these capabilities via Android and the
T-Mobile G1 phone.&#8221; 

Three powerful services

Visa mobile applications for Android will help make consumers mobile lives
easier, improve their ability to manage and protect their Visa accounts, and get
valuable offers from merchants that are tailored specifically for their
interests. Visa cardholders with Android powered devices can download the Visa
Mobile application from the Android Market, and simply enroll to receive
services. Consumers are also able to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; at any time, preserving their
privacy. 

The services include:

* Alerts: Near real-time notification of Visa account activity based on
cardholder preferences, such as the size of the transaction, or whether the
transaction is in foreign currency. Because these alerts are triggered by the
transaction as it passes through the Visa network, consumers will receive
notifications almost immediately after completing their purchase. This service
is intended to increase cardholders&#8217; peace of mind by enabling them to better
track Visa spending. It also provides Visa with a new way to combat payment card
fraud. 
* Offers: Consumers will be able to receive offers from any of the participating
merchants directly to their phone. These offers &#8211; ranging from discounts,
loyalty points and statement credits &#8211; could be based on a consumer&#8217;s previous
purchase activity. For consumers and merchants alike, this service will ensure
the most relevant offers are sent in a timely manner, helping increase merchant
traffic, loyalty and customer satisfaction. Merchants benefit from better
targeting and more efficient marketing spend and cardholders get more of the
offers they want. 
* Locator: A service that is integrated with Google Maps&#8482; and Google
location-based services to show consumers the nearby locations of merchants
sending them offers, or of an ATM that accepts Visa. The location would be
highlighted on a map on the mobile device&#8217;s screen and the user would also be
able to get driving directions to the location.

Demonstration at the WIRED Store

Visa&#8217;s applications will be demonstrated by Visa and Google representatives at a
December 15 special live premiere of Saturday Night Live's Seth Meyers, Bill
Hader, Jason Sudeikis and Simon Rich series of digital short films, THE LINE, at
the WIRED Store in Manhattan. Invited guests at the party will have a chance to
touch and experience the Visa mobile services on the T-Mobile G1&#8482;. 

The WIRED Store is a "pop up" store operated by WIRED magazine, and sponsored in
part by Visa, that is open just for the holiday season. Operating this year at
15 West 18th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenues in New York City, the store
gives consumers a chance to see some of the hottest new technologies in the
market. The T-Mobile G1&#8482; is expected to be one of the most popular items on
display, both at the special event and during the remaining two weeks of the
season. 

&#8220;This is a great opportunity for shoppers to see just how Visa&#8217;s mobile services
can make their lives easier and more rewarding,&#8221; said Attinger. &#8220;We&#8217;re confident
that, once they have the chance to try it, consumers will be eager to become
Visa Mobile users.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded the U.S. Gaming
technology sector to "attractive" from "neutral," saying it
felt slots stocks have been overly punished and investors may
want to reconsider the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We view slots as a derivative way to play an improving
consumer without taking the 'survivor risk' the casinos face
due to their highly leveraged balance sheets, covenant tests,
and upcoming maturities," analyst Steven Kent wrote in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, as the economy continues to worsen, additional
states such as Ohio, New York, Kentucky and Texas could look to
gaming as a way of plugging budget holes, Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, many of the casino operators have the
potential to bump up against debt covenants and face upcoming
debt maturities, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also upgraded Bally Technologies Inc (BYI.N) to
"buy" from "neutral," citing the casino gaming equipment
maker's concentration on systems sales, fixed fee participation
games, and plans to expand into additional international
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also raised his price target on stock of the
company to $25 from $20 and said cutbacks on buying slot
machines will be some of the last made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the numbers of machines replaced will most likely be
down in 2009, we would still expect operators to buy the bare
minimum of machines to keep the floor fresh, he added.

&lt;p&gt;Venafi to Integrate IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager Into its Systems Management
for Encryption Platform, Giving Organizations More Holistic Management of
Encryption Keys and Certificates
SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
Venafi Inc., inventor of systems management for encryption, today announced an
OEM agreement with IBM (NYSE:IBM) under which it will embed IBM Tivoli Key
Lifecycle Manager (TKLM) into its encryption management platform. This expanded
functionality will help organizations better manage encryption across their
diverse operating environments and infrastructure by enabling the Venafi
platform to deliver and manage symmetric encryption keys for tape and disk
storage systems in addition to the asymmetric keys and certificates it already
manages. 

Under the agreement, Venafi will integrate IBM&#8217;s TKLM software&#8212;used to serve
keys at the time of use to IBM tape and disk storage devices&#8212;with its own
technology to deliver the market a unique new offering. The Venafi management
platform is currently used by many of the world&#8217;s leading organizations to
automate the management of digital certificates and related keys across a
variety of enterprise applications and systems, including IBM WebSphere
Application Server, IBM HTTP Server, IBM Tivoli Access Manager, IBM WebSphere MQ
server and client, as well as applications and platforms from many other
vendors. 

&#8220;Customers want a holistic enterprise encryption and key management platform to
address data security in a comprehensive manner, including management of
encryption keys for their encrypted tape and disk environments, as well as other
critical systems and applications that make up their infrastructure,&#8221; said Kris
Lovejoy, director of corporate security strategy, IBM. &#8220;Leveraging IBM&#8217;s
software, Venafi can better help customers automate the tedious processes
required to manage the lifecycle of encryption assets such as certificates and
private keys. This integration can provide customers a more holistic view of the
encryption in use throughout their organizations.&#8221; 

Encryption is critical for protecting both active and stored data, but far too
many companies are still managing this encryption and associated encryption keys
manually &#8211; if at all. This often results in systems failure, data loss, security
lapses and non-compliance with regulations and industry standards, according to
Trell Rohovit, Venafi president &amp; CEO. 

&#8220;Venafi recognized a long time ago that taking a systems management approach to
this problem and architecting accordingly would allow it to plug-in and manage
various key issuance and encryption systems from a variety of vendors,&#8221; Rohovit
said. &#8220;The Venafi Systems Management for Encryption platform demystifies
encryption for operations folks, allowing them to address the operational
management challenges without a deep understanding of cryptography.&#8221; 

&#8220;Integrating TKLM into our platform not only provides a more comprehensive
encryption management system for IBM customers but it further validates the
importance of that more comprehensive management in the first place,&#8221; he added. 

More on Venafi and the IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager (TKLM)

TKLM centralizes and automates the encryption key management process for
self-encrypting storage offerings from IBM. The system serves keys at the time
of use to storage systems in order to maintain centralized management and assure
the security of key material. With the Venafi integration, users will be able to
centrally create, import, distribute, back up, archive and manage the lifecycle
of the certificates associated with those keys. Venafi currently automates the
issuance, installation and maintenance of the asymmetric keys and certificates
TKLM currently uses to protect symmetric keys managed by the TKLM server.
Through the patented Venafi integration with the world&#8217;s leading certificate
authorities, including IBM PKI Services for z/OS (IBM&#8217;s ultra-secure CA on z),
these certificates are automatically provisioned, tracked and managed by the
Venafi system. 

The Venafi OEM agreement supports IBM&#8217;s strategy to work with independent
software vendors to embed IBM software into their own offerings to help save
time and money on development and speed time to market. IBM&#8217;s software OEM
strategy represents a significant and growing revenue opportunity for IBM and
its business partners.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Apple Inc
(AAPL.O) to "neutral" from "buy" on concerns about weak
consumer spending in the near-term, and risk of the stock's
valuation premium coming down if iPhone sales fall short of
expectations in the first half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which has a price target of $115 on the
stock, removed Apple from its Americas buy list as it expects
the company to face a tougher environment in the March and June
quarters as consumer demand takes another leg down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Shipments of MacBooks, iPod nanos, and iPhone were all
slightly lower than what was expected going into the (December)
quarter," analyst David Bailey wrote in a note to its clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The near-term outlook is not very positive, as it is
unlikely that Apple will launch a new product category at the
MacWorld conference in early January, taking away a potential
catalyst for the shares and causing Apple to try to generate
demand in a tough environment without the benefit of a new
offering in the first part of 2009, Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the analyst reiterated his longer-term view that
Apple's ability to innovate will keep it ahead of the
competition and drive share gains in its existing product
categories and allow it to be first to market in newer
categories like Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Apple were down more than 2 percent at $96.11
before the bell Monday. They closed at $98.27 Friday on
Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 15 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its price
targets on at least four tobacco companies, citing increases in
State Excise Tax (SET), Federal Excise Tax (FET) and
manufacturer price increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As a result, we forecast average flat to low single digit
Cigarette operating profit growth in 2009 and earnings per
share growth ranging from 3 percent to 6 percent, boosted by
share buybacks," analyst Erik Bloomquist wrote in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bloomquist upgraded Altria Group (MO.N) to "overweight"
from "neutral," expecting a 25 percent cash return on market
cap by 2010 and the company's lead in the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He cut his rating on Lorillard Inc (LO.N) to "neutral" from
"overweight," saying he was less certain on cash returns to
investors, compared with Altria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst, who named Altria as his US market top stock,
said he saw attractive returns from these companies and he
expects share buybacks to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bloomquist said Philip Morris International (PM.N) remained
his over-all U.S. listed favourite, due to its strong long-term
growth outlook despite current foreign exchange headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The following table lists the rating and the price target

&lt;p&gt;    * targets market-beating Xbox growth for 2009 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * optimistic about Xbox growth momentum in 2009 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * no concrete cost-cutting plans in pipeline &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Kelvin Soh &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SINGAPORE, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) expects its Xbox game console sales to outpace broader market growth next year, a senior executive said on Wednesday, projecting optimism despite dampened consumer spending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Although the global economic slowdown has hit consumer demand, Microsoft expects the overall video game industry to continue growing next year as more people choose to stay at home, said Alan Bowman, Asia general manager of Xbox operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Industry watchers expect the sector to grow in the 20 percent range this year, though Bowman declined to give specific forecasts for 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Outpacing the market is a key measure, but we've also managed to broaden the market to include people who have never played video games before," Bowman, who is based in Sydney, told Reuters in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "So what is really driving our growth momentum right now is how we are broadening our consumer base to include not only hardcore gamers but also individuals who would have previously not thought about buying a game console." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In Asia, market research firm GfK said Xbox shipments in October grew by 53 percent compared to September after Microsoft cut the price of the console to less than $200. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    No figures were available for the same period last year as they only began tracking the market late last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bowman said current shipment volumes had reached such high levels that the company could afford to depend on volume to rake in a profit despite the lower prices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We're looking at some really great levels right now, so that allows us to pass on cost savings to our customers." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Xbox outsold rival Sony's (6758.T) PlayStation 3 in Japan in September, its first monthly unit sales win in Sony's home base. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    However, it still lags behind Nintendo's 7974.OS Wii console, which sold over 2 million units in the U.S. in November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bowman said he was confident the Xbox's current growth momentum would continue into the Chinese New Year shopping season on the back of its lower price. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Chinese New Year, which takes place in late January 2009, is the peak shopping season for most countries in the greater China region and many retailers in east Asia typically chalk up their best sales during that period.  Microsoft has sold about 25 million Xbox 360 consoles worldwide since its introduction in late 2005, compared to 14.4 million units for Sony's PlayStation 3 and 30 million of Nintendo's Wii units, which both came out in late 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While video game developers such as Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O have warned recently that their profits and revenue will fall short of already low-forecasts, Bowman said Microsoft would continue to invest in software and game development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Game development is the core of what we do," he said. "Microsoft is a software company by heart, and we will continue to work with our partners and by ourselves to develop new software for the market." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bowman also said there were no concrete cost-cutting measures being implemented to deal with the current economic downturn, but that the company is "constantly evaluating our options". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Any global company needs to be mindful of their costs and money, but that's a combination of good internal controls and effective cost management," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Lincoln Feast) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((kelvin.soh@thomsonreuters.com; +886 2 2508-0815; Reuters Messaging:kelvin.soh.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MICROSOFT XBOX/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2008.

&lt;p&gt;-- Reducci&#243;n de m&#225;s de 50% del &#225;rea de celdas de memoria est&#225;tica de acceso
aleatorio (Static Random Access Memory, SRAM) con un transistor de efecto campo
no plano (Field-Effect Transistor, FET); establece un enfoque prometedor para
los nodos de tecnolog&#237;a futuros -- 
TOKIO, NUEVA YORK y SUNNYVALE, California--(Business Wire)--
Toshiba Corporation (TOKIO:6502), IBM (NYSE:IBM) y AMD (NYSE:AMD) anunciaron hoy
que han desarrollado en conjunto una celda con memoria SRAM, con un &#225;rea de solo
0,128 micr&#243;metros cuadrados (&#956;m2), lo cual significa que es la celda de memoria
SRAM funcional m&#225;s peque&#241;a del mundo que utiliza tecnolog&#237;a de transistor de
efecto campo con forma de aleta (fin-shaped Field Effect Transistor, FinFET). 

La celda, desarrollada con material para compuerta met&#225;lica de constante
diel&#233;ctrica K elevada (high-k metal gate, HKMG), ofrece ventajas con respecto a
las celdas de FET planos para las futuras generaciones tecnol&#243;gicas. Las celdas
con memoria SRAM son componentes de la mayor&#237;a de los circuitos integrados a
gran escala en el nivel de sistema, tales como microprocesadores, y las celdas
m&#225;s peque&#241;as con memoria SRAM pueden ayudar a obtener procesadores m&#225;s peque&#241;os,
m&#225;s r&#225;pidos y que consuman menos energ&#237;a. Este desarrollo tecnol&#243;gico fue
anunciado el 16 de diciembre en una ponencia t&#233;cnica presentada en el
International Electron Devices Meeting (Encuentro Internacional de Dispositivos
Electr&#243;nicos) de 2008 (http://www.his.com/~iedm/general/) realizado en San
Francisco, California. 

Para reducir la medida del transistor cuando se fabrican celdas con memoria SRAM
utilizando transistores planos convencionales, los fabricantes de tarjetas
inteligentes (Intelligent Cards, IC) por lo general ajustan las propiedades
agregando m&#225;s impurezas en el &#225;rea del dispositivo. Sin embargo, este ajuste
genera una variabilidad no deseable y deteriora la estabilidad de las memorias
SRAM. Este tema es cada vez m&#225;s cr&#237;tico, especialmente en las tecnolog&#237;as de
nodo de 22 nm y superiores. El uso de transistores FinFETs &#8213;transistores
verticales con canales de silicona en forma de aleta y sin agregado de
impurezas&#8213; representa un enfoque alternativo que permite la reducci&#243;n del tama&#241;o
de las celdas con memoria SRAM con una variaci&#243;n caracter&#237;stica menor. 

Los investigadores de estas tres compa&#241;&#237;as fabricaron una celda de gran escala y
memoria SRAM con tecnolog&#237;a FinFET aplicando propiedades HKMG. Es la celda de
memoria SRAM y transistor FET no plano m&#225;s peque&#241;a que se haya fabricado: con
0,128 &#956;m2, la celda integrada es m&#225;s de un 50 por ciento m&#225;s peque&#241;a que la
celda de transistor FET no plano de 0,274 &#956;m2 antes mencionado. Para lograr este
objetivo, el equipo optimiz&#243; los procesos, en particular para el dep&#243;sito y la
remoci&#243;n de materiales, lo que incluye la propiedad de compuerta HKMG desde las
superficies verticales de la estructura de transistor FinFET no plano. 

Tambi&#233;n investigaron la variaci&#243;n estoc&#225;stica de las propiedades de los
transistores FinFET dentro de las celdas de gran escala con memoria SRAM y
simularon las variaciones de las celdas con memoria SRAM en un tama&#241;o de celda
a&#250;n m&#225;s peque&#241;o. Los investigadores verificaron que los transistores FinFET sin
modificaci&#243;n de canal mejoraron la variabilidad caracter&#237;stica del transistor en
m&#225;s de un 28 por ciento. En las simulaciones de las celdas con memoria SRAM de
un &#225;rea de 0,063 &#956;m2, equivalente o superior a la escala de celda para un nodo
de 22 nm, los resultados confirmaron que se espera que la celda con memoria SRAM
con transistor FinFET ofrezca una ventaja significativa en condiciones de
operaci&#243;n estable, comparada con una celda de transistor FET plano con memoria
SRAM de esta generaci&#243;n. 

Al fabricar con &#233;xito celdas de gran escala con memoria SRAM, transistores
FinFET y compuerta HKMG, las compa&#241;&#237;as han posicionado los transistores FinFETs
como una estructura de transistor atractiva para las memorias SRAM en los nodos
de 22nm y superiores. La nueva tecnolog&#237;a da un paso adelante hacia la obtenci&#243;n
de dispositivos pr&#225;cticos m&#225;s poderosos.

Para reduzir o tamanho dos transistores quando as c&#233;lulas SRAM s&#227;o criadas
utilizando transistores planares convencionais, os fabricantes de IC geralmente
ajustam as propriedades com maior dopagem de impurezas na &#225;rea do dispositivo.
No entanto, este ajuste cria variabilidades indesej&#225;veis e deteriora a
estabilidade SRAM. Esta quest&#227;o est&#225; se tornando cr&#237;tica, especialmente no n&#243; de
tecnologia 22 nm e al&#233;m. O uso de FinFETs &#8211; transistores verticais com canais de
sil&#237;cio sem dopagem, com formato de barbatana &#8211; &#233; uma abordagem alternativa que
permite a redu&#231;&#227;o do tamanho das c&#233;lulas SRAM com menor varia&#231;&#227;o de
caracter&#237;sticas. 

Pesquisadores das tr&#234;s empresas fabricaram uma c&#233;lula FinFET SRAM de alta escala
utilizando HKGM. &#201; a menor c&#233;lula FET SRAM n&#227;o planar j&#225; obtida at&#233; hoje: com
0,128 &#956;m2, a c&#233;lula integrada &#233; mais de 50% menor do que a c&#233;lula FET n&#227;o planar
de 0,274 &#956;m2 conhecida anteriormente. Para atingir esta meta, a equipe otimizou
os processos, especialmente para os materiais de deposi&#231;&#227;o e remo&#231;&#227;o, incluindo
HKMG de superf&#237;cies verticais da estrutura FinFET n&#227;o planar. 

Os pesquisadores investigaram tamb&#233;m a varia&#231;&#227;o estoc&#225;stica das propriedades
FinFET dentro de c&#233;lulas SRAM altamente escaladas e simularam varia&#231;&#245;es de
c&#233;lulas SRAM em c&#233;lula de tamanho at&#233; menor. Eles verificaram que as FinFETs sem
dopagem de canal melhorou a variabilidade das caracter&#237;sticas dos transistores
em mais de 28%. Nas simula&#231;&#245;es das c&#233;lulas SRAM de &#225;rea de 0,063&#956;m2,
equivalentes a ou al&#233;m da escala da c&#233;lula para o n&#243; 22 nm, os resultados
confirmaram que a c&#233;lula FinFET SRAM deve oferecer vantagem significativa em
opera&#231;&#227;o est&#225;vel, em compara&#231;&#227;o com uma c&#233;lula FET SRAM planar dessa gera&#231;&#227;o. 

Fabricando com sucesso c&#233;lulas FinFET altamente escaladas com HKMG, as empresas
posicionaram as FinFETs como uma estrutura de transistores atraente para as
SRAMs no n&#243; 22 nm e al&#233;m. A nova tecnologia representa um passo adiante para os
dispositivos pr&#225;ticos mais poderosos.

&lt;p&gt;-- Die Verkleinerung der Fl&#228;che von nichtplanaren FET SRAM-Zellen um mehr als
50&#160;%&#160;liefert viel versprechenden Ansatz f&#252;r zuk&#252;nftige Technologieknoten -- 
TOKIO &amp; NEW YORK &amp; SUNNYVALE, Kalifornien--(Business Wire)--
Toshiba Corporation (TOKIO:6502), IBM (NYSE:IBM) und AMD (NYSE:AMD) verk&#252;ndeten
heute, dass sie gemeinsam eine SRAM-Zelle (SRAM, statischer Arbeitsspeicher)
entwickelt haben, die eine Fl&#228;che von gerade mal 0,128 Quadratmikrometer (&#956;m2)
hat. Damit ist sie die kleinste funktionale SRAM-Zelle der Welt mit
lamellenf&#246;rmigen Feldeffekttransistoren (FinFET). 

Die Zelle, die mit einem High-k/Metall-Gate-Material (HKMG) entwickelt wurde,
bietet einige Vorteile gegen&#252;ber planaren FET-Zellen f&#252;r zuk&#252;nftige
Technologiegenerationen. SRAM-Zellen sind Schaltkreiskomponenten in den meisten
Systemschaltungen mit hohem Integrationsgrad, zu denen z.&#160;B. Mikroprozessoren
geh&#246;ren. Kleinere SRAM-Zellen k&#246;nnen dazu beitragen, kleinere, schnellere
Prozessoren herzustellen, die weniger Strom verbrauchen. Die Technologie wurde
am 16. Dezember in einem Fachbeitrag bekannt gemacht, der bei dem International
Electron Devices Meeting 2008 (http://www.his.com/~iedm/general/) in San
Francisco, Kalifornien, pr&#228;sentiert wurde. 

F&#252;r die Verringerung der Transistorengr&#246;&#223;e bei der Herstellung von SRAM-Zellen,
die mit herk&#246;mmlichen Planartransistoren arbeiten, ver&#228;ndern Hersteller f&#252;r
integrierte Schaltungen generell deren Eigenschaften, indem sie mehr Fremdstoffe
auf der Fl&#228;che des Bauelements einbringen (Dotierung). Allerdings f&#252;hrt diese
Ver&#228;nderung zu unerw&#252;nschten Variabilit&#228;ten und wirkt sich negativ auf die
SRAM-Stabilit&#228;t aus. Dieses Problem ist bedenklich, speziell in Hinsicht auf
22-nm-Technologieknoten und dar&#252;ber hinaus. Die Verwendung von FinFETs &#8211;
vertikale Transistoren mit lamellenf&#246;rmigen undotierten Siliziumkan&#228;len &#8211; ist
eine alternative Methode, um die Gr&#246;&#223;e von SRAM-Zellen zu verringern, ohne dass
dabei die typischen Abweichungen auftreten. 

Forscher der drei Unternehmen haben eine hoch skalierte FinFET SRAM-Zelle
hergestellt, die aus HKMG besteht. Dabei handelt es sich um die kleinste
nichtplanare FET SRAM-Zelle, die je fabriziert wurde: mit einer Fl&#228;che von 0,128
&#956;m2 ist die integrierte Zelle um mehr als 50 Prozent kleiner als die
nichtplanare FET-Zelle mit einer Gr&#246;&#223;e von 0,274 &#956;m2, von der zuvor berichtet
wurde. F&#252;r die Realisierung dieses Ziels hat das Team die Prozesse optimiert,
speziell in Hinblick auf die Beschichtung und die Entfernung der Materialien,
einschlie&#223;lich HKMG, von vertikalen Oberfl&#228;chen der nichtplanaren
FinFET-Struktur. 

Die Forscher haben auch die stochastische Abweichung von FinFET-Eigenschaften in
hoch skalierten SRAM-Zellen untersucht und haben Schwankungen von SRAM-Zellen
bei einer noch kleineren Zellgr&#246;&#223;e simuliert. Sie haben best&#228;tigt, dass FinFETs
ohne Kanaldotierung die f&#252;r die Transistoren charakteristische Variabilit&#228;t um
mehr als 28 Prozent verbessern. In Simulationen von SRAM-Zellen mit einer Fl&#228;che
von 0,063 &#956;m2, die der Zellskalierung f&#252;r den 22-nm-Knoten entspricht oder
dar&#252;ber hinaus geht, best&#228;tigten die Ergebnisse, dass die FinFET SRAM-Zelle
aller Voraussicht nach einen betr&#228;chtlichen Vorteil f&#252;r den stabilen Betrieb
bietet, wenn man sie mit einer planaren FET SRAM-Zelle von dieser Generation
vergleicht. 

Durch die erfolgreiche Herstellung von hoch skalierten FinFET SRAM-Zellen mit
HKMG haben die Unternehmen FinFETs zu einer attraktiven Transistorstruktur f&#252;r
SRAMs in dem 22-nm-Knoten und dar&#252;ber hinaus gemacht. Die neue Technologie
bedeutet einen Schritt nach vorn, was die Entwicklung von noch
leistungsst&#228;rkeren praktischen Ger&#228;ten angeht.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - The Magic Kingdom has lost some of its Wall Street magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Walt Disney Co have held up better in this turbulent year than any of its peers. Investors have lauded a strong management team and solid business strategies and execution for keeping the company shielded from recession woes longer than other media biggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, a growing chorus of Wall Street observers argues that Disney's stock trades at too much of a premium to its sector peers, especially amid recent reductions to earnings estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it might be too expensive compared with its sector rivals, especially in a recession economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, for example, Pali Research analyst Rich Greenfield downgraded shares from "buy" to "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While Disney has long traded at premium earnings and free-cash-flow multiples to its large-cap media peers, its valuation gap has meaningfully widened over the past month to a level that we can't ignore," he said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenfield reduced his earnings estimates for Disney on November 18, when the conglomerate's stock traded at a 2009 price/earnings multiple of 10.4 times and a free-cash-flow multiple of 11.7 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In issuing his downgrade, the Pali analyst highlighted that Disney was trading at a price/earnings multiple of 13.1 times, compared with Viacom's eight times and News Corp.'s nine times multiples. Meanwhile, Disney's free-cash-flow multiple had ballooned to 15 times, well ahead of Viacom's seven and News Corp.'s eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenfield argued that the gap is too big, though he acknowledged that "Disney deserves a premium multiple to News Corp. given its superior asset mix and to Viacom given the higher quality of its cable network assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also last week, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Michael Nathanson highlighted recent signs of declining momentum at several Disney units, including its TV networks and theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In stark contrast to business trends, Disney's relative price/earnings multiple has ballooned to a 13% premium to the broader market, and Disney currently trades 41 relative multiple points above its media conglomerate peers -- the widest margin in recent history," he wrote in a report entitled "Can the Disney Difference Be This Wide?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His conclusion: "While we believe that Disney should trade at a premium to other media conglomerates due to the strength of management and the competitive positioning of its businesses, we also do not believe that the current gap relative to its peers is justified. Either the stock trades down or peers need to trade up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathanson also pointed out that Disney shares haven't come under the same kinds of pressure as peers amid recent earnings downgrades from analysts. "Since the end of October, fiscal-year 2009 consensus earnings-per-share estimates for Disney have been cut by 8%, and yet the stock has underperformed the SP 500 by only 1%."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathanson rates Disney shares "market-perform" with a price target of $22 -- 7% below the price at the time his report was published. Disney stock rose 4.4% to $23.78 on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, in line with the broader market. It has traded within a 52-week range of $35.02 and $18.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Barclays Capital analyst Anthony DiClemente on Friday reduced his film estimates for Disney. "In addition to headwinds for advertising and theme parks, Disney's creative cycle could exacerbate year-over-year earnings-per-share declines in fiscal-year 2009," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiClemente, too, pointed out the Disney valuation edge, predicting that it would underperform during the next six to nine months. "Disney trades at a 50%-plus premium to its peers though may have the most downside to Street consensus in the group," he said in maintaining an "underweight" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Disney's appeal has faded recently, the downbeaten stocks of other media giants have attracted more attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenfield for one likes Viacom, which has struggled with cable network ad trends, and News Corp., whose local TV stations have been hit hard by the recession. He rates both a "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In speaking out for Viacom's stock, he said investor fears regarding possible additional stock sales of the Viacom chairman are overdone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While investors may fear that Sumner Redstone's National Amusements will need to sell Viacom shares in the near future, we find it impossible to not want to own Viacom shares at 6.6 times trough earnings," Greenfield wrote, predicting that the stock could hit $25 in the coming year. Its widely traded class B stock was up 5.3% to $17.26, far from its 52-week high of $44.97. Its low is $11.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street also has looked at Time Warner with some bullishness. For example, UBS analyst Michael Morris last month reiterated his "buy" rating, arguing that "shares do not fully reflect the true value of the company's assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi Investment Research analyst Jason Bazinet reiterated that TW remains his top pick for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although several media stocks look oversold at these levels, TW still stands out as the one stock with imminent structural catalysts," he said. He holds a "buy" rating on TW's stock with a $19 target price. Time Warner rose 7.2% to $10.52. Its 52-week range is $16.97 and $7.00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported its first quarterly loss since going public nine years ago as plunging stock, debt and real estate markets caught up with a Wall Street leader that had sidestepped the worst financial crisis in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But investors, bracing for deeper losses, appeared relieved, sending Goldman stock up 14.4 percent on Tuesday and helping lift the broader U.S. stock market. Shares of rival Morgan Stanley, which is set to announce its results on Wednesday, surged 18.3 percent on Goldman's report and the Federal Reserve's decision to cut rates to a range of zero to 0.25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman posted a net loss of $2.12 billion, or $4.97 a share, for the fourth quarter ended November 28, capping a year that tarnished its Midas touch reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss exceeded the average analyst target of $3.73 a share, according to Reuters Estimates, yet privately many investors feared the results could have been as high as $6 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fear in the market was that the results would be much worse," said Walter Todd, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writedowns and losses on investments, leveraged loans and mortgages topped $5 billion as virtually every market tumbled in recent months -- a period during which Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc sank into bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch  Co Inc sold itself to Bank of America Corp and the U.S. government bailed out the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That loss exceeds the $4.9 billion in writedowns that Goldman has reported in the past two years since the credit crisis began last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet some analysts said investors are anticipating a thawing in the markets, which would begin the recover of asset values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is so much liquidity, and it grew even more when the Fed cut rates, that when you start to see normal market activity there will only be a thin herd of competitors who can compete for these dollars," said Douglas Ciocca, a managing director at Renaissance Capital Corp in Kansas City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UGLY QUARTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disastrous environment took a turn for the worst in September, as investors lost confidence that Wall Street's broker-dealers could survive. Cash-strapped banks and funds were forced to sell assets and generated crushing markdowns for brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was forced to seek $21 billion in fresh capital from the U.S. Treasury, public investors and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc -- and converted to a bank holding company hoping to reassure investors it could survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman slashed its balance sheet by nearly 20 percent to $885 billion during the quarter, boosting its capital ratios and paring leverage. The bank also cut its payroll by about 2,500 employees in the fourth quarter, down about 8 percent from the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the fourth quarter was ugly, as expected. Goldman's mammoth trading and principal investing results were its worst since the bond market turmoil of 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank-wide writedowns outstripped revenue from banking and trading, resulting in negative revenue of $1.6 billion -- a far cry from the $11 billion revenue recorded a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year-earlier period, Goldman reported record net income of $3.2 billion, or $7.01 a share. Goldman managed to turn in a record year, through hedging and timely bets against subprime mortgages, even as the rest of the industry suffered humbling losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is also reinventing itself as a bank, figuring out how to make money in a world where merger activity has slowed and financial markets are still frozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were an investment bank for 139 years and a bank holding company for three months. We're still a little new at this game," Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a conference call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and others became bank holding companies in September to take advantage of stable deposit funding. But as a regulated bank, it has had to reduce its leverage, making it hard to achieve the same levels of profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said Goldman intends to expand its deposit funding to as much as $50 billion to $100 billion over the next year from about $20 billion now. Viniar said Goldman looked at a number of bank takeovers but so far has chosen not to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, it will seek deposits through brokers, its wealth manager network and possible through an Internet bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO BIG CHANGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Viniar said Goldman the bank holding company would not change its stripes. It will continue to finance deals and invest firm capital and take risks if it sees an opportunity. Viniar stressed that its investments, depressed by panicky markets, would likely rebound in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of these positions represent excellent long-term investments," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moody's Investors Service cut Goldman's credit rating one notch to "A1" and said the firm's outlook remains "negative," but credit markets shrugged off the downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman posted its first loss since the fourth quarter of 1998, when Long-Term Capital Management's collapse and the Asian debt crisis roiled bond markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income, currency and commodities trading generated negative revenue of $3.4 billion and principal investments recorded a loss of $3.6 billion, partly offset by a 2 percent rise in equities trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Goldman's first loss from trading and principal investments since 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking revenue fell by half to $1.03 billion. Goldman's backlog of pending deals dropped during the quarter, ending November "significantly lower" than a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the declines, Goldman slashed full-year compensation and benefits in half to around $10.9 billion, or $364,000 per employee. Last year, it paid out a Wall Street record $20.2 billion in compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman closed up $9.54 at $76 on the New York Stock Exchange, or about three-quarters of the bank's book value at the end November. The stock soared as high as $78 during the session and was among the biggest net gainers on the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares fell by more than two-thirds this year, and more than half since September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay and Dan Wilchins; Editing by John Wallace and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co and Media-One Holdings Ltd on Tuesday unveiled plans to launch a nationwide, free-to-air television channel in Russia in 2009, populated by Disney Channel and locally produced programing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney will take a 49 percent stake in the joint venture and provide cash and programing as well as expertise in content acquisition and marketing to kids and families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company would not comment on the size of its investment in the joint venture, or the length of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media-One, the majority stakeholder, brings to the table 30 owned and operated TV stations throughout Russia, as well as knowledge of the Russian market and regulatory environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal still must receive regulatory approval from Russia, which requires foreign investors to have Russian partners. Russia's regulatory environment for TV is seen as similar to that of western European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney already operates local retail, licensing, theatrical distribution, mobile and Internet businesses in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Bird, chairman of Walt Disney International, said on Tuesday that its newest Disney Channel would reach 75 percent of a Russian population that was already "extremely familiar" with the company's fairy tales and products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney opted for a free-to-air strategy in Russia to get the broadest reach possible because paid cable and satellite TV subscription is "very limited," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint venture has room to expand its coverage through acquisitions of more TV stations to carry the new channel. "That's something the venture would look at," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney operates 30 Disney Channels worldwide, mainly on cable and other forms of pay TV, and sees them as crucial to familiarizing international consumers with its theme parks, movies and consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has moved aggressively to establish TV presences in developing markets, including China, India and Eastern Europe since Chief Executive Robert Iger took over in 2005 and made international expansion a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also has stressed locally made programing based on culturally relevant stories, recently partnering with Indian creative partners on children's TV and an animated film, and with Russian and Chinese partners on features films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian economy is expected to buck the global economic downturn in 2009, leading Disney to "a certain amount of optimism" that "there is still a lot of room to grow" its locally operated business, Bird said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 16 (Reuters) - Overseas shares traded in the
United States rose sharply on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal
Reserve cut its benchmark rate to the bone and said it would
employ "all available tools" to jumpstart the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The move heartened investors because boosting the U.S.
economy, the world's biggest, is seen as key to reinvigorating
global markets, which have suffered steep losses this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nearly all sectors advanced. Financial stocks in particular
added to their gains after U.S. bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) posted a smaller-than-feared quarterly loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bank of New York Mellon's index of leading American
Depositary Receipts (ADRs) .BKADR was ended up 6.3 percent
while the 30-share Dow Jones industrial average .DJI climbed
4.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed --the U.S. central bank-- cut its target for
overnight interest rates to a record low zero to 0.25 percent,
down from the prior 1 percent target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed added it was prepared to expand already announced
large purchases of debt issued by government-sponsored mortgage
agencies to support the battered housing market. For details,
see [ID:nLG10118]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news helped bolster shares, some of which had already
seen gains stemming from Goldman Sachs's earnings. The bank
posted its first quarterly loss since going public in 1999, but
that loss, $2.12 billion, was less than some feared.
[ID:nN16521076]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swiss bank Credit Suisse (CS.N) gained 11 percent to $26.97
and Brazilian oil giant Petroleo Brasil (PBR.N) leapt 9.3
percent to $25.51, even as crude oil fell nearly 2 percent.
China Telecom CP (CHA.N) leapt 8.1 percent to $40.28, while
French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Aventis SA (SNY.N) rose
nearly 7 percent to $31.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bank of New York Mellon's index of leading European
ADRs .BKEUR leapt 6.2 percent. In Europe, shares closed
higher as big banks rallied on the Goldman news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares
ended rose 0.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bank of New York Mellon's index of leading Asian ADRs
.BKAS rose 6 percent. Asian markets were largely flat as
investors awaited the Fed's rate cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Receipts with the Bank of New York Mellon's index of
leading Latin American ADRs .BKLA jumped 9.2 percent. In
Latin America, investor sentiment was boosted by the Fed's
move.

&lt;p&gt;Customer Confidence Continues to Grow as Empowered Members Speak Out


CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
&#8220;I appreciate that RushCard serves the &#8220;forgotten public customer.&#8221; Once you
can&#8217;t get a bank account, you&#8217;re considered worthless. It was humiliating.
RushCard really helped me out. Before I got mine, I&#8217;d have to give friends money
and have them write checks to pay my bills, or have them call and make a phone
payment. I&#8217;d also walk around with cash, sometimes as much as $1,000 in my
pocket. Now I use my RushCard for everything&#8230; it&#8217;s my primary bank card, even
though I now have a bank account."--Dan Gonzales

Millions of Americans either don&#8217;t qualify for a bank account or don&#8217;t want one.
How do they cope with the day-to-day functions of paying bills, filling up the
car or buying groceries? For the past five years, RushCard members have been
part of a growing movement of the empowered, using the Prepaid Visa&#174; RushCard to
take responsibility for their finances, manage their money and build their
credit. RushCard announced today it has managed over $2 Billion in deposits and
spending transactions for its members, and has implemented programs like Spend
Tracker,RushPATH to Credit and Free Text Alerts.

&#8220;I had some financial difficulties in the past and RushCard helped me manage my
money and my situation. A friend from work told me about the RushCard.Ever since
I started using it, I stopped carrying cash with me. I&#8217;m able to pay all my
bills, my car, everything with it. I am very pleased with the type of program
that RushCard offers.&#8221;-- Mona Banks

RushCard members have access to all the conveniences of a Visa debit card,
including the ability to make purchases and pay bills online, rent a car, and
book hotel accommodations.Direct deposit allows members to avoid paying high
fees and waiting in long lines to cash a check.Plus, since the RushCard is
prepaid, members cannot go into debt or incur high overdraft fees and interest
charges.

The new online Spend Tracker tool enables members to keep track of what they
spend and, therefore, make better financial choices.RushPATH to Credit, an
important new program, provides members the ability to build a positive credit
file by reporting their regular payment history to participating consumer credit
reporting agencies. RushText alerts enable members to check their account
balances or receive deposit confirmations on their mobile phones. And the
RushCard is the only major pre-paid debit card with free customer service.

&#8220;I&#8217;m personally very happy that RushCard is benefiting and empowering people
exactly as it was intended,&#8221; emphasized Simmons. &#8220;In America today, no one
should be left out or kept out of having access to the American Dream and
financial services which a bank account or credit card provides to others. The
fact that we have already helped our members manage $2 Billion in transactions
proves that RushCard is instrumental in providing access to those services that
hundreds of thousands of people may not otherwise have. I thank our members for
their continued confidence in the card and want them to know we will continue to
provide them with new services to make their lives easier and help them achieve
financial stability.&#8221;

&#8220;We are thrilled to be a part of something that is empowering so many people to
manage their money better, especially in economic times like these where every
dollar counts and incurring debt can be so debilitating,&#8221; asserted Ram
Palaniappan, General Manager of UniRush, LLC. &#8220;We are committed to finding ways
to continue to serve our members better and offer them more solutions to
financial literacy.&#8221;

"RushCard has truly been a blessing for me and my family. It is really a
lifesaver. I&#8217;ve been through a lot of difficult times, and RushCard has helped
me better manage the money I received from school. I&#8217;m a student, and I decided
to get a RushCard because the fees of those check-cashing businesses were
ridiculous. I wanted to save money for my family and my kids, so RushCard was
the best option.&#8221;-- Nicole Johnson

&#8220;As we celebrate this major accomplishment, we look forward to the day all
Americans have the financial access and dignity they deserve,&#8221; declared Simmons.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, details, background, comments from Disney

&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
and Media-One Holdings Ltd unveiled on Tuesday plans to launch
a nationwide, free-to-air television channel in Russia in 2009,
populated by Disney Channel and locally produced programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney will take a 49 percent stake in the joint venture
and provide cash and programming, as well as expertise in
content acquisition and marketing to kids and families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company would not comment on the size of its investment

culturally relevant stories, recently partnering with Indian
creative partners on children's TV and an animated film, and
with Russian and Chinese partners on features films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Russian economy is expected to buck the global economic
downturn in 2009, leading Disney to "a certain amount of

&lt;p&gt;LIMA (Reuters) - Traffickers hid 2.8 tonnes of cocaine in thousands of pounds of smelly bird droppings, Peruvian police said on Monday after uncovering the latest ruse to conceal drug shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cocaine exporters in Peru, the world's No. 2 producer after neighboring Colombia, counted on the stench of the dung, which is sold as a high-end organic fertilizer, tricking dogs trained to find drugs at ports of entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guano, as the dung is known in Spanish, is rich in nitrates and phosphorous and has a strong ammonia smell. The cocaine was hidden in 400 bags of guano that together weighed 20 tonnes and was bound for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The organic products camouflaged the cocaine by neutralizing it to avoid detection," police said after a five-month investigation that led to the seizure at a warehouse in Lima about 10 days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five people were arrested, including a Colombian man, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guano accumulates as white mounds on the desert islands where birds such as pelicans live along the coasts of Peru and Chile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once one of the world's most valuable commodities, and Bolivia, Peru and Chile fought over its control in the 1879-1883 War of the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diego Ore; writing by Terry Wade; editing by Mohammad Zargham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms and assigns Rating Outlooks for J.P. Morgan Commercial
Mortgage Finance Corp.'s mortgage pass-through certificates, series 1999-C8 as
follows: 

-- $117.2 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $36.6 million class B at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $32.9 million class C at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $14.6 million class D at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $25.6 million class E at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $11 million class F at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $16.5 million class G at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $20.1 million class H at 'B'; Outlook Negative; 

-- $14.8 million class J at 'C/DR5'. 

Classes K and NR have been reduced to zero due to realized losses. Class A-1 has
paid in full. 

Affirmations are due to sufficient credit enhancement as a result of
amortization, loan repayment, and defeasance. As of the November 2008
distribution date, the pool's aggregate performance has been reduced 60.5% to
$289.3 million from $731.5 million. Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction
of any rating changes over the next one to two years. 

Approximately 33.4% of the pool has defeased, including five of the top 10
loans. Of the pool, 78% is scheduled to mature in the next twelve months;
however, 35% of these maturing loans have defeased. 

There are currently seven specially serviced loans (16.2%), including the
largest remaining loan. The largest remaining loan (7.5%) is backed by a
692-unit multifamily property located in Rolling Meadows, IL, a suburb of
Chicago. The loan is currently 30 days delinquent and has had a history of
delinquency throughout the life of the loan. The property is currently listed
for sale. At this time, Fitch does not expect losses to the trust. 

The second largest specially serviced loan (2.1%) is backed by a 121,639 square
foot office property located in Kansas City, MO. The loan was transferred on
June 2, 2008 due to imminent default. The special servicer is pursuing
foreclosure and expects to take title by March 2009. Losses are possible. 

Fitch has identified 18 loans (32.1%) as Fitch Loans of Concern. These include
specially serviced loans, loans with DSCRs below 1.0 times, loans with declining
occupancies, and loans with other performance issues. The largest non-specially
serviced Loan of Concern is collateralized by an office in Seattle, Washington.
A major tenant occupying approximately 31% of the net rentable area will vacate
in February 2009. The space is currently being marketed. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the company's asset management division performed "pretty well" during the fourth quarter despite a brutal environment, but warned that hedge fund assets were likely to shrink in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

g&#233;n&#233;ral les propri&#233;t&#233;s en dopant d'impuret&#233;s la surface du dispositif. Mais cet
ajustement cr&#233;e une variabilit&#233; ind&#233;sirable et d&#233;grade la stabilit&#233; de la SRAM.
Ce probl&#232;me devient critique, particuli&#232;rement &#224; partir du n&#339;ud 22&#160;nm de la
technologie et au-del&#224;. L'emploi de FinFET -- transistors verticaux &#224; canaux de
silicium non dop&#233; en forme d'ailette &#8211; constitue une approche alternative pour
permettre la r&#233;duction de taille des cellules SRAM sans variation
caract&#233;ristique. 

Les chercheurs des trois entreprises ont fabriqu&#233; une cellule SRAM FinFET tr&#232;s
fortement proportionnelle en mat&#233;riau HKMG. C'est la plus petite cellule SRAM &#224;
FET non planaire jamais r&#233;alis&#233;e&#160;: &#224; 0,128&#160;&#956;m2, la cellule int&#233;gr&#233;e est plus de
50&#160;% plus r&#233;duite que la cellule FET non planaire de 0,274&#160;&#956;m2 pr&#233;c&#233;demment
pr&#233;sent&#233;e. Pour r&#233;aliser cet objectif, l'&#233;quipe a optimis&#233; les processus,
particuli&#232;rement en ce qui concerne le d&#233;p&#244;t et l'&#233;limination des mat&#233;riaux,
notamment le HKMG, des surfaces verticales de la structure du FinFET non
planaire. 

Les chercheurs ont &#233;galement &#233;tudi&#233; la variation stochastique des propri&#233;t&#233;s des
FinFET dans les cellules SRAM &#224; haute proportionnalit&#233; et simul&#233; les variations
des cellules SRAM &#224; une taille de cellule encore plus r&#233;duite. Ils ont mis en
&#233;vidence le fait que les FinFET sans dopage des canaux am&#233;lioraient de plus de
28&#160;% la variabilit&#233; caract&#233;ristique des transistors. Dans les simulations de
cellules SRAM de 0,063&#160;&#956;m2 de superficie, &#233;quivalente ou sup&#233;rieure &#224; la
proportionnalit&#233; de cellule du n&#339;ud 22&#160;nm, les r&#233;sultats ont confirm&#233; que la
cellule SRAM FinFET devrait offrir un gain notable de stabilit&#233; de
fonctionnement compar&#233; &#224; la cellule SRAM &#224; FET planaire de cette g&#233;n&#233;ration. 

En parvenant &#224; fabriquer des cellules SRAM &#224; FinFET hautement proportionnels
avec HKMG, les entreprises ont positionn&#233; les FinFET comme une structure &#224;
transistors s&#233;duisante pour les SRAM du n&#339;ud 22&#160;nm et au-del&#224;. La nouvelle
technologie a avanc&#233; d&#8217;un pas en avant vers des dispositifs encore plus
puissants.

&lt;p&gt; * Principal investments net loss $3.6 billion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Moody's cuts Goldman debt rating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares rise nearly 10 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from investor, detail from earnings results)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
reported its first quarterly loss since going public nine years
ago as plunging values of stocks, debt and real estate caught
up with a Wall Street leader that until recently had
sidestepped the worst of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But investors had braced for even worse results and
appeared relieved by the numbers as Goldman shares rose nearly
10 percent on Tuesday, lifting the broader U.S. stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank posted its worst quarterly trading results in a
decade, signaling that the engine that fueled so much of the
bank's profits in recent years may be sputtering. Writedowns
topped $5 billion, and revenue from investment banking
businesses, including merger advisory and underwriting, dropped
31 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman posted a net loss of $2.12 billion, or $4.97 a
share, for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 28, compared with
record net income of $3.2 billion, or $7.01 a share, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expected a loss of $3.73 a share,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is reinventing itself as it struggles with a credit
crisis that has forced three competitors to sell themselves or
go out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Borrowing in bond markets has become expensive and
unreliable for many financial institutions, pushing Goldman and
others to become bank holding companies to take advantage of
deposit funding. But being a regulated bank makes it harder for
Goldman to trade its own funds for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were an investment bank for 139 years and a bank
holding company for three months. We're still a little new at
this game," Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a
conference call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman hopes to gain as much as $50 billion to $100
billion in deposit funding over the next year, compared with
its current level of $20 billion. The bank had total assets of
$885 billion at the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the U.S. financial sector broadly contracts, Goldman is
laying off workers, having shed 2,500 employees in the fourth
quarter, an 8 percent decline from the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares were up $6.38 at $72.84 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The bank's book value per share was $98.68 at
the end of the quarter, meaning its stock was trading at about
0.7 times the book value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fear in the market was the results would be much
worse, so the stock is rallying," said Walter Todd, portfolio
manager at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South
Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's Investors Service cut its Goldman credit rating to
A1 from Aa3 and said the firm's outlook remains "negative,"
citing its vulnerability to credit markets and a difficult
operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But credit markets largely shrugged off the downgrade, and
the price of protecting Goldman's debt against default for five
years was unchanged at $370,000 a year for every $10 million of
debt protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman posted its first loss since the fourth quarter of
1998, when the collapse of hedge fund Long-Term Capital
Management and the Asian debt crisis roiled markets. The
company went public in 1999, and used partnership accounting
before then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a quarter when almost every business line suffered, the
company's writedowns outstripped revenue from clients and
trading, resulting in negative net revenue of $1.58 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A year earlier, quarterly net revenue totaled $10.7
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fixed-income, currency and commodities trading generated
negative revenue of $3.4 billion, while principal investments
recorded a loss of $3.6 billion. Equities trading revenue rose
2 percent to $2.64 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, it was the first quarter of negative trading and
principal investments revenue since 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even the best racing machines, given the worst driving
conditions, can perform badly," said Michael Holland, founder
of Holland  Co, which oversees more than $4 billion in assets.
November put an exclamation point on Wall Street's worst year
since the Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banking revenue fell by half to $1.03 billion.
Goldman's backlog of pending deals dropped during the quarter,
as few new transactions were announced, and ended the year
"significantly lower" than a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asset management revenue lost 19 percent to $945 million as
falling market prices and customer outflows cut into fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amid these declines, Goldman slashed its compensation and
benefits spending for the year by 46 percent to around $10.93
billion, or $364,000 per employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares have fallen nearly 70 percent this year, and
nearly two-thirds since September as investors lost confidence
in Wall Street's lightly regulated, highly leveraged
broker-dealers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its quarterly report, to be followed by Morgan Stanley's
(MS.N) results on Wednesday, may help answer questions that
have clouded the banking industry since Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK collapsed into bankruptcy in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay and Dan Wilchins;

&lt;p&gt; * FTSEurofirst 300 closes up 0.9 pct&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Banks gain after Goldman results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Fed rate cut expected; U.S. economic data downbeat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Brian Gorman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - European stocks closed higher on
Tuesday as banks gained after results at Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
relieved investors, and as markets braced for a rate cut by the
U.S. Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares
rose 0.9 percent to close at 834.84 points, near the day's high
and the first gain in four sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index has lost more than 44 percent this year, hurt by a
credit crisis that has helped push several major economies into
recession. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks in Europe added most to the benchmark index. BNP
Paribas (BNPP.PA), Banco Santander (SAN.MC), Deutsche Bank
DBGKn.DE and UBS (UBSN.VX) rose between 1.8 and 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Goldman Sachs posted its first quarterly loss since going
public nine years ago, although some investors had expected even
deeper losses and its shares rose 8.6 percent on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downbeat U.S. economic data may strengthen the case for a
rate cut. In a decision expected at 1915 GMT, the Fed is likely
to cut interest rates by at least 50 basis points to 0.5
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. consumer prices plunged for a second straight month
during November, according to a government report on Tuesday
that is likely to fan fears that economic recession is rapidly
heightening risks of deflation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, new U.S. housing starts and permits also plunged
to record lows in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The investment universe is still being driven by economic
news from the U.S.," said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays
stockbrokers. "Data continues to disappoint. Markets are hoping
for action from the incoming president, Barack Obama."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones .DJI, SP 500 .SPX and Nasdaq Composite
.IXIC were up between 1.4 and 2.6 percent as European bourses
were closing.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHARMAS GAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back in Europe, defensive stocks were some of the best
gainers, with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) ending 1.7 percent higher
and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) gaining 3.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Potts said: "We're advising investors to go into drugs and
telecoms, as they are defensive: large companies that have
strong stable cashflows, that will outperform against this
economic backdrop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Electricite de France (EDF.PA) was the top-weighted gainer
in the index, up 3.1 percent after reports it is close to buying
half of the nuclear assets of Constellation Energy Group CEG.N
for $4.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Most oils rose, tracking a gain in crude prices CLc1, up
more than 1 percent to more than 45 a barrel on hopes OPEC will
cut output on Wednesday. Total (TOTF.PA), ENI (ENI.MI), and
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), rose between 1 and 1.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miners were the biggest negative weight on the index, as
metal prices slipped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Antofagasta (ANTO.L), BHP Billiton (BLT.L), Rio Tinto
(RIO.L) and Xstrata XTA.L fell 1.8 to 3.6 percent. Lonmin
(LMI.L) slipped 3.3 percent ahead of its demotion from the FTSE
100 and the FTSEurofirst 300 indexes after Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  On the macro side, investors got a bit of relief, with the
euro zone Services PMI for December coming in at 42 compared with
forecasts of 41.2, while the manufacturing PMI came in at 34.5
compared to forecasts of 34.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a little better than expected. We have all been
surprised at the rate of decline in the past few months so we
were worried it could fall further," said Dominic Bryant,
analyst at BNP Paribas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across Europe, the FTSE 100 .FTSE closed up 0.7 percent,
while Germany's DAX .GDAXI was up 1.6 percent and France's CAC
40 .FCHI was 2 percent higher.

&lt;p&gt;-- Area of Nonplanar-FET SRAM Cell Cut by More Than 50%;&#160;Establishes Promising
Approach for Future Technology Nodes -- 
TOKYO &amp; NEW YORK &amp; SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Toshiba Corporation (TOKYO:6502), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and AMD (NYSE:AMD) today
announced that they have together developed a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)
cell that has an area of only 0.128 square micrometers (&#956;m2), the world&#8217;s
smallest functional SRAM cell that makes use of fin-shaped Field Effect
Transistors (FinFETs). 

The cell, developed with a high-k/metal gate (HKMG) material, offers advantages
over planar-FET cells for future technology generations. SRAM cells are circuit
components in most systems-level, large-scale integrated circuits such as
microprocessors, and smaller SRAM cells can help provide smaller, faster
processors that consume less power. The technology was announced on December 16
in a technical paper presented at the 2008 International Electron Devices
Meeting (http://www.his.com/~iedm/general/) in San Francisco, California. 

To reduce the transistor size when SRAM cells are created using conventional
planar transistors, IC manufacturers generally adjust properties by doping more
impurities into the device area. However, this adjustment creates undesirable
variability and deteriorates the SRAM stability. This issue is becoming
critical, especially at the 22nm technology node and beyond. The use of FinFETs
-- vertical transistors with fin-shaped undoped silicon channels -- is an
alternative approach to allow SRAM cell size reduction with less characteristic
variation. 

Researchers from the three companies fabricated a highly scaled FinFET SRAM cell
using HKMG. It is the smallest nonplanar-FET SRAM cell yet achieved: at
0.128&#956;m2, the integrated cell is more than 50 percent smaller than the 0.274&#956;m2
nonplanar-FET cell previously reported. To achieve this goal, the team optimized
the processes, especially for depositing and removing materials, including HKMG
from vertical surfaces of the non-planar FinFET structure. 

The researchers also investigated the stochastic variation of FinFET properties
within the highly scaled SRAM cells and simulated SRAM cell variations at an
even smaller cell size. They verified that FinFETs without channel doping
improved transistor characteristic variability by more than 28 percent. In
simulations of SRAM cells of 0.063&#956;m2 area, equivalent to or beyond the cell
scaling for the 22nm node, the results confirmed that the FinFET SRAM cell is
expected to offer a significant advantage in stable operation compared to a
planar-FET SRAM cell at this generation. 

By successfully fabricating highly scaled FinFET SRAM cells with HKMG, the
companies have positioned FinFETs as an attractive transistor structure for
SRAMs in the 22nm node and beyond. The new technology is a step forward to more
powerful practical devices.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group  (GS.N),
which on Tuesday posted its first quarterly loss in nine years,
said it cut its commodities exposure during the fourth quarter,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc wants to expand deposits by as much as fivefold in the next year, but the newly minted bank holding company remains wary of buying institutions that bring other troubles with them, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viniar told reporters he expects Goldman will expand its $20 billion deposit base to between $50 billion and $100 billion over the next year. Growth will be fueled through a combination of deposit brokers, Goldman's private wealth managers and "other sources," including acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there has been speculation that Goldman would pursue deals with Citigroup and other U.S. banks, Viniar said the firm is proceeding cautiously. But he did not rule out a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not going to make an acquisition just to grow our deposit base. And we have to be very careful about not making an acquisition of deposits that have troubled assets which come with them," Viniar told reporters in a briefing after Goldman reported a fourth-quarter loss of $2.12 billion, its first loss since going public nine years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is a potential way of growing that business. We will look at opportunities if they make sense, but so far we haven't seen anything that makes sense," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman converted from an investment bank to a Federal Reserve-regulated bank holding company in September as investors and customers lost confidence in the lightly regulated, highly leveraged broker-dealer model favored by Wall Street firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift, made reluctantly only after Lehman Brothers collapsed into bankruptcy, gave Goldman permanent access to Fed funding and allows it to attract deposits, reducing its reliance on short-term debt markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, Goldman's bank has about $150 billion in assets, funded in part by more than $20 billion in U.S. deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been growing those slowly, internally, through third party channels. We are looking to grow deposits within the bank, not because it is a be-all-end-all, but a good diversified source of funding," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Goldman rival Morgan Stanley, which has undergone the same conversion to a bank holding company, has been more enthusiastic about the potential for building a significant banking business. Morgan is already one of the world's largest brokerages for individual investors, and it recently hired senior Wachovia Corp executives to help create a major retail bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said Goldman, which generally does business with institutions and companies, intends to steer clear of consumer banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strategy is evolving, but as we sit here now, we're much more of a wholesale than a retail company. We always have been," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar, though, asked for patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to give us a little more time," he said. "We were an investment bank for 139 years and a bank holding company for three months. We're still a little new at this game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported its first quarterly loss since going public nine years ago as the plunging value of stocks, debt and real estate caught up with a Wall Street leader that had largely avoided fallout from the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman posted a net loss of $2.12 billion, or $4.97 a share, for the fourth quarter ended November 28, compared with record net income of $3.2 billion, or $7.01 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding one-time items, analysts, on average, had expected a loss of $3.73 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN  CO IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors have been anticipating the worst. It was weaker than expected, but maybe that has to do with how they're marking it. Maybe they're getting it out of the way in the fourth quarter here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a slight concern that if they're marking paper a little bit more severely than someone else, will others have to follow? The initial reaction will be that Goldman is trading up, which would benefit the financial sector, which is pretty oversold and looking to rebound."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're still somewhat dependent on the financial sector to lead us and so far this week the banks have been a bit suspect here. Hopefully we have the next day or two led by results (from) Goldman Sachs can get us out of the starting gate at least."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRIS HOSSAIN, SENIOR SALES MANAGER AT ODL SECURITIES, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not as bad as expected. People obviously had factored $2 billion losses and the fear was going to be $4 billion. It's a bit of a relief."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIM SMALLS, HEAD OF U.S. STOCK TRADING AT BROKERAGE FIRM EXECUTION LLC IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock is up from the standpoint that everyone had been expecting this to be the proverbial kitchen sink quarter for Goldman - they were going to throw as much of the nonsense as they could possibly find into this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the number on people's radar screen was much bigger as they try to clear the books to start the next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROBERT LUTTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CABOT MONEY MANAGEMENT IN SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers were fairly well anticipated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Expectations are very low for the sector today and that may mean there's some kind of a floor set here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think going forward, what kind of business does Goldman Sachs have? There's a huge question mark at this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This whole change from an investment bank to a bank is a big question mark."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs still has some of the brightest minds and some of the most capable people working in their firm and that's always going to have some valuable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Does the world need those services right now, that's the biggest issue?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WALTER TODD, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GREENWOOD CAPITAL ASSOCIATES, GREENWOOD, SOUTH CAROLINA:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fear in the market was, the results would be much worse than they were. So the stock is rallying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you buy Goldman Sachs today, you need to have faith in the management team -- that they'll be able to adapt to the new world order as a bank holding company. They have a good, smart management team. I'm sure they'll adapt, but you're taking a leap of faith."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dominic Lau in London; Deepa Seetharaman, Dan Wilchins, Leah Schnurr and Elinor Comlay in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 16 (Reuters) - European stocks closed higher on
Tuesday, with banks gaining after results at Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) beat expectations, and as investors braced for a rate cut
in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares
closed provisionally up 0.8 percent at 833.83 points, having
been up as much as 1 percent earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index has lost more than 44 percent this year, hurt by a
credit crisis that has helped push several major economies into
recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs posted its first quarterly loss since going
public nine years ago, but some investors had expected even
deeper losses and its shares rose 8.6 percent on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European banks gained. BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Deutsche Bank
DBGKn.DE and UBS (UBSN.VX) were up between 1.8 and 4.4
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downbeat U.S. economic data may strengthen the case for a
rate cut. In a decision expected at 1915 GMT, the Federal
Reserve is likely to cut interest rates by at least 50 basis
points to 0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back in Europe, defensive stocks were some the best gainers,
with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) up 2 percent and Sanofi-Aventis
(SASY.PA) up 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The investment universe is still being driven by the
economic news from the U.S.," said Henk Potts, strategist at
Barclays stockbrokers. "Data continues to disappoint. Markets
are hoping for action from the incoming president, Barack
Obama."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EDF (EDF.PA) was the top-weighted gainer in the FTSEurofirst
300 index, up 3.1 percent, following reports it is close to
buying half of the nuclear assets of Constellation Energy Group
CEG.N for $4.5 billion.

 (Updates to midmorning)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Leah Schnurr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as
a smaller-than-feared loss from Goldman Sachs boosted
beaten-down financials ahead of an expected interest rate cut
from the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) rose more than 8
percent after the company reported its first quarterly loss
since going public in 1999, but the loss was not as deep as
already lowered expectations. For more see [ID:nN16521076].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The credit crunch arising from the meltdown of the U.S.
housing market has hit financials hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everyone had been expecting this to be the proverbial
kitchen sink quarter for Goldman -- they were going to throw as
much of the nonsense as they could possibly find into this
quarter," said Tim Smalls, head of U.S. stock trading at
brokerage firm Execution LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut,
explaining the stock's rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cost-cutting measures from top electronics retailer Best
Buy (BBY.N) lifted optimism, with investors betting the sector
was bracing to withstand a sharp drop in consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Best Buy rose 15.5 percent to $27.11 after it
reported better-than -expected results and said it plans to
offer buyouts and cut back on store openings. [ID:nN16548984].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 90.40 points,
or 1.06 percent, to 8,654.93. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX gained 12.79 points, or 1.47 percent, to 881.36. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 29.47 points, or 1.95
percent, to 1,537.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since hitting an 11-year intraday low on Nov. 21, the broad
SP 500 index has pushed higher. It is up nearly 20 percent
from the low but is still down about 40 percent year to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- is expected to lower
benchmark rates from the current 1 percent at a scheduled
decision later in the day as it continues its aggressive
campaign of cutting rates in an effort to stimulate growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors will be watching for signals on what other policy
measures it will consider to reverse the economic downturn as
it runs out of room to trim rates any further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest economic data continued to show effects of the
recession, with U.S. consumer prices plunging at a record rate
for a second straight month in November and construction starts
on new homes tumbled to a record low. [ID:nN1620608].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financials sector was among the biggest gainers with
the SP financial index .GSPF rising 2.8 percent. Goldman
gained 8.6 percent to $72.18, while Dow component JPMorgan
Chase (JPM.N) was up 4.1 percent at $29.80. JPMorgan was among
the Dow's biggest boosts.

&lt;p&gt;CUPERTINO, Calif. &amp; MOSCOW--(Business Wire)--
Chordiant Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: CHRD), the leading provider of Customer
Experience (Cx&#8482;) software and services, jointly with its global partner IBM
(NYSE: IBM) today announced that they have completed the pilot implementation of
Chordiant&#8217;s front-office Cx solution for servicing clients at the retail arm of
KIT Finance Bank. 

In light of its plans to considerably expand its retail business, KIT Finance
Bank faced the task of maximizing the efficiency of its sales and servicing
channels. The bank&#8217;s existing IT environment included multiple disparate banking
applications that contained customer data and functionality. The goal of the new
solution was to reduce the effort needed to perform transactions at the branches
and in the contact center and to shift the focus to sales and servicing clients.


To meet these goals the bank needed a front-office solution that would
consolidate information on customers, products and services within a common
desktop, standardize and automate all key business processes in sales and
servicing customers, simplify and speed-up the work of personnel, and improve
quality of servicing through implementation of real-time Next-Best-Action&#8482;
recommendations to the clients. From a technology standpoint, the goal was to
integrate with existing systems at the bank and considerably reduce the time
required for implementation and modification of banking products. 

The bank chose Chordiant because it could successfully manage the above tasks
with the use of operational CRM and modern open technologies. The solution is
effectively multi-channel, which allows the integration of various customer
servicing channels within the single platform. These include contact center,
branch, internet bank, electronic self servicing, etc. KIT Bank also selected
Chordiant because of IBM and Chordiant&#8217;s experience in implementing such
solutions at leading banks around the world. 

The purpose of the pilot was to test the Chordiant solution in a Russian
environment in one sales channel (branch) and with one product line (term
deposits by individuals). The standard Chordiant front-office solution was
localized and customized to meet the requirements of the bank and integrated
with the banks&#8217; existing solutions. Following tests the customized solution was
accepted by the bank. 

&#8220;Implementation of the pilot confirmed that our choice of IBM and Chordiant was
correct. The solution allowed us to improve the quality of servicing customers
and increase personnel efficiency. One of the most impressive characteristics of
the Chordiant front office was the fivefold reduction in the average time to
open a term deposit. The joint work of the IBM-Chordiant team allowed us to
achieve a solution within limited timeframes,&#8221; said Vladislav Bykov, Deputy
Director General of KIT Finance Investment Bank. 

IBM managed the project and coordinated the activity of all participants. IBM
Global Business Services (IBM GBS) consultants and Chordiant specialists
designed the solution, which allows new product lines to be added with minimal
modification to the existing customer service modules. The front office was
integrated with existing systems using a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and
WEB-services through IBM WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus. 

&#8220;IBM and Chordiant have a long history of partnership and have successfully
implemented Chordiant solutions many times all over the world. This project is
an important milestone in our cooperation&#8212;it is the first implementation of
Chordiant in Russia, and we are happy that this experience was a success.
Efficient implementation processes and active participation by the banks&#8217;
specialists resulted in the project going live in five months. This is a very
good result, particularly when you consider that it had to be localized for the
Russian market and customized to suit the client,&#8221; said the head of IBM GBS
Boris Hohl.

&lt;p&gt;The upgrades, which will increase the supply of ultra-low sulfur diesel by 6 million gallons per day, come at a time when poor refinery profit margins have most refiners scaling back or canceling previously announced projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the time to do that.

&lt;p&gt; * Banks reverse losses after Goldman results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Fed rate cut expected; U.S. economic data downbeat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Brian Gorman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - European stocks rose 0.5 percent
by mid afternoon on Tuesday, tracking gains in the United States
on Goldman Sachs' results (GS.N), mitigating the impact of
downbeat data that sparked worries about deflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 1505 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was up 0.5 percent at 831.83 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil and gas stocks added most points to the index, with
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) up 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Defensive stocks were also strong, with GlaxoSmithKline
(GSK.L) up 1.5 percent and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) up 2.7
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs posted its first quarterly loss since going
public nine years ago, although some investors had expected even
deeper losses and its shares rose 6.4 percent on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks gained. BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Deutsche Bank
DBGKn.DE were up 2.7 and 3.5 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a decision expected at 1915 GMT, the Fed is likely to cut
interest rates by at least 50 basis points to 0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer prices plunged for a second straight month during
November, according to a government report on Tuesday that is
likely to fan fears that economic recession is rapidly
heightening risks of deflation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Labor Department said its closely watched Consumer Price
Index dropped 1.7 percent after falling 1 percent in October --
back-to-back record drops since the department started keeping
monthly data in 1947. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meantime, new U.S. housing starts and permits also plunged
to record lows in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Europe, miners were the biggest negative weight on the
index, as gold prices dipped, with Rio Tinto (RIO.L), Anglo
American (AAL.L) and Xstrata XTA.L down between 1.4 percent
and 3.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the macro side, investors got a bit of relief, with the
euro zone Services PMI for December coming in at 42 compared with
forecasts of 41.2, while the manufacturing PMI came in at 34.5,
compared with forecasts of 34.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a little better than expected. We have all been
surprised at the rate of decline in the past few months so we
were worried it could fall further," said Dominic Bryant,
analyst at BNP Paribas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across Europe, the FTSE 100 .FTSE index was up 0.8
percent, while Germany's DAX .GDAXI was up 1.3 percent and
France's CAC 40 .FCHI was up 1 percent higher.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
wants to expand deposits by as much as fivefold in the next
year, but the newly minted bank holding company remains wary of
buying institutions that bring other troubles with them, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Viniar told reporters he expects Goldman will expand its
$20 billion deposit base to between $50 billion and $100
billion over the next year. Growth will be fueled through a
combination of deposit brokers, Goldman's private wealth
managers and "other sources," including acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While there has been speculation that Goldman would pursue
deals with Citigroup (C.N) and other U.S. banks, Viniar said
the firm is proceeding cautiously. But he did not rule out a
deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're not going to make an acquisition just to grow our
deposit base. And we have to be very careful about not making
an acquisition of deposits that have troubled assets which come
with them," Viniar told reporters in a briefing after Goldman
reported a fourth-quarter loss of $2.12 billion, its first loss
since going public nine years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That is a potential way of growing that business. We will
look at opportunities if they make sense, but so far we haven't
seen anything that makes sense," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman converted from an investment bank to a Federal
Reserve-regulated bank holding company in September as
investors and customers lost confidence in the lightly
regulated, highly leveraged broker-dealer model favored by Wall
Street firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shift, made reluctantly only after Lehman Brothers
collapsed into bankruptcy, gave Goldman permanent access to Fed
funding and allows it to attract deposits, reducing its
reliance on short-term debt markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To date, Goldman's bank has about $150 billion in assets,
funded in part by more than $20 billion in U.S. deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've been growing those slowly, internally, through third
party channels. We are looking to grow deposits within the
bank, not because it is a be-all-end-all, but a good
diversified source of funding," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison, Goldman rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which
has undergone the same conversion to a bank holding company,
has been more enthusiastic about the potential for building a
significant banking business. Morgan is already one of the
world's largest brokerages for individual investors, and it
recently hired senior Wachovia Corp WB.N executives to help
create a major retail bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar said Goldman, which generally does business with
institutions and companies, intends to steer clear of consumer
banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The strategy is evolving, but as we sit here now, we're
much more of a wholesale than a retail company. We always have
been," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar, though, asked for patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have to give us a little more time," he said. "We were
an investment bank for 139 years and a bank holding company for
three months. We're still a little new at this game."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds closing prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISTANBUL Dec 16 (Reuters) - Turkish markets strengthened on
Tuesday, bolstered by global share gains and hopes of an IMF
deal for the country as quarterly results from embattled U.S.
bank Goldman Sachs boosted investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main Istanbul share index .XU100 closed 3.11 percent
higher at 26,395.82 points, outperforming the MSCI index of
emerging markets which was 1.22 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index rose by 2.65 percent on Monday, but it has fallen
nearly 50 percent since the beginning of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs results were not as bad as they could have
been and have given a boost to global markets and this is
driving our market right now. Optimism over an IMF deal is
helping us as well," said Zeynel Abdi Balci, head of research at
Acar Invest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, the largest surviving investment bank, posted
a net loss of $2.12 billion, or $4.97 a share, for the fourth
quarter ended Nov. 28, compared with record net income of $3.2
billion, or $7.01 a share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News on a pending deal between Ankara and the International
Monetary Fund has also shored up Turkish markets as the country
faces a large financing shortfall in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Treasury said on Monday "significant progress" was
achieved in the technical studies aimed at devising a new IMF
programme and the Fund said a mission would visit Turkey in
early January for loan talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turkish business leaders and investors have for months been
calling for a loan accord with the fund to boost the Turkish
economy, which has slowed sharply this year while its markets
have been battered by fallout from the global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lira IYIX= closed at 1.5650 against the dollar on the
interbank market against the Monday close of 1.5675.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Markets showed little reaction to comments from the Turkish
central bank governor on its monetary policy outlook for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank will trim the range between its lending and
borrowing rates if liquidity tightness lasts, Governor Durmus
Yilmaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said on Tuesday the central bank could lend to banks
in the event of uncertainty in the banking system and capital
flight and that the bank could hold 91-day repo auctions if
liquidity dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yield on the June 23, 2010 benchmark bond
0#TRTSYSUM=IS rose to 18.57 percent from the previous day's
close of 18.40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bechmark sold at an average yield of 18.53 percent at
auction where the Turkish Treasury sold 947.9 million lira
($605.3 million) of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also sold 434.8 million lira at auction in a tap of an
11-month discount bill maturing on Nov 18, 2009 at an average
yield of 18.75 percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 16 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service cut
Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) ratings on Tuesday, affecting $175
billion in debt, due to the firm's vulnerabilities to the
global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's cut the firm's long-term debt ratings by one notch
to "A1," the fifth highest rating, from "Aa3," excluding
FDIC-guaranteed debt. The outlook remains negative, which means
another cut may come in 12 months to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This crisis has demonstrated that the business model of
wholesale investment banks is not as resilient as it appeared,"
Peter Nerby, a senior vice president of Moody's, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman reported on Tuesday its first quarterly loss since
going public and it was the firm's first loss since the fourth
quarter of 1998, when the collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management and the Asian debt crisis roiled global markets. For
details, click [ID:nN16521076]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's said the loss was within Moody's expections and
Goldman Sachs still remains profitable for 2008 and has
outperformed many of its peers.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities sees a "highly challenging" 2009 for small U.S. banks, as it expects mounting credit pressure and top-line headwinds to weigh on their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have cut our 2009 EPS estimates for the small cap banks by about 12 percent on average, reflecting higher credit costs, lower spread revenue, and the dilutive impact of TARP capital," analyst John Pancari said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancari said the pressure on the group will be compounded by persistent deposit pricing challenges and moderating earning asset growth, both of which he expects will affect top-line performance in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current downturn in the credit cycle is likely to continue to play out with mounting deterioration in other real-estate sensitive areas of lending," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Arup Roychoudhury in Bangalore; Editing by Pratish Narayanan)&lt;/p&gt;

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today reported net revenues of
$22.22&#160;billion and net earnings of $2.32&#160;billion for the year ended
November&#160;28,&#160;2008. Diluted earnings per common share were $4.47 compared with

fourth quarter, the Tier 1 Ratio increased from 11.6%, reflecting $20.75 billion
of equity issuances.

______________ 

&#8220;Our results for the fourth quarter reflect extraordinarily difficult operating
conditions, including a sharp decline in values across virtually every asset
class,&#8221; said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;While
our quarterly performance obviously didn't meet our expectations, Goldman Sachs
remained profitable during one of the most challenging years in our industry's
history. Our deep and global client franchise, experienced and talented people
and strong balance sheet position our firm well for the year ahead.&#8221; 

Net Revenues

Investment Banking

Full Year

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $5.19&#160;billion for the year, 31% lower
than 2007. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $2.66&#160;billion, 37% lower than
particularly strong net revenues in 2007, primarily reflecting a decline in
industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm&#8217;s
Underwriting business were $2.53&#160;billion, 24% lower than 2007, principally due
to significantly lower net revenues in debt underwriting. The decrease in debt
underwriting was primarily due to a decline in leveraged finance and
mortgage-related activity, reflecting difficult market conditions. Net revenues
in equity underwriting were slightly lower compared with 2007, reflecting a
decrease in industry-wide equity and equity-related offerings. 

Fourth Quarter

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.03&#160;billion, 48% lower than the fourth
quarter of 2007 and 20% lower than the third quarter of 2008. Net revenues in
Financial Advisory were $574&#160;million, 54% lower than a particularly strong
fourth quarter of 2007, primarily reflecting a decline in industry-wide
completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm&#8217;s Underwriting
business were $460&#160;million, 37% lower than the fourth quarter of 2007. Net
revenues in both debt and equity underwriting were significantly lower,
reflecting lower levels of activity. 

The firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog decreased during the quarter
and ended the year significantly lower than at the end of 2007.&#160;(4)

Trading and Principal Investments

Full Year

Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $9.06 billion for the
year, 71% lower than 2007. 

Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $3.71&#160;billion
for the year, 77% lower than 2007, primarily reflecting losses in credit
products, which included a loss of approximately $3.1&#160;billion (net of hedges)
related to non-investment-grade credit origination activities and losses from
investments, including corporate debt and private and public equities. Results
in mortgages included net losses of approximately $1.7&#160;billion on residential
mortgage loans and securities and approximately $1.4&#160;billion on commercial
mortgage loans and securities. Interest rate products, currencies and
commodities each produced particularly strong results and net revenues were
higher compared with 2007. During 2008, although client-driven activity was
generally solid, FICC operated in a challenging environment characterized by
broad-based declines in asset values, wider mortgage and corporate credit
spreads, reduced levels of liquidity and broad-based investor deleveraging. 

Net revenues in Equities were $9.21&#160;billion for the year, 19% lower than a
particularly strong 2007, reflecting losses in principal strategies, partially
offset by higher net revenues in the client franchise businesses. Commissions
were particularly strong and were higher than 2007. During 2008, Equities
operated in an environment characterized by a significant decline in global
equity prices, broad-based investor deleveraging and very high levels of
volatility, particularly in the second half of the year. 

Principal Investments recorded a net loss of $3.86&#160;billion for 2008. These
results included net losses of $2.53&#160;billion from corporate principal
investments and $949&#160;million from real estate principal investments, as well as
a $446&#160;million loss related to the firm&#8217;s investment in the ordinary shares of
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC). 

Fourth Quarter

Trading and Principal Investments recorded negative net revenues of
$4.36&#160;billion, compared with net revenues of $6.93&#160;billion for the fourth
quarter of 2007 and $2.70&#160;billion for the third quarter of 2008. 

FICC recorded negative net revenues of $3.40&#160;billion compared with net revenues
of $3.30&#160;billion for the fourth quarter of 2007. The negative net revenues for
FICC in the quarter were due to losses from investments, including corporate
debt and private and public equities, and trading in credit products. These
results were adversely impacted by unprecedented weakness across the broader
credit markets, reflecting broad-based declines in asset values, substantially
reduced levels of liquidity and dislocation between prices for cash instruments
and the related derivative contracts and between credit indices and the
underlying single names. Credit products also included a loss of approximately
$1.3&#160;billion ($1&#160;billion, net of hedges) related to non-investment-grade credit
origination activities and mortgages included a net loss of approximately $700
million on commercial mortgage loans and securities. Net revenues in commodities
and currencies were solid, but lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2007.
Interest rate products had strong results, which were significantly higher
compared with the fourth quarter of 2007. 

Net revenues in Equities were $2.64&#160;billion, 2% higher than the fourth quarter
of 2007, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in derivatives,
partially offset by losses in principal strategies. Commissions were
particularly strong and were higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2007.
During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by a
significant decline in global equity prices, a significant increase in
volatility levels and generally strong client-driven activity. 

Principal Investments recorded a net loss of $3.60&#160;billion for the fourth
quarter of 2008. These results included net losses of $2.00&#160;billion from
corporate principal investments and $961&#160;million from real estate principal
investments, as well as a $631&#160;million loss related to the firm&#8217;s investment in
the ordinary shares of ICBC. 

Asset Management and Securities Services

Full Year

Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $7.97&#160;billion for
the year, 11% higher than 2007. 

Asset Management net revenues were $4.55 billion for the year, 1% higher than
2007. During the year, assets under management decreased $89&#160;billion to
$779&#160;billion, due to $123&#160;billion of market depreciation, primarily in equity
assets, partially offset by $34&#160;billion of net inflows. Net inflows reflected
inflows in money market, fixed income and alternative investment assets,
partially offset by outflows in equity assets. 

Securities Services net revenues were $3.42&#160;billion for the year, 26% higher
than 2007, reflecting the impact of changes in the composition of securities
lending customer balances, as well as higher total average customer balances. 

Fourth Quarter

Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.74&#160;billion, 5%
lower than the fourth quarter of 2007 and 15% lower than the third quarter of
2008. 

Asset Management net revenues were $945&#160;million, 19% lower than the fourth
quarter of 2007, primarily due to lower management and other fees, principally
due to market depreciation and net outflows in equity assets. During the
quarter, assets under management decreased $84&#160;billion to $779&#160;billion, due to
$90&#160;billion of market depreciation, primarily in equity assets, partially offset
by $6 billion of net inflows. Net inflows reflected inflows in money market and
alternative investment assets, partially offset by outflows in equity and fixed
income assets. 

Securities Services net revenues were $799&#160;million, 19% higher than the fourth
quarter of 2007. The increase in net revenues reflected&#160;the impact of changes in
the composition of securities lending customer balances, partially offset by the
impact of lower total average customer balances. 

Expenses

Operating expenses were $19.89&#160;billion for 2008, 30% lower than 2007. 

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits)
were $10.93&#160;billion for 2008, 46% lower than 2007, reflecting lower levels of
discretionary compensation due to lower net revenues. The ratio of compensation
and benefits (excluding severance costs of approximately $275&#160;million in the
fourth quarter of 2008) to net revenues was 48.0% for 2008. The ratio of
compensation and benefits to net revenues was 43.9% for 2007. Employment levels
decreased 1% compared with the end of 2007, reflecting an 8% decrease during the
fourth quarter. 

Non-Compensation Expenses

Full Year

Non-compensation expenses were $8.95&#160;billion for 2008, 9% higher than 2007.
Excluding consolidated entities held for investment purposes&#160;(5),
non-compensation expenses were 5% higher than 2007. The majority of this
increase was attributable to higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and
distribution fees, principally reflecting higher activity levels in Equities and
FICC. 

Fourth Quarter

Non-compensation expenses were $2.51&#160;billion, 4% higher than the fourth quarter
of 2007 and 15% higher than the third quarter of 2008. Excluding consolidated
entities held for investment purposes&#160;(5), non-compensation expenses were 4%
lower than the fourth quarter of 2007 and 9% higher than the third quarter of
2008. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2007 was due to lower
occupancy and market development expenses. The decrease in occupancy expenses
was attributable to exit costs incurred during the fourth quarter of 2007
related to the firm&#8217;s office space. The decrease in market development expenses
primarily reflected lower levels of business activity during the fourth quarter
of 2008. 

Provision for Taxes

The effective income tax rate was approximately 1% for 2008, down from 25.1% for
the first nine months of 2008 and down from 34.1% for fiscal year 2007. The
decreases in the effective income tax rate were primarily due to an increase in
permanent benefits as a percentage of lower earnings and changes in geographic
earnings mix. 

Capital

As of November&#160;28,&#160;2008, total capital was $232.59&#160;billion, consisting of
$64.37&#160;billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity (common shareholders&#8217; equity of
$47.90&#160;billion and preferred stock of $16.47&#160;billion) and $168.22&#160;billion in
unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $98.68, an
increase of 9% compared with the end of 2007 and essentially unchanged from the
end of the third quarter of 2008. Tangible book value per common share&#160;(1) was
$88.00, an increase of 12% compared with the end of 2007 and essentially
unchanged from the end of the third quarter of 2008. Book value and tangible
book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding, including
restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements,
of 485.4&#160;million at period end. 

On September&#160;29,&#160;2008, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.) completed a
public offering of 46.7 million common shares at $123.00 per share for proceeds
of $5.75&#160;billion. 

On October&#160;1,&#160;2008, Group Inc. issued to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and certain
affiliates 50,000 shares of 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series&#160;G
(Series&#160;G Preferred Stock), and a five-year warrant to purchase 43.5&#160;million
common shares at an exercise price of $115.00 per share, for aggregate proceeds
of $5.00&#160;billion. 

On October&#160;28,&#160;2008, under the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s TARP Capital Purchase Program,
Group Inc. issued to the U.S. Treasury 10.0&#160;million shares of Fixed Rate
Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series&#160;H (Series&#160;H Preferred Stock), and a
ten-year warrant to purchase 12.2&#160;million common shares at an exercise price of
$122.90 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $10.00&#160;billion. Cumulative
dividends on the Series&#160;H Preferred Stock are payable at a rate of 5% annually
through November&#160;15,&#160;2013 and at a rate of 9% annually thereafter. 

The firm repurchased 10.5&#160;million shares of its common stock during 2008 at an
average cost per share of $193.18, for a total cost of $2.04&#160;billion. The
remaining share authorization under the firm&#8217;s existing share repurchase program
is 60.9&#160;million shares. 

The firm&#8217;s Tier 1 Ratio&#160;(3) was 15.6% as of November&#160;28,&#160;2008. 

Other Balance Sheet and Liquidity Metrics

* Total assets&#160;(6) were $885&#160;billion as of November&#160;28,&#160;2008, down 18% from
August&#160;29,&#160;2008. 
* Level 3 assets&#160;(7) were approximately $66&#160;billion as of November&#160;28,&#160;2008
(down from $68&#160;billion as of August&#160;29,&#160;2008) and represented 7.5% of total
assets. 
* Average global core excess&#160;(8) liquidity was $111.43&#160;billion for the fourth
quarter of 2008 and $96.73&#160;billion for the year ended November&#160;28,&#160;2008.

Dividends and Other Matters

The Board of Directors of Group Inc. (the Board) approved a change in the firm&#8217;s
fiscal year end from the last Friday of November to the last Friday of December.
The change is effective for the firm's 2009 fiscal year. 

The Board declared a dividend of $0.4666666 per common share to be paid on
March&#160;26,&#160;2009 to common shareholders of record on February&#160;24,&#160;2009. The
dividend of $0.4666666 per common share is reflective of a four month period
(December&#160;2008 through March&#160;2009), due to the change in the firm&#8217;s fiscal year
end. The Board also declared dividends of $239.58, $387.50, $255.56 and $255.56
per share of Series&#160;A Preferred Stock, Series&#160;B Preferred Stock, Series&#160;C
Preferred Stock and Series&#160;D Preferred Stock, respectively (represented by
depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of
preferred stock), to be paid on February&#160;10,&#160;2009 to preferred shareholders of
record on January&#160;26,&#160;2009. In addition, the Board declared dividends of $2,500
per share of Series&#160;G Preferred Stock to be paid on February&#160;10,&#160;2009 to

$14.8611111 per share of Series&#160;H Preferred Stock to be paid on
February&#160;17,&#160;2009 to preferred shareholders of record on January&#160;31,&#160;2009.

firm&#8217;s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially,
from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these
forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important
factors that could affect the firm&#8217;s future results and financial condition, see

Certain of the information regarding the firm&#8217;s Tier 1 Ratio, total assets,
level 3 assets and global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary
estimates; these estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to
change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its annual financial
statements. 

Statements about the firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog also may
constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk
that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be
completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually
earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those
currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the
terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case
of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general
economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities
markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the
securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the
securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse
development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a
required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that
could adversely affect the firm&#8217;s investment banking transactions, see &#8220;Risk
Factors&#8221; in Part&#160;I, Item&#160;1A of the firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form&#160;10-K for the

&lt;p&gt;FAIRFAX, Virginie--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Refining &amp; Supply a annonc&#233; aujourd&#8217;hui que la soci&#233;t&#233; allait
investir plus d&#8217;un milliard USD dans trois raffineries pour accro&#238;tre
l&#8217;approvisionnement en diesel br&#251;lant avec une r&#233;duction des &#233;missions de plus
de vingt-deux millions de litres par jour. La soci&#233;t&#233; va construire de nouvelles
unit&#233;s et modifier les installations en place au niveau de ses raffineries de
B&#226;ton-Rouge en Louisiane, de Baytown au Texas et d&#8217;Anvers en Belgique. 

&#171;&#160;Ceci souligne la volont&#233; permanente de la soci&#233;t&#233; de r&#233;pondre aux besoins
croissants du march&#233;, tout en fournissant en m&#234;me temps des combustibles plus
propres aux consommateurs. L&#8217;augmentation de notre production de diesel sur ces
trois sites &#233;quivaudra au diesel produit dans quatre raffineries de taille
moyenne&#160;&#187;, a indiqu&#233; Sherman Glass, pr&#233;sident de Refining &amp; Supply. &#171;&#160;Alli&#233; &#224;
des moteurs plus propres et aux toutes derni&#232;res technologies de contr&#244;le des
&#233;missions, ce diesel &#224; faible teneur en soufre r&#233;duit les &#233;missions dans le
secteur des transports routiers comme dans les secteurs industriels non
routiers.&#160;&#187; 

Cet investissement constitue la phase la plus r&#233;cente des efforts d&#8217;ExxonMobil
pour accro&#238;tre les approvisionnements et r&#233;duire la teneur en soufre de
l&#8217;essence et du diesel pour moteurs. En 2000, la soci&#233;t&#233; a mis en place une
approche int&#233;gr&#233;e pour convertir et modifier les raffineries, les terminaux et

&lt;p&gt;Dec 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Baidu.com Inc
(BIDU.O) to "conviction buy" from "neutral" and said the top
Chinese Internet search company was set to benefit from the
growth in paid search in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Search spending is expected to climb at about 30 percent
annually for several years and Baidu is expected to maintain
query share with government help and consumer loyalty, the
brokerage said in a note dated Dec. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This will result in revenue and earnings per share growth
of 30 percent per year for the company, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paid search will outgrow China's gross domestic product
helped by current low penetration, rising query volumes on
increasing broadband penetration and secular demand from
consumer-facing companies, Goldman Sachs forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it expected concerns that the Chinese
government had targeted Baidu for punishment would diminish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We doubt the government seeks to disadvantage Baidu to the
extent it loses substantial query share to foreign rivals,"
Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage has a 6-month price target of $145 on Baidu
stock. Baidu shares closed at $118.09 on Monday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;ISTANBUL Dec 16 (Reuters) - Turkish markets inched up on
Tuesday, bolstered by gains for European stocks and hopes of an
IMF deal for the country as investors looked to quarterly
results from embattled U.S. bank Goldman Sachs for direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The main Istanbul share index .XU100 gained 0.83 percent
to 25,811 points in first session trade, slightly outperforming
the MSCI index of emerging markets that was trading 0.55 percent
higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Turkish markets have been quite strong for the past two
weeks owing to the fact that there might be an IMF stand-by
agreement and volatility in global markets has subsided
somewhat," said Erkan Savran, head of research at Ak Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index rose by 2.65 percent on Monday, but it has fallen
nearly 50 percent since the beginning of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were expecting a slightly negative opening in the
markets today, but what will define our direction for the second
session will be the news from the U.S. on Goldman Sachs net
profit," said Savran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, the largest surviving investment bank, is
expected to report a quarterly loss of as much as $2.5 billion,
hit by the falling value of many of its investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News on a pending deal between Ankara and the International
Monetary Fund has shored up Turkish markets as the country faces
a large financing shortfall in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Treasury said on Monday "significant progress" was
achieved in the technical studies aimed at devising a new IMF
programme and the Fund said a mission would visit Turkey in
early January for loan talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turkish business leaders and investors have for months been
calling for a loan accord with the fund to boost the Turkish
economy, which has slowed sharply this year while its markets
have been battered by fallout from the global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lira IYIX= was trading at 1.5660 against the dollar on
the interbank market agianst the Monday close of 1.5675.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Markets showed little reaction to comments from the Turkish
central bank governor on its monetary policy outlook for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank will trim the range between its lending and
borrowing rates if liquidity tightness lasts, Governor Durmus
Yilmaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said on Tuesday the central bank could lend to banks
in the event of uncertainty in the banking system and capital
flight and that the bank could hold 91-day repo auctions if
liquidity dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yield on the June 23, 2010 benchmark bond
0#TRTSYSUM=IS rose to 18.56 percent from the previous day's
close of 18.40 percent.

&lt;p&gt;FAIRFAX, Virginia--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Refining &amp; Supply hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass es mehr als 1
Milliarde US-Dollar in drei Raffinerien investieren wird, um die Versorgung mit
sauber verbrennendem Diesel um ungef&#228;hr 24 Millionen Liter pro Tag zu
verbessern. Das Unternehmen wird an den Raffineriestandorten Baton
Rouge/Louisiana, Baytown/Texas und Antwerpen neue Einheiten errichten sowie
bestehende modifizieren. 

&#8222;Dies unterstreicht das anhaltende Engagement des Unternehmens, den wachsenden
Bedarf des Marktes zu decken und gleichzeitig dem Verbraucher sauberer
verbrennendes Diesel zur Verf&#252;gung zu stellen. Die Steigerung unserer
Dieselproduktion in diesen drei Einrichtungen entspricht dem Diesel, das in
ungef&#228;hr vier Raffinerien durchschnittlicher Gr&#246;&#223;e produziert wird", sagte
Sherman Glass, Pr&#228;sident f&#252;r Refining &amp; Supply. &#8222;Zusammen mit Motoren, die
sauberer verbrennen und den neuesten Kontrolltechnologien f&#252;r Fahrzeugemissionen
reduziert dieser Diesel mit niedrigem Schwefelgehalt Emissionen sowohl auf der
Stra&#223;e wie auch in Off-Road-Industrien.&#8220; 

Diese Investition stellt die letzte Phase bei den Anstrengungen von ExxonMobil
dar, bei Benzin und Diesel die Versorgung zu verbessern und den Schwefelgehalt
zu senken. Im Jahre 2000 startete das Unternehmen einen integrierten Ansatz,
Raffinerien, Terminals und Pipelines umzur&#252;sten und zu modifizieren, um
Kraftstoffe mit extrem niedrigem Schwefelgehalt anbieten zu k&#246;nnen. 

Die Umr&#252;stungen und Vergr&#246;&#223;erungen sollen 2010 abgeschlossen sein. Die
Produktion von Diesel mit einem Schwefelgehalt von 15 ppm (Parts Per Million)
oder weniger wird gesteigert.

&lt;p&gt;FAIRFAX, Va.--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Refining &amp; Supply today announced it will invest more than $1 billion
in three refineries to increase the supply of cleaner burning diesel by about
six million gallons per day. The company will construct new units and modify
existing facilities at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Baytown, Texas; and Antwerp,
Belgium, refineries. 

&#8220;This underscores the company's ongoing commitment to meeting the growing needs
of the marketplace, while, at the same time, providing cleaner burning fuels to
consumers. Our increase in diesel production at these three sites will be equal
tothe diesel produced from about four average-size refineries,&#8221; said Sherman
Glass, President, Refining &amp; Supply. &#8220;In combination with cleaner-burning
engines and the latest vehicle emissions control technologies, this low sulfur
diesel reduces emissions in both on-road transportation, and off-road industrial
sectors.&#8221; 

This investment is the latest phase in ExxonMobil's efforts to increase supplies
and reduce the sulfur content of both motor gasoline and diesel. In 2000, the
company began an integrated approach to convert and modify refineries, terminals
and pipelines to provide ultra low sulfur fuel products. 

By 2010, the refineries&#8217; modifications and expansions are expected to be
completed, increasing production of diesel with sulfur levels of 15 parts per
million (ppm) or less.

&lt;p&gt;  MALVERN, PA and NEW YORK, NY, Dec 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AUXL) and Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:
PFE) announced today that they have entered into a strategic alliance for
the development, commercialization and supply of XIAFLEX(TM) (clostridial
collagenase for injection), a novel, first-in-class, late-stage biologic,
for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease.
Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will receive exclusive rights to
commercialize XIAFLEX in the 27 member countries of the European Union
(EU) and 19 other European and Eurasian countries. In addition, Pfizer
will be primarily responsible for regulatory activities for XIAFLEX in
these countries.

    Auxilium has completed Phase III trials for XIAFLEX in Dupuytren's
contracture and expects to file a U.S. biologics license application (BLA)
for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in early 2009. Pfizer expects to file XIAFLEX for approval
for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture in Europe in 2010. XIAFLEX is
also being evaluated in a Phase IIb trial for Peyronie's disease with top
line data expected in late 2009.

    "Today, Pfizer and Auxilium have forged a compelling partnership and
together we believe we have the opportunity to offer the first, effective
non-surgical treatment for two diseases," said Armando Anido, Chief
Executive Officer and President of Auxilium. "With the strength of
Pfizer's commercialization and development organization, this
relationship greatly enhances our ability to effectively introduce this
potentially groundbreaking technology for the treatment of Dupuytren's
contracture and Peyronie's disease in Europe."

    Under the agreement, Pfizer will make an up-front payment of $75 million
to Auxilium and up to $410 million in potential milestone payments, with
$150 million tied to regulatory milestones and $260 million based on sales
milestones. Auxilium will receive increasing tiered royalties based on
sales of XIAFLEX in Pfizer's territories.

    "Our partnership with Auxilium is a testament to Pfizer's commitment to
draw on the best external science for innovative products that complement
our existing portfolio and fill unmet medical needs," said Olivier
Brandicourt, President and General Manager of Pfizer's Specialty Care
Business Unit. "We look forward to combining our strengths to further the
potential for XIAFLEX as an advanced new treatment for patients suffering
from Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease."

    Auxilium will remain primarily responsible for the global development of
XIAFLEX and will be responsible for all clinical and commercial drug
manufacturing and supply. Pfizer will share clinical development costs for
certain trials required for the EU and be responsible for all
discretionary development within the countries for which it has exclusive
rights to commercialize XIAFLEX. Pfizer will have a right of negotiation
to obtain exclusive rights to commercialize XIAFLEX pipeline indications
in its territories.

    Conference Call

    Auxilium will hold a conference call tomorrow, December 18, 2008 at 8:00
a.m. EST, to discuss the partnership. The conference call will be
simultaneously web cast on Auxilium's web site and archived for future
review until January 18, 2009.

About XIAFLEX

    XIAFLEX (clostridial collagenase for injection) is an investigational new
drug that has completed phase III clinical trials for the treatment of
Dupuytren's contracture, is in Phase IIb of development for the treatment
of Peyronie's disease and is in Phase II of development for the treatment
of Frozen Shoulder syndrome (Adhesive Capsulitis). As an investigational
non-surgical treatment for these conditions, XIAFLEX is a combination of
several subtypes of collagenase, derived from clostridium histolyticum, in
specific proportion. Together, they work synergistically to break the
bonds of the triple helix collagen structure more effectively than human
collagenase.

    About Dupuytren's Contracture

    Dupuytren's contracture is a condition that affects the connective tissue
that lies beneath the skin in the palm. The disease is progressive in
nature. Typically, nodules develop in the palm as collagen deposits
accumulate. As the disease progresses, the collagen deposits form a cord
that stretches from the palm of the hand to the base of the finger. Once
this cord develops, the patient's fingers contract and the function of the
hand is impaired. Currently, surgery is the only effective treatment. The
incidence of Dupuytren's contracture is highest in Caucasians,
historically those of Northern European descent, with a global prevalence
of three to six percent of the Caucasian population.(1) Most cases of
Dupuytren's contracture occur in patients older than 50 years.(2)

    The most frequently affected parts of the hand associated with Dupuytren's
contracture are the joints called the Metacarpal-Phalangeal Joint, or MP
joint, which is the joint closest to the palm of the hand and the Proximal
Intra-Phalangeal Joint, or the PIP joint, which is the middle joint in the
finger. The little finger and ring finger are most frequently involved.
There are currently no drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for Dupuytren's contracture, which is treated primarily by
an open surgical procedure.

    About Peyronie's Disease

    Peyronie's disease is the development of collagen plaque, or scar tissue,
on the shaft of the penis that hardens and reduces flexibility, thus
causing pain and forcing the penis to bend or arc during erection. This
often can prevent sexual intercourse. In addition to difficulty with
sexual intercourse, Peyronie's disease may also be associated with
emotional distress, loss of self-esteem and depression. In certain
populations, the estimated number of men affected by Peyronie's Disease
may be as high as 9 percent in men over 60 years of age and 3 percent in
men over 30.(3)

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil will pay nearly $6.1 million in civil penalties for violations of a court-approved Clean Air Act agreement, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA said Exxon failed to monitor the sulfur content in some fuel gas streams burned in refinery furnaces, breaching a 2005 settlement between the oil company and federal regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said in a statement that the company discovered some fuel gas streams that had not been addressed in the settlement while conducting an environmental self audit in November 2006 at its Baytown, Texas, refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said it reported these findings to the EPA, and that all streams now meet EPA standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the original agreement, Exxon was already required to pay a $7.7 million civil penalty, $6.7 million in environmental projects in areas surrounding the company's refineries and to install pollution controls at six U.S. refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 2005 settlement has already resulted in major reductions in air emissions from the company's refineries, but we need full compliance to realize all the benefits of the settlement," said Granta Nakayama, assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three other Exxon refineries with EPA violations associated with the fine are located in Beaumont, Texas, Torrance, California, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ayesha Rascoe; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt Disney Company's (Disney)
proposed senior unsecured note offering. 

Disney's ratings and Stable Outlook continue to reflect the company's leading
market positions in core businesses, unique brand franchises, strong cash flows,
and significant financial flexibility. Disney has benefited from strong
multi-year performance at its cable networks which has resulted in significant
increases in stable, incrementally high-margin carriage fees. In addition,
Disney continues to successfully leverage its hit-driven brands across multiple
platforms. Credit concerns center on the cyclical volatility of its theme parks
and resorts, studio and broadcast network businesses. The stresses required to
impair the company's financial flexibility are consistent with an 'A' rating,
and Fitch believes that even in the midst of a difficult economy, potential
rating pressure is less likely to be driven by operating performance than by
discretionary actions on the part of management. 

The cyclical challenges facing the media &amp; entertainment industry relate to both
the existing weak macro-economic environment, as well as the general volatility
that accompanies hit-driven businesses. Fitch believes that Disney is less
exposed to some of the advertising-based cyclical challenges facing other Media
&amp; Entertainment companies given its small reliance on local advertising. While
the current macro-economic environment could put pressure on the Parks and
Resorts segment, Fitch believes the company's focus on its lower cost value
packages and efforts to cross collaborate and implement best practices rather
than operating the parks as standalone businesses could make a downturn less
severe than historical periods. 

While results have been resilient thus far, the segment's revenues are generally
tied to the health of the macro-economy and its profits can swing widely (2 to 3
times the changes in revenue) due to the significant operating leverage in the
business. Fitch believes that in a downside case the parks business could
experience 10%-15% declines in attendance, modest pricing pressure and reduction
in per-capita guest spending, and a more than 20% reduction in segment EBITDA.
This scenario still results in significant segment cash flows and would not
impair the company's overall credit quality.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from Exxon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Dec 17 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) will pay
nearly $6.1 million in civil penalties for violations of a
court-approved Clean Air Act agreement, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and Justice Department said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EPA said Exxon failed to monitor the sulfur content in
some fuel gas streams burned in refinery furnaces, breaching a
2005 settlement between the oil company and federal
regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said in a statement that the company discovered some
fuel gas streams that had not been addressed in the settlement
while conducting an environmental self audit in November 2006
at its Baytown, Texas, refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said it reported these findings to the EPA, and that
all streams now meet EPA standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the original agreement, Exxon was already required to
pay a $7.7 million civil penalty, $6.7 million in environmental
projects in areas surrounding the company's refineries and to
install pollution controls at six U.S. refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The 2005 settlement has already resulted in major
reductions in air emissions from the company's refineries, but
we need full compliance to realize all the benefits of the
settlement," said Granta Nakayama, assistant administrator for
EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three other Exxon refineries with EPA violations associated
with the fine are located in Beaumont, Texas, Torrance,
California, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

&lt;p&gt;The First TRUVIA&#8482; Naturally Sweetened Reduced-Calorie Sparkling Beverage In The
U.S.
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola North America (CCNA) today announced the 2008 launch of the first
sparkling naturally sweetened, reduced-calorie beverage in the U.S. made with
TRUVIA&#8482; natural sweetener. Sprite Green&#8482;, the new reduced-calorie Sprite line
extension, is the first of what the Company expects will be many new, naturally
sweetened, reduced, low and zero-calorie beverages sweetened with TRUVIA natural
sweetener in the future. 

Developed jointly by Cargill and The Coca-Cola Company, TRUVIA natural sweetener
is a great-tasting, zero-calorie natural sweetener using rebiana, which comes
from the best-tasting part of the stevia leaf. Harvested at the peak of
sweetness, stevia leaves are dried and steeped in water, much like tea. This
extract is then further refined and purified. The finished product is the pure,
natural sweetness of rebiana. 

Sprite Green is naturally sweetened with TRUVIA brand sweetener and has 50
calories per 8.5-ounce serving and 5% lemon juice. Sprite Green was created to
appeal to active young adults and will be launched in two U.S. cities this month
in distinctive 8.5-ounce aluminum bottles. Initial availability will be limited
to teen and young adult-oriented locations and events with a broader rollout
planned for early 2009. Sprite Green complements the Sprite brand&#8217;s leading
lemon-lime and zero-calorie lemon-lime sparkling beverages. 

&#8220;The Sprite brand has a rich history of setting trends and breaking new ground
in sparkling beverages, and we think consumers will be excited to try Sprite
Green,&#8221; said Santiago Blanco, vice president, Sprite and Flavors, Coca-Cola
North America. &#8220;Sprite Green with TRUVIA natural sweetener is a significant step
for CCNA in our ongoing efforts to apply the latest breakthrough innovations to
our expanding array of beverages.&#8221;

TRUVIA natural sweetener was developed jointly by Cargill and The Coca-Cola
Company. To demonstrate rebiana&#8217;s safety, the companies undertook an extensive
research program, the findings of which have been published in peer-reviewed
scientific journals and presented to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). In addition, details on the safety assessment conducted on rebiana have
been discussed at several national and international scientific meetings by
various organizations and recognized experts. The FDA has issued a letter of no
objection to Cargill indicating that the agency, on the basis of the scientific
data provided by Cargill, as well as other information available to the agency,
has no questions regarding the conclusion that Rebiana is GRAS under the
intended conditions of use.

&lt;p&gt;FAIRFAX, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today confirmed that it has entered into an
agreement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to resolve certain stipulated penalties alleged to be due under the
New Source Review Consent Decree signed in December, 2005. This agreement
requires payment of approximately $6 million in penalties, most of which are
associated with alleged non-compliances with New Source Performance Standards
Subpart J (NSPS J) on three heaters at the Baytown Refinery. 

ExxonMobil's Baytown Refinery had conducted a comprehensive review of the
Baytown fuel gas system in late 2004/early 2005. It was believed that all fuel
gas streams and associated combustion devices subject to NSPS J had been
identified and addressed in the Consent Decree agreement. 

However, while performing an environmental self-audit in November 2006 Baytown
Refinery became aware that a small number of streams (potentially subject to
NSPS J requirements) had not been specifically addressed in the Consent Decree.
Environmental impacts associated with this item were very minor and all streams
now meet the NSPS J standard. ExxonMobil proactively self-reported this finding
to the EPA. 

The agreement also included penalties for several minor items at the Baton
Rouge, Beaumont and Torrance refineries. 

ExxonMobil and its affiliates work hard to meet all environmental regulatory
requirements and to comply with the Consent Decree. We have long been an
industry leader in advancing pollution control technologies and hold many
patents in this field. We live and work in the communities where we operate and
we will continue to have strong commitments toward improving air quality and
maintaining high standards of environmental performance.

&lt;p&gt;Globalisierung einer einst regionalen Energiequelle durch technologische
Fortschritte
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Das f&#252;hrende Technologieunternehmen f&#252;r Fl&#252;ssigerdgas (Liquefied Natural Gas -
LNG), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), hat einen industriellen Durchbruch
hinsichtlich der Konstruktion und Gr&#246;&#223;e von Tankern erzielt, durch den ein
effizienterer Transport von Erdgas zu den M&#228;rkten in aller Welt m&#246;glich wird.
Die k&#252;rzliche Fertigstellung des weltweit ersten Q-Max-LNG-Tankers mit dem Namen
&#8218;Mozah&#8217; stellt einen bedeutenden Schritt f&#252;r die Bef&#246;rderung von Fl&#252;ssigerdgas
dar, da mit diesem Transportkosten gesenkt werden k&#246;nnen, w&#228;hrend zugleich die
Energieeffizienz verbessert wird und Emissionen reduziert werden. Die
innovativen Q-Max-Schiffe bef&#246;rdern bis zu 80 Prozent mehr Ladung, aber
ben&#246;tigen dank der Gr&#246;&#223;envorteile und Leistungsf&#228;higkeit der Motoren ungef&#228;hr 40
Prozent weniger Energie pro Ladeeinheit als herk&#246;mmliche LNG-Tanker. 

&#8222;Die Q-Max-Tanker &#252;bertreffen die bisherigen LNG-Transportformen in fast jeder
Hinsicht&#8220;, erkl&#228;rt Neil Duffin, Pr&#228;sident der ExxonMobil Development Company.
&#8222;Das gleiche Technologiepotenzial, das uns dazu angetrieben hat, eine neue
Klasse von LNG-Tankern zu entwickeln, f&#246;rdert auch die Innovation hinsichtlich
aller Aspekte der LNG-Wertsch&#246;pfungskette.&#8220; 

Zu den Technologien f&#252;r gro&#223;e LNG-Schiffe, die in Verbindung mit dem
Joint-Venture-Partner Qatar Petroleum entwickelt wurden, geh&#246;ren zahlreiche
industrielle Durchbr&#252;che und bedeutende Verbesserungen, darunter gr&#246;&#223;ere
Schiffskonstruktionen, Bordanlagen f&#252;r eine Wiederverfl&#252;ssigung, langsam
laufende Dieselmotoren, Doppelschiffsschrauben und -ruder, die gr&#246;&#223;ten je
gebauten LNG-Bordtanks, die neusten Antifouling-Schutzsysteme f&#252;r den
Schiffsrumpf und optimierte Brandschutzsysteme. Das Endergebnis dieser Schiffe
der neuen Generation ist eine Senkung der Transportkosten um 20-30 Prozent. 

&#8222;Qatar Petroleum und ExxonMobil haben gro&#223;en technischen Aufwand betrieben, um
diese bahnbrechenden Verbesserungen in der LNG-Transportbranche zu erm&#246;glichen&#8220;,
erl&#228;utert Faisal Al Suwaidi, CEO von Qatargas. &#8222;Der Transport ist ein
entscheidender Aspekt in der LNG-Wertsch&#246;pfungskette, die sich von Qatars North
Field, dem gr&#246;&#223;ten Erdgasfeld der Welt mit abbaubaren Ressourcen von &#252;ber 25
Billionen Kubikmeter, bis hin zu den Haushalten in Asien, Europa und Amerika
erstreckt. Mittels unserer innovativen Technologie haben wir das LNG-Gesch&#228;ft
erfolgreich ver&#228;ndert und gr&#246;&#223;ere Teile der Welt f&#252;r Fl&#252;ssigerdgas aus Qatar
zug&#228;nglich gemacht&#8220;, erkl&#228;rt Faisal Al Suwaidi. Qatar Petroleum und ExxonMobil
sind Gesellschafter im Joint-Venture &#8218;Qatargas&#8217;, das den Mozah-Tanker und f&#252;nf
andere Q-Max-Transporter chartern wird, um Fl&#252;ssigerdgas von neuen
Verfl&#252;ssigungsz&#252;gen in Qatar zu liefern. 

Seit &#252;ber 30 Jahren hat sich die Gr&#246;&#223;e von LNG-Schiffen mit einer Kapazit&#228;t von
ungef&#228;hr 140.000 Kubikmetern so gut wie nicht ver&#228;ndert. Die Schiffsbetreiber,
Hydrodynamiker, Schiffsbauer und Konstruktionsingenieure von Qatar Petroleum und
ExxonMobil haben eng zusammengearbeitet, um die Konstruktionen von gr&#246;&#223;eren
Q-Max-Ladetanks zu entwickeln und gr&#252;ndlich zu testen. Es wurden umfassende
Auswertungen zum Ladungsschwall (Cargo Sloshing) durchgef&#252;hrt, um nachzuweisen,
dass die gr&#246;&#223;eren Systeme machbar und verl&#228;sslich sind. Die daraufhin
entwickelten Q-Max-Transporter sind l&#228;nger als drei Fu&#223;ballfelder, erstrecken
sich vom Kiel bis zum Masttop &#252;ber 20 Stockwerke und sind mit den gr&#246;&#223;ten durch
ein Membransystem gesch&#252;tzten Sicherheitstanks ausgestattet, die je gebaut
wurden. Mit einer Gesamtkapazit&#228;t von bis zu 266.000 Kubikmetern bef&#246;rdert jedes
Schiff genug Erdgas, um den Energiebedarf von 70.000 Haushalten in den USA f&#252;r
ein Jahr zu decken. 

Neben der Vergr&#246;&#223;erung des Schiffs wurde viel Aufwand betrieben, um die
Bordanlage zur Wiederverfl&#252;ssigung zu konstruieren, zu testen und zu
implementieren. Mit dieser Anlage wird Erdgas erneut verfl&#252;ssigt, das sich
w&#228;hrend der &#220;berfahrt in Dampf verwandelt hat. Auf diese Weise wird es als
Fl&#252;ssigkeit wieder in die Ladetanks gespritzt, anstatt es als verdampftes Gas
f&#252;r die Versorgung des Tankers selbst zu verwenden, sodass eine Lieferung von
fast 100 Prozent der Ladung m&#246;glich ist. Dies ist besonders vorteilhaft f&#252;r die
langen Schiffsfahrten von Qatar nach Europa und Amerika. Die Bordsysteme f&#252;r die
Wiederverfl&#252;ssigung haben es erm&#246;glicht, von Dampfkesseln und -turbinen f&#252;r den
Antrieb herk&#246;mmlicher LNG-Schiffe zu hocheffizienten langsam laufenden
Dieselmotoren zu wechseln. Die Q-Max-Schiffe sind mit zwei Dieselmotoren
ausgestattet, die die Doppelschiffsschrauben und -ruder antreiben. Dadurch
erhalten die Schiffe eine h&#246;here Energieeffizienz, sind zuverl&#228;ssiger und besser
man&#246;vrierf&#228;hig und ihr Kraftstoffverbrauch wird bis zu einem Drittel gesenkt. 

Die Joint-Ventures von ExxonMobil in Qatar sind bei erfahrenen Kennern der
Branche als Wegbereiter hinsichtlich der Produktion von Fl&#252;ssigerdgas und der
technologischen Innovation bekannt und werden in den kommenden 18 Monaten
weitere Neuigkeiten vorstellen. ExxonMobil ist nicht nur der Wegbereiter f&#252;r die
gr&#246;&#223;ten Schiffe der Branche, die Fl&#252;ssigerdgas zu den M&#228;rkten transportieren,
sondern das Unternehmen setzt in Partnerschaft mit Qatar Petroleum auch eine
neue Technologie in Qatar ein, um vier der weltweit gr&#246;&#223;ten Produktionsanlagen
f&#252;r Fl&#252;ssigerdgas zu bauen und beteiligt sich an der Entwicklung von Pl&#228;nen f&#252;r
Terminals zur Wiedervergasung von LNG in Italien, Gro&#223;britannien und den USA.

holding of preferred shares in the electronics company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daiwa Securities SMBC Co and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp,
the two other big holdouts, have already agreed to accept the
offer, the Nikkei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three financial firms would hold 70 percent of Sanyo's
common stock following conversion of the preferred shares they
received in return for bailing out Sanyo in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal values Sanyo at about $9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panasonic's board will officially decide on Friday to
conduct a tender offer, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panasonic, formerly known as Matsushita Electric, had
initially offered to pay 120 yen per share. It raised the
figure to 130 yen in early December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Goldman Sachs, which is reported to have bought the
preferred shares for the equivalent of 70 yen each, had said
this price was still too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanyo shares closed at 143 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daiwa Securities SMBC is a joint venture between Daiwa
Securities Group Inc (8601.T) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc (SMFG) (8316.T). Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp is
Sanyo's main bank and part of SMFG.

&lt;p&gt;FREEPORT, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Landowner Jolly Bay LLC, a company dedicated to responsible and sustainable
growth for Walton County and its residents, has filed a notice of claim for
$3,350,000.00 against Walton County, Florida under Florida&#8217;s Bert J. Harris
Private Property Rights Protection Act. The Bert J. Harris Act provides for
monetary compensation, including attorneys' fees and costs, to private property
owners when changing County regulations diminish the value of private property.
The claim and two previously filed lawsuits against the County by Jolly Bay are
the result of the County's September 22, 2008 denial of its mixed use
development. 

"Jolly Bay was unfairly treated by the County and the Bert Harris Act was
adopted by the Legislature to give landowners like Jolly Bay a legal remedy,"
said Ronald Weaver of Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff &amp; Sitterson, P.A,
attorneys specializing in Bert Harris claims and land use litigation. "Dozens of
Florida governments are facing hundreds of millions of dollars of combined
claims for interfering illegally with property owners' legitimate rights.&#8221; 

Weaver explained that over a two-year period the landowners and County staff met
numerous times to discuss the design of the project and up until the point of
public opposition to the height of the proposed condominium, County staff
affirmed that the project and proposed condominium met all County requirements.
In reaction to the public opposition at a time when the County had no adopted
height limitation that could be lawfully applied to the project, Weaver further
explained, County staff made up and changed un-adopted rules and standards over
a year period as they delayed the project. Although the citizens&#8217; own Planning
Commission voted unanimously for the project, the Board of County Commissioners,
after an initial motion to approve the project, ultimately applied a made-up,
un-adopted height standard to deny the project. &#8220;My clients spent in good faith
over $625,000.00 on the application process based on the County staff&#8217;s repeated
affirmations and the clear lack of any applicable height limitation in the
adopted regulations,&#8221; said Weaver. 

&#8220;What is most troubling,&#8221; Weaver added, &#8220;is that Walton County&#8217;s action in
denying the project based on an un-adopted, subjective height standard is
directly contrary to the Circuit Court&#8217;s previous clear instructions to Walton
County in the 2001 Inlet Beach Capital case.&#8221; In the 2001 Inlet Beach Capital
case, the Circuit Court reversed the Walton County Board of County
Commissioners&#8217; denial of a project and told Walton County that it cannot base
the denial of projects on its own un-adopted subjective interpretations of its
land use regulations because landowners must have notice of the conditions that
they must meet in order to improve their property. 

Weaver further added that the County has 180 days to respond to the notice of
claim with a written settlement offer acceptable to the owners, or Jolly Bay LLC
will have no other choice but to go to the court system with a third lawsuit
against the County and seek over $3.35 million in damages, plus additional
attorneys' fees and costs. 

The Jolly Bay project is located 1/2 mile from the northeast 331 bridge landing
off Jolly Bay Road and included an upscale recreational vehicle park, a bed &amp;
breakfast, a 73-unit condominium, a boat docking facility and commercial spaces.
The plans had the project situated on 17 acres of a 60-acre tract of land in
order to preserve 43 acres of natural beauty, and to ensure the integrity of,
and compatibility with, the surrounding area.

&lt;p&gt;Avan&#231;os tecnol&#243;gicos resultam na globaliza&#231;&#227;o de um recurso energ&#233;tico antes
regional
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
A tecnologia l&#237;der da Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) em g&#225;s natural
liquefeito (GNL) resultou numa revolu&#231;&#227;o no setor, no projeto e tamanho dos
navios transportadores, dando maior efici&#234;ncia ao transporte de g&#225;s natural para
mercados de todo o mundo. A recente conclus&#227;o do primeiro navio transportador de
GNL Q-Max do mundo, denominado "Mozah", marca um avan&#231;o no embarque de GNL, com
redu&#231;&#227;o dos custos de transporte, melhoria da efici&#234;ncia energ&#233;tica e redu&#231;&#227;o de
emiss&#245;es. Os inovadores navios Q-Max levam at&#233; 80% mais carga, requerendo,
assim, 40% menos energia por unidade de carga que os transportadores de GNL
convencionais, em raz&#227;o da economia de escala e da efici&#234;ncia dos motores. 

&#8220;Os navios transportadores Q-Max modificam o modelo de embarque de GNL em quase
todos os aspectos&#8221;, disse Neil Duffin, presidente da ExxonMobil Development
Company. &#8220;A mesma capacidade tecnol&#243;gica que nos levou a desenvolver uma nova
classe de navios transportadores de GNL est&#225; conduzindo a inova&#231;&#227;o em todos os
aspectos da cadeia de valor do GNL.&#8221; 

As tecnologias de grandes navios de GNL, desenvolvidas em conjunto com a s&#243;cia
em joint-venture Qatar Petroleum, incluem v&#225;rios avan&#231;os revolucion&#225;rios para o
setor e melhorias significativas, como o aumento do tamanho dos navios, unidades
de reliquefa&#231;&#227;o a bordo, motores diesel de baixa velocidade, h&#233;lices e lemes
duplos, os maiores tanques GNL de navio j&#225; constru&#237;dos, os mais recentes e
melhores sistemas de anti-impurezas do casco e de prote&#231;&#227;o contra inc&#234;ndio.
Esses navios de nova gera&#231;&#227;o proporcionam uma redu&#231;&#227;o de 20% a 30% nos custos de
transporte. 

&#8220;A Qatar Petroleum, junto com a ExxonMobil, liderou um importante esfor&#231;o
t&#233;cnico para permitir essa revolucion&#225;ria melhoria no segmento de transporte de
GNL&#8221;, disse Faisal Al Suwaidi, diretor executivo da Qatargas. &#8220;O transporte &#233;
uma conex&#227;o cr&#237;tica na cadeia de valor do GNL, que se estende desde o Campo
Norte do Qatar, o maior campo de g&#225;s n&#227;o associado do mundo, com recursos
recuper&#225;veis de mais de 25 trilh&#245;es de metros c&#250;bicos, at&#233; lares da &#193;sia, Europa
e Am&#233;ricas. Com nossa tecnologia inovadora, transformamos efetivamente os
neg&#243;cios de GNL e abrimos ainda mais o mundo para a Qatar GNL&#8221;, disse Al
Suwaidi. A Qatar Petroleum e a ExxonMobil s&#227;o acionistas numa joint-venture da
Qatar, a Qatargas, que vai fretar o Mozah e cinco outros transportadores Q-Max
para fornecer GNL a partir de novos trens de liquefa&#231;&#227;o no Qatar. 

Por mais de trinta anos, o tamanho dos navios GNL permaneceu virtualmente
inalterado, com capacidade de cento e quarenta mil metros c&#250;bicos. Operadores de
navios, especialistas em hidrodin&#226;mica, arquitetos navais e engenheiros
estruturais da Qatar Petroleum e da ExxonMobil trabalharam em conjunto para
desenvolver e testar rigorosamente projetos de tanques de carga Q-Max maiores.
Foi feita uma avalia&#231;&#227;o abrangente do deslocamento de carga para comprovar que
os sistemas de maior porte s&#227;o vi&#225;veis e confi&#225;veis. Os transportadores Q-Max
que resultaram do processo t&#234;m comprimento superior tr&#234;s campos de futebol, com
torre de vinte andares da quilha ao topo do mastro e est&#227;o equipados com os
maiores tanques de conten&#231;&#227;o por membrana j&#225; constru&#237;dos. Com capacidade total
de at&#233; duzentos e sessenta e seis mil metros c&#250;bicos, cada navio carrega g&#225;s
natural em quantidade suficiente para atender &#224;s necessidades energ&#233;ticas de
setenta mil lares norte-americanos durante um ano. 

Al&#233;m do aumento do tamanho do navio, uma iniciativa importante foi tomada para
projetar, testar e implementar a unidade de reliquefa&#231;&#227;o a bordo, que reliquefaz
o g&#225;s natural vaporizado durante o transporte, reinjetando-o na forma de l&#237;quido
nos tanques de carga, em vez de us&#225;-lo como g&#225;s vaporizado no fornecimento de
energia para o pr&#243;prio navio-tanque. Isso permite a entrega de quase 100% da
carga e &#233; especialmente ben&#233;fico em viagens de longa dist&#226;ncia, do Qatar para a
Europa e as Am&#233;ricas. As instala&#231;&#245;es de reliquefa&#231;&#227;o a bordo criaram a
oportunidade de substituir as caldeiras de vapor e turbinas usadas para
propuls&#227;o dos navios de GNL convencionais por motores a diesel de baixa
velocidade altamente eficientes. Os navios Q-Max s&#227;o equipados com dois motores
diesel que impulsionam h&#233;lices e lemes duplos. Isso proporciona maior efici&#234;ncia
energ&#233;tica, navios mais confi&#225;veis e mais f&#225;ceis de manobrar, reduzindo o
consumo de combust&#237;vel em at&#233; um ter&#231;o. 

Reconhecidas por veteranos do setor como pioneiras na produ&#231;&#227;o de GNL e inova&#231;&#227;o
tecnol&#243;gica, as joint-ventures da ExxonMobil no Qatar ver&#227;o o advento de mais
produtos de primeira qualidade nos pr&#243;ximos dezoito meses. Al&#233;m de ser pioneira
na utiliza&#231;&#227;o dos maiores navios da ind&#250;stria para o transporte de GNL para o
mercado, a ExxonMobil, em parceria com a Qatar Petroleum, est&#225; utilizando no
Qatar uma nova tecnologia para construir quatro das maiores instala&#231;&#245;es de
produ&#231;&#227;o de GNL do mundo, al&#233;m de participar do desenvolvimento de projetos de
regaseifica&#231;&#227;o de terminais de GNL na It&#225;lia, no Reino Unido e nos Estados
Unidos.

&lt;p&gt;Los avances tecnol&#243;gicos globalizan un recurso energ&#233;tico otrora regional
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
El liderazgo tecnol&#243;gico de Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) en el campo del
gas natural licuado o GNL ha logrado un importante avance industrial en el
dise&#241;o y tama&#241;o de barcos metaneros, lo que permite que el transporte de gas
natural a los mercados de todo el mundo sea m&#225;s eficiente. La reciente
finalizaci&#243;n del primer barco de transporte de GNL Q-Max del mundo, bautizado
como &#8216;Mozah&#8217;, marca un hito en la industria dado que reduce los costos de
transporte y al mismo tiempo, mejora la eficiencia energ&#233;tica y disminuye las
emisiones al medio ambiente. Los innovadores barcos Q-Max pueden transportar
hasta un 80 por ciento m&#225;s de carga y precisan aproximadamente un 40 por ciento
menos de energ&#237;a por unidad de carga que los barcos transportadores de GNL
convencionales, debido a sus econom&#237;as de escala y a la eficiencia de sus
motores. 

&#8220;Los barcos transportadores Q-Max rompen el molde del transporte de GNL en
pr&#225;cticamente todos los sentidos&#8221;, coment&#243; Neil Duffin, presidente de ExxonMobil
Development Company. &#8220;La misma capacidad tecnol&#243;gica que nos llev&#243; a desarrollar
un nuevo tipo de barco de transporte de GNL es la que genera el esp&#237;ritu
innovador en todos los aspectos de la cadena de valor del GNL&#8221;. 

Las tecnolog&#237;as de los grandes barcos de GNL, desarrolladas con Qatar Petroleum,
su socio en este emprendimiento conjunto, comprenden numerosos avances de la
industria y significativos progresos, como por ejemplo el tama&#241;o de los barcos,
las unidades de relicuefacci&#243;n a bordo, los motores diesel de baja velocidad,
h&#233;lices y timones dobles, los tanques de GNL m&#225;s grandes jam&#225;s construidos a
bordo de barcos, lo &#250;ltimo en protecci&#243;n antichoque para el casco y avanzados
sistemas de protecci&#243;n contra incendios. El resultado final de esta nueva
generaci&#243;n de barcos consiste en una reducci&#243;n del 20 al 30 por ciento en el
costo del transporte. 

&#8220;Qatar Petroleum y ExxonMobil han realizado un esfuerzo t&#233;cnico de gran magnitud
para lograr este revolucionario avance en la industria del transporte de GNL&#8221;,
afirm&#243; el Sr. Faisal Al Suwaidi, director ejecutivo de Qatargas. &#8220;El transporte
constituye un eslab&#243;n cr&#237;tico en la cadena de valor del GNL que se extiende
desde el Yacimiento del Norte (North Field) de Qatar, el yacimiento de gas no
asociado m&#225;s grande del mundo, que posee recursos recuperables con m&#225;s de 900
billones de pies c&#250;bicos, hasta los hogares de Asia, Europa y el continente
americano&#8221;. Con nuestra innovadora tecnolog&#237;a, hemos transformado efectivamente
el negocio del GNL y logrado una mayor apertura mundial para el GNL de Qatar&#8221;,
sostuvo Al Suwaidi. Qatar Petroleum y ExxonMobil son accionistas de un
emprendimiento conjunto conocido como Qatargas, que arrendar&#225; al Mozah y a otros
cinco barcos Q-Max para suministrar GNL desde los trenes de licuefacci&#243;n de
Qatar. 

Con una capacidad cercana a 140.000 metros c&#250;bicos, el tama&#241;o de los barcos de
GNL ha sido pr&#225;cticamente el mismo por m&#225;s de 30 a&#241;os. Los operadores navales,
especialistas en hidrodin&#225;mica, arquitectos navales e ingenieros estructurales
de Qatar Petroleum y ExxonMobil han trabajado codo a codo para desarrollar y
probar rigurosamente los dise&#241;os de los tanques de carga de los barcos Q-Max,
que son m&#225;s grandes que los convencionales. Se efectuaron evaluaciones
exhaustivas del impacto del agua en la carga para verificar que estos sistemas
m&#225;s grandes fueran factibles y confiables. Los barcos de transporte Q-Max tienen
una longitud superior a tres canchas de f&#250;tbol, una altura de quilla a tope
equivalente a veinte pisos y est&#225;n equipados con los tanques contenedores de
membrana m&#225;s grandes jam&#225;s construidos. Con una capacidad total de hasta 266.000
metros c&#250;bicos, cada barco transporta suficiente gas natural como para
satisfacer las demandas energ&#233;ticas de 70.000 hogares estadounidenses por un
a&#241;o. 

Adem&#225;s del objetivo de incrementar el tama&#241;o del barco, se desarroll&#243; la
importante iniciativa de dise&#241;ar, probar e implementar una planta de
relicuefacci&#243;n a bordo del barco que re-licua el gas natural que se evapora
durante el transporte a fin de reinyectarlo en estado l&#237;quido a los tanques de
carga en lugar de emplearlo como gas vaporizado para surtir al buque cisterna
mismo. De esta manera, se aprovecha aproximadamente el 100 por ciento de la
carga. Esto resulta particularmente beneficioso en el caso de trayectos largos
desde Qatar a Europa y al continente americano. Las instalaciones de
relicuefacci&#243;n a bordo brindan la oportunidad de reemplazar las calderas de
vapor y las turbinas para propulsi&#243;n, que emplean los barcos de transporte
convencionales de GNL licuado, por motores diesel de baja velocidad de gran
eficiencia. Los barcos Q-Max cuentan con dos motores diesel con h&#233;lices y
timones dobles. Esto les permite un aprovechamiento de la energ&#237;a con mayor
eficiencia y los vuelve m&#225;s confiables y maniobrables, lo que reduce hasta un
tercio el consumo de combustible. 

Reconocidos por expertos de la industria como los pioneros en la producci&#243;n de
GNL e innovaci&#243;n tecnol&#243;gica, los emprendimientos conjuntos de ExxonMobil en
Qatar ser&#225;n testigos de m&#225;s progresos industriales durante los pr&#243;ximos 18
meses. Adem&#225;s de ser el pionero en la industria de embarcaciones de gran tama&#241;o
para el transporte de GNL al mercado, ExxonMobil, en asociaci&#243;n con Qatar
Petroleum, emplea tecnolog&#237;a de avanzada en Qatar para construir cuatro de las
instalaciones de producci&#243;n de GNL m&#225;s grandes del mundo y participa en el
desarrollo de proyectos de terminales de regasificaci&#243;n de GNL en Italia, el
Reino Unido y los Estados Unidos.

&lt;p&gt;Technological Advancements Result in the Globalization of a Once-Regional Energy
Resource
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation&#8217;s (NYSE:XOM) technology leadership in liquefied natural
gas or LNG has resulted in an industry breakthrough in carrier design and size,
enabling the more efficient transport of natural gas to markets throughout the
world. The recent completion of the world&#8217;s first Q-Max LNG carrier, named
&#8216;Mozah,&#8217; marks a step change in LNG shipping by reducing transportation cost,
while improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. The innovative Q-Max
ships carry up to 80 percent more cargo, yet require approximately 40 percent
less energy per unit of cargo than conventional LNG carriers due to economies of
scale and efficiency of the engines. 

&#8220;The Q-Max carriers break the LNG shipping mold in nearly every way,&#8221; said Neil
Duffin, President, ExxonMobil Development Company. &#8220;The same technology
capability that drove us to develop a new class of LNG carrier is driving
innovation in all aspects of the LNG value chain.&#8221; 

The large LNG ship technologies, developed in conjunction with joint venture
partner Qatar Petroleum, include a number of industry breakthroughs and
significant enhancements, including increased ship size, onboard reliquefaction
units, slow-speed diesel engines, twin propellers and rudders, largest
ship-board LNG tanks ever built, the latest in hull antifouling protection and
improved fire-protection systems. The end result of these new generation ships
is a 20-30 percent reduction in transportation cost. 

&#8220;Qatar Petroleum, with ExxonMobil, led a major technical effort to enable this
groundbreaking enhancement in the LNG shipping industry,&#8221; said Mr. Faisal Al
Suwaidi, Qatargas Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;Shipping is a critical link in the
LNG value chain that extends from Qatar&#8217;s North Field, the largest
non-associated gas field in the world with recoverable resources of more than
900 trillion cubic feet, to homes in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. With our
innovative technology, we have effectively transformed the LNG business and
opened up more of the world for Qatar LNG,&#8221; said Al Suwaidi. Qatar Petroleum and
ExxonMobil are shareholders in a Qatar joint venture, Qatargas, that will
charter the Mozah and five other Q-Max carriers to supply LNG from new
liquefaction trains in Qatar. 

For more than 30 years the size of LNG ships remained virtually unchanged with
capacity of about 140,000 cubic meters. Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil&#8217;s ship
operators, hydrodynamicists, naval architects and structural engineers worked
closely to develop and rigorously test the larger Q-Max cargo tank designs.
Comprehensive evaluation of cargo sloshing was performed to prove that the
larger systems were feasible and reliable. The resulting Q-Max carriers are
longer than three football fields, tower twenty stories tall from keel to
masthead and are equipped with the largest membrane containment tanks ever
built. With a total capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters, each ship carries
enough natural gas to meet the energy needs of 70,000 U.S. homes for one year. 

In addition to increasing the size of the ship, a major initiative was
undertaken to design, test and implement the on-board reliquefaction plant that
re-liquefies natural gas that is vaporized during transit, re-injecting it as
liquid into the cargo tanks rather than using it as vaporized gas to power the
tanker itself &#8211; allowing for delivery of nearly 100 percent of the cargo. This
is particularly beneficial for the long-haul voyages from Qatar to Europe and
the Americas. The on-board reliquefaction facilities created an opportunity to
shift from steam boilers and turbines used for propulsion by conventional LNG
ships to highly efficient slow-speed diesel engines. The Q-Max ships are
equipped with two diesel engines driving twin propellers and rudders. This leads
to more energy efficient, reliable and maneuverable ships, reducing fuel
consumption by up to one-third. 

Recognized by industry veterans as a pioneer in LNG production and technology
innovation, ExxonMobil&#8217;s joint ventures in Qatar will see the advent of more
industry firsts over the next 18 months. In addition to pioneering the
industry's largest vessels to carry LNG to market, ExxonMobil in partnership
with Qatar Petroleum is employing new technology in Qatar to build four of the
largest LNG production facilities in the world and is participating in the
development of LNG regasification terminal projects in Italy, UK and the US.

&lt;p&gt;Les avanc&#233;es technologiques permettent la mondialisation d'une ressource en
&#233;nergie autrefois r&#233;gionale
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Le leadership technologique d'Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE&#160;:&#160;XOM) en gaz
naturel liqu&#233;fi&#233; ou GNL a permis une avanc&#233;e du secteur en conception et taille
de m&#233;thaniers permettant un transport plus efficace vers les march&#233;s du monde
entier. L'ach&#232;vement du premier m&#233;thanier Q-Max au monde, le &#171;&#160;Mozah&#160;&#187;, marque
une &#233;tape charni&#232;re pour l'acheminement de GNL en r&#233;duisant le co&#251;t du transport
tout en am&#233;liorant l'efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique et en r&#233;duisant les &#233;missions. Les
navires Q-Max innovants portent jusqu'&#224; 80&#160;% de chargement en plus, mais
n&#233;cessitent pr&#232;s de 40&#160;% d'&#233;nergie en moins par unit&#233; de chargement que les
m&#233;thaniers traditionnels gr&#226;ce &#224; des &#233;conomies d'&#233;chelle et d'efficacit&#233; des
moteurs. 

&#171;&#160;Les m&#233;thaniers Q-Max diff&#232;rent des m&#233;thaniers traditionnels en pratiquement
tout&#160;&#187;, explique Neil Duffin, pr&#233;sident, ExxonMobil Development Company. &#171;&#160;La
m&#234;me capacit&#233; technologique que celle qui nous a pouss&#233; &#224; d&#233;velopper une
nouvelle classe de m&#233;thaniers constitue la force motrice de l'innovation dans
tous les aspects de la cha&#238;ne de valeur du GNL.&#160;&#187; 

Les technologies des grands m&#233;thaniers, d&#233;velopp&#233;es de paire avec le partenaire
de joint-venture Qatar Petroleum, comprennent un certain nombre d'avanc&#233;es pour
le secteur et des am&#233;liorations d'importance, y compris la taille accrue des
navires, les unit&#233;s de reliqu&#233;faction &#224; bord, des moteurs diesel &#224; basse
vitesse, des doubles h&#233;lices et gouvernails, les plus grands r&#233;servoirs &#224; bord
de GNL jamais construits, la protection antifouling dernier cri de la coque et
des syst&#232;mes pare-feux am&#233;lior&#233;s. Le r&#233;sultat final de ces navires de nouvelles
g&#233;n&#233;rations est une r&#233;duction de 20 &#224; 30&#160;% en co&#251;t de transport. 

&#171;&#160;Qatar Petroleum et ExxonMobil ont &#233;t&#233; &#224; la t&#234;te d'un effort technologique
permettant ce progr&#232;s pionnier dans l'industrie de l&#8217;acheminement de GNL&#160;&#187;,
explique M. Faisal Al Suwaidi, pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de Qatargas.
&#171;&#160;L'acheminement est un lien essentiel dans la cha&#238;ne de valeur qui va du
gisement Nord du Qatar, le gisement de gaz non-associ&#233; le plus grand au monde
avec des ressources recouvrables de plus de 25,4 billions de m&#232;tres cube, vers
les foyers d'Asie, d'Europe et des Am&#233;riques. Gr&#226;ce &#224; notre technologie
innovante, nous avons transform&#233; avec succ&#232;s le secteur du GNL et avons ouvert
une plus grande partie du monde pour le GNL du Qatar&#160;&#187;, explique Al Suwaidi.
Qatar Petroleum et ExxonMobil sont actionnaires d'une joint-venture au Qatar,
Qatargas, qui va affr&#233;ter le Mozah et cinq autres m&#233;thaniers Q-Max pour fournir
le GNL &#224; partir des nouveaux trains de liqu&#233;faction au Qatar. 

Depuis plus de 30 ans, la taille des navires de GNL n'a pratiquement pas chang&#233;
avec une capacit&#233; avoisinant les 140&#160;000 m&#232;tres cube. Les op&#233;rateurs de navires,
les hydrodynamiciens, les architectes navals et les ing&#233;nieurs structurels de
Qatar Petroleum et ExxonMobil ont travaill&#233; ensemble pour d&#233;velopper et tester
de mani&#232;re rigoureuse les r&#233;servoirs de cargo Q-Max de taille plus importante.
L'&#233;valuation compl&#232;te du ballottement du chargement a &#233;t&#233; effectu&#233;e afin de
prouver que les syst&#232;mes de taille plus importante &#233;taient faisables et fiables.
Les m&#233;thaniers Q-Max qui en r&#233;sultent sont plus longs que trois terrains de
football am&#233;ricain, ont une hauteur de vingt &#233;tages de la quille &#224; la t&#234;te de
m&#226;t et sont &#233;quip&#233;s de la plus grande membrane de confinement des r&#233;servoirs
jamais con&#231;ue. Avec une capacit&#233; totale allant jusqu'&#224; 266&#160;000 m&#232;tres cube,
chaque navire porte suffisamment de gaz naturel pour pouvoir satisfaire aux
besoins en &#233;nergie de 70&#160;000 foyers am&#233;ricains pour une p&#233;riode d'un an. 

En plus de la taille accrue du navire, une grande initiative a &#233;t&#233; entreprise
pour la conception, l'&#233;valuation et la mise en &#339;uvre d'une usine de
reliqu&#233;faction &#224; bord qui reliqu&#233;fie le gaz naturel qui est vaporis&#233; au court du
transport en le r&#233;injectant en tant que liquide dans les r&#233;servoirs de transport
plut&#244;t que de l'utiliser sous forme vaporis&#233;e pour l'alimentation du navire,
permettant ici la livraison de pr&#232;s de 100&#160;% du chargement. Ceci est
particuli&#232;rement avantageux pour les voyages de long-courrier du Qatar vers
l'Europe ou les Am&#233;riques. Les installations de reliqu&#233;faction ont fourni la
possibilit&#233; de passer des g&#233;n&#233;rateurs &#224; vapeurs et des turbines utilis&#233;s pour la
propulsion des navires &#224; GNL traditionnels &#224; des moteurs diesels &#224; basse vitesse
tr&#232;s efficients. Les navires Q-Max sont &#233;quip&#233;s de deux moteurs diesel qui
alimentent des h&#233;lices et gouvernails doubles. Cela donne des navires &#224; plus
faible consommation d'&#233;nergie, plus fiables et faciles &#224; man&#339;uvrer, r&#233;duisant
ainsi la consommation de carburant jusqu'&#224; un tiers. 

Reconnues par les anciens du secteur comme &#233;tant un pionnier de l'innovation de
la technologie et de la production de GNL, les joint-ventures d'ExxonMobil au
Qatar conna&#238;tront davantage de premi&#232;res pour l&#8217;industrie au cours des 18 mois
qui viennent. En plus de faire figure de pionnier avec les plus grands navires
du secteur portant du GNL vers les march&#233;s, ExxonMobil, avec son partenaire
Qatar Petroleum, emploie la nouvelle technologie au Qatar pour construire quatre
des plus grandes installations de production de GNL au monde et participe au
d&#233;veloppement de projets de terminaux de regaz&#233;ification en Italie, au
Royaume-Uni et aux &#201;tats-Unis.

&lt;p&gt;
COSTA MESA, Calif., Dec. 17, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emulex Corporation
(NYSE:ELX) today announced that IBM has selected Emulex LightPulse(r) 8Gb/s
Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) for the new IBM Power Systems servers. By
leveraging Emulex HBAs, IBM is able to provide customers with the increased I/O
bandwidth, manageability and CPU efficiency required to support the increased
deployment of virtualized servers and high transaction databases.

"Once again, Emulex and IBM have teamed up to bring a high performance, reliable
SAN connectivity solution to market - one that end users can confidently use to
overcome the bandwidth challenges associated with next-generation data centers,"
said Taufik Ma, vice president of product marketing, Emulex. "Further, in using
Emulex 8Gb/s HBAs as part of the Power server family, IBM customers will
experience higher performance and throughput within their server environments,
as well as greater flexibility and scalability for SAN connectivity management,
which will ultimately help their organizations save time and money."

Offering industry-standard N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) support, Emulex's
LPe12000 family of 8Gb/s HBAs "virtualize" SAN connections so that each virtual
machine has independent access to its own protected storage. Emulex Virtual HBA
technology, when combined with the IBM Power platform, PowerVM(tm)
virtualization technology and the IBM AIX(r) operating system, enables customers
to leverage SAN management tools and best practices, such as fabric zoning and
LUN mapping/masking.

"Today's news underscores IBM Power Systems ongoing commitment to providing
customers with servers that have high availability and that are virtualization
ready, so that IT managers can keep up with the never-ending demand for
higher-speed channel and networking applications in the data center," said
Kelvin Hawkins, vice president, Power Systems development at IBM. "IBM and
Emulex have been working together for over ten years to deliver industry-leading
solutions that meet our customers' needs."

In July, Emulex announced that IBM selected the 8Gb/s HBAs for IBM System x
servers. IBM's selection was driven by the performance attributes of Emulex's
new 8Gb/s HBA, with support for Message-Signaled Interrupts eXtended (MSI-X), an
interrupt handling mechanism ideal for both virtualization and
transaction-intensive environments.

Emulex has the largest installed base of Fibre Channel HBAs in IBM SANs
worldwide. For more information on the Emulex's partnership and joint work with

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp expects its Xbox game console sales to outpace broader market growth next year, a senior executive said on Wednesday, projecting optimism despite dampened consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the global economic slowdown has hit consumer demand, Microsoft expects the overall video game industry to continue growing next year as more people choose to stay at home, said Alan Bowman, Asia general manager of Xbox operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry watchers expect the sector to grow in the 20 percent range this year, though Bowman declined to give specific forecasts for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Outpacing the market is a key measure, but we've also managed to broaden the market to include people who have never played video games before," Bowman, who is based in Sydney, told Reuters in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So what is really driving our growth momentum right now is how we are broadening our consumer base to include not only hardcore gamers but also individuals who would have previously not thought about buying a game console."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Asia, market research firm GfK said Xbox shipments in October grew by 53 percent compared to September after Microsoft cut the price of the console to less than $200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No figures were available for the same period last year as they only began tracking the market late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowman said current shipment volumes had reached such high levels that the company could afford to depend on volume to rake in a profit despite the lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're looking at some really great levels right now, so that allows us to pass on cost savings to our customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox outsold rival Sony's PlayStation 3 in Japan in September, its first monthly unit sales win in Sony's home base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it still lags behind Nintendo's Wii console, which sold over 2 million units in the U.S. in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowman said he was confident the Xbox's current growth momentum would continue into the Chinese New Year shopping season on the back of its lower price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese New Year, which takes place in late January 2009, is the peak shopping season for most countries in the greater China region and many retailers in east Asia typically chalk up their best sales during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has sold about 25 million Xbox 360 consoles worldwide since its introduction in late 2005, compared to 14.4 million units for Sony's PlayStation 3 and 30 million of Nintendo's Wii units, which both came out in late 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While video game developers such as Electronic Arts Inc have warned recently that their profits and revenue will fall short of already low-forecasts, Bowman said Microsoft would continue to invest in software and game development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Game development is the core of what we do," he said. "Microsoft is a software company by heart, and we will continue to work with our partners and by ourselves to develop new software for the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowman also said there were no concrete cost-cutting measures being implemented to deal with the current economic downturn, but that the company is "constantly evaluating our options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any global company needs to be mindful of their costs and money, but that's a combination of good internal controls and effective cost management," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled an initiative to help organizations reduce
costs and improve the efficiency of their information technology (IT) and
product engineering teams. To help companies overcome the challenges
associated with today's rapidly changing and global business climate,
IBM's new offerings will empower companies to use their software as a
strategic business asset.

    Organizations too frequently waste valuable time, money and resources by
failing to ensure software and systems projects meet business requirements
prior to delivering them to the marketplace. Even if business objectives
are clear, most companies experience a serious gap in the ability of IT to
execute against these goals. With 62% of projects failing to meet
deadlines, 49% of projects suffering budget overruns and 41% failing to
deliver on expected business value or return on investment (ROI)*,
software and systems projects are not providing the level of return of
investment required by today's businesses.

    For example, if an automobile manufacturer is forced to recall a
significant number of cars due to defects in the software, or a large
organization reports a loss due to problems in its ERP system, they are
wasting valuable time, money and resources that could have been saved by
ensuring their software and products met business requirements prior to
marketplace delivery.

    To help address these challenges, IBM is announcing new software enabled
by Jazz, IBM's collaborative technology platform, to help companies
balance the rising cost of IT operations with the need to generate
results with fewer resources. To derive greater value from their software
investments, companies must collaborate across geographical and
organizational boundaries, automate work flow based on up-to-date
information and continuously report progress against desired business
outcomes. These new offerings will help transform how business leaders
and IT organizations work together to:

    Act quickly to seize new business opportunities by analyzing ROI 
scenarios, the impact of change and the alignment of business and 
technology investments which are key to successful business 
transformations;

    Achieve precision in desired business outcomes by building consensus 
among business and technology leaders and by making better decisions based
 on accurate and real-time information;

    Execute with reduced risk and cost, delivering higher quality  solutions
and improved IT and product engineering efficiency through real-time team
collaboration, automation and reporting.

    "Historically, when companies have looked for ways to reduce costs, they
have often overlooked the importance of assuring that information
technology is efficient," said John Lutz, general manager, Managed
Business Process Services, IBM Global Technology Services. "In today's
rapidly changing economic climate, organizations must drive business and
product differentiation with greater agility and confidence. This
'agility at scale' will be crucial to the future of many businesses."

    New and enhanced software facilitates collaboration and business
transformation

    The challenges of globalization and technology outsourcing are forcing
companies to become more nimble, using an increasingly geographically
dispersed, virtual and agile workforce to remain competitive. In the world
of software delivery, this means around the clock collaboration to improve
the success rate of software projects. IBM's Jazz technology platform
helps geographically dispersed teams collaborate to improve business
processes and align business and IT priorities.

    IBM Rational  Requirements Composer -- new software that helps business
and IT teams  partner to deliver business differentiation and improve the
business  results tied to their investments in software. Built on Jazz,
IBM Rational  Requirements Composer helps geographically distributed
teams work together  in an open, real-time and transparent manner to more
effectively define the  scope of a project and build consensus among
business and IT leaders.

    IBM Rational  RequisitePro -- enhanced software that tightly integrates
with IBM Rational  Software Architect to ensure delivered solutions meet
business  requirements and priorities.

    IBM Telelogic System Architect -- enhanced software that helps business 
and IT teams work together to prioritize investments to support business 
goals and seize new business opportunities by visualizing, analyzing and 
communicating enterprise blueprints of business and technology 
architectures. Integration between Telelogic System Architect and IBM
Rational  Software Architect links strategy, processes and IT
infrastructure  planning directly with solution and system
implementations. IBM  Telelogic System Architect XT, the System Architect
web client,  includes new, out-of-the-box templates that improve how
business and IT  information is captured and consolidated, making the
data more visually  appealing to CTOs and business leaders. In addition,
new web-based  dashboards provide executives with the insight about IT
projects they need  to quickly seize new business opportunities.

    IBM Rational  ClearQuest, Rational Build  Forge, Rational  Asset Manager
and IBM Rational  ClearCase -- a collection of enhanced software which
improves team  productivity and the ability to execute against desired
business and  technical requirements at lower cost and risk. With new
collaboration,  automation and reporting features taking advantage of Web
2.0 and Jazz  technologies, customers can more easily implement software
delivery best  practice processes, helping them deliver higher quality
solutions and  improved IT efficiency. Organizations can now achieve
better visibility  into projects and provide traceability across the
software supply chain  using around the clock global monitoring.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is
slashing bonuses for senior level partners by 80 percent and
capping the cash component of their payouts to $220,000, people
familiar with the situation said, days after the bank announced
its first quarterly loss in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week Goldman reported a higher-than-expected
loss of $2.1 billion for the quarter ended Nov. 28, capping a
year when profit and revenue were slammed by the worsening
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Compensation and benefit expenses for 2008 has been slashed
in half to $10.9 billion across about 30,000 employees, or an
average of $364,000 per person. Goldman cut more than 3,200
jobs worldwide as business conditions kept getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now some of the most severe compensation cuts have been
suffered by the firm's partner managing directors, Goldman's
highest ranking and most generously paid executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The people familiar said partners will receive a maximum of
$220,000 in cash, with the remainder comprised of stock-based
deferred pay that is 35 percent restricted stock and 65 percent
options. The stock units vest over three years with the first
portion not vesting for one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Historically, Goldman partners received their deferred pay
entirely in stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Annual bonuses usually represent the lion's share of a Wall
Streeter's total compensation. But this year, salaries and
commissions comprise the biggest portion of Goldman's
compensation expenses, with cash bonuses the smallest part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lot of Wall Street traditions went out the window this
year, as the financial crisis drove Bear Stearns and Lehman
Brothers out of business and nearly sank Goldman and Morgan
Stanley (MS.N), who were forced to accept $10 billion
investments from the U.S. Treasury, tap a variety of federal
relief programs and convert from broker-dealers into
deposit-taking banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Responding to popular outrage from taxpayers who did not
want to see Wall Street executives get rewarded even as they
accepted rescue funding, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and
six other senior Goldman executives will receive zero bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For perspective, U.S. Census Bureau data show the median
income for Americans is about $45,000. The average United Auto
Workers member takes home about $60,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joseph Giannone; Editing by Bernard Orr)

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that the French Autorite des marches
financiers (AMF) published the definitive results of IBM's tender offers
in France and the United States for ILOG (NASDAQ: ILOG) (PARIS: ILO)
following the expiration of the subsequent offering period. These results
indicate that, as of the expiration of the subsequent offering period on
December 15, 2008, in aggregate an additional 913,865 ordinary shares
(including ordinary shares represented by ADSs) had been tendered into
the tender offers.

    When combined with the 19,664,945 ordinary shares (including ordinary
shares represented by ADSs) tendered into the tender offers during the
initial offering period that expired on November 24, 2008, these results
indicate that IBM will hold 20,578,810 ordinary shares, representing 96.83
percent of the voting rights and the share capital of ILOG, on an issued
and outstanding basis as of December 15, 2008.

    Accordingly, IBM will accept all the ordinary shares and ADSs tendered
during the subsequent offering period and expects that the settlement of
the tender offers and the payment of the cash consideration in respect of
the tendered ordinary shares will occur on December 24, 2008.

    As the securities not tendered into the tender offers represent less than
5 percent of the voting rights and the share capital of ILOG, IBM
requested today the implementation of a squeeze-out of the ordinary
shares held by minority shareholders. The AMF is expected to announce the
date of the implementation of the squeeze-out on December 19, 2008. The
trading of the ordinary shares will be suspended as of December 19, 2008,
and the ordinary shares will be delisted from Euronext upon the
implementation of the squeeze-out.

    As of December 19, 2008, ADSs will be placed on a trading halt. The
quotation of ADSs on the NASDAQ Global Select Market will be terminated
upon the implementation of the squeeze-out or shortly thereafter. ILOG
will terminate the registration of its ordinary shares and ADSs under the
U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, when it becomes eligible
to do so.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), along with its international
affiliate, the European Centre for Law and Justice (ECLJ) said today&#8217;s vote in
the United Nations General Assembly shows a continued and dramatic erosion of
support for the &#8220;Combating Defamation of Religions&#8221; resolution sponsored by the
Organization of the Islamic Conference. 

The vote today in the U.N. General Assembly: 86 &#8216;Yes&#8217; votes, 53 &#8216;No&#8217; votes, and
42 &#8216;Abstain&#8217; votes. It&#8217;s the first time the &#8216;No&#8217; and &#8216;Abstain&#8217; votes outnumbered
the &#8216;Yes&#8217; votes in a vote before the General Assembly. It also marks a
significant decline in support from one year ago. In 2007, the vote totals for
the resolution were as follows: 108 &#8216;Yes&#8217; votes, 51 &#8216;No&#8217; votes, and 25 &#8216;Abstain&#8217;
votes. The number of &#8216;Yes&#8217; votes has dropped off sharply &#8211; 22 fewer &#8216;Yes&#8217; votes
this year. And with today&#8217;s vote, the number of &#8216;No&#8217; and &#8216;Abstain&#8217; votes totaled
95 &#8211; compared to just 76 votes for the &#8216;No&#8217; and &#8216;Abstain&#8217; one year ago. 

&#8220;The vote today reflects a significant shift and a dramatic loss of momentum for
this troubling resolution,&#8221; said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel of the ACLJ and
ECLJ. &#8220;It&#8217;s clear that world opinion is turning against this dangerous
resolution &#8211; a resolution that is harmful, not helpful, to preserving religious
liberty and freedom. In recent months, we&#8217;ve heard from some 400,000 people who
understand the dangers associated with this resolution. It&#8217;s also clear that a
growing number of nations understand that this resolution is unacceptable. We&#8217;ll
continue with our commitment of advocacy and education to ensure that even fewer
nations support this in the future.&#8221; 

Today&#8217;s vote in the U.N. General Assembly comes just one month after an
important committee vote at the U.N. when the erosion of support became
apparent. The U.N.&#8217;s Third Committee voted in November: 85 &#8216;Yes&#8217; votes, 42 &#8216;No&#8217;
votes, and 50 &#8216;Abstain&#8217; votes &#8211; marking the first time the &#8216;No&#8217; and &#8216;Abstain&#8217;
votes outnumbered the &#8216;Yes&#8217; votes. 

The ACLJ and ECLJ have been working to educate and inform member nations about
the dangers of the resolution &#8211; a resolution that a growing number of
organizations and legal experts believe does not encourage religious freedom &#8211;
but is often used to silence religious minorities &#8211; including Christianity in
many countries. 

In addition to working to convince nations to withhold support for this
resolution, the ECLJ also delivered an oral argument before the U.N.&#8217;s Human
Rights Council. You can read the ECLJ's written submission to the U.N. Office of
the High Commissioner of Human Rights here: 

http://eclj.org/PDF/080626_ECLJ_submission_to_OHCHR_on_Combating_Defamation_of_Religions_June2008.pdf

The ECLJ has special consultative status from the U.N. &#8211; a designation that
enhances the global nature of the ACLJ&#8217;s religious liberty and human rights work
that already spans more than 35 countries. 

Led by Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow, the ACLJ and its worldwide affiliates engage
in litigation, provide legal services, render advice to individuals and
governmental agencies, as well as counsel clients on global freedom and liberty
issues. The ACLJ and its affiliated organizations also support training law
students from around the world in order to protect religious liberty and
safeguard human rights and dignity.

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Dec 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: NWK) announced today that
Quintum, now part of NET, has made its new Response Point VoIP Gateways
generally available through its North American distribution channels. The
NET Quintum gateways have been specifically designed to work with any
Microsoft Response Point-based IP telephony system. The Microsoft
Response Point system -- which includes the Response Point base unit with
IP PBX software running on Windows XP, SIP phones, management and client
software, and a PSTN gateway -- is an easy-to-use VoIP phone system
uniquely designed for the needs of small and medium businesses (SMB).

    Deploying a robust enterprise VoIP system can be expensive, as converged
data/voice networks are often complex to install and operate. SMB
customers need VoIP solutions that are highly integrated and easy-to-use,
with a low total cost of ownership. The newly released NET Quintum
gateways enable SMB customers to take advantage of reduced management
costs from system consolidation -- eliminating multiple, often
stand-alone systems, each with their own management and service
contracts, and collapsing the voice architecture to support both digital
and analog trunking. By leveraging ubiquitous network infrastructures,
the Response Point gateways allow SMBs to deploy solutions to real-world
communications demands.

    "In this challenging economic environment, SMBs are looking for
productivity improvements and cost savings. Our Response Point gateways
enable customers to affordably extend the tools they use for voice calls
while simplifying their communications, thereby increasing productivity.
They also deliver enterprise-grade security and reliability, and they
significantly reduce costs by eliminating the expense of a hosted
service," said Chuck Rutledge, Vice President of Marketing for NET. "In
fact, building complete, end-to-end solutions specifically for SMBs,
rather than re-purposing large enterprise solutions, is a key
differentiator of our Response Point gateway. Our goal is to help SMB
customers stretch their budget further as they strive to meet their
unique business needs."

    NET Quintum Response Point VoIP Gateways are generally available. The
digital gateway supports a T1, E1 or PRI connection and has a list price
of $1800. The analog gateway supports up to 4 FXS ports and has a list
price of $330. Upon installation, the analog gateway is configured
completely by the Microsoft Response Point application. The digital T1/E1
gateway offers a customized configuration wizard to step through the
additional questions required to complete the setup. Additional
information can be found at a dedicated microsite:

&lt;p&gt;Customers utilize the latest features of Perception and SharePoint together
NORWALK, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Assessment technology and services supplier Questionmark today announced that
the latest version of the Questionmark&#8482; Perception&#8482; assessment management system
can now integrate with the latest version of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server.


Questionmark&#8217;s SharePoint Portal Connector add-on may now be deployed to
integrate Questionmark Perception v4.4 with either Microsoft SharePoint Portal
Server (SPS) 2007 or with SharePoint Portal Server 2003. Previously, the
connector software supported SharePoint Portal Server 2003. Updated
documentation is now available for customers seeking to deploy connector with
SharePoint Server 2007. 

Organizations use SPS to facilitate collaboration, provide content management
features, implement business processes, and supply access to information that is
essential to organizational goals and processes. 

The Questionmark Connector uses Microsoft web parts to provide direct access to
assessments from a &#8220;My Assessments&#8221; window, just as they would &#8220;My Calendar,&#8221;
&#8220;My email&#8221; and/or &#8220;My Address Book.&#8221; 

Under &#8220;My Assessments,&#8221; the logged-in user sees a list of the quizzes, tests and
surveys that have been scheduled for them. Clicking on one of the assessment
links causes the assessment to start. When the assessment is completed, the
results are stored within the Perception database for future analysis, and the
user can be provided any appropriate feedback. 

More information and a free 30 day evaluation copy of the SharePoint Portal
Connector is available from http://www.questionmark.com/go/sharepointconnector.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) on
Thursday sold $7.75 billion in notes in a three-part deal,
backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, IFR reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank sold $1.75 billion of 2-year fixed-rate notes at
midswaps plus 18 basis points, said IFR, a Thomson Reuters
service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It sold a second tranche of $3 billion of 3.5-year
fixed-rate notes at midswaps plus 38 basis points and a third
tranche of $3 billion of 3.5-year floating-rate notes at
3-month London interbank offered rate plus 38 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan acted as sole lead manager on its own deal, which
was made under the government's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
Program, which offers full FDIC backing for debt sales of no
longer than 3 years by financial institutions.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3594ef/transfer_pricing_i) has
announced the addition of the "Transfer Pricing in Mexico" report to their
offering. 

As a member of the OECD, Mexico has enacted transfer pricing laws that are
generally consistent with OECD guidelines. Mexico's best method rule favors
traditional methodologies, starting with the CUP method, over profit-based
methods. Given the aggressive enforcement by Mexico's tax authorities in recent
years, careful compliance with filing requirements for transfer pricing studies
and documentation is advisable. 

Although there are no statutory penalties for failure to file required
documentation and the penalty for failure to file a transfer pricing return is
less than ten thousand U.S. dollars, failure to file either item can result in
rejection of deductions associated with related-party transactions. Mexican
courts have supported the tax authorities' approach, ruling that otherwise
permissible deductions may be disallowed solely on the basis of failure to have
transfer pricing documentation in time for the annual tax filing deadline. 

Further complicating transfer pricing compliance in Mexico are strict
requirements that do not permit the use of documentation prepared for another
taxpayer, and tend not to allow parent-company transfer pricing analysis. Also,
data must be provided from the current fiscal year, which in Mexico is the same
as the calendar year, so companies that do not operate on a calendar year basis
must make appropriate adjustments. There is also great difficulty in finding
comparable data in Mexico, although companies filing annual reports with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are generally accepted as comparables. 

Mexico also has a well-developed, active APA program that may be attractive to
taxpayers wishing to avoid the uncertainty associated with transfer pricing.
Contract manufacturers operating in Mexico under the Maquiladora program have a
special set of transfer pricing rules, which is also discussed. By Jose Casas

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has partnered with Highmark Inc. to
transform Highmark's energy-efficient data center in its Harrisburg, PA
location. For Highmark, Pennsylvania's largest health insurer, a
commitment toward a healthier environment will help to create healthier
communities.

    An increasing number of companies are implementing initiatives to reduce
the risk of climate change's impact. Highmark's active role in green
business projects was awarded a prestigious honor by Computerworld
magazine, which ranked it as a top "green" information technology company
for 2008.

    "A significant percent of our IT costs are driven by actual computing
systems -- the hard drives, servers and storage appliances. At Highmark,
we are always looking for opportunities to reduce our power footprint. IBM
has shown us how we can improve efficiency in our data center -- both to
reduce our environmental impact and to support our offerings to the
community," said Mark Wood, director of data center infrastructure at
Highmark.

    IBM's technologies and services are aimed at helping clients sharply
reduce data center energy consumption. The data center is an area of
information technology (IT) that can reap substantial and lasting
benefits by using 'greener' technology. IBM's analysis of Highmark's data
center included a data center energy efficiency assessment and a thermal
analysis using IBM's Mobile Measurement Technology (MMT), which measures
3D temperature distributions within data centers to discover where
improvements are needed.

    By identifying cooling and electrical usage trends, IBM helped Highmark
uncover opportunities to reduce excessive operational costs. This has
helped Highmark increase data center flexibility, speed of response and
availability -- all of which will translate into better service and value
for Highmark members.

    "Inefficiencies in power and cooling usage can represent a tremendous
drain on data center environments. IBM's Mobile Measurement Technology
can help clients optimize their environments and realize an annual energy
savings of 10-12% above and beyond savings from their green investment,"
said Bob Tierney, Site and Facilities, Services Sales Leader at IBM.
"Improving energy efficiency and extending the life of the data center is
especially important in these economic times, as clients look for ways to
positively impact bottom lines."

    The data center energy efficiency assessment and thermal analysis were
completed in November.

    Highmark has a variety of sustainable, eco-friendly, green business
projects; more information can be found at www.highmark.com.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, comments from other analysts, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 18 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Joy
Global Inc JOYG.O and Bucyrus International Inc BUCY.O to
"underweight" from "neutral," saying the mining equipment
makers are likely to face a deeper and longer-than-expected
fall in orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brokerages Barclays Capital, UBS and Stifel Nicolaus also
cut their price targets on Joy Global's stock, a day after the
mining equipment maker forecast weak 2009 results citing a
slowdown in orders as customers were becoming more selective
about their new mine expansion projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given that Bucyrus and Joy Global share the market, JP
Morgan analyst Ann Duignan said she expected similar commentary
from Bucyrus in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We view mining as classic late cycle -- an industry that
lags on the way up and the way down. As such, we expect the
negative earnings revisions to continue into 2010 and beyond,"
Duignan wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If commodity prices continue to remain low, industry capex
reductions are expected to continue, Duignan said. In recent
weeks, mining companies like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N) and Rio
Tinto (RIO.L)(RIO.AX) have cut their capex budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Not surprisingly, we expect a slowdown in new projects
(for mining equipment makers)," Duignan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Joy Global were down 8 percent at $23.44, while
Bucyrus shares plunged nearly 12 percent to $19.90, in midday
trade Thursday on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays analyst Andy Kaplowitz cut his earnings estimates
on Joy Global due to increased risk of further order
cancellations and the effects of a stronger dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Following are the price target changes made on Joy Global

&lt;p&gt;Reaching a milestone in adoption of GS1 Standards for the data synchronization
industry while reducing supply-chain costs and increasing efficiency
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Leading global manufacturers Kraft Foods (KFT), Nestl&#233; (NESN) and The Procter &amp;
Gamble Company (PG), along with German-based retailerMETRO Group (MEOG.DE),
announced today they have extended the use of the Global Data Synchronization
Network&#174; (GDSN&#174;) to synchronize item data in Russia. 

The supply-chain partners are leveraging the GDSN connections of two
world-leading GDSN data-pool providers. Kraft, Nestl&#233; and P are members of
1SYNC, the world&#8217;s largest data pool; METRO Group uses SA2 Worldsync as its
global home data pool, which is also the GS1-approved country data pool for the
entire Russian user community. 

Kraft, Nestl&#233; and P intend to synchronize their product catalogues in multiple
countries with METRO Group representation, and expect to realize supply-chain
benefits such as reduced paperwork and strengthened service levels thanks to
faster setup of new items and more-accurate product data. 

Enabling active GDSN connections in Russia is a milestone for the
data-synchronization industry given Russia&#8217;s dynamic market conditions. As one
of the fastest-growing European markets, Russia offers a significant potential
for suppliers and retailers to grow across all sectors. This GDSN connection
provides a faster and more cost-effective flow of information and goods in a
country where electronic master data exchange is still in the initial stage. 

&#8220;By synchronizing product data with METRO Group in Russia, we are able to get
real-time inventory updates from Metro&#8217;s stores in the region,&#8221; said Janna
Kouchina, Director Sales, Kraft Foods Russia. &#8220;This gives us the ability to get
our products to the store shelf faster. We hope that more retailers will adopt
this process, giving us the ability to experience similar benefits across our
supply chain globally.&#8221; 

&#8220;Leveraging our GDSN experience in European and non European countries, we are
very pleased to demonstrate once again our capability to synchronize data with a
major player such as Metro Group in Russia,&#8221; says Jonathan Pearce Head of Supply
Chain for Nestl&#233; Russian Region. &#8220;The operational benefits are obvious: an
efficient and sustainable supply chain that contributes to maximizing product
availability to our consumers and shoppers. Moreover, GDSN is a very good way to
build up and strengthen a long term relationship with our customers." 

&#8220;Availability of accurate product master data in our own and our customers&#8217;
systems is key to flawless operation of today&#8217;s supply chain,&#8221; says Wolfgang
Menzel, IDS Manager Global Customer Development, Procter &amp; Gamble. &#8220;Building on
the 1SYNC / SA2 interoperability established in Germany, we are now scaling GDSN
capability and benefits. Russia, a key growth market, is an excellent choice.
Based on global standards, we are transforming our collaborative processes and
eliminating waste from the end-to-end value chain.&#8221; 

Urs Ulrich Katzenstein, Head of Master Data Exchange, METRO Group, said, &#8220;We are
very satisfied with the outcome from accurate global data synchronization and
are working toward synchronizing item data with all our suppliers globally. With
the GDSN connection in Russia, other trading partners will benefit as well.
Together with our partners from retail and industry we see ourselves as
pioneers, establishing more efficient trade relations worldwide.&#8221; 

In addition to Russia, METRO Group is currently synchronizing GDSN data via SA2
Worldsync in Germany, Poland and the U.K. The retailing company is working
toward rolling out its efforts to other countries, such as Denmark and Hungary.
The GDSN not only leverages the achievement of global standards as recommended
by GS1, but also ensures ongoing business and improved efficiencies for a
growing geographical span of trading partners. The adoption rate of the GDSN is
steadily increasing and currently contains more than 3.1 million registered
items with Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs). 

1SYNC chief executive officer Bob Noe said, &#8220;There is now a clear acceleration
in the implementation of data synchronization throughout the world, and we will
continue to collaborate with organizations such as GS1 and ECR Europe (Efficient
Consumer Response) to ensure that the GDSN continues to be a solution that
addresses the needs of all trading partners globally, irrespective of their
size.&#8221; 

Commenting on this announcement, Nihat Arkan, chief executive officer, SA2
Worldsync said, &#8220;We are delighted to further support METRO Group&#8217;s data
synchronization efforts in every single country with Metro representation. This
rollout is a clear demonstration of the value that can be gained by global data
synchronization.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities said it expects the "great recession" of 2008 to end by the second half of 2009 and views discretionary and financials as drivers of earnings growth in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are likely to approach 2009 with a more bullish tilt given the expected continuation of the December rally, JP Morgan's chief U.S. strategist Thomas Lee wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the record cash on sidelines, positive expectations from an Obama administration, and a potential mid-2009 economic recovery, we see investors buying stocks in early 2009," Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An economic recovery will spur risk appetite, reversing extreme risk aversion, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financials and discretionary are expected to have incrementally better fundamentals relative to the SP 500, according to the strategist, while resources and exporters are seen reversing to earnings drag from drivers in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage believes the U.S. Federal Reserve's and Treasury's actions, lower gasoline prices, lower mortgage rates, $700 billion to $1 trillion in fiscal stimulus, and a possible auto sales recovery in the second half of 2009 will almost certainly do something for the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest economy has been hit from rising loan defaults and foreclosures in the face of reduced consumer spending and poor liquidity in the credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategist called the 2008 recession "challenging," and said "we believe the greatest policy mistake in 2008 was allowing Lehman Brothers to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further failure in a financial company is less likely now that policy makers see the importance of the "lender of last resort" function, Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some potential areas of further weakness are a large industrial company failure, a large, tentacled hedge fund failure, a large foreign company defaulting, or even a large emerging market nation, the strategist added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several financial companies have had to file for bankruptcy or seek government aid as they struggle to keep themselves afloat amid the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee, however, forecast 2009 to be an earnings trough for the SP 500, with a strong rebound seen in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said any equity rally over the next few months is likely to fail unless it is confirmed by a broad improvement in the credit market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott, Dinesh Nair)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annual Study Reveals What Characterizes Pharma&#8217;s Most Effective Sales Forces and
Identifies Differences in Most Desired Rep Attributes Across Six Attitudinal
Segments of Physicians


EAST HANOVER, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
For the fifth year in a row, Pfizer has claimed the top spot as the industry&#8217;s
&#8220;most effective&#8221; sales force, as ranked by GfK Market Measures in a study with
more than 800 physicians across 12 specialties. An analysis of the study
participants&#8217; rankings and responses to a number of related sales force issues,
as viewed through the lens of GfK&#8217;s new physician attitudinal promotional
segmentation, Segment Tracker&#8482;, reveals key differences across physician groups
in their perceptions of sales representative interactions. 

With company rankings consistent with last year&#8217;s results, Pfizer remains the
No. 1 sales force, as reported by 18 percent of physicians. Following closely is
Merck at 11 percent and three companies that tied for third place: AstraZeneca,
GSK and Eli Lilly, each with 8 percent. Novartis, with 7 percent, and Schering
and Forest, each with 3 percent, round out the 2008 &#8220;most effective sales force&#8221;
rankings. 

A look at the profiles* [see below] of the six physician segments within GfK&#8217;s
Segment Tracker and their respective rankings of sales forces brings a further
dimension to the study results. Although Pfizer places first or second in every
promotional segment, Patient-Overloaded Independents, the smallest but most
patient-laden segment, is where Pfizer&#8217;s share is the highest at 24 percent.
This segment also expresses a preference for Novartis, ranking it as the second
most effective sales force with 15 percent. Ranking second within the segments
of Hometown Altruists and Occupational Traditionalists at 10 percent each is
Merck, which also ranked among the top five spots across the other four
physician segments. 

In defining what makes a company&#8217;s sales force &#8220;most effective,&#8221; all six
physician segments selected &#8220;positive professional attributes&#8221; as a top mention
by 75 percent or more of respondents. The segment Corporate Professionals,
however, is the most heavily focused on the professionalism of the sales
representative interaction at 86 percent. Industry Enthusiasts and
Patient-Overloaded Independents selected their top companies more often based on
&#8220;positive rep knowledge&#8221; (69 percent and 71 percent respectively) and &#8220;positive
patient-directed focus&#8221; (18 percent and 15 percent respectively). 

Looking at what physicians need from representatives, the segments ranked their
top five mentions similarly: product information, research data/clinical
literature, educational materials, cost information and knowledgeable
representatives who can answer questions. Differences were noted, however,
across segments as to the relative importance of these needs. For example,
Corporate Professionals are the least likely segment (29 percent) to require
research data as they tend to be creatures of habit, yet they express one of the
highest needs for product information (61 percent) that centers on new
indications for known products. Occupational Traditionalists and Corporate
Professionals are the least likely segments to require cost information (12
percent and 16 percent respectively), as both are more likely to rely on
familiar products where cost/formulary is known. Occupational Traditionalists
are also the least likely to indicate a desire for product information (43
percent), which is characteristic of their late-adopter behavior.
Patient-Overloaded Independents have the greatest need for knowledgeable
representatives who can answer questions (14 percent). This segment&#8217;s relatively
high need for product information (58 percent) is dominated by the need for
safety/side effect information. 

In tracking physicians&#8217; evaluations of representative actions they deem as
important, &#8220;respect for time&#8221; and &#8220;articulate&#8221; are two of the highest-rated
attributes across all six segments. Evaluating the segments across multiple
representative attributes and actions reveals that Patient-Overloaded
Independents and Industry Enthusiasts trend similarly (high) across multiple
representative actions, highlighting their full-service use of representatives.
Likewise, there is parallel trending on these attributes for Occupational
Traditionalists and Corporate Professionals, who each use representative
services very selectively. Looking at another group of representative action
attributes, which include &#8220;ask unmet patient needs,&#8221; &#8220;has patient educational
materials,&#8221; &#8220;has patient compliance materials&#8221; and &#8220;has formulary/reimbursement
information,&#8221; Patient-Overloaded Independents and Industry Enthusiasts once
again trend similarly, showing a high desire for patient-focused support
materials. Occupational Traditionalists and Corporate Professionals trend
similarly here as well in their notable lack of concern for these elements. 

&#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s consistent year-to-year top ranking is due to its sales force&#8217;s
ability to adapt to their customers&#8217; needs and preferences,&#8221; said Stacy Vaughn,
vice president, sales force effectiveness research at GfK Market Measures. &#8220;This
is exactly where we feel our new Segment Tracker tool will be invaluable. By
understanding physicians&#8217; promotional attitudes and behaviors, we believe that
companies will be able to develop segment-appropriate vehicles and also develop
and tailor content with a particular orientation &#8211; whether it be a business or
clinical orientation &#8211; that physicians will be able to relate to. Ultimately
this will have a strong impact on physicians&#8217; professional relationship with a
company and its representatives.&#8221;

factors, including but not limited to the factors described in the Company&#8217;s
Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange

coverage for asbestos exposure, protection and validity of its patents and other
intellectual property rights, increasing competition by foreign and domestic
companies, compliance with its debt covenants, recoverability of claims against
its customers and others by the Company and claims by third parties against the
Company, and changes in estimates used in its critical accounting policies.
Other factors and assumptions not identified above were also involved in the
formation of these forward-looking statements and the failure of such other

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) agreed to sell its 29 percent stake in Sanyo Electric 6764.T after Panasonic Corp (6752.T) slightly sweetened its offer, three financial sources said, clearing the way for a deal worth at least $6.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move by Goldman, which, unlike two other major Sanyo shareholders, had rejected Panasonic's earlier lower offers, came after the Wall Street firm reported its first quarterly loss since going public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of Panasonic, the world's biggest plasma TV maker, and Sanyo, the top producer of rechargeable batteries, would create Japan's No. 2 electronics manufacturer after Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) with $120 billion in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanyo shares closed down 1.4 percent at 141 yen on the news that a deal had been reached below the company's current share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panasonic and Sanyo plan to hold a news conference on Friday to give details of a planned tender offer, in which Panasonic will offer 131 yen per Sanyo share, the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, 1 yen more than it had earlier offered this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Goldman Sachs and Panasonic declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman appears to have taken its chance to sell its stake, despite the price being far below what it had been seeking, due to the increasingly bleak outlook for Japanese consumer electronics makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last month, Panasonic, formerly known as Matsushita Electric, cut its annual net profit forecast by 90 percent and announced plans to restructure as the global financial crisis dampens sales of TVs and other electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have also said the market price of Sanyo shares may not have fully factored in a dilution in per-share value, which comes with the conversion of preferred shares into common shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, Daiwa Securities SMBC and Goldman hold nearly 430 million of Sanyo's preferred shares, each of which can be exchanged for 10 common shares when a restriction is lifted in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If converted, Goldman and Daiwa Securities SMBC would each hold a 29 percent stake in Sanyo, while Sumitomo Mitsui Banking would hold 12 percent. The combined 70 percent stake would be worth about $6.4 billion, based on the offer price of 131 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHALLENGES AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said Panasonic President Fumio Ohtsubo would have a tough time creating synergy effects even though the deal now looks set to go through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When things are good and top lines are growing, it is easy for Japanese companies to carry out restructuring. They are not very good at streamlining in an environment like this since no one would rehire the employees they let go," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His pain from overseeing the birth of a successful merger has just begun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hit by a global economic downturn and a surging yen, Japanese exporters are scrambling to cut costs by lowering production and delaying construction of new plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sanyo leads the market for rechargeable batteries, which are widely used in cell phones, PCs and increasingly in automobiles, struggling businesses such as microchips are dragging down its overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Panasonic fell 0.5 percent to 1,021 yen, compared with a 0.3 percent slide in the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index .IELEC.T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panasonic, which is sitting on $11 billion in cash, first offered about 120 yen per share to the three top shareholders of Sanyo, and later raised its offer by 10 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daiwa Securities SMBC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking were considering the offer positively, sources have said. But Goldman earlier this month rejected the sweetened offer of 130 yen, saying the price was not fair for all Sanyo shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daiwa Securities SMBC is a joint venture between Daiwa Securities Group (8601.T) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) (8316.T), while Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp is Sanyo's main bank and part of SMFG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Taiga Uranaka; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Chris Gallagher)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* 2008 full year comparable earnings per diluted share now expected in a range
of $1.28 to $1.31.
* 120-day business review identified opportunities for a stronger marketplace
presence, improved efficiencies and a new incidence-based economic model with
The Coca-Cola Company enabling a more aligned 2009 business plan.
* 2009 outlook includes comparable EPS growth in a mid single-digit range
excluding the expected impact of foreign currency headwinds.
* Management to discuss its outlook and the 120-day review with investors via
conference call at 10 a.m. ET.

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) today said it expects to achieve full year
comparable earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.28 to $1.31. Key
operating factors in this guidance include stronger than expected volume
performance in North America, continued solid European performance, and ongoing
operating expense control efforts. 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John F. Brock will host a conference call
and presentation with analysts and investors to discuss this outlook and the
impact of the 120-day business review. The call will begin at 10 a.m. ET and
will be webcast via CCE&#8217;s website, www.cokecce.com. 

&#8220;As we continue to face significant economic challenges throughout our
territories, we remain focused on key value drivers designed to protect and
enhance margins and free cash flow. We are encouraged by our progress in several
key areas as we work to restore a foundation for growth at Coca-Cola
Enterprises,&#8221; Mr. Brock said. &#8220;We are seeing slightly improved business trends
in North America, including better than expected volume in response to our
September pricing increase driven in part by improved execution and moderating
commodity cost increases. 

&#8220;Longer term, we believe our 120-day business review has identified important
opportunities in North America that will drive growth, enhance our efficiency
and effectiveness, and improve our performance in the marketplace,&#8221; Mr. Brock
said. &#8220;Throughout this review, we have worked closely with The Coca-Cola
Company, and though we have more work to do, together, we are taking action to
capture significant opportunities in our supply chain, developing key
initiatives that will strengthen our price/package architecture, and
implementing a new incidence-based economic model that offers greater synergy
for our two companies. 

&#8220;This review has accelerated the pace and scope of change and put into motion
essential changes necessary to restore long-term, profitable growth in North
America,&#8221; Mr. Brock said. &#8220;This effort has also reinforced our confidence in our
strategic priorities and affirmed that while our long-term performance
objectives remain ambitious, they are achievable.&#8221; 

Key North American outcomes from the 120-day review include:

* New integrated supply chain initiative that will consolidate common supply
chain activities, optimize product flow, and create approximately $150 million
of annual incremental operating income by 2011 for CCE and The Coca-Cola
Company. 
* New price/package architecture initiatives in both single-serve and
multi-serve categories that will enhance brand equity, create new value for our
customers and consumers, and drive recruitment. 
* New incidence-based economic model that better aligns CCE and The Coca-Cola
Company in our efforts to drive profitable growth, simplifies our business
relationship, better reflects our go-to-market approach, and places greater
emphasis on margin management. 
* Reorganization of our operations that creates a more focused structure by
reducing U.S. business units from 6 to 4, which provides greater operating
flexibility and sharpens accountabilities.

Beyond these initiatives, we have also implemented programs to improve corporate
efficiencies, including the development of optimization programs for Finance,
Human Resources, and Business Information Systems. We have also strengthened our
brand portfolio through a new distribution agreement for Monster energy drinks
and Capri-Sun juice drinks, along with the acquisition of Abbey Well mineral
water in Great Britain. 

&#8220;In addition, we continue to work with The Coca-Cola Company to create long-term
improvements that strengthen our go-to-market model and improve our efficiency.
We have identified additional opportunities with significant potential,
including ways to reach new customers with the right package for different
occasions, to better serve foodservice customer needs through a wider variety of
sales and delivery methods, and to create additional selling synergy between
bottle/can and fountain sales. We look forward to discussing these initiatives
with you as appropriate in the future,&#8221; Mr. Brock said. 

2008 OUTLOOK

For full-year 2008, the company now expects comparable earnings per diluted
share in a range of $1.28 to $1.31, including foreign currency impact and
excluding items affecting comparability. This guidance reflects better than
expected fourth quarter volume in North America, benefits from continued growth
in Europe, and operating expense initiatives. Cash flow from operations, less
capital spending (free cash flow) is expected to be approximately $650 million,
with capital spending of approximately $1 billion. The comparable effective tax
rate for 2008 is expected to be approximately 25 percent. 

North America is expected to generate full-year 2008 results that include a low
single-digit volume decline, mid single-digit pricing per case growth, and high
single-digit cost of goods per case growth. In Europe, full-year 2008 volume,
pricing per case, and cost of goods per case each is expected to increase in a
low single-digit range. 

2009 OUTLOOK

On a comparable and currency neutral basis, consolidated financial results for
2009 will reflect low single-digit operating income growth and mid single-digit
EPS growth. At recent rates, foreign currency would have a negative impact on
expected 2009 comparable EPS of approximately 15 cents. The company also expects
strong free cash flow of more than $650 million, and capital expenditures of
approximately $900 million. Free cash flow will continue to be used primarily
for debt reduction. The effective tax rate for 2009 is expected to be 25 percent
to 26 percent. 

In North America, full-year 2009 revenue is expected to increase in a mid
single-digit range as we actively manage the price and volume equation. Volume
is expected to decline reflecting expected continued downward economic

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
General Motors Corporation (NYSE: GM), Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE), The Coca-Cola

Here are highlights from Wednesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:

GM Assistance Still Under Review

General Motors Corporation (NYSE: GM) is one of the largest automobile
manufacturers in the world. We believe that the company should file for
bankruptcy to rid itself of Unions and pension &amp; health care issues, besides
separating dealerships from the rest of the company. 

The company has failed to secure any loan from the government until now. The
U.S. government was supposed to provide $25-50B in aid as DIP
[debtor-in-possession] financing. The government also rejected the immediate $12
billion short term loan as the UAW [United Auto Workers] refused to accept any
wage cut until 2011. 

Freddie Mac Target Even Lower

Freddie Mac's (NYSE: FRE) 3Q08 net loss came in at $19.44 per diluted share,
compared to a loss of $2.07 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. We
anticipate the price volatility to continue as the market looks for further
information on the future structure of the GSEs and their role in the housing
markets. 

Further, as the housing situation continues to worsen, we anticipate higher
losses and write-offs in the coming quarters. As such, Freddie Mac will need
additional capital infusions and the conservatorship may continue for the coming
quarters. Also, the company may undertake a reverse stock split to continue its
listing on the NYSE. 

Coca-Cola Looking to Pop Trends

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) has strong soft drink brands, leading market
shares, and generates solid cash flow. The company's new CEO, Muhtar Kent, will
continue with Isdell's revitalization plan to deal with the challenges of
sluggish volume trends. 

Though world-wide volume growth has begun to improve, it is being driven by
non-carbonated beverages and international markets along with incremental
marketing spending of $400 million annually. 

Hanesbrands Valuation Attractive

Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE: HBI) is a manufacturer and marketer of innerwear,
outerwear, and hosiery apparel, which are sold under the brand names of Hanes,
Champion, Playtex, Bali, Just My Size, Barely There, L'eggs, Outer Banks, and
Wonderbra. Approximately 90% of the company s sales are in the United States.
The company was spun off from Sara Lee Corporation (NYSE: SLE). 

Management's business model requires only modest sales growth to create
substantial EPS growth. Earnings are being driven by brand building and
cost-reduction initiatives. Since the spin-off in September 2006, the company
has reduced debt by $285 million, lowering interest expense from the post
spin-off financial structure.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts throughout, adds closing share prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Taro Fuse and Kiyoshi Takenaka&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Dec 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) agreed to sell
its 29 percent stake in Sanyo Electric 6764.T after Panasonic
Corp (6752.T) slightly sweetened its offer, three financial
sources said, clearing the way for a deal worth at least $6.4
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move by Goldman, which, unlike two other major Sanyo
shareholders, had rejected Panasonic's earlier lower offers, came
after the Wall Street firm reported its first quarterly loss
since going public. [ID:nN16521076]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combination of Panasonic, the world's biggest plasma TV
maker, and Sanyo, the top producer of rechargeable batteries,
would create Japan's No. 2 electronics manufacturer after Hitachi
Ltd (6501.T) with $120 billion in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanyo shares closed down 1.4 percent at 141 yen on the news
that a deal had been reached below the company's current share
price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panasonic and Sanyo plan to hold a news conference on Friday
to give details of a planned tender offer, in which Panasonic
will offer 131 yen per Sanyo share, the sources with direct
knowledge of the matter said, 1 yen more than it had earlier
offered this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials at Goldman Sachs and Panasonic declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman appears to have taken its chance to sell its stake,
despite the price being far below what it had been seeking, due
to the increasingly bleak outlook for Japanese consumer
electronics makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late last month, Panasonic, formerly known as Matsushita
Electric, cut its annual net profit forecast by 90 percent and
announced plans to restructure as the global financial crisis
dampens sales of TVs and other electronics. [ID:nLR132843]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts have also said the market price of Sanyo shares
may not have fully factored in a dilution in per-share value,
which comes with the conversion of preferred shares into common
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, Daiwa Securities SMBC and Goldman
hold nearly 430 million of Sanyo's preferred shares, each of
which can be exchanged for 10 common shares when a restriction is
lifted in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If converted, Goldman and Daiwa Securities SMBC would each
hold a 29 percent stake in Sanyo, while Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
would hold 12 percent. The combined 70 percent stake would be
worth about $6.4 billion, based on the offer price of 131 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHALLENGES AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management, said Panasonic President Fumio Ohtsubo would have a
tough time creating synergy effects even though the deal now
looks set to go through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When things are good and top lines are growing, it is easy
for Japanese companies to carry out restructuring. They are not
very good at streamlining in an environment like this since no
one would rehire the employees they let go," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "His pain from overseeing the birth of a successful merger
has just begun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hit by a global economic downturn and a surging yen, Japanese
exporters are scrambling to cut costs by lowering production and
delaying construction of new plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Sanyo leads the market for rechargeable batteries,
which are widely used in cellphones, PCs and increasingly in
automobiles, struggling businesses such as microchips are
dragging down its overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Panasonic fell 0.5 percent to 1,021 yen, compared
with a 0.3 percent slide in the Tokyo stock market's electrical
machinery index .IELEC.T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panasonic, which is sitting on $11 billion in cash, first
offered about 120 yen per share to the three top shareholders of
Sanyo, and later raised its offer by 10 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daiwa Securities SMBC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking were
considering the offer positively, sources have said. But Goldman
earlier this month rejected the sweetened offer of 130 yen,
saying the price was not fair for all Sanyo shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daiwa Securities SMBC is a joint venture between Daiwa
Securities Group (8601.T) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
(SMFG) (8316.T), while Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp is Sanyo's
main bank and part of SMFG.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its global automotive production and sales forecasts, citing a sharp deterioration in the operating environment for automobile companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brokerage downgraded German automotive cable and wiring producer Leoni (LEOGn.DE) to "sell" from "neutral" and Autoliv (ALV.N), the world's top airbag and seat-belt maker, to "neutral" from "buy." Goldman expects global automotive production and sales in 2008 to fall 4 percent, compared with its prior view of a 3 percent fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It expects production and sales in 2009 to decline 9 percent, from its earlier estimate of a fall of 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that the fourth-quarter reporting season is likely to be a negative catalyst for the sector with companies highlighting current operating challenges, negative cash flow exacerbated by working capital pressures and zero visibility heading into 2009," Goldman said. Goldman upgraded French car-parts maker Valeo (VLOF.PA) to "neutral" from "sell," saying its share have underperformed and the market may be willing to look through further bad news despite a deteriorating trading environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also removed world number two truck maker Volvo (VOLVb.ST) from its Conviction Sell List.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Amiteshwar Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York lost $178 million in tax revenues because six top Goldman Sachs executives decided to skip bonuses, New York Gov. David Paterson said on Friday, underscoring the budget pain inflicted by Wall Street's troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial sector is the bedrock of New York's economy and it usually pays the state 30 percent of all its tax revenues in the January to March quarter, Paterson said in a telephone call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heavy share of taxes paid in the first quarter of each year occurs because this is when the companies often pay their employees the lion's share of generous bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-November, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and six other top corporate officers said they would forego their 2008 bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in recession-ville," Paterson said, adding he did not think the economic crisis was fully appreciated by legislators who have criticized his array of proposed education and health care cuts and fee and tax increases but have failed to come up with other options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Paterson proposed cutting spending by $9.6 billion and raising more than $4 billion in fees and taxes -- including new levies on Internet music downloads and luxury goods -- to close a 15-month, $15.4 billion deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the states and federal government do not get spending under control, we will graduate to a 10-year recession," Paterson told reporters in a conference call, warning a depression could follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am sensitive to the queasiness of legislators about taking these positions," Paterson said. But he said credit rating agencies would frown if the state failed to swiftly close its budget, warning any delays would worsen the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joan Gralla; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joan Gralla&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 19 (Reuters) - New York lost $178 million in

to come up with other options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, Paterson proposed cutting spending by $9.6
billion and raising more than $4 billion in fees and taxes --
including new levies on Internet music downloads and luxury
goods -- to close a 15-month, $15.4 billion deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the states and federal government do not get spending
under control, we will graduate to a 10-year recession,"
Paterson told reporters in a conference call, warning a
depression could follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am sensitive to the queasiness of legislators about
taking these positions," Paterson said. But he said credit
rating agencies would frown if the state failed to swiftly
close its budget, warning any delays would worsen the problem.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 19 (Reuters) - New York lost $178 million in
tax revenues because six top Goldman Sachs executives decided
to skip bonuses, New York Gov. David Paterson said on Friday,
underscoring the budget pain inflicted by Wall Street's
troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The financial sector is the bedrock of New York's economy
and it usually pays the state 30 percent of all its tax
revenues in the January to March quarter, versus the 20 percent
average for the full year, Paterson said in a telephone call
with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rise in revenues in the first quarter of each year
occurs because this is when the companies often pay their
employees the lion's share of generous bonuses.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Pfizer Inc.'s (Pfizer) Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs)
and debt ratings as follows: 

--Long-term IDR at 'AA+'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt rating at 'AA+'; 

--Bank loan rating at 'AA+'. 

The ratings apply to approximately $16.3 billion of debt. The Rating Outlook
remains Negative. 

Pfizer has been successful at mitigating the effects of the patent expiry of
three of its six top-selling pharmaceuticals since the second quarter of 2006,
from solid performace of medicines launched since 2005, including Lyrica,
Sutent, and Chantix, as well as major restructuring initiatives starting in
2005. During this period of patent losses, EBITDA and revenues have stayed at
consistent levels. The company is now tasked to counter a period of significant
drug patent expiration in 2011-2012, which includes the loss of market
exclusivity in 2011 for Lipitor representing 26% of total revenues. Fitch
anticipates the worst affect of patent expirations will occur in 2012. 

Pfizer's slimming R pipeline requires the highest investment in the industry
as the company spent $7.4 billion for the latest 12-month (LTM) period at the
end of the third quarter. The company recently pared back the size of the
overall R program, now placing primary focus on only six disease states (which
no longer includes cholesterol-lowering). The company's current late-stage
program is thin compared to its peers, and is not expected to fully replace
potential losses from patent losses in 2011-2012. The company is challenged in
2009 to expand its late-stage pipeline either from progression of the mid-stage
portfolio or external licensing to help mitigate the maturing portfolio risk. 

The company maintained very strong liquidity with a cash balance and short-term
investments totaling $26 billion on Sept. 30, 2008. Additionally, the company
doubled its lines of credit to $7.4 billion by the end of the third quarter from
$3.7 billion at the end of 2007. Pfizer maintains a $12 billion commercial paper
program. Free cash flow improved to $5.8 billion for the LTM period at the end
of the third quarter from $3.4 billion in 2007, despite generic competition to
key products, Camptosar and Norvasc. Fitch expects relatively stable free cash
flow generation prior to the period of patent losses, and a significant
departure from historical levels in 2011-2013. 

Leverage has returned to historical level at approximately 0.8 times (x) through
the LTM period at the end of the third quarter, as Pfizer resumed significant
commercial paper borrowing during the year. Leverage is expected to remain
relatively consistent with the current rating category through the company's
patent cliff in 2011-2012, supported by a light debt maturity schedule during
this time. Fitch believes the current buildup of short-term debt may predicate
aggressive M activity in the near-term to counter future revenue and earnings
losses from the maturing product portfolio.

&lt;p&gt;Master Contract for Energy Projects at U.S. Federal Agency Facilities Nationally
and Internationally
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Energy Solutions (CES), a unit of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), has
been awarded a master contract by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to work
with federal agencies to reduce energy and water consumption and increase the
use of renewable energy at agency facilities. 

The Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC), awarded to 16 qualified energy
contractors, are intended to ensure quality design, implementation, operation
and maintenance services for federal agency energy projects. 

Each of these new DOE contracts, which have a minimum five year term with the
option to increase up to a total of 11 years, provides for a maximum individual
contract value of $5 billion over the life of the contract. Federal agencies are
allowed to use these contracts for federal facility energy efficiency projects,
both nationally and internationally. 

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of
2007 require federal agencies to achieve a 30 percent reduction in energy
intensity and a 16 percent reduction in water use by 2015. They also require an
increase in renewable energy use by federal facilities to 7.5 percent of
electricity needs by 2013. The new DOE contracts are intended to help federal
agencies achieve these mandated targets by working in partnership with the
private sector. 

The DOE contract is part of the ESPC program authorized by Congress, which
allows energy efficiency projects at federal agencies to be funded by guaranteed
energy cost savings and, therefore, requiring no capital expenditures up front.
Energy contractors, such as CES, obtain financing to fund energy efficiency
upgrades and renewable power systems and are repaid for these improvements by
the agencies over a period of years through the savings generated by the
project. 

&#8220;We are extremely pleased to be awarded one of the Department of Energy&#8217;s new
master energy performance contracts,&#8221; said Jim Davis, president of Chevron
Energy Solutions. &#8220;This contract is expected to allow CES to expand our
partnership with federal agencies to help them become more energy efficient, use
more renewable energy and achieve taxpayer savings.&#8221; 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business across the globe. The company's success
is driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 59,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops and commercializes the energy
resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is
based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is available at

&lt;p&gt;Congressmen Describe Human Rights Report As &#8220;Laughably Short&#8221; of Facts on Oil
Pollution in Amazon Rainforest
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee and the Co-Chair of the
House Human Rights Commission have called for Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice to investigate why the State Department&#8217;s annual human rights report
includes &#8220;countless&#8221; examples of abuses across the world but fails to mention
the &#8220;detrimental impact&#8221; of environmental destruction in the Ecuadorian
rainforest from the oil operations of Texaco, now owned by Chevron. 

In a letter to Rice, U.S. Congressmen Howard Berman and Jim McGovern wrote: &#8220;We
are &#8230; deeply troubled by the fact that the Human Rights Report does not even
begin to reflect the grave human rights situation in the region. When the 2007
Report states that &#8216;Although oil companies increased efforts to minimize the
environmental and social impact of their oil projects in the Amazonian region,
environmental damage, particularly deforestation, continued,&#8217; it falls laughably
short of factually documenting what it is legally mandated to do, which is to
report on the &#8216;status of internally recognized human rights.&#8217;&#8221; 

Berman serves as Chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee, and McGovern is
Co-Chair of the House Human Rights Commission. McGovern recently returned from a
congressional trip to Ecuador&#8217;s rainforest to view the environmental impact of
oil operations in a large area of rainforest where Texaco (now Chevron) built
and operated hundreds of wells in the 1970s and 1980s. 

Chevron is currently a defendant in a civil suit in Ecuador where a
court-appointed expert found damages could be as high as $27 billion. Plaintiffs
say the toxic dumping by Texaco was 30 times larger than the oil spilled in the
Exxon Valdez disaster and was done intentionally to lower production costs. 

In their letter, the congressmen asked Rice to answer several questions:

* Why is there no mention of the high cancer rate and the significant numbers of
deaths that occurred in the region? 
* Why does the Report not state that this is an issue going as far back as 1964
when U.S. companies first extracted oil? 
* Why does the Report give countless examples of ongoing human rights
investigations, court cases, national human rights committee proceedings, but
fails to mention the 15-year-old lawsuit against Chevron, which is now pending
in Ecuador?

The court-appointed expert in Ecuador determined that the contamination was
largely the product of sub-standard practices used by Texaco from 1964 to 1990,
when the company dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste over an area
of rainforest roughly the size of Rhode Island. Chevron now owns Texaco and will
bear any liability in the case, which is being tried in Ecuador at Chevron's
request. 

According to the expert, more than 1,000 people have died of cancer in the
region because of the oil contamination and five indigenous groups are
struggling to survive. 

A final court ruling on Chevron&#8217;s liability and damages is expected in 2009.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 19 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities cut its rating on
insurers Genworth Financial Inc (GNW.N) and Prudential
Financial Inc (PRU.N) to "neutral" from "overweight," and said
it was maintaining a cautious stance on the U.S. life insurance
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Genworth fell as much as 16 percent in morning
trade, while those of Prudential fell 8 percent. The broader
Dow Jones U.S. life insurance index .DJUSIL fell about 2
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insurers like Prudential and Genworth, who have seen their
capital getting eroded away recently with heavy investment
losses, are struggling to assuage investor fears amid a weak
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About a half dozen life insurers applied for Federal funds
under the $700 billion U.S. bailout. No decision has yet been
made by the U.S. Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although valuations are attractive, we expect weak
earnings, poor operating trends, and capital concerns to limit
upside until business fundamentals stabilize," analyst Jimmy
Bhullar wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The equity market decline is likely to pressure cash flows
and assets under management growth in the variable annuity,
asset management, variable life, and 401(k) businesses, which
collectively account for about one-fourth of industry earnings,
he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst introduced year-end price target for the
insurers and also upgraded UNUM Group (UNM.N) to "neutral" from
"underweight" and Assurant Inc (AIZ.N) to "overweight" from
"neutral".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are relatively more positive on companies where we have
a greater degree of comfort in EPS estimates, operating trends,
and investment portfolios," Bhullar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the sector, Bhullar said he expects declining earnings
estimates, poor sales/net flows and continued high investment
losses to preclude multiple expansion for the insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst chose Reinsurance Group of America (RGA.N), on
which he maintained an "overweight" rating, as the top pick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Genworth closed at $3.34 Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange, while those of Prudential closed at $30.74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the alerts, please double click [ID:nWNAB4714]

&lt;p&gt;  YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, NY, Dec 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) Researchers today announced that they demonstrated the
operation of graphene field-effect transistors at GHz frequencies, and
achieved the highest frequencies reported so far using this novel
non-silicon electronic material.

    This accomplishment is an important milestone for the Carbon Electronics
for RF Applications (CERA) program sponsored by DARPA, as part of the
effort to develop the next-generation of communication devices.

    Graphene is a special form of graphite, consisting of a single layer of
carbon atoms packed in honeycomb lattice, similar to an atomic scale
chicken wire. Graphene has attracted immense worldwide attention and
activities because its unusual electronic properties may eventually lead
to vastly faster transistors than any transistors achieved so far.

    The work is performed by inter-disciplinary collaboration at IBM T. J.
Waston Research Center. "Integrating new materials along with the
miniaturization of transistors is the driving force in improving the
performance of next generation electronic chips," said IBM researchers
involved in this project.

    The operation speed of a transistor is determined by the size of the
device and the speed at which electrons travel. The size dependence was
one of the driving forces to pursue ever-shrinking Si transistors in
semiconductor industries. A key advantage of graphene lies in the very
high electron speed with which electrons propagate in it, essential for
achieving high-speed, high-performance transistors.

    Now, IBM scientists have fabricated nanoscale graphene field-effect
transistors and demonstrated the operation of graphene transistors at the
GHz frequency range. More importantly, the scaling behavior, i.e. the size
dependence of the performance of the graphene transistors was established
for the first time. The team found that the operation frequency increases
with diminishing device dimension and achieved a cut-off frequency of 26
GHz for graphene transistors with a gate length of 150 nm, the highest
frequency obtained for graphene so far.

    IBM researchers expect that by improving the gate dielectric materials,
the performance of these graphene transistors could be further enhanced.
They expect that THz graphene transistors could be achieved in an
optimized graphene transistor with a gate length of 50 nanometers. In the
next phase, the IBM researchers also plan to pursue RF circuits based on
these high-performance transistors.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase  Co, will not seek a bonus for 2008, a person close to the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimon joins a raft of other chief executives who are not receiving bonuses for a year when the credit crunch walloped the banking sector and forced government rescues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks face mounting criticism that bonus systems are rewarding executives for taking on irresponsible risks. Taxpayer sentiment has turned against Wall Street and its highly paid bankers as financial companies have received billions of dollars in government money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc CEO John Thain will not receive bonuses, according to their banks. Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack said he will not receive a bonus for the second straight year. Citigroup Inc board member and adviser Robert Rubin will also not receive a bonus, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon led JPMorgan through the acquisitions of Bear Stearns Cos and Washington Mutual Inc while limiting writedowns on toxic debt this year, but many analysts believe high U.S. unemployment will weigh on the bank's results next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's shares have fallen 32 percent this year, compared with a 50 percent drop for the U.S. banking sector as measured by the KBW Bank index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision as to whether Dimon receives a bonus is ultimately up to the JPMorgan board, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan received $25 billion under the U.S. Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times, quoting people briefed on the situation, reported on Friday that while Dimon would not request a bonus, his deputies were expected to receive bonuses based on their divisions' performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit has not yet decided whether to accept a bonus, the newspaper said, quoting people familiar with his plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Credit Suisse Group AG said it would pay senior executive bonuses with troublesome, illiquid assets, forcing employees to take on the risk that at least some of them put on the Swiss bank's books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Foundation will award a total of $1 million to support four
innovative projects to improve water resources and sanitation in developing
nations. The projects were selected by the Global Water Challenge (GWC) business
coalition and Ashoka&#8217;s Changemakers through &#8220;Tapping Local Innovation:
Unclogging the Water and Sanitation Crisis,&#8221; an online competition calling for
groundbreaking solutions to some of the world&#8217;s most pressing water and
sanitation challenges. A total of 265 projects from social entrepreneurs in 54
countries around the world were submitted to the competition. 

The projects receiving funding are:

* Naandi Foundation: Clean drinking water for underserved populations in India 
* Manna Energy Foundation: Water treatment plants to create fuel for families in
rural Rwanda 
* Ecotact: Treatment systems that safely transform waste into fuel and
fertilizer for Kenyan communities 
* Clean Shop: Public education to support clean latrines for South African
schools

&#8220;This collaborative competition tapped the power of human ingenuity and
demonstrated that solutions exist to local water and sanitation issues,&#8221; said
Paul Faeth, Executive Director of GWC. &#8220;With Coca-Cola&#8217;s $1 million grant, we
are able to further fund projects that we believe will start a ripple effect in
their communities and create scalable, replicable and sustainable models that
can be applied around the world.&#8221; 

&#8220;While these four projects are among the most inspiring of the applications we
received, all of our submissions have evoked discussion and helped to build
community in the sector,&#8221; said Charlie Brown, the Executive Director of Ashoka&#8217;s
Changemakers. &#8220;We look forward to seeing new energy and innovation in addressing
the global water crisis in the years to come.&#8221; 

Applications for the award were submitted through the Ashoka&#8217;s Changemakers Web
site (www.changemakers.net) between January and March of 2008. The judges
included Ed Cain, Vice President-Grant Programs, Hilton Foundation; Ian
Callaghan, Head of Microfinance Institutions Group, Morgan Stanley; Dr. Sanjay
Gupta, Chief Medical Correspondent, CNN; and Tanvi Nagpal, Director of Water and
Sanitation Initiatives, Global Water Challenge. Further details on each of the
organizations and projects that will receive awards from GWC, Ashoka
Changemakers and The Coca-Cola Foundation are as follows: 

Naandi Foundation, India: Community-based Safe Drinking Water Systems: Through a
collaborative partnership between villages, technology partners and the states,
the Naandi Foundation is facilitating the availability of safe drinking water to
citizens in the Andhra Pradesh and Punjab states of India. The village
panchayats support the development of water purification plants in the villages,
and the partnership supplies water to villagers at a nominal user fee, which
pays for the operations and maintenance that make the plant sustainable. A
public education program in the villages also creates an environment for greater
understanding of health, hygiene and sanitation issues among local citizens.
More information is available at www.naandi.org. 

Manna Energy Foundation, Rwanda: Developing Another World in Rural Rwanda: With
funding through carbon credits, the Manna Energy Foundation is installing close
to 500 water treatment systems and biogas generators for secondary schools in
Rwanda. The project will reach a population of 236,000 students, which amounts
to three percent of the Rwandan population. The water treatment plants will use
gravity and photovoltaic filtration systems, and the biogas generators will take
human and kitchen waste and capture the waste methane, which can be used in high
efficiency cook stoves. More information is available at www.mannaenergy.org. 

Ecotact - Innovating Sanitation, Kenya: Iko-Toilet Thinking Beyond a Toilet:
Ecotact is implementing an innovative model for installing and operating
pay-for-use toilets in urban areas of Kenya by leveraging recent innovations in
environmental sanitation. Waterless urinals reduce water consumption; urine is
segregated and sold as fertilizer, and some facilities will use human waste to
generate methane gas which reduces sewage disposal. Each toilet offers
additional services, tailored to meet the needs of the local community: a small
business, showers, and an ATM. The diverse array of funding sources includes
user fees, advertising revenues, and the leasing of a small space to
microentrepreneurs. More information is available at www.ecotact.org. 

Clean Shop, South Africa: Schools Sanitation Improvement and Enhancement
Project: Clean Shop employs 350 people and conducts daily cleaning and hygiene
services for schools, universities, mines, supermarkets, and gas stations. In
partnership with the University of Venda, Clean Shop educates parents with
children in public schools to clean and operate local school latrines. It is
poised to operate in many more schools in partnership with the South African
government. More information is available at www.thecleanshop.co.za. Further
details about these solutions and more can be found at www.changemakers.net.

&lt;p&gt;Research to utilize Novocell&#8217;s stem cell-derived pancreatic progenitor cells
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Novocell, Inc., a stem cell engineering company, today announced it has entered
into a non-exclusive drug discovery collaboration with Pfizer giving Pfizer
access to Novocell&#8217;s proprietary pancreatic progenitor cells derived from human
embryonic stem (hES) cells. 

Under terms of the agreement, Novocell will receive an upfront payment with
additional amounts payable upon the achievement of certain technical milestones,
as well as research funding. In addition, Novocell will receive payments
relating to the sale by Pfizer of any exclusive therapeutic discovered as a
result of the collaboration. The duration of the research collaboration will be
2 years with the option by Pfizer to extend. 

&#8220;We are very pleased to collaborate with Pfizer, an industry leading
pharmaceutical company with a strategic vision about regenerative medicine. This
joint opportunity takes advantage of our leading stem cell engineering
technologies and Pfizer&#8217;s expertise in drug discovery, providing for innovative,
regenerative therapeutics,&#8221; said Alan J. Lewis, Ph.D., President and Chief
Executive Officer of Novocell. 

Novocell scientists were first to demonstrate a ground-breaking differentiation
process that successfully engineers hES cells into definitive endoderm cells
necessary for pancreas formation. Novocell also demonstrated earlier this year,
that hES-derived pancreatic progenitors develop into functioning ductal, acinar
and endocrine cells in vivo. These endocrine cells are capable of producing
insulin in response to glucose as well as other pancreatic endocrine hormones in
vivo.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks featured in this
week&#8217;s analysis includes Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: APC), BJ Services
Company (NYSE: BJS), Dril-Quip, Inc. (NYSE: DRQ), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:
XOM) and Precision Drilling Trust (NYSE: PDS). 

To see the Zacks Industry Rank and the trend in earnings estimates revisions for
more than 200 industry groups, visit http://at.zacks.com/?id=3154. 

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by Charles Rotblut, CFA, Senior Market
Analyst for Zacks.com. 

This week: Bearish Short-Term Outlook For Oil Stocks

At yesterday&#8217;s meeting, OPEC ministers agreed to a production cut of 2.2 million
barrels per day, which equates to a 4.2 million per day reduction from September
levels. In addition, Russia, Syria and other non-member countries are also
likely to lower production levels. 

The moves are in response to the $100+ drop in oil that has occurred since Jul
11. The global economic slump, and forecasts for reduced consumption next year,
has oil producers concerned about a loss of revenues. 

Though OPEC members have a long history of violating quotas, production levels
should drop after the meeting. The commodities markets, however, are unimpressed
as crude was trading at just $43 per barrel this morning. 

The Impact on Oil Stocks

For investors, today's meeting won't have any meaningful short-term impact. The
"magic" number for many companies is believed to be about $65 per barrel. Oil
prices below this level discourage capital investment and production. Prices
above this level encourage more activity. 

Not a line in the sand, per se, but a good benchmark for gauging what the
industry is going to do. 

The other issue is the credit markets. Even for companies with strong cash
positions, access to debt financing remains difficult and expensive. This also
discourages investment. 

It is this combination of low oil prices and a lack of financing that has led
brokerage analysts to continue lowering 2009 profit forecasts on a large number
of oil-related stocks. The downward revisions span most of the energy sector
including exploration and production company Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
(NYSE: APC), services provider BJ Services Company (NYSE: BJS), equipment maker
Dril-Quip, Inc. (NYSE: DRQ) and driller Precision Drilling Trust (NYSE: PDS). 

Even conglomerates like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) are seeing their
consensus earnings estimates lowered. 

BJS and PDS are Zacks #5 Rank ("strong sell") stocks. APC, DRQ and XOM are Zacks
#4 Rank ("sell") stocks. 

Crude Will Rebound

Crude prices will not stay at current levels, though the timing of the rebound
is uncertain. It will be soon enough, however, to make recent buyers of new SUV
question their purchases. Bluntly put, enjoy the cheap gasoline prices while you
can. 

Long-term investors should not be in a rush to buy oil stocks, though long-term
valuations are cheap. Therefore, it makes sense to continue eyeing the sector,
even if the short-term outlook is not positive. 

An alternative method is to look at pipeline partnerships. Our senior oil
analyst, Sheraz Mian, discussed these in a recent blog post
(http://at.zacks.com/?id=5067). 

Though opportunities for short-term capital appreciation might be small, all of
these partnerships yield attractive dividends. 

Industry Groups

Because the weakness in crude prices affects the entire sector, I covered
multiple industry groups this week. The specific groups are:

* Oil &amp; Gas-Drilling (http://at.zacks.com/?id=5064) - Precision Drilling Trust 
* Oil Field Machinery &amp; Equipment (http://at.zacks.com/?id=4773) - Dril-Quip

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Dec 19 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has chosen
a production site in Australia for its proposed Wheatstone
liquefied natural gas project, the company said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; After narrowing its search to three locations, the oil and
gas major said it preferred to build the project, potentially
one of the largest of its kind in Australia, at Ashburton
North.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The site is 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the town of
Onslow and about 200 kilometres south of the offshore
Wheatstone natural gas field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Australia Chief Executive Roy Krzywosinski said in
a statement that front-end engineering and design work would be
carried out in 2009 while the company sought government
approval to operate a 25 million tonnes per year LNG and
domestic gas plant complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The initial development consists of two LNG processing
facilities with a nominal capacity of 5 million tonnes per year
each. A separate, but co-located domestic gas plant designed to
initially process up to 250 million standard cubic feet per day
is included as part of the development plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokeswoman said no Wheatstone gas had been
contracted for sale while a final investment decision would be
made following the completion of the design study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Approvals from the Western Australian state government were
needed for the project to proceed, the spokeswoman said.   
Output from the project, announced in March as a 5-
million-tonnes-per-year facility, has been since revised
following discovery of more gas at its Iago gas field adjacent
to the Wheatstone gas field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If expanded to 25 million tonnes, the Wheatstone plant
would be larger than the North West Shelf LNG project, operated
by Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd Woodside (WPL.AX), and
Chevron's own proposed 15 million-tonnes-per-year Gorgon LNG
project, currently Australia's biggest planned resources
project.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Exxon comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 21 (Reuters) - Hurricane damage discovered at
Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) $1 billion natural gas terminal
under construction in Texas will postpone the facility's start
up, according to a report in the online edition of The Wall
Street Journal on Saturday, citing people familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The liquefied natural gas, or LNG, facility in southeast
Texas was damaged by seawater from Hurricane Ike nearly three
months ago and assessing damage has taken time, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report said that people briefed on the matter confirmed
the scheduled mid-2009 start-up of the terminal will be delayed
as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This will likely cost Exxon and business partners revenue
just as plunging commodity prices are hurting energy
producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spokeswoman Kimberly Brasington said the company's
assessment of Ike's impact on the facility was still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be premature to speculate on the outcome of the
ongoing assessment work," she said, in an e-mail message. She
added that recovery and construction work continued at the
site.

&lt;p&gt;Keller Rohrback L.L.P. Responds to Microsoft's Statement Regarding Disc
Scratching by the Xbox 360 Console

SEATTLE, Dec. 22, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Keller Rohrback L.L.P.
(www.krclassaction.com), one of the law firms for Plaintiffs and a proposed
class of U.S. consumers who own an Xbox 360 console, today responded to the
December 16, 2008 statement of Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") (Nasdaq:MSFT)
in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer downplaying the impact of the defective Xbox
360 design.

On November 21, 2008, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification in In re
Microsoft Xbox 360 Scratched Disc Litigation, which is pending in the United
States District Court, Western District of Washington. Plaintiffs' motion, which
is currently pending before the Hon. John C. Coughenour, asserts that the Xbox
360 console is defectively designed. Plaintiffs allege that during normal
console use, when an Xbox 360 is tilted or swiveled "even slightly," with a game
disc spinning in the console's vertical position, components of the disc drive
are likely to contact the game disc, creating a distinctive circular gouge on
its underside. The circular gouge caused by this contact makes discs unplayable.

As of April 2008, Microsoft reported 55,000 separate customer complaints
regarding the alleged disc-scratching defect.

In a statement issued on December 16, Microsoft countered that 55,000 reports
from dissatisfied customers represents "less than one-half of 1% of the total
Xbox 360 user base." However, counsel for Plaintiffs and the proposed class
report that they have independently received over 1,000 inquiries from Xbox 360
users whose game discs have been ruined by the defectively-designed Xbox 360
console.

Plaintiffs allege, based on discovery in the case and depositions of Microsoft
employees, that Microsoft was well aware -- even before it launched the Xbox 360
in November 2005 -- of the likelihood that the Xbox 360 console, when used as
designed, would scratch discs if moved even slightly while a disc was spinning.

Plaintiffs also allege that the Xbox 360's defect stems from a design flaw. From
an early stage of development, Microsoft specified a video game console with a
disc drive that would operate in a vertical position while also specifying a
very high speed of disc rotation during play. However, Microsoft failed to
anticipate obvious dangers of disc damage caused by the gyroscopic forces
exerted on Xbox 360 game discs. Microsoft failed to take necessary measures to
prevent discs from being irreparably scratched when the console is moved even
slightly during normal console use while in the vertical position.

While Microsoft's December 16 statement notes that "movement of any game
console, not just Xbox 360, can cause scratches on a disc," Microsoft fails to
address Plaintiffs' allegations that both the Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo
Wii are far less prone to disc scratching because of their slower speeds of game
disc rotation and their more robust and effective disc retention designs.

Plaintiffs allege that Microsoft should have anticipated this design defect and
resolved it before bringing the product to market. Microsoft also should have
taken reasonable steps to remedy the defect after its discovery beyond placing a
temporary warning sticker on the disc tray and burying a statement in the user
manual, because even small unintentional movements of the Xbox 360 may scratch
discs and render them permanently unplayable.

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects alert, headline and story to clarify loss was in
taxable income, not tax revenues.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 17 (Reuters) - New York lost $178 million in
taxable income because six top Goldman Sachs executives decided
to skip bonuses, New York Gov. David Paterson said on Friday,
underscoring the budget pain inflicted by Wall Street's
troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial sector is the bedrock of New York's economy
and it usually pays the state 30 percent of all its tax
revenues in the January to March quarter, versus the 20 percent
average for the full year, Paterson said in a telephone call
with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rise in revenues in the first quarter of each year
occurs because this is when the companies often pay their
employees the lion's share of generous bonuses.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge
approved a settlement calling for $1.27 billion in cash plus
securities with a face value of $5.7 billion to be transferred
to Barclays Plc (BARC.L) in connection with its purchase of the
core U.S. brokerage business of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The settlement relates to fund transfers made the week of
Sept. 15 to keep Lehman's LEHMQ.PK brokerage business
operating while the parent company filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck approved the settlement on
Monday and said the Lehman creditors committee could conduct
further inquiries into the agreement if it chose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This settlement represents a significant benefit to
(Lehman Brothers) and is the right thing to do," Peck said,
citing representations made by lawyers for JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N), Barclays, Lehman and the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York in court on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The securities being transferred, many of them
mortgage-backed securities, have declined substantially from
their original value, lawyers for the various parties said in
court. They declined to give the current value of the
securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to court papers, the $7 billion in cash and
securities stemmed from a sum Barclay's had expected to receive
after loaning $45 billion to the Lehman brokerage business on
Sept. 18, two days before the court approved its purchase of
the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broker-dealer needed the funds to guarantee its
short-term obligations. It had been given assistance earlier
that week from the New York Fed, which made a short-term loan
worth $46.22 billion to Lehman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays had expected $49.7 billion to be returned to it
from Lehman as part of its loan, but only $42.7 billion could
be transferred before the court ordered the liquidation of
Lehman's brokerage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The securities and cash will come from Lehman Brothers Inc
accounts at JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), according to court
papers. JPMorgan has agreed to release liens it has on those
accounts. Lehman Brothers Inc is the brokerage business that is
being liquidated by a trustee to facilitate the transfer of
customer accounts to Barclays and other parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harvey Miller, a lawyer representing bankrupt Lehman
Brothers Holdings, told the court that the brokerage's former
parent company did not object to the settlement and that it
would spare the company significant future litigation.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, JP Morgan comment. Changes dateline, previous

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta Dec 22 (Reuters) - Swiss banking giant
UBS (UBSN.VX) will sell its Canadian energy operations and
global agriculture business to J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM.N) for an
undisclosed amount, the banks said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan has bought all of UBS's Canadian-based
commodities energy business, Canadian Energy, from UBS's
investment bank by purchasing shares in UBS Warburg Energy
Holdings, UBS said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan is also buying UBS's London-based Global
Agricultural Commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to take advantage of opportunities that will
further enhance and diversify our global commodities business,"
Blythe Masters, head of global commodities for J.P. Morgan,
said in a statement. "The addition of these businesses and
talented teams further expands our North American energy
franchise and provides further depth to our growing
agricultural and soft commodities platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the acquisition, J.P. Morgan adds a Canadian office in
Calgary, Alberta, supplementing its investment banking
operation in Montreal, a treasury and securities business in
Toronto, and an asset management office in Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter
of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move comes after UBS said in October that the
investment bank would focus on client franchises in the
securities and advisory businesses, while exiting certain
business activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As part of this, the investment bank is exiting all of its
commodities businesses, with the exception of precious metals
and the index and exchange-traded commodities activities," UBS
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said it was also in discussions with other third
parties regarding the sale of other parts of its nonstrategic
commodities businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition further bulks up J.P. Morgan's
energy-trading business, adding to the Houston-based U.S. power
and gas franchise that came with its purchase of Bear Stearns
in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Calgary office deals with Canadian natural gas, power,
and crude oil physical and financial markets, J.P. Morgan said.
The office will be run by Brian Cumming, a J.P. Morgan managing
director most recently based in London.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today it has been selected by Eaton Corporation
(NYSE: ETN) to supply modeling software in support of Eaton's development
of series hydraulic hybrid systems.

    The series hydraulic hybrid (SHH) system -- that promises dramatic fuel
savings and environmental benefits -- replaces the conventional
drivetrain and transmission. The system uses hydraulic pumps and
hydraulic storage tanks to capture and store energy, similar to what is
done with electric motors and batteries in a hybrid electric vehicle.

    Shipping giant, UPS, will deploy the first two package delivery vehicles
with the SHH system in Minneapolis during the first half next year. Eaton,
the developer of the SHH system, will monitor the vehicle's fuel economy
performance and emissions. An additional five vehicles will be deployed
later in 2009 and early 2010.

    Like many of the components that make up today's vehicles, the hydraulic
hybrid systems are intelligent software intensive systems. IBM is
supplying Telelogic Rhapsody modeling software that helps Eaton improve
quality and save time in the development of these hybrid systems. Eaton
project teams use Telelogic Rhapsody to model the software that makes the
SHH system work. This process allows the development teams to be more
efficient and shorten design cycles.

    With this smart system, fuel economy is increased in three ways: vehicle
braking energy is recovered that normally is wasted; the engine is
operated more efficiently, and the engine can be shut off when stopped or
decelerating. Initial trials of the SHH system demonstrated up to 50
percent improvement in fuel efficiency and one third reduction in CO2
emissions.

    "Using Telelogic Rhapsody software improves the quality of the application
software that is integral to the series hydraulic hybrid system
development process," said Steve Zielinski, chief engineer for software
in Eaton's Fluid Power Group. "IBM's Telelogic Rhapsody increases
communication through graphic modeling, and provides validation through
simulation and automated testing."

    About Eaton Corporation

    Eaton Corporation is a diversified power management company with 2007
sales of $13 billion. Eaton is a global technology leader in electrical
systems for power quality, distribution and control; hydraulics

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 22 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's
largest credit card network, said on Monday it set aside an
additional $1.1 billion to cover legal expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before becoming a public company in March, Visa set aside
$3 billion to cover lawsuits. It has already spent $2.1 billion
in a settlement with American Express Co (AXP.N) over
anti-competitive practices, and in October it agreed to pay
$1.89 billion to Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) over the
next year in a similar settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said the new addition to its litigation account had
the effect of a $1.1 billion share repurchase. Under the terms
of its initial public offering, Visa's bank shareholders agreed
to have their stake diluted to fund litigation in order to save
other shareholders from direct losses from lawsuits in certain
U.S. court cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transaction announced on Monday reduces share count by
about 20.8 million and will boost 2009 operating earnings by
about 7 cents a share, according to John Williams, an analyst
at Macquarie Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa shares were up 9 cents to $55.06 in early trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Dec 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced consumers continued to flex their
influence on businesses and institutions in 2008 despite dramatic shifts
in global markets. Based on an analysis of surveys conducted with
consumers throughout the year, IBM consultants are advising clients to
remain focused on understanding and adapting to the needs of today's
empowered and informed consumers as a means of differentiation in 2009.

    In 2008 the rapid proliferation of mobile devices and rise of social
networking have dramatically changed consumer expectations and behaviors
and have impacted the future of a number of industries including: consumer
electronics, travel, media and entertainment, retail and auto. Consumers
are in more control than ever before, and through the use of these tools,
can easily rally fellow consumers to demand products and services that are
tailored to them and improve their lives.

    Further evidence of this growing consumer control point was noted in IBM's
Global CEO Study, the largest study of chief executives ever conducted.
CEOs pointed specifically to their own customer base as the source of the
most important changes they will have to address, as two new and more
demanding classes of customers emerged: the 'information omnivore,' and
the 'socially-minded' customer.

    Overall CEOs are planning a 22 percent increase in investments in the next
three years to serve these more sophisticated and demanding customers.
CEOs in the U.S., Europe and China indicated they plan an average
investment jump of 19 percent at these targeted customers over the next
three years.

    "Consumers are becoming 'producers,' often creating entertainment and
advertising content for their peers while demanding flexibility and
responsiveness from companies with whom they choose to do business. These
customers are more demanding; however, the majority of CEOs do not see
them as a threat, but as an opportunity for differentiation -- based on
meeting the heightened expectations of this group, and capitalizing on
new market opportunities that will emerge," said Peter Korsten, Global
Leader, IBM Institute for Business Value. "Dealing with this new breed of
consumer in the midst of a whole new economic environment will play a
major role in companies' agendas for the foreseeable future."

    Consistent consumer attitude and behavior was also seen across multiple
industries based on the studies conducted by the IBM Institute for
Business Value:

Consumer Electronics

    Consumers desire greater affordability, awareness and better content and
applications for the mobile Internet. In terms of device features, the
survey found consumers prefer a large screen, high resolution, internal
memory, and quick speed data transfer as the most important and desired
features in their mobile device.  Over 50 percent of consumers polled
stated that they would substitute their Internet usage on a PC for a
mobile device.  Consumers are most loyal to their preferred brands for
communication services such as email and instant messaging. 

    Travel

    Consumers cited the biggest airline "rip-offs" to be baggage fees (78
percent), additional charges for redemption of miles (76 percent) and
first class ticket prices (58 percent).  58 percent prefer paying the
lowest possible ticket price, sacrificing all amenities like food,
blankets, pillows, beverages and headphones. 

    Media &amp; Entertainment

    Large scale adoption and usage of digital content services accessed via
the PC and mobile phone, with ad-supported models (versus consumer-paid)
was preferred almost three to one by respondents globally.  Interest in
mobile video content has more than doubled since last year to 55 percent. 
For both PC and mobile video, over 70 percent of respondents prefer
advertising-supported models as opposed to consumer-paid models,
representing a huge growth opportunity for the industry.  Consumers
prefer to see advertising before or after a video.  Consumers listed free
high-quality music/videos, discounts to favorite stores and air
travel/hotel points as the most desired and attractive incentives. 

    Retail

    Between 46-50 percent of all shoppers in the U.S. and the UK admitted to
switching loyalties to retailers as they shopped across different
channels. Overall, most consumers cited price as their primary motivation
for change, followed by convenience and product availability.  Over 75
percent of shoppers cited that they prefer shopping "Online to Store"
followed by "Store to Online" (7+ percent) and "Online to Call Center"
(3+ percent) across all product categories -- these combinations were
nearly identical for U.S. and UK consumers. 

    Auto

    Consumers are demanding more information and entertainment from their
vehicles, as well as increased safety, economy, and environmental
responsibility.  Consumers will expect to purchase or lease a vehicle
that comes with flexible access to a diverse "garage" of vehicles. 
Consumers want an automotive experience that matches their lifestyles and
lets them move seamlessly from life inside the vehicle to their world
outside.

&lt;p&gt;ZURICH Dec 22 (Reuters) - UBS (UBSN.VX) has sold some of
its non-strategic commodities businesses to J.P. Morgan for an
undisclosed amount, the Swiss bank said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan had bought all of the Canadian-based commodities

bank would focus on client franchises in the securities and

certain business activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As part of this, the investment bank is exiting all of its

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 23 (Reuters) - U.S. worker safety regulators
are investigating working conditions at the nation's
second-largest refinery during Hurricane Gustav in early
September, according to officials on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health

Louisiana, refinery filed in early September, but declined to

the 503,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery said the complaint
was filed after workers had to manually shut refinery units in
90-mile-per-hour (145 kph) winds after electrical power to the
refinery was knocked out by the storm on Sept. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They double- and triple-manned for the hurricane and what
they didn't plan for was when we lose our power, our steam, our
nitrogen and these guys have to go out in hurricane winds with

&lt;p&gt;Check Point SmartDefense protections already protect users against latest
Microsoft SQL Server threat
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CHKP), the worldwide leader in
securing the Internet, today announced through Check Point SmartDefense
Services, users of VPN-1 R65 and R62, VSX NGX R65 and IPS-1 R65 are already
protected from an unpatched, publically available Microsoft SQL Server buffer
overflow vulnerability. 

An attacker can take advantage of the vulnerability by creating a specially
crafted Structured Query Language (SQL) request and sending it to a targeted
server, triggering a memory overwrite. Successful exploitation would cause a
denial of service and may allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on a
vulnerable system. The threat affects users of SQL Server 2000 and 2005. Check
Point rates the severity of vulnerability as critical. 

"SQL Server vulnerabilities such as this are relatively easy for hackers to
exploit and leave businesses quite vulnerable," said Oded Gonda, vice president
of network security products at Check Point. "It`s the goal of Check Point
SmartDefense Services to provide our customers with immediate protection from
the latest threats, which often arise before patches are available." 

Check Point SmartDefense provides intrusion prevention capabilities that are
integrated into Check Point gateways. SmartDefense is updated by SmartDefense
Services, which provide ongoing and real-time updates and configuration
advisories for defenses and security policies. SmartDefense protections are
developed and distributed by SmartDefense Research and Response Centers located
around the globe. 

More information about the vulnerability and the SmartDefense protection can be
found at Check Point's Security Research and Response website:

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader" will have to sail without Disney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studio said Tuesday that for budgetary and logistical reasons it will not exercise its option to co-produce and co-finance the next "Narnia" movie with producer Walden Media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third entry in the series, based on the classic books by C.S. Lewis, was in preproduction and set for a spring shoot for a planned May 2010 release. The development puts the participation of the talent attached in doubt. Michael Apted was on board to direct a script by Steven Knight. The key players of the second installment, "Prince Caspian" -- Ben Barnes, Georgie Henley, William Moseley and Anna Popplewell -- were to return for the third film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is rare for a studio to pull out of a planned trilogy in midstream, but the number-crunching showed a franchise on a downward trend. "Lion" roared to $745 million worldwide. This year, "Prince Caspian" grossed just $419 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walden has a strong relationship with the Lewis estate and will shop "Treader" in hopes of finding a new partner. The most likely candidate at this stage is Fox, which markets and distributes Walden fare under the Fox Walden banner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any partnership on a "Narnia" movie will require a substantial investment. "Caspian," which filmed in the Czech Republic, Mexico and New Zealand, cost $200 million. The first film, "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," was shot mostly in New Zealand for $180 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further challenging "Treader" may be a waning of the pricey children's fantasy genre. When the "Harry Potter" series topped the book charts and then filled movie theaters, studios began snapping up fantasy manuscripts as quickly as they could. When "The Lord of the Rings" showed it was possible for adults to enjoy the fare as well -- and produced the box-office results to prove it -- Hollywood's fascination with the genre intensified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no other fantasy adventure films have shown that kind of box office punch. Earlier this year, Warners and New Line hoped they were launching a franchise with "The Golden Compass," but the adaptation of the Philip Pullman trilogy tanked domestically. The film grossed just $70 million domestically and the co-production partners declined to go forward with a second installment despite the fact the film did take in more than $300 million overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters Life!) - An Australian scientist is doping up honey bees with cocaine to study how their brain reacts to the drug, and possibly find a way to stop addiction in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research found similarities between honey bees and humans, in that they are both are driven by rewards and both have their judgment altered by cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time that it's been shown that cocaine has been rewarding to an insect," Andrew Barron, co-author of the report published this month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a joint project between Australia's Macquarie University, the Australian National University and University of Illinois, Barren applied tiny doses of cocaine to the backs of bees before sending them out to hunt for food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally when bees return from collecting pollen they perform a dance to communicate where the food was found and how good it tasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cocaine-induced honey bees "waggledanced" much more enthusiastically than other bees, and seemed to experience the same addictive pleasures as humans, the report added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barron said the cocaine changed the bees' estimation of how successful its trip had been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found was that the honey bee responds to cocaine in very similar ways as humans, so cocaine changes the way the bees evaluate," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also found that when we let the bees go 'cold turkey', they had real difficulties learning, which is the same thing you see in humans when they go through withdrawal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barron said he hoped to identify the neural pathways that cocaine targets in bees to find out more about the mechanisms involved in human addiction and to find out whether the drug has as devastating an effect on bee society as it does on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we could do that, we could possibly develop new treatments to prevent or treat addiction," he said, adding that the bees used in the experiment were not harmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Miral Fahmy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters Life!) - An Australian scientist is doping up honey bees with cocaine to study how their brain reacts to the drug, and possibly find a way to stop addiction in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research found similarities between honey bees and humans, in that they are both are driven by rewards and both have their judgment altered by cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time that it's been shown that cocaine has been rewarding to an insect," Andrew Barron, co-author of the report published this month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a joint project between Australia's Macquarie University, the Australian National University and University of Illinois, Barren applied tiny doses of cocaine to the backs of bees before sending them out to hunt for food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally when bees return from collecting pollen they perform a dance to communicate where the food was found and how good it tasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cocaine-induced honey bees "waggledanced" much more enthusiastically than other bees, and seemed to experience the same addictive pleasures as humans, the report added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barron said the cocaine changed the bees' estimation of how successful its trip had been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found was that the honey bee responds to cocaine in very similar ways as humans, so cocaine changes the way the bees evaluate," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also found that when we let the bees go 'cold turkey', they had real difficulties learning, which is the same thing you see in humans when they go through withdrawal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barron said he hoped to identify the neural pathways that cocaine targets in bees to find out more about the mechanisms involved in human addiction and to find out whether the drug has as devastating an effect on bee society as it does on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we could do that, we could possibly develop new treatments to prevent or treat addiction," he said, adding that the bees used in the experiment were not harmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Miral Fahmy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Dec 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
A Briggs Passport and Visa Expeditors (http://www.abriggs.com) has
established Northern California headquarters in San Francisco's Financial
District at 50 California Street, corner of California and Davis, a block
away from BART, MUNI and Market Street public transportation. Telephone
is 415-626-5860.

    "Despite the economic slowdown, we are experiencing strong demand for our
passport and visa expediting services in the San Francisco market. San
Francisco International Airport (SFO), the 'gateway to the Pacific,' is a
world-class airport serving tens of millions of domestic and international
passengers annually. That drove our decision to open a dedicated visa and
passport service facility in downtown San Francisco," said Porter Briggs,
President of A Briggs.

    "Our corporate, educational and health care customers are still traveling
and depend on totally secure and thoroughly professional services,"
continued Mr. Briggs. "The tourist demand is still strong on the high end,
especially with all the discounted specials being offered by popular
destinations. Also, beginning June 2009, the Western Hemisphere Travel
Initiative (WHTI) will require everyone to have a passport book or card or
a new enhanced driver's license to cross a U.S. border -- all of which
accelerates the demand."

    Mr. Briggs in welcoming Joan Caldwell as Director of the San Francisco
office said, "Ms. Caldwell brings extensive experience in the areas of
Customer Service, Supply Chain Management, Global Business, Systems
Implementation, Process Improvements, Facilitation, Financial and Risk
Analysis, and Project Management. Prior to joining A Briggs, Ms. Caldwell
worked for the Levi Strauss Company for 23 years and served as Vice
President for Sourcing, Inventory, and Production Planning."

United States (U.S.) passports and travel visas as quickly as six hours.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Mylan, Inc. (NYSE: MYL), Reddy Ice Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: FRZ), National
Semiconductor Corp. (NYSE: NSM), Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Jamba, Inc.
(NASDAQ: JMBA). 

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from
the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Mylan Generics Fairly Traded

Mylan, Inc. (NYSE: MYL) is engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing,
licensing, and distribution of generic, branded, and branded generic
pharmaceutical products, as well as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
With the acquisition of Merck Generics and Matrix Labs, Mylan is now the third
largest generic company in the world. 

We expect the Merck Generics acquisition to allow Mylan to expand its footprints
in non-U.S. markets and to contribute significantly to long-term growth. Mylan
also announced certain strategic initiatives which should help drive long-term
growth. Besides this, Mylan has been working on improving its capital structure,
which should help ease concerns regarding its liquidity position. 

Reddy Ice to Melt Further

Headquartered in Dallas, TX, Reddy Ice Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: FRZ) is the largest
manufacturer and distributor of packaged ice in the United States. The company
sells its products primarily under the Reddy Ice brand to approximately 82,000
consumer locations in 31 states and the District of Columbia. 

Management is attempting to grow the top line through an aggressive acquisition
strategy. However, due to adverse weather conditions in 2007, management twice
lowered guidance. In 2008, management lowered guidance after reporting earnings
each and every quarter. In September 2008, the Board suspended payment of the
quarterly cash dividend. 

Nat'l Semi an Outstanding Value

National Semiconductor Corp. (NYSE: NSM) is an OEM [original equipment
manufacturer] of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. November quarter
revenue fell short of consensus expectations on both the top and bottom lines. 

Forward guidance is for a revenue decline of -30% in the next quarter. New
higher-margin products continue to grow in the mix, and management has refocused
R [research and development] into areas that should sustain margins. 

Pfizer Has Many Opportunities

Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE) is the world's largest pharmaceutical company in terms
of sales. In 2007, Pfizer posted sales from continuing operations of $48.4
billion, which was flat from 2006. 

Although we believe Pfizer continues to face an uphill battle in growing its
top-line given the company's sheer size and lack of a significant pipeline,
near-term earnings growth will come in the form of cost-cutting and share
repurchases. We are also concerned with the lack a catalyst to increase revenues
once Lipitor loses patent exclusivity in 2011. 

Jamba Looking Squeezed Out

We maintain our Sell rating on shares of Jamba, Inc. (NASDAQ: JMBA). As with
many fast-growing restaurant chains, Jamba is suffering from the effects of
uncontrolled growth that has led to under-performing locations being opened and
a loss of attention to both innovation and current consumer trends. 

Management has formulated a turnaround plan that will curtail unit expansion
until store level performance improves, improve site selection, retrench
non-store level personnel, close 31 under-performing stores, innovate menu
offerings, and build relevance and awareness through effective marketing. Early
indications are positive: the last 17 stores opened are generating AUVs [average
unit volumes] that are 27% greater than those opened in 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - For investment bankers who arrange the sale of stocks and bonds, 2008 was a year to forget, and the new year may not bring instant relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) was the world's largest underwriter in 2008 as measured by issuance volume, helped by its acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ended an eight-year run at the top for Citigroup Inc (C.N), but Citigroup still edged out JPMorgan for the top spot in reported fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mounting asset writedowns and loan losses morphed into a worldwide credit crisis, total securities underwriting slid 38 percent to $4.71 trillion, a six-year low, from $7.6 trillion in 2007. The number of new issues fell 41 percent. Reported fees dropped 17 percent to $13.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problems worsened as the year droned on; volume in the fourth quarter totaled $678.8 billion, down 52 percent from a year earlier and 15 percent from the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was clearly an avoidance of risk," said Bruce Thompson, head of global capital markets at Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), who will keep that job after the bank finishes buying Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N, expected Thursday. "In the fourth quarter, there was an evolution from what had been concern about markets to concern about the overall economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some asset classes fared particularly poorly in the fourth quarter. In the United States, issuance volume slid 95 percent in mortgage-backed securities, 96 percent in junk bonds, and 97 percent in asset-backed securities, Thomson Reuters said. U.S. commercial mortgage securities issuance fell to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall issuance would have been even lower but for tens of billions of dollars of debt issued by financial companies with the backing of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were a whole lot of issuers who could not get money out of the investment-grade corporate bond market at any price, specifically issuers whose businesses were deemed to be very cyclical," said Nigel Cree, head of syndication for North America at Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan handled $455.1 billion of new issue volume for the year. Barclays Plc (BARC.L) was next with $401.3 billion, reflecting its purchase of much of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK, followed by Citigroup with $309 billion. In the fourth quarter, JPMorgan also ranked first, followed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fees, Citigroup reported $1.67 billion in 2008, followed by JPMorgan and Merrill. Bank of America, Goldman and JPMorgan led in the fourth quarter, when overall fees fell 52 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARNAGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issuance sputtered in the worst financial crisis since at least World War II, with even the most optimistic forecasters saying economies aren't likely to recover before mid-2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnage such as the Lehman bankruptcy, government takeovers of mortgage financiers Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, a $152 billion bailout of insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N), and the sales of Merrill and Wachovia Corp WB.N led nervous investors to reduce debt and shun securities they perceived to carry credit risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors flocked to the relative safety of U.S. Treasuries amid a flood of redemptions from mutual funds and hedge funds. Demand for some riskier securities such as collateralized debt obligations all but vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major U.S. stock indexes lost two-fifths of their value during the year, and losses even piled up in fixed income. Through Tuesday, total returns in 2008 were minus 27 percent on junk bonds and minus 21 percent on asset-backed debt, and even safer corporate bonds and municipal bonds left investors in the red, according to Merrill data. Treasuries, in contrast, were up 14.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More problems could lie ahead as investors stay wary about risk. "Sales could still be tough in the first half of the year," said Mirko Mikelic, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major credit rating agencies have said the U.S. junk bond default rate could reach double digits in 2009. Consumers are spending less, and tight credit markets are making it hard for companies to refinance existing debt or fund day-to-day needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, low stock prices and high market volatility may leave many companies loathe to issue shares or go public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America's Thompson expects issuance in 2009 to rise from the fourth quarter. "Companies have pent-up demand for issuance because of their inability to raise capital," he said. "Investors, meanwhile, are trying to get a handle about companies' performance over the next six to 12 months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Dena Aubin, Walden Siew and Phil Wahba; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 31 (Reuters) - For investment bankers who
arrange the sale of stocks and bonds, 2008 was a year to
forget, and the new year may not bring instant relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) was the world's largest
underwriter in 2008 as measured by issuance volume, helped by
its acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos, according to Thomson
Reuters data released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That ended an eight-year run at the top for Citigroup Inc
(C.N), but Citigroup still edged out JPMorgan for the top spot
in reported fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As mounting asset writedowns and loan losses morphed into a
worldwide credit crisis, total securities underwriting slid 38
percent to $4.71 trillion, a six-year low, from $7.6 trillion
in 2007. The number of new issues fell 41 percent. Reported
fees dropped 17 percent to $13.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Problems worsened as the year droned on; volume in the
fourth quarter totaled $678.8 billion, down 52 percent from a
year earlier and 15 percent from the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was clearly an avoidance of risk," said Bruce
Thompson, head of global capital markets at Bank of America
Corp (BAC.N), who will keep that job after the bank finishes
buying Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N, expected Thursday. "In
the fourth quarter, there was an evolution from what had been
concern about markets to concern about the overall economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some asset classes fared particularly poorly in the fourth
quarter. In the United States, issuance volume slid 95 percent
in mortgage-backed securities, 96 percent in junk bonds, and 97
percent in asset-backed securities, Thomson Reuters said. U.S.
commercial mortgage securities issuance fell to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall issuance would have been even lower but for tens of
billions of dollars of debt issued by financial companies with
the backing of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There were a whole lot of issuers who could not get money
out of the investment-grade corporate bond market at any price,
specifically issuers whose businesses were deemed to be very
cyclical," said Nigel Cree, head of syndication for North
America at Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan handled $455.1 billion of new issue volume for the
year. Barclays Plc (BARC.L) was next with $401.3 billion,
reflecting its purchase of much of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
LEHMQ.PK, followed by Citigroup with $309 billion. In the
fourth quarter, JPMorgan also ranked first, followed by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fees, Citigroup reported $1.67 billion in 2008, followed
by JPMorgan and Merrill. Bank of America, Goldman and JPMorgan
led in the fourth quarter, when overall fees fell 52 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CARNAGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Issuance sputtered in the worst financial crisis since at
least World War II, with even the most optimistic forecasters
saying economies aren't likely to recover before mid-2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carnage such as the Lehman bankruptcy, government takeovers
of mortgage financiers Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac
FRE.N, a $152 billion bailout of insurer American
International Group Inc (AIG.N), and the sales of Merrill and
Wachovia Corp WB.N led nervous investors to reduce debt and
shun securities they perceived to carry credit risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors flocked to the relative safety of U.S. Treasuries
amid a flood of redemptions from mutual funds and hedge funds.
Demand for some riskier securities such as collateralized debt
obligations all but vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major U.S. stock indexes lost two-fifths of their value
during the year, and losses even piled up in fixed income.
Through Tuesday, total returns in 2008 were minus 27 percent on
junk bonds and minus 21 percent on asset-backed debt, and even
safer corporate bonds and municipal bonds left investors in the
red, according to Merrill data. Treasuries, in contrast, were
up 14.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More problems could lie ahead as investors stay wary about
risk. "Sales could still be tough in the first half of the
year," said Mirko Mikelic, senior portfolio manager at Fifth
Third Asset Management in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major credit rating agencies have said the U.S. junk bond
default rate could reach double digits in 2009. Consumers are
spending less, and tight credit markets are making it hard for
companies to refinance existing debt or fund day-to-day needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, low stock prices and high market volatility may
leave many companies loathe to issue shares or go public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America's Thompson expects issuance in 2009 to rise
from the fourth quarter. "Companies have pent-up demand for
issuance because of their inability to raise capital," he said.
"Investors, meanwhile, are trying to get a handle about
companies' performance over the next six to 12 months."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds government spokeswoman's comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Dec 31 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's government may
accept equity rather than cash as repayment for part of a HK$6.1
billion (US$782 million) loan it gave to Hong Kong Disneyland,
its loss-making joint venture with Walt Disney Co, a local
newspaper said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sing Tao Daily newspaper, quoting unidentified sources,
said the proposal was made by Walt Disney and details were being
discussed with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A government spokeswoman said the government and Walt Disney
were discussing financing expansion plans for Hong Kong
Disneyland but no decisions had been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There may be a capital realignment of the joint venture
company, that is a possibility," the spokeswoman told Reuters.
"No conclusions have been made yet and we have no timetable for
(concluding) the discussions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government has a 57 percent stake in the joint venture
after investing HK$3.25 billion while Disney has a 43 percent
share, having invested HK$2.45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the U.S. company is looking for ways to fund a HK$3
billion expansion of the theme park, an equity conversion would
enable the government to retain its majority shareholding in
Hongkong International Theme Parks, the joint venture which runs
Hong Kong Disneyland, the newspaper report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposal would allow Disney to lower its overall debt
ratio and enhance its ability to borrow more money from banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture is financed by 40 percent equity and 60 percent
debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has borrowed HK$8.4 billion for the project,
comprising a HK$2.3 billion bank loan it paid off earlier this
year and the HK$6.1 billion government loan, which it was
supposed to repay within 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sing Tao said the government, if it agrees to the equity
conversion proposal, would probably need to get it passed in the
Legislative Council as it concerns taxpayers' money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong Disneyland has been losing money since opening in
2005 and the government has been criticised for pumping money
into the venture.
