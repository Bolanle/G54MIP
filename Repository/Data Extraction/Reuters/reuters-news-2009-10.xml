&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 1 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline demand peaked
in 2007 and will decline into the future as efficiency and the
development of biofuels and high-tech cars like hybrids speed
up, Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) top executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We think going forward that because of the emphasis on
energy efficiency, ongoing improvements in vehicle miles
standards and hybrid (cars), that motor vehicle gasoline demand
is down, is headed down, and is going to continue to head
down," Rex Tillerson, Exxon chief executive, said at an
Economic Club of Washington dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel, will continue to
chip away at demand in the world's largest consumer of motor
fuels, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. mandates require steady annual increases in the
blending of biofuels into gasoline and will peak at 36 billion
gallons of the alternative fuel by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. oil products demand was about 20 million barrels a day
in 2007 and should fall to about 17 million barrels by 2020,
Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The falling demand means the United States, which has not
built a new refinery from the ground up since 1973, will
"likely not" need to build another one, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Motor fuel demand is expected to keep growing in rapidly
developing countries like China, where many people are
acquiring their first gasoline-powered cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson reiterated that Exxon believed a carbon tax on
fossil fuels would reduce greenhouse gas emissions better than
a cap and trade market because it would be easier to administer
and be less subject to gaming by speculators. U.S. Senators
John Kerry and Barbara Boxer unveiled climate legislation on
Wednesday that would kick off a cap and trade market by 2012,
although the future of the bill is uncertain.

&lt;p&gt;   * IBM launches Internet-based email for businesses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Prices it below Google Apps email&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Oct 1 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) is introducing an
inexpensive Web-based corporate email service that will compete
with Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Google Apps, which has recently
suffered several high-profile outages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp will likely try to
capitalize on the damage that those outages have caused to
Google Apps over the past year. Last month millions of business
users could not access email for almost two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An IBM spokesman said on Thursday that the company will
start selling its LotusLive iNotes next week. The lightweight
email service will cost $36 per user per year, about 25 percent
less than what Google charges for a more robust product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's offering does not have as many bells and whistles as
Google's, but the technology giant could attract more customers
because it has decades more experience serving the business
market. Its products include Lotus Notes, one of the world's
two most widely used email programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google, on the other hand, generates the bulk of its
revenue from advertisements placed on free search products
targeted at consumers. It is just getting into the business of
selling to businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The IBM brand will help a lot," said Forrester Research
Inc analyst Liz Herbert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; iNotes will also compete with a Web-based email service
from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) that costs about $120 per user per
year, according to the software maker's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Chang)

&lt;p&gt;IBM this week is marking the 10th anniversary of its IBM developerWorks Web site, which features resources for software developers and IT professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With developerWorks, IBM sought to foster adherence to industry standards, company officials said this week. "Instead of building a developer portal that talked about DB2, we built a portal that talked about Java" and XML and Web services, said Dirk Nicol, IBM program director for emerging technology. He was the lead in setting up developerWorks, which has seen its traffic grow from 200,000 unique monthly visitors in 1999 to 4 million visitors per month now. (A quick look at the site Thursday, however, does show a degree of DB2-related material on the site's "Popular content" link.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Also on InfoWorld: IBM developerWorks has covered such topics as grid computing. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The growth that we've seen is directly attributable to how we have evaluated the needs of the involved IT professional," said Stephanie Martin, director of developerWorks at IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeveloperWorks has enabled IBM to get feedback on emerging technologies. The company's WebSphere middleware platform was one beneficiary, said Nicol. However, the intent of developerWorks has not necessarily been to build new products but to build marketplace skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we don't have Java and XML and Linux skills in the marketplace, we can't sell our products," Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having used the site as a place to promote technologies such as the jCentral search engine, which crawled the Web for Java code, developerWorks now is the domain for topics including cloud computing and IBM's "Smarter Planet" effort to promote interconnected, intelligent devices that leverage analytics. Other efforts will include tutorials and information on health care standards, privacy, and telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company added social networking capabilities to the site via the My developerWorks extension unveiled in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.infoworld.com/node/94125&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft Corp.'s frontal attack on Google Inc. with its well-received Bing search engine, Google moved today to keep its huge lead in the business by adding some shiny, new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google released nine new Search Options tools today, giving users more ways to manipulate their search results and get down to what they're really looking for, according to Nundu Janakiram , a Google product manager, and Patrick Riley, a software engineer, in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web company first released Google Search Options in May. The product is a collection of tools designed to let users better "slice and dice" search results so they can massage the information they're getting. The tool should help people who struggle to decide exactly which query they should pose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the tool included options to narrow the search down by filtering out anything but forum sites, for instance, or only seeing results from the past week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Google expanded the options to further narrow results to information posted in the past hour, from visited pages or from not yet visited pages. The new tools can also limit searches to books, blogs and/or news sites. The tools also let users expand or narrow the number of shopping sites they receive results from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With these tools you can choose to see only the most recent results in our index, or see results from a specific time period," wrote Janakiram and Riley. "This can be particularly helpful when you're looking for the freshest information, or if you have some idea of when the information you're looking for may have been published to the web."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Google features come as Bing, Microsoft's overhauled search engine, starts slowly gaining ground in the search market. Last month, Nielsen Co. reported that Bing's share of the search market grew by 22.1% from 9% in July to 10.7% in August. That performance made Bing the fastest growing search engine in Nielsen's top 10 list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been busy beefing up Bing in hopes that it will eventually give Google a run for its money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Microsoft released a beta version of a tool called Visual Search , which is designed to let Bing users search through galleries of images instead of mainly text. Visual Search met with applause from some analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in another shot at Google, Microsoft this summer agreed to enter into a partnership with Yahoo , which will let Bing power its sites. The proposed alliance -- which still must pass antitrust muster -- could give the two companies some much-needed leverage in their ongoing battle against Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though demand for H-1B visas fell sharply this year, the debate over the program that lets employers temporarily hire foreign technology and other specialty workers has continued to intensify, especially in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government's fiscal year began today with some 66,700 H-1B visas set to be issued, and nearly 20,000 still available under the cap of 85,000. A year ago, the available issues were reserved long before the start of fiscal 2009 after the government received 163,000 visa petitions within days of April 1, 2008, the first day applications were accepted. Thus the fiscal 2009 visa winners were selected via a lottery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the the waning interest in applying for visas as the economy declined, Congress is gearing up for what may be the final showdown over H-1B, arguably the most heated technology issue today. The status of the visa could be resolved for the long term during the debate expected during fiscal 2010 over comprehensive immigration reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list of fiscal 2009's 10 top H-1B stories, as compiled by Computerworld , follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number One : Senators Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) filed the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2009. The bill, which has not yet faced a Congressional hearing, has already become the rallying point for H-1B opponents and a top concern for the technology industry as a whole. The sweeping measure would require companies to post all help wanted ads on the Internet, and first complete "good-faith" efforts to fill the posted jobs with U.S. workers. The bill also includes new wage requirements which would raise the salaries of the lowest paid visa holders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian offshore firms appear most concerned about the bill because it would limit the number of visa holders they could employ to 50% of their U.S. workforce. Durbin and Grassley are both members of the Senate subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security and positioned to influence any comprehensive immigration reform legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number Two : The continuing debate over a comprehensive immigration reform prior to the filing of a bill in Congress. Leading the debate is Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), who heads the subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security and is an ardent supporter of the H-1B visa program. Schumer offered a tip about what he wants in a reform bill by inviting former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to a committee hearing on immigration reform earlier this year. Greenspan called for an end to visa restrictions and said the H-1B cap protects tech workers from global competition. In fact, Greenspan called the U.S. tech workers a " privileged elite ."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number Three : The indication that Congress would be willing to set restrictions on the H-1B visa program when it approved the $700 billion Trouble Asset Relief Program (TARP) in February. An amendment to the bailout bill by Sens. Grassley and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) imposed H-1B restrictions on banks that receive bailout funds. The restriction requires that the banks make a good faith effort to hire U.S. workers, though it didn't limit their use of offshore outsourcing firms. The measure was driven by public anger over the bailout and fears of job losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number Four : The decision by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) to step up enforcement of the H-1B visa petition process, demanding more evidence from companies to support the need for foreign workers. The paper chase was launched following a USCIS report last fall that found nearly 20% of H-1B visa applications had problems, which included fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number Five : A study by researchers at the New York University's Stern School of Business and Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania found evidence that H-1B use is reducing tech wages by as much as 6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number Six : Demand for H-1B visas declined, at least temporarily, in recent months. Randall Sidlosca, an immigration attorney at Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak  Stewart, PC in Miami, said the main reason for the decline is the economic downturn, though the TARP restrictions also played a role. The lack of H-1B jobs has prompted many foreign national students in U.S. universities to seek additional degrees, according to Sarah Hawk, who heads the immigration practice at Fisher  Phillips LLP in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number Seven : The U.S. Department of Justice filed H-1B fraud charges against a dozen people and companies, alleging that they were "displacing qualified American workers," by avoiding prevailing wage laws, undercutting tech worker salaries and treating H-1B workers as itinerant laborers. Some say it was the largest H-1B enforcement action ever taken by the federal government on the H-1B program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number Eight : President Barack Obama appointed strong supporters of H-1B visas to positions in his administration. The Obama administration has yet to outline its approach to the H-1B visa issue, but the views of his appointees, or at least the companies they have worked for, are well known. For example, Diana Farrell, deputy director of the National Economic Council, is a former executive at McKinsey  Co., a consulting firm that has produced research that concludes offshore outsourcing is a means to improving the U.S. economy. Janet Napolitano, the former governor of Arizona and now secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the USCIS, is another H-1B advocate. Google Inc. CEO Eric Schmidt, who has also argued against cap restrictions, was appointed to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), along with Microsoft's Chief Research and Strategy Officer Craig Mundie. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has been a leading proponent of ending the visa restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number Nine : The Programmers Guild's legal challenged a decision by President George W. Bush's administration to increase the term of student visas from one year to 29 months. But the case forced tech workers into a Catch-22 situation after the government argued that the guild and its co-filers didn't have standing to bring a case, which raised the question of who should file the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number Ten : The shrinking IT job market brings the H-1B debate into clearer focus. For the technology industry and tech workers, the H-1B visa is at the heart of the globalization issue. Unless the tech employment picture improves before the immigration reform debate reaches its apex, The H-1B issue will draw ever sharper focus. It is a fight between those who believe H-1B visas are needed to foster economic growth, and those who see the visa as a means for displacing U.S. workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and revises the Rating Outlooks on 22 classes of
commercial mortgage pass-through certificates from J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Trust 2006-LDP9. A detailed list of rating actions follows
at the end of this press release. 

The downgrades are the result of loss expectations and reflect Fitch's
prospective views regarding commercial real estate market value and cash flow
declines. Fitch forecasts potential losses of 8.4% for this transaction, should
market conditions not recover. Today's rating actions are based on losses of
5.5%, including 100% of the losses associated with term defaults and any losses
associated with maturities within the next five years. Given the significant
term to maturity, Fitch's actions only account for 25% of the losses associated
with maturities beyond five years. The bonds with Negative Outlooks indicate
classes that may be downgraded in the future should full potential losses be
realized. 

Fitch analyzed the transaction and calculated expected losses by assuming cash
flows on each of the properties decline 15% from year-end (YE) 2007 and property
values decline 35% from issuance. These loss estimates were reviewed in more
detail for loans representing 67.3% of the pool and, in certain cases, revised
based on additional information and/or property characteristics. 

Approximately 24% of the mortgages mature in the next five four years, and 73%
of the pool is scheduled to mature in 2017. 

Fitch identified 29 Loans of Concern (13.7%) within the pool, 16 of which (3.3%)
are specially serviced. One of the specially serviced loans, Tysons Galleria,
remains current while the rest are delinquent. One of the Fitch Loans of Concern
(7.8%) is within the transaction's top 15 loans by unpaid principal balance. 

Two of the loans within the top 15 (6.1%) are expected to default during their
term with loss severities ranging from 18.7% through 18.8%. Seven of the top 15
loans (20.5%) are expected to default at maturity, with loss severities ranging
from 11.1 to 19.1%. The largest contributors to loss are as follows: Galleria
Towers (4.9% of the pool), 131 South Dearborn (4.8% of the pool), The Belnord
(7.8% of the pool) and the Americold Portfolio (4% of the pool). 

The Galleria Towers loan is secured by three office buildings located in the
North Dallas office market. The loan is sponsored by Joel and Margaret
Kestenbaum. The loan continues to be current with combined occupancy, as of year
end (YE) 2008, at 94%. The servicer reported DSCR for YE 2008 and issuance was
1.30 times (x) and 1.28x, respectively. Given the high leverage nature of the
loan and its interest-only structure, Fitch expects a default at maturity, and
the loan to incur losses of approximately 20%. 

The 131 South Dearborn loan is secured by 1,504,364 sf office property located
in Chicago, IL. The loan is sponsored by Robert M. Gans. The loan continues to
be current with occupancy, as of June 2009, at 95%. The servicer reported DSCR
for YE 2008 and issuance was 1.18x and 1.28x, respectively. Given the high
leverage nature of the loan and its interest-only structure, Fitch expects a
default at maturity, and the loan to incur losses of approximately 20%. 

The Belnord loan is secured by a 215 unit residential rental property located in
the Upper West Side neighborhood of New York City. In addition to the
residential rentals, the property also includes 60,514 sf of retail space. The
loan is sponsored by Gary Barnett. The property consists of both rent controlled
/ stabilized and market rent units. At issuance, the borrower estimated that
units would be converted from rent controlled / stabilized to market rents
benefiting from the upside in revenue. Although recent leases show that achieved
market rents are slightly below expectations, the process of converting rent
controlled / stabilized units to market rent has fallen behind schedule. The YE
2008 DSCR and occupancy was 96% and 0.64x compared to issuance of 98% and 0.47x,
respectively. The loan was structured with a $50 million reserve for debt
service shortfall, of which $28 million remains outstanding. Fitch expects that,
at current operating levels, the debt service is sufficient to cover shortfalls
for the next three to four years. Fitch expects a default at maturity and the
loan to incur losses of approximately 10%. 

The Americold Portfolio is secured by four cold storage warehouse/distribution
facilities totaling 3,328,621 sf (51,654,912 cubic feet) located across four
states. More specifically, the properties are located in Carthage, MO (66% of
portfolio NRA); Fort Worth, TX (14.3% of portfolio NRA); West Point, MS (10.3%
of portfolio NRA) and Garden City, KS (9.5% of portfolio NRA). The loan is
sponsored by Vornado Realty Trust, Crescent Real Estate Equities and the Yucaipa
Companies. The loan continues to be current. The servicer reported DSCR for YE
2008 and issuance was 0.98x and 1.85x, respectively. The drop in DSCR is
attributed to the loss of a major tenant, Sarah Lee, who has ceased renting
space in the Fort Worth property. Given the high leverage nature of the loan and
its interest-only structure, Fitch expects a default at maturity, and the loan
to incur losses of approximately 20%.

(RRs) to the following classes as indicated: 

--$318.5 million class A-J to 'BBB/LS3' from 'AAA; Outlook Negative;

(JPM.N) private equity firm, according to a prospectus filed

revenue of $428.8 million, down 30 percent from a year earlier,

downturns in the automotive and construction sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said operations could suffer if chemicals company
LyondellBasell Industries [ACCEIN.UL], a major supplier that
operates two European plants for Kraton, fails to meet its
obligations to Kraton because of the bankruptcy of Lyondell's
U.S. operations earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IPO is being managed by Credit Suisse, Bank of America

&lt;p&gt;
 * Cutting-Edge Fuel Cell Technology
 * Lowers Costs and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
 * Maintains Productivity With Convenient In-Plant Refueling Stations
LATHAM, N.Y., Oct. 1, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The nation's second largest
Coca-Cola bottler will install 40 hydrogen-powered forklifts at its Charlotte,
North Carolina production center. Plug Power Inc. (Nasdaq:PLUG), a leader in
providing clean, reliable energy solutions, announced today that it will provide
its class-1 sit down counterbalanced GenDrive(TM) fuel cell solution to
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated early in 2010.

"With these fuel cell materials handling units, we will be able to maintain
productivity, decrease operating costs and lower greenhouse gas emissions by 30
percent," said Coca-Cola Consolidated spokesman Lauren C. Steele. "We assessed
many different technologies for our materials handling fleet and believe the
Plug Power fuel cell units give us the best overall solution."

In deciding to convert its material handling fleet from internal combustion to a
cleaner technology, Coca-Cola Consolidated considered several options. One
alternative, batteries, would allow the company to move to electric lift trucks,
but consumed valuable facility space with battery charging equipment and
infrastructure. With batteries also came operator downtime and decreased
productivity as time is spent changing and charging the power source.

With Plug Power's GenDrive fuel cell, the soft drink manufacturer is able to
maintain productivity, cut operating costs and lower greenhouse gas emissions
significantly. Operators are able to run equipment at full speed for an entire
shift, thus maximizing efficiency. Compact hydrogen fueling stations are
conveniently located throughout the facility, allowing for easy refueling.
Successful product demonstrations under rigorous conditions proved GenDrive as a
commercially viable power alternative for Coca Cola Consolidated's
high-throughput operations.

"Coca-Cola Consolidated's acceptance of Plug Power's GenDrive fuel cell solution
again emphasizes the commercial readiness of this product for the material
handing market," said Tom Hoying, Vice President of Sales for Plug Power Inc.
"Plug Power was able to provide this significant customer with a proven solution
allowing them to lower operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions without
sacrificing productivity."

Plug Power Inc. (Nasdaq:PLUG), an established leader in the development and
deployment of clean, reliable energy solutions, integrates fuel cell technology
into motive and continuous power products. The Company is actively engaged with

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Oct 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Compugen today announced that it has become the first Microsoft(R)
Authorized Refurbisher (MAR) in Canada. MAR is a new program offered by
Microsoft enabling Compugen to provide genuine Microsoft software on
professionally refurbished computers. This eliminates the risk of buying
used computers without these protections.

    Rising awareness of intellectual property rights has made business owners
and consumers ask their supplier whether they have the full rights they
believe they are paying for when they buy a system that is refurbished
and loaded with an operating system-can they get support, is the software
legitimate, etc.?

    Microsoft has recently announced the instigation of lawsuits against a
number of used computer resellers whom they believe are acting with
wilful disregard for licensing rights-operations that obtain off-lease
equipment, wipe and refurbish, and resell it with an unlicensed operating
system to unsuspecting customers.

    "The time is right for action to be taken," said Steve Glover, President
of Compugen Finance, the financing, refurbishing and recycling division
of Compugen Inc. "A healthy supply chain is critical to consumer and
business protection, and that means we all need to compete on a level
playing field. There is pressure on suppliers to keep the price down, and
legitimate suppliers have to compete with others who may ignore licensing
requirements."

    Compugen Finance acquires used Tier 1 equipment as part of its asset
reuse and recycle programs - an extension of Compugen's Green IT
initiatives. Items that can be refurbished, made warrantable and put back
into service are sold into the education market, small businesses and
major chains such as The Source where consumers can pick up excellent
value in used equipment, as well as new PCs.

    "Compugen's participation in the MAR program allows us to show our
customers that our resale equipment comes to them from legitimate
sources. MARs operate according to stringent guidelines that protect the
software vendor, the reputation of the hardware manufacturer, the
retailer and the consumer. The MAR program will help level the playing
field and make it easier for us to show our customers-through the new
certificates of authenticity provided-that their purchases are fully
legitimate, warranted and they are protected down the road," said Kevin
Luff, Vice President of The Source. "We back what we sell and Compugen
makes it easy for us to do this with the used equipment they provide."

    Microsoft has developed its MAR program to ensure that Microsoft,
retailers and refurbishers work together seamlessly to provide a superior
end-user experience with refurbished equipment.

    "The MAR program is rapidly expanding around the world and we are excited
that Compugen is joining as the first MAR partner in Canada. The criteria
for joining is very selective, so this designation speaks to the overall
calibre of Compugen as a large, established refurbisher, and to the
expertise required to deliver high quality on its refurbished products,"
says Bradley Hopkinson, director, Microsoft WW Genuine Windows.
"Compugen's preinstallation of genuine Microsoft licensed software
underscores their commitment to delivering refurbished computers with
exceptional value and security."

    About the MAR Program

    Under the commercial MAR program, Compugen receives access to Microsoft's
proprietary tools, enabling the company to install a genuine Microsoft
Windows XP operating system on each of the thousands of refurbished
computers it processes for remarketing each month. Compugen also is
permitted to affix a Microsoft Windows XP Certificate of Authenticity
(COA) label on each of the PCs it remarkets, providing a sign of due
diligence in licensing terms. Compugen has for some time participated in
the Community MAR program, which assists eligible organizations in
acquiring refurbished hardware, fully licensed and ready for use.

    The MAR program is only for large, established refurbishers: guidelines
require significant volumes of equipment being processed, adequate
systems for data wiping and reporting, technical expertise for
pre-installing Microsoft Windows operating systems in large volume,
appropriate security measures to ensure safe handling and storage of high
value assets and software licenses, and conformance with all applicable
regulations. The MAR program was introduced in the United States
relatively recently and Compugen is at the leading edge of the MAR
program in Canada.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct 1 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Leap Wireless International Inc LEAP.O and MetroPCS Communications Inc PCS.N to "neutral" from "overweight," saying competitive pressures were mounting in the wireless industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have become increasingly concerned with wireless fundamentals as the industry faces secular challenges, with high penetration and heavy competition causing downward movement on price and increased acquisition costs," analyst Mike McCormack said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Leap Wireless and MetroPCS have been forced to operate more and more defensively, McCormack said, adding that he expects to see additional erosion of average revenue per user over time, while the long-term margin outlook could be challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both companies have provided long-term outlook margins in the mid-40 percent range. However, they could run into challenges affecting their level of profitability, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    McCormack said he is cautious about the companies' ability to continue scaling effectively in the long run, citing increase in acquisition costs to win market share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The analyst has a price target of $22 on Leap Wireless shares, and $10 on MetroPCS shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Leap Wireless were down 2 percent at $19.20 in pre-market trade Thursday, while those of MetroPCS slid more than 3 percent to $9.05.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Leap Wireless shares closed at $19.55 Wednesday on Nasdaq, while MetroPCS shares closed at $9.36 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Fareha Khan in Bangalore; Editing by Unnikrishnan Nair) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((fareha.khan@reuters.com; within U.S. +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800 Reuters Messaging: fareha.khan.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: LEAPWIRELESS/RESEARCH JPMORGAN  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct 1 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) might face one final soft quarter due to slower server sales and the sale of Razorfish ad agency before getting a boost from the Windows 7 launch, said Goldman Sachs, which removed the stock from its Americas Conviction Buy list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage said it remained bullish on the world's No. 1 software maker, with the Windows 7 launch scheduled for later this month, adding that Wall Street estimates do not fully incorporate upside from a strong product cycle for fiscal 2010 and 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Beyond Windows 7, Microsoft's product pipeline is robust across all segments, like Office 2010 and Bing, said the brokerage, which has a "buy" rating and $30 price target on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the near term, the brokerage said it was balancing the risk of a still soft first quarter of fiscal 2010 report and continued lack of outlook against a backdrop of likely more positive reports across the technology, media and telecommunications sector, the brokerage said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Hence we are shifting the stock off of our conviction List to make room for stocks more closely oriented to near-term catalysts," analyst Sarah Friar wrote in a note to clients.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In July, Microsoft, which is expected to report first-quarter results on Oct. 23, posted the first-ever drop in annual sales of Windows and its quarterly revenue fell a steeper-than-expected 17 percent as its business continued to be hurt by the weak global PC and server markets. [nN23403957] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Microsoft, which in August struck a deal with Publicis (PUBP.PA) to sell Razorfish ad agency for $530 million, were down 1 percent at $25.50 in trading before the bell.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Manasi Phadke in Bangalore; Editing by Deepak Kannan) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((manasi.phadke@thomsonreuters.com; within U.S. +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging: manasi.milindphadke.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MICROSOFT/RESEARCH GOLDMANSACHS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

U.S. Bank Easing Overdraft Penalties

US Bank, a subsidiary of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp (USB), has recently
announced easing of its overdraft penalties. The bank is modifying its service
charge policies for checking accounts which will become effective in the first
quarter of 2010. 

U.S. Bank will eliminate fees when a customer`s account is overdrawn by less
than $10, regardless of the number of overdraft transactions that may have
occurred. It will also limit the number of overdraft fees to three or fewer per
day. Customers will also be permitted to "opt out" of a transaction, if
possible, when the charge might overdraft their account. 

New customers will also be allowed to decide whether to allow the bank to
overdraft their accounts if they have insufficient funds for transactions. The
bank will also establish an annual cap on the amount of overdraft fees it can
assess on a single account. 

Overdraft fees have become a massive source of capital for banks and an
exceptional burden on consumers. U.S. banks will collect $38.5 billion in
overdraft charges in 2009, which is almost twice the amount of fees banks
collected in 2000. Despite the recession, overdraft fees have trended higher
this year. While the median overdraft fee in 2008 was $25, it rose to $26 in
2009. Such fees are mostly collected from customers who are worst affected due
to the economic crisis worldwide. 

Recently, some of the major U.S. banks like Bank of America Corporation (BAC),
JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), BB Corporation (BBT) and Wells Fargo (WFC) have
also announced restructuring of overdraft policies and fees. 

Easing of overdraft policies follows widespread criticism by US congressional
leaders and consumers groups who have argued that the fees are excessive. As a
result of the credit card reforms, the ability to raise fees and interest rates
remains restricted. Also, the credit card issuers need to give longer notice
periods to customers before altering their interest rates.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Accounting Solutions for CRM

Salesforce.com (CRM) continues to capture the headlines. The web-based software
maker and a player in the "cloud computing" space now ventures into the business
of selling accounting software in collaboration with a Dutch company. 

Salesforce has set up a company named FinancialForce.com in association with
Unit 4 Agresso (UNI4), the parent company of financial software specialist CODA,
that sells accounting software. Both the companies will invest in
FinancialForce.com, which in turn will use CODA`s cloud accounting application
previously known as CODA 2go and will deliver finance and accounting solutions
in the cloud. 

This brings Salesforce to an area where the company has not ventured before.
This new accounting application is expected to provide finance professional and
CFOs with better efficiency and confidence to perform complex accounting
operations. Both Salesforce and non-Salesforce customers will be able to use
this application through FinancialForce.com. 

On the other hand, Salesforce is expected to face tough competition from
established players like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Intuit Inc. (INTU) and
Sage Group Plc (SGE), which sell accounting software to Small and Medium
Business (SMB) customers. 

We clearly see that cloud computing is an area where the company is making
progress at a very fast pace. Recently, the company`s cloud computing
applications were selected by the General Services Administration`s (GSA) cloud
computing storehouse named Apps.gov. This online cloud computing site introduced
by GSA will help US government organizations to buy and use the cloud computing
applications already agreed upon by GSA. 

This apart, the company introduced the Service Cloud 2, an enhanced solution to
customers, including Salesforce Knowledge, Salesforce Answers and Salesforce for
Twitter. The "Contact Manager," a new edition from Salesforce.com, provides the
essential tools needed to manage business contacts and customers in the cloud,
and is mainly introduced to cater to the needs of the SMB customers. 

Through this new product introductions and innovations, Salesforce.com is slowly
but surely enhancing its reputation in the cloud computing space. Although the
intention is there, we believe that the company has to overcome hurdles to
achieve success. Competition is intense as major technology players like Google
Inc. (GOOG).

&lt;p&gt;The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) specification may be experiencing a renaissance, but it would sure be helpful if Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser supported SVG, a Google official argued at a technical conference on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SVG is a World Wide Web Consortium specification for high-quality, interactive graphics on the Web using XML. Other browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Opera support it, said Brad Neuberg, a developer advocate at Google and a member of the Open Web Advocacy group. "I think SVG has a really special history," he said at the SVG Open 2009 conference at Google offices in Mountain View, Calif. "I'm just blown away by the kind of level of passion and the level of commitment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Also on InfoWorld: Could HTML 5 kill Flash and Silverlight? | Cut straight to the key news for technology development and IT management with our once-a-day summary of the top tech news. Subscribe to the InfoWorld Daily newsletter. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Folks want to be able to do drawing on the Web. They want SVG and Canvas. There's a clear market demand, so developers want this," said Neuberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A renaissance is happening with SVG similar to what happened with DHTML, Neuberg said. Hindering progress, however, is a lack of native support for the standard in IE. Developers, Neuberg said, have had to use a workaround: SVG Web, a JavaScript library enabling use of SVG in Internet Explorer and other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But SVG Web is limited, according to Neuberg: "SVG Web, it's not a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card for IE. The library will always be slower than native support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had two representatives at the event Friday, a move lauded by Neuberg. "I really respect that they came to the conference this year" and are having a dialog, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Microsoft's reps, IE software architect Ted Johnson, said the company would not be announcing anything at the event about future versions of the browser. "We're just here to listen and learn," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SVG, Johnson said, grew out of proposals from Microsoft and Adobe. Microsoft has supported vector graphics via Vector Markup Language (VML), he said, but he gave a nod to SVG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SVG's coming of age," Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's lack of SVG support in IE is a problem, said conference attendee Greg Sterndale, senior software engineer at Plectix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it sounds like the guys at Google have done a lot of work, and the community's done a lot of work to find a way around that for now. I think that in the future, IE is definitely going to be supporting it," Sterndale said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also backing SVG was a presenter from Wikimedia Foundation, maker of the Wikipedia Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been using SVG very heavily on Wikipedia because it gives us a standard format for graphics, which can be edited by multiple people," said Brion Vibber, CTO of the foundation. He added that browser support is up to snuff on pretty much every browser but IE, though SVG Web helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until we have native support in IE, we have something almost as good," Vibber said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuberg said Canvas 2-D Web drawing capability is also sought for IE. Canvas is part of the HTML 5 specification, of which Google is a big supporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuberg cited multiple benefits of SVG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SVG is very searchable," Neuberg added, acknowledging that Google is a search company. Also, he noted, SVG is easy to import and export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't get trapped into any [specific] tool and it's also very server-friendly" when working with -- for example -- PHP scripts, Neuberg said. Google's Visualization API supports SVG as well. "This is a perfect use case for SVG," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Krill is an editor at large at InfoWorld.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is slamming a lawsuit that claims it misled millions of Windows XP users about that company's anti-piracy software, calling the lawsuit "fictional," "demonstrably false" and from an "alternate universe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said last week that it also opposes a move to grant the case class-action status, court documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-year-old lawsuit accuses Microsoft of duping consumers by labeling its Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) software a critical security update, and failing to tell them that WGA collected information from their PCs and frequently "phoned home" that data to its servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2006, Microsoft began pushing WGA to Windows XP users via Windows Update, the company's default update service, as a "high priority" update that was automatically downloaded and installed to most machines. Shortly after that, Microsoft acknowledged that WGA transmitted information whenever a user logged on to Windows XP. Under pressure from an intense user backlash , it later reduced the frequency of the piracy checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft relies on WGA to detect bootlegged copies of Windows; if the software sniffs out a counterfeit, WGA posts constant nagging messages on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In documents filed with a Seattle federal court on Sept. 22, Microsoft asked that a request for class-action status -- a move that would open the case to millions of Americans, and open up Microsoft to significant damages if it loses -- be denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ignoring the evidence, Plaintiffs tell an outrageously fictional tale of how Microsoft supposedly 'forced' WGA Validation onto more than 350 million Windows XP computers," Microsoft said in the opposition brief submitted to U.S. District Court Judge Richard Jones. "Without any evidence, Plaintiffs assert that Microsoft achieved this distribution by threatening to withhold critical security updates and breaking into computers without their owners' consent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company lawyers also claimed that the plaintiffs had constructed an "alternate universe" that had no connection to the facts. "The fictional thesis on which Plaintiffs base their motion is demonstrably false," Microsoft attorneys argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Microsoft denied that it had ever withheld patches from users running counterfeit Windows XP. "Despite Plaintiffs' assertions to the contrary, Microsoft never withheld any critical updates or security updates designed to improve the existing functionality of Windows XP, regardless of whether a user's copy of Windows XP was genuine," the company countered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class-action for the case is unfeasible, Microsoft said, because it would require inspecting "tens of millions of individual computers," an impossible task. "Each inspection would require a skilled computer technician and cost hundreds of dollars more than the $5 Plaintiffs seek for each proposed class member," said Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If class-action status is granted, Microsoft could face serious damages, its lawyers acknowledged as they cast the plaintiffs as gold diggers. "Plaintiffs seek hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of tens of millions of persons for twelve forms of alleged damages," said Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case has had a relatively low profile in the press. Nearly a year ago, however, Computerworld reported that Jones had granted Microsoft's request to keep secret sections of the WGA software development kit (SDK). Making those details public, Microsoft argued, would give hackers inside information on how to break, or crack, WGA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's WGA, however, has often made news. In August 2007, a day-long server outage riled thousands of users who were mistakenly fingered for running counterfeit copies of Windows. More recently, Microsoft confirmed that it will not allow users with pirated Windows to install its free Security Essentials software .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the court docket, the case, which currently involves nine plaintiffs, including two companies, is set to go to trial Jan. 25, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;


		
        </body></entry><entry author="Hugh Bronstein" date="2009-10-02T23:45:30+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSTRE5916YX20091002"><headline>U.S. cocaine use falls but too soon to claim victory</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - As U.S. cocaine use falls and security is tightened on its border with Mexico, more drugs are flowing toward Africa, a top U.S. official said, although he warned Americans should not be complacent about the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Mexico are cracking down on cartels locked in a bloody war for control of the multibillion-dollar cocaine trade, and U.N. experts say U.S. consumption has fallen significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those changes have pushed more of the trade in South American cocaine toward West Africa for distribution in Europe and other growing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske said the shift does not mean the United States can claim a triumph, as the drug trade reaches into and threatens to destabilize new regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This does not mark a victory for anyone, and should actually give us pause," he told Reuters in an interview in Colombia late on Tuesday. "The last thing we should do is pat ourselves on the back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the post for five months, Kerlikowske is promising a bigger emphasis on reducing U.S. drug demand while law enforcement agencies try to clamp down on the new routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the United States is still the world's biggest cocaine consumer, Latin America's cartels have in recent years moved more cocaine to Europe via West African countries such as Guinea Bissau, where drug traffickers have been implicated in the assassination of the president and head of the military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For countries that have weakened governmental infrastructures and are more susceptible to corruption, the potential to become a 'narco state' is high," Kerlikowske said, without mentioning any specific countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.N. officials say the booming West African cocaine trade breeds corruption and threatens security across the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the world economy recovers, people in business want to make investments in places that are secure. If you look at the antithesis of security, it is drug trafficking and drug addiction," Kerlikowske said during a two-day visit to Colombia, the world's biggest producer of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia has received more than $6 billion in U.S. aid over the last nine years, most of it aimed at staunching the flow of drugs and combating cocaine-funded Marxist rebels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombian cocaine output fell sharply last year, although increases in Peru and Bolivia partly made up for the decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latin America's drug wars are largely fueled by U.S. demand and Kerlikowske, a former Seattle police chief, is promising a balanced approach with increased emphasis on drug addiction prevention and treatment programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to be helpful not just in interdiction and eradication but across this broad range, as we work hard in our own country to reduce our own demand," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Kieran Murray)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM has launched LotusLive iNotes, an on-demand e-mail, calendaring and contact management system meant to compete with the likes of Gmail and Microsoft Exchange, the company said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing starts at US$3 per user per month, undercutting Google Apps Premier Edition, which costs $50 per user per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is aiming the software at large enterprises that want to migrate an on-premise e-mail system to SaaS (software as a service), particularly for users who aren't tied to a desk, such as retail workers. It is also hoping to win business from smaller companies interested in on-demand software but with concerns about security and service outages, such as those suffered by Gmail in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LotusLive iNotes is based on technology IBM purchased from the Hong Kong company Outblaze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we brought to Outblaze and to the marketplace is what you'd expect from IBM in terms of security, reliability and privacy," said Sean Poulley, vice president of online collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While alluding to Google's service outages, Poulley acknowledged that no company can guarantee 100 percent uptime for on-demand applications. But IBM has a long-standing track record of running "the world's mission-critical systems," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will also have an opportunity to win customers from Microsoft who aren't ready to migrate to the upcoming Exchange 2010 release, given the headaches and investments involved, Poulley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from concerned, Google is "actually pretty excited about this," said spokesman Andrew Kovacs. "When a company with as rich a history as IBM makes a statement that they need to have a cloud-computing solution for businesses, it's a validation of the cloud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, Google's offering is more full-fledged than IBM's, according to Kovacs. "Apps goes far beyond e-mail, and on the messaging side alone, we believe there's a pretty substantial difference." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also has a lot to prove in terms of the reliability of LotusLive iNotes, Kovacs said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've seen a claim of reliability and people are supposed to take IBM's word for it at this point," he said. "I haven't seen any statistics on Outblaze's [historical] uptime." Gmail has been more than 99.9 percent reliable overall, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the main point of interest in IBM's announcement is price, said Gartner analyst Matt Cain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Outblaze always sold low-cost mailboxes and that's what this is," he said. "Google's long been in it, Microsoft's long been in it. Now IBM's in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that's not to say IBM's brand on the software isn't of some value, Cain added. "From an enterprise perspective, you'd rather buy e-mail from IBM than a company called Outblaze."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unlikely that IBM's pricing strategy will cause competitors to lower fees for their offerings, according to Cain. For one thing, Microsoft already has a $2 per month Exchange Online option called "Deskless Worker," Cain noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After gaining market share every month since its June unveiling, Microsoft's Bing search engine slipped a bit last month for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web metrics firm Net Applications this week reported this week that Bing's share of the global search engine market slipped from 3.52% in August to 3.39% in September. The market share of the dominant search engine, Google, also dipped slightly between August and September, going from 83.33% to 83.13%, according to the latest Net Applications report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo search maintained its role as the second most used search engine, but it's market share dropped from 7.28% to 6.84%, Net Applications said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a pretty small slip for Bing, percentage-wise, and it's only from one measurement source," said Dan Olds, an analyst for The Gabriel Consulting Group. "The true tale will be told when the other folks who measure market share weigh in. Also, this isn't really a surprise. While I'm sure that Microsoft would love to see Bing steadily gain on Google, that just isn't in the cards. This is going to be a big battle that will be fought over the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Bing didn't show a dramatic fall by any means, this latest report is its first shift in momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks ago, comScore Inc. said its research found that Bing increased its share of the competitive market by 4.5% between July and August to 9.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And The Nielsen Co. last month said its survey found that Bing's share of the search market grew by 22.1% between July and August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Nielsen nor comScore have yet released their September numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olds said he wouldn't be surprised to see Bing's market share slide in the Nielsen and comScore surveys as well. Such back and forth in momentum is typical of a big market battle, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to underestimate just how entrenched Google is as the default Internet search engine," said Olds. "It's not just top of mind for the vast majority of users, it's also built into many of the automated searches that are embedded into other Web sites. This is a big mountain for Bing to climb. We'll see a lot of back and forth in terms of market share, but I do think that Microsoft is now fully committed to the battle and they have the resources and brainpower to make significant inroads."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Title Shows How to Reach More Customers through Multisite Commerce 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
IBM Press, a publishing imprint of Pearson, today announced its latest books for
business and technical professionals, including Maria Azua`s The Social Factor:
Innovate, Ignite, and Win through Mass Collaboration and Social Networking.
(www.ibmpressbooks.com/title/0137018908) 

This book examines "The Social Age" in which we are all now living and working,
which arose from the massive adoption of low-cost, Internet communication tools.
Azua discusses the implications for companies that must now think and work
differently by using these tools to encourage innovation and collaboration, both
within employee communities and beyond company borders. The Social Factor draws
on examples from IBM and other enterprises, as well as the Obama Presidential
campaign, which illustrate the incredible power of social networking. 

Key concepts introduced within The Social Factorinclude:

* An overview of "The Social Age," including the events that led to the social
networking revolution 
* The defining characteristics of social age organizations, including a shift in
"top-down" management hierarchies to realize the value of information residing
within organizational layers 
* Using wikis, blogs, cloud tagging, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube as
the primary tools and venues that can measurably advance the objectives of a
company, including growing the bottom line 
* The cloud computing paradigm, or massively scalable computers available
on-demand (i.e. pay-as-you-go utility model) that are changing how CIOs and IT
professionals execute IT strategies 
* The phenomenon of open source and collaborative software development as
representing a new mindset that can result in even better software solutions 
* Best practices for using social tools to drive innovation and technology
adoption, with guidance on how to bring social innovation into the organization

Azua is vice president of Cloud Computing Enablement for IBM Enterprise
Initiatives, responsible for the deployment and operations of cloud computing
collaboration communities. Prior to her current role, she was vice president of
technology and innovation reporting to the IBM CIO, and in this capacity she
focused on the development of innovative IT solutions and integration of new
technologies, including state-of-the-art social networking tools and programs
for the enterprise. 

A related forthcoming book, Joey Bernal`s Web 2.0 and Social Networking for the
Enterprise: Guidelines and Examples for Implementation and Management Within
Your Organization, will serve as the enterprise decision-maker's guide to using
Web 2.0 for profit. Drawing on an extensive collection of case studies from
companies that have used IBM and third-party technologies to build high-value
Web 2.0 applications and systems, Bernal`s book discusses specific technical
implementations such as AJAX, REST and mashups. The official book will publish
in late October 2009, and currently is available as an eBook on the publisher
site. Bernal is a certified IT specialist for IBM, and has an extensive
background in the design and development of portal and web applications.

Multisite Commerce: Proven Principles for Overcoming the Business,
Organizational, and Technical Challenges,by Lev Mirlas, is designed to help
executives and project managers looking to more broadly reach their existing and
prospective customers at lower costs. Mirlas, who pioneered the concept of a
shared multisite platform with IBM WebSphere Commerce, introduces best practices
and methodologies for implementing and managing multiple commerce sites. He
first explains why multisite commerce is critical for business, yet difficult to
execute, and then addresses it from the business, implementation, and technical
perspectives. (www.ibmpressbooks.com/title/0137148879)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), legendary for its clout in Washington, has inexplicably halted its political fund-raising machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strange twist comes at a time when Wall Street's biggest and most powerful investment bank, nicknamed Government Sachs by critics, seems in other respects to be just as politically involved as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By all accounts, its senior executives are in close contact with Washington regulators, the lobbyists on its payroll include some of the best connected, and it continues to spend heavily to influence government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet one key prong of its assault on the Capitol has been oddly neglected lately: Campaign finance filings show its federal political action committee (PAC) has not taken a penny from employees in more than a year and has a balance of just $25,483 -- pocket change for a Goldman banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Goldman's chief rivals -- Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) -- have armed their U.S. lobbyists with hundreds of thousands of dollars in employee political contributions, filings show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like Goldman use their PACs to collect political contributions from employees; lobbyists funnel the funds to candidates and parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Goldman -- whose alumni include many who have held high positions in the federal government -- abruptly stopped tapping its employees for political money is a mystery. A Goldman spokeswoman would only say, "We have a PAC and we plan to continue to have a PAC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics believe Goldman might be operating under the belief that it has all the political influence it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They don't seem to need a PAC since Goldman has had its way with Washington consistently since Wall Street imploded a year ago," said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the non-profit Consumer Education Foundation. "You could argue they have done pretty well without any PAC contributions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GUN SHY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with Goldman's past political giving said the bank was shy about sending out its annual PAC solicitation letter so soon after slashing jobs and bonuses amid the turmoil in the banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turnover in Goldman's Washington office, which manages the PAC, might also be a factor, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They decided not to do it last winter because it was not a good time, with people losing jobs," said the source, who asked to remain anonymous because Goldman considers its political activities an internal matter. "Things weren't that great and they didn't think it would be very successful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surely, Goldman has found other ways of getting the pulse and setting the agenda in Washington, as a recent research note from Citigroup Inc (C.N) points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman's management team has had a lot of interaction with Washington ... they believe Washington is likely to be more balanced in the (regulatory) proposals than some market participants had feared," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 2008 election cycle, Goldman was the top corporate giver, according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics, which tracked more than $6 million in political contributions back to the bank. Goldman strongly supported candidates from the Democratic party, according to the Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PACs are just one of the tools companies use to exert political influence. They also employ lobbyists, form "527" advocacy groups, and encourage employees to contribute directly to candidates or causes, serve on boards, and work on campaigns or with political parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a number of ways," said Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics. "Goldman Sachs at the very least is using several of those methods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman's PAC has gone silent this year, employees have contributed directly to campaigns and candidates to the tune of about $200,000, according to the Center. This is significantly more than has been directly contributed by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley employees, the center said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has also spent $1.3 million to lobby Washington in the first two quarters of 2009, according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Goldman's PAC is not raising money, filings show it has given out about $25,000 this year, including $2,000 to Christopher Dodd, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Banking Committee and is facing an uphill battle for re-election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has also been active in responding to regulators. For example, it has come out against the Securities and Exchange Commission's proposed new rules on short-selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see any indication Goldman's influence is waning in D.C.," Rosenfield said. "Every which way you look they come out on top."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and American Idol finalist Elliott Yamin have
teamed up to support new malaria prevention projects at the Saint Isabel
Orphanage and School in Luanda, Angola. 

Yamin, a champion in the fight against malaria, delivered a special performance
Friday at the 1st Annual Washington Ideas Forum, two days of discussion by major
newsmakers and top journalists on the most pressing issues of the day. In
support of his performance, ExxonMobil made a grant of $100,000 to the orphanage
and school as part of the company`s continued commitment in the fight against
malaria. 

"When I visited Angola as part of Idol Gives Back, I saw how devastating malaria
is in Africa and that there are some basic actions we can take to save lives,"
said Yamin. "Saint Isabel provides hope and new lives for the children of
Luanda, and I am very honored to support its efforts." 

Dr. Steven Phillips, Medical Projects Director of ExxonMobil, said the company
knows first-hand the health and economic impacts of malaria on its workforce,
their families and the communities where it operates. 

"We know that prevention is the key to saving lives when combating malaria,"
said Phillips. "We are proud to help Saint Isabel build on its long history of
providing care and education to Luanda`s marginalized children." 

The grant will enable Saint Isabel to improve and expand its facility to better
protect more children from malaria by reducing exposure to mosquitoes through
increased ventilation and new windows and screens. In addition, Saint Isabel
will launch an art-based malaria prevention education program that will teach
children how to fight malaria. 

"These underprivileged youth are the most susceptible to diseases such as
malaria," said Sister Domingas, director of Saint Isabel, which provides room
and board to children between the ages of five and 17, and schooling to an
additional 800 students. "These improvements will result in healthier, happier
children. We consider ExxonMobil to be an important partner in safeguarding the
children of Luanda." 

ExxonMobil is the largest non-pharmaceutical corporate donor to malaria research
and development efforts and since 2000 has committed more than $150 million to
African community outreach programs, including $55 million to programs to fight
malaria. 

As a lead sponsor of American Idol`s Idol Gives Back, the company made a
$13-million commitment for the distribution of bed nets. Additionally, since the
initiation of the President`s Malaria Initiative in 2005, ExxonMobil has
contributed $3 million to support its activities in Angola. 

The company established the ExxonMobil Malaria Initiative in 2000 in support of
the Abuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa and its goal to halve
malaria deaths by 2010. Since then, ExxonMobil has developed on-the-ground
public-private partnerships, supported treatment and vaccine research, raised
awareness and contributed to anti-malaria efforts in 12 African countries. 

Malaria, a life-threatening disease caused by a parasite and transmitted to
humans by the bite of a mosquito, kills more than one million annually. The
majority of victims are pregnant women and children under the age of five.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds output detail, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS Oct 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Friday it had
acquired ConocoPhillips' (COP.N) share in the Deltana Platform
offshore natural gas project and will develop the field in a
joint venture with Chevron (CVX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Deltana Platform is a gas field between the mouth of
the Orinoco river and Trinidad and Tobago. Chevron and
ConocoPhillips have been exploring the area since 2003 and
found about 7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in two
blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State oil company PDVSA will hold a 61 percent share in the
project and Chevron 39 percent, the company said in a
statement. PDVSA said the joint venture will produce 750
million cubic feet per day but did not give a timeline or an
estimate of investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It did not under what terms it had acquired Conoco's share
in the Deltana field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said the project requires the construction of a
300 km (186 mile) pipeline to take the gas to a Liquid Natural
gas plant, also to be built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Norway's Statoil (STL.OL) is exploring another block in the
Deltana field but so far has not found gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuela is on poor terms with Conoco, which has taken the
country to international courts over the 2007 nationalization
of crude projects. PDVSA is planning its own suit to block
Conoco from buying its share in the Merey Sweeny refinery.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added technology outsourcing and consulting firm Accenture Plc (ACN.N) to its conviction buy list, citing the company's more aggressive posture in returning cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and higher dividend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Accenture's decision to increase its dividend by 50 percent, shift to a semi-annual dividend payout and its approval of a $4 billion additional share repurchase program are expected to drive shares, analyst Julio Quinteros wrote in a note.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Revenue declines are expected to level out in the first half of fiscal 2010, with a resumption of growth in the second half, giving a boost to shares, the analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On Thursday, Accenture raised its annual divided to 75 cents a share and said it would move from an annual to a semi-annual schedule for the payment of dividends starting in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company also approved a $4 billion additional share repurchase, bringing its total outstanding authority to about $4.9 billion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The $4.9 billion authorization represents the highest level authorized by the board since its IPO," Quinteros said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of the company were trading at $36.31 before the bell Friday. They closed at $36.53 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Manasi Phadke in Bangalore; Editing by Anne Pallivathuckal) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((manasi.phadke@thomsonreuters.com; within U.S. +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging: manasi.milindphadke.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: ACCENTURE/RESEARCH GOLDMANSACHS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM is introducing an inexpensive Web-based corporate email service that will compete with Google Inc's Google Apps, which has recently suffered several high-profile outages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp will likely try to capitalize on the damage that those outages have caused to Google Apps over the past year. Last month millions of business users could not access email for almost two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IBM spokesman said on Thursday that the company will start selling its LotusLive iNotes next week. The lightweight email service will cost $36 per user per year, about 25 percent less than what Google charges for a more robust product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's offering does not have as many bells and whistles as Google's, but the technology giant could attract more customers because it has decades more experience serving the business market. Its products include Lotus Notes, one of the world's two most widely used email programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, on the other hand, generates the bulk of its revenue from advertisements placed on free search products targeted at consumers. It is just getting into the business of selling to businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The IBM brand will help a lot," said Forrester Research Inc analyst Liz Herbert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iNotes will also compete with a Web-based email service from Microsoft Corp that costs about $120 per user per year, according to the software maker's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc (DWA.O) to its Americas Conviction Buy List, citing solid year-to-date performance for 3-D films despite the weak economic environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage said it raised its six-month price target to $45 on the stock and its 2010 earnings estimates for the company to reflect strong income from 3-D films. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this year, DreamWorks Animation's first big 3-D film, "Monsters vs. Aliens", sold an estimated $58.2 million worth of tickets across the United States and Canada during its first three days. [nN29307752] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Hollywood is betting a lot on 3-D, with about 40 films scheduled to run in 3-D over the next three years in hopes that audiences will pay $3 to $5 more per ticket than they typically do to watch movies that feature characters and objects popping out of movie screens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Our higher, above consensus EPS for 2010 could prove to be conservative given our relatively low domestic and international attendance expectations for 2010 films, low conversion rates for theatrical attendance to DVD units, and potential upside from a weaker dollar," the brokerage said in a note dated Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In April, the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter net earnings as demand for its "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa" DVD remained strong, despite industrywide DVD sale weakness. [nN28347217] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe that the real potential for further upside to our estimates lies in international box office for Shrek 4," the brokerage said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of the company closed at $34.35 Thursday on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Shrutika Verma in Bangalore; Editing by Deepak Kannan) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((shrutika.verma@thomsonreuters.com; within US +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging shrutika.verma.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: DREAMWORKS/RESEARCH GOLDMAN  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - The wall-crawling superheroes and caped vigilantes of Marvel Comics will soon overrun the streets and take to the skies in the more sedate precincts of the Magic Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might not be a bad thing for comic books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $4 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment Inc MVL.N by media giant Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) announced on August 31 could give the publisher a real shot at expanding its niche comic book business to one that has broad, mass-market appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marvel's new parent Disney, with a media empire spanning radio stations, cable networks, theme parks, toys and movie studios, could expand the limited readership and restricted retail network that have kept the industry in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low growth projections at Marvel Comics, whose library of 5,000 characters includes Spider-Man and X-Men, are reflective of the near-stagnant North American comic book industry, of which it has the largest market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The industry still has to make new inroads if it's to survive -- from distribution right down to the corner comic shop," said Bob Layton, a writer of Marvel's Iron Man stories. "I have no doubt that Disney may bring in a different distribution model."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's experience with characters and its ability to monetize them are expected to add heft to Marvel's comic book business. It also brings with it money, a promise of investments and marketing clout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A large number of comic shops in America are dingy, poorly managed venues, akin to porn shops," Layton said. "The comic industry needs easily accessible venues where young people can casually find and purchase comics, either through subsidies or discount incentives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comic book publishers such as Marvel and DC Comics, owned by Time Warner (TWX.N), cater to niche customers, usually teenage boys and older males, through specialty stores that only dedicated fans would visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a core group of people that are comic book fans," Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Sterne, Agee  Leach, said. "But to expand that and make it more mass market probably is the biggest challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney can certainly expand the audience with mass market appeal, Bhatia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary means of comic book distribution in North America is the direct market, which was worth about $437 million in 2008, according to comic-book researcher Comichron.com. Under the direct market system, distributors and retailers buy comics from publishers under the condition that they cannot return unsold books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marvel has more than 40 percent of the market, followed by DC Comics, according to Diamond Comic Distributors, the largest distributor of comic books in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comic book segment contributed more than a fourth of the Marvel's overall revenue in the second quarter. Movies and licensing make up the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'A QUEST FOR CONTENT'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see the Marvel acquisition by Disney helping to expand the genre of comic books and remove it from the dusty basement of the world," said Sean Creswell, the owner of Capes Comic Book Lounge in Omaha. His shop derives 45 percent of its sales from Marvel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do see Disney stepping in and offering retailers outside of the direct comic book market incentives for selling Marvel products," Creswell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marvel declined an interview request from Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Marvel, the publishing business has been a nice, steady predictable growth business that contrasted nicely with the vagaries of the film business, which is always a lot more volatile," Caris  Co analyst David Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the route to Marvel characters' gaining mass popularity has been through movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would expect Disney, because they are a mass marketer, to move it toward more mass market," said Kelly O'Keefe, a branding specialist and managing director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Brandcenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Disney has evolved from a creator of popular characters to a major media and entertainment brand that makes a lot of revenue from licensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all about content," Bhatia said. "And media companies want to have content. Comic books provide some of that. It's one of the ways to be in control of content that you can exploit in different ways, whether it's comic books or movies or toys or video games. It's a quest for content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney-Marvel deal shines a light on comic books, and any kind of spotlight on comics is good for entertainment companies, said Scott Rosenberg, chairman of Platinum Studios PDOS.OB, a comic book publishing and licensing company. "A rising tide raises all ships," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney can put comic books in supermarkets and give promotional copies away for free with movies, Rosenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk that a comic publisher runs in going mass market, O'Keefe said, is that some of the hard-core audience might drift away to look for alternative comics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenges are that Disney doesn't take the edge out of Marvel Comics," O'Keefe said. "Marvel Comics have been famous for tackling controversial subjects. You don't want to see the rough edges of Marvel Comics rounded by Disney."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Mike Miller)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual Identity Focuses on Law Enforcement, Public Safety and Military Training
Organizations


BLOOMINGTON, Ind.--(Business Wire)--
Acadis Readiness Suite, Envisage Technologies Corporation`s Web-based enterprise
training logistics management system, has undergone an intensive review and is
re-launching its brand to better match the identified needs of customers,
including law enforcement, public safety and military organizations. After
months of talking to customers, conducting research and reviewing the Acadis
offering, Envisage has further validated what its customers want and need most:
a system that meets the unique challenges of high-risk training environments and
optimizes valuable resources, while saving time and money. 

The result of its internal review is a more targeted look and feel reflective of
Envisage`s continued commitment to evolve the Acadis brand based on industry
needs. It will have a new logo, product brochure and Web site
(www.envisagenow.com) that clearly communicate the Acadis offering and how it
addresses the unique requirements of law enforcement, public safety and military
organizations. 

"The operation of the Acadis Readiness Suite itself won`t change, so our current
customers can be assured that their system will continue to support their
organization as it always has," said Ari Vidali, chief executive officer of
Envisage. "What will change is our communication about how Acadis modernizes
training processes, automates complex training logistics and gives access to
complete officer training records with the click of a mouse." 

The Acadis Readiness Suite tracks law enforcement, public safety and military
organizations` personnel, training and certifications in a single consolidated,
enterprise-level system. On-demand access to data and powerful scheduling and
logistics tools help organizations with constrained resources plan and deliver
high-risk training to ensure workforce readiness. 

The Acadis Readiness Suite:

* Manages real-time training and certification records that follow an employee
throughout their career and defend against litigation 
* Provides exceptional security that meets the terms of federal and military
security standards 
* Automates complex logistics and scheduling 
* Includes modules designed to simplify and integrate complex workflows while
meeting the highest security standards

"Envisage is committed to continually addressing the unique needs of law
enforcement, public safety and military organizations," said Vidali. "Our
updated Web site and identity are the first of many steps we`re taking to better
serve our markets. Unlike generic technology firms, we are intensely focused on
developing software that simplifies high-liability training and will continue to
work hand in hand with law enforcement, public safety and military leaders on
training modernization." 

The Acadis Readiness Suite rebrand is officially being unveiled at the
International Association of Chiefs of Police annual conference held Oct. 3-7,
2009, in Denver, Colo.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI Oct 2 (Reuters) - India has protested against a Chinese embassy policy of issuing different visas to residents of Kashmir, the latest in a series of low-level border disputes between the Asian giants. New Delhi bristles at any hint that Kashmir is not part of India, which has for two decades grappled with a separatist insurgency in the state that has killed tens of thousands and fuelled tensions with nuclear-armed rival Pakistan. India claims Kashmir in full but shares the Himalayan region with Pakistan and China. While trade between India and China has flourished, mistrust remains, especially over the disputed Indian border state of Arunachal Pradesh which is set to welcome the Dalai Lama in November. [ID:nDEL535814] India and China fought a brief but bloody border war, partly over Arunachal Pradesh, in 1962. India's Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Thursday in response to a local newspaper article, which had said the Chinese embassy in New Delhi gave Kashmir residents visas on a separate sheet of paper and not in a passport. It is our considered view and position that there should be no discrimination against visa applicants of Indian nationality on grounds of domicile or ethnicity, it said. We have conveyed our well-justified concern to the Chinese government in this regard. Chinese officials declined to comment. The row comes ahead of a controversial visit by the Dalai Lama to the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, part of which China claims in a long-running dispute that dates back to a 1962 border war. [ID:nPEK367216]  China, which reviles the Tibetan spiritual leader as a dangerous separatist, has protested against the trip and said it was further proof of the Dalai Lama's scheming. But India, which has hosted the exiled Dalai Lama since he fled a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule in 1959, has cleared the visit.

&lt;p&gt;IBM has launched LotusLive iNotes, an on-demand e-mail, calendaring and contact management system meant to compete with the likes of Gmail and Microsoft Exchange, the company said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing starts at US$3 per user per month, undercutting Google Apps Premier Edition, which costs $50 per user per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is aiming the software at large enterprises that want to migrate an on-premise e-mail system to SaaS (software as a service), particularly for users who aren't tied to a desk, such as retail workers. It is also hoping to win business from smaller companies interested in on-demand software but with concerns about security and service outages, such as those suffered by Gmail in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LotusLive iNotes is based on technology IBM purchased from the Hong Kong company Outblaze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we brought to Outblaze and to the marketplace is what you'd expect from IBM in terms of security, reliability and privacy," said Sean Poulley, vice president of online collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While alluding to Google's service outages, Poulley acknowledged that no company can guarantee 100 percent uptime for on-demand applications. But IBM has a long-standing track record of running "the world's mission-critical systems," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will also have an opportunity to win customers from Microsoft who aren't ready to migrate to the upcoming Exchange 2010 release, given the headaches and investments involved, Poulley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the main point of interest in IBM's announcement is price, said Gartner analyst Matt Cain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Outblaze always sold low-cost mailboxes and that's what this is," he said. "Google's long been in it, Microsoft's long been in it. Now IBM's in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that's not to say IBM's brand on the software isn't of some value, Cain added. ."From an enterprise perspective, you'd rather buy e-mail from IBM than a company called Outblaze."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unlikely that IBM's pricing strategy will cause competitors to lower fees for their offerings, according to Cain. For one thing, Microsoft already has a $2 per month Exchange Online option called "Deskless Worker," Cain noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE : XOM) et le finaliste d`American Idol Elliott
Yamin se sont associ&#233;s pour apporter leur soutien &#224; de nouveaux projets de
pr&#233;vention du paludisme dans l`orphelinat et &#233;cole Saint Isabel de Luanda en
Angola. 

Yamin, un champion de la lutte contre le paludisme, s`est produit tout
sp&#233;cialement vendredi &#224; l`occasion du 1er forum annuel des id&#233;es de Washington,
qui consiste en deux journ&#233;es de discussions sur les probl&#232;mes les plus urgents
du jour par des personnalit&#233;s de premier plan de l`actualit&#233; et les plus grands
journalistes. En soutien &#224; son spectacle, ExxonMobil a donn&#233; une subvention de
100 000 dollars &#224; l`orphelinat et son &#233;cole dans le cadre de l`engagement
continuel de la soci&#233;t&#233; dans la lutte contre le paludisme. 

&#171; Lorsque je me suis rendu en Angola dans le cadre de Idol Gives Back, j`ai vu &#224;
quel point le paludisme avait des effets d&#233;vastateurs en Afrique et qu`il &#233;tait
possible de prendre des mesures de base pour sauver des vies &#187;, a confi&#233; Yamin.
&#171; Saint Isabel offre un espoir et de nouvelles vies aux enfants de Luanda, et
c`est un honneur pour moi que d`apporter mon soutien &#224; leurs efforts. &#187; 

Le Dr Steven Phillips, directeur des projets m&#233;dicaux d`ExxonMobil, a indiqu&#233;
que la soci&#233;t&#233; avait une connaissance directe de l`impact sanitaire et
&#233;conomique du paludisme sur ses travailleurs, leurs familles et les communaut&#233;s
o&#249; elle est pr&#233;sente. 

&#171; Nous savons que la pr&#233;vention est cruciale pour sauver des vies dans la lutte
contre le paludisme &#187;, a expliqu&#233; le Dr Phillips. &#171; Nous sommes fiers d`aider
Saint Isabel &#224; consolider sa tradition de longue date d`&#233;ducation et de soins
aux enfants marginalis&#233;s de Luanda. &#187; 

La subvention va permettre &#224; Saint Isabel d`am&#233;liorer et d`agrandir son
&#233;tablissement afin de mieux prot&#233;ger un plus grand nombre d`enfants du paludisme
en r&#233;duisant l`exposition aux moustiques gr&#226;ce &#224; une meilleure ventilation et de
nouvelles fen&#234;tres et moustiquaires. Par ailleurs, Saint Isabel va lancer un
programme artistique p&#233;dagogique sur la pr&#233;vention du paludisme qui apprendra
aux enfants comment combattre cette maladie. 

&#171; Ces jeunes d&#233;favoris&#233;s sont les plus pr&#233;dispos&#233;s aux maladies telles que le
paludisme &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; S&#339;ur Domingas, directrice de Saint Isabel, qui offre g&#238;te
et couvert &#224; des enfants entre 5 et 17 ans, et scolarise 800 &#233;l&#232;ves
suppl&#233;mentaires. &#171; Gr&#226;ce &#224; ces am&#233;liorations, les enfants seront en meilleure
sant&#233; et plus heureux. Nous consid&#233;rons qu`ExxonMobil est un partenaire
important dans la protection des enfants de Luanda. &#187; 

ExxonMobil est la plus grande entreprise non pharmaceutique donatrice aux
efforts de recherche et de d&#233;veloppement en mati&#232;re de paludisme, et depuis l`an
2000 la soci&#233;t&#233; a contribu&#233; plus de 150 millions de dollars &#224; des programmes de
sensibilisation des communaut&#233;s africaines, dont 55 millions de dollars &#224; des
programmes de lutte contre le paludisme. 

En tant que sponsor principal de Idol Gives Back d`American Idol, la soci&#233;t&#233;
s`est engag&#233;e &#224; verser 13 millions de dollars destin&#233;s &#224; la distribution de
moustiquaires. En outre, depuis la mise en place de l`initiative contre le
paludisme du pr&#233;sident en 2005, ExxonMobil a contribu&#233; &#224; hauteur de 3 millions
de dollars en soutien &#224; ses activit&#233;s en Angola. 

La soci&#233;t&#233; a mis sur pied l`Initiative ExxonMobil contre le paludisme en l`an
2000 en soutien &#224; la D&#233;claration d`Abuja, &#171; Faire reculer le paludisme en
Afrique &#187;, et &#224; son objectif de r&#233;duire de moiti&#233; la mortalit&#233; due au paludisme
d`ici &#224; 2010. Depuis cette date, ExxonMobil a d&#233;velopp&#233; des partenariats sur le
terrain entre le secteur public et le priv&#233;, apport&#233; son soutien &#224; la recherche
de traitements et de vaccins, sensibilis&#233; le public et a contribu&#233; aux efforts
anti-paludisme dans 12 pays africains. 

Le paludisme, une maladie pouvant &#234;tre mortelle due &#224; un parasite et transmise &#224;
l`homme par les piq&#251;res de moustique, fait plus d`un million de victimes par an,
dont la majorit&#233; sont les femmes enceintes et les enfants de moins de cinq ans.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co and Universal studios unveiled changes at the top on Monday, as Hollywood's worst-performing major houses try to turn things around in a potentially record year at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney on Monday said it had replaced popular studio chairman Dick Cook, who shocked the industry with his departure about two weeks ago, with Rich Ross: a newcomer to film who as Disney Channels Worldwide chairman steered powerhouse franchises like "Hannah Montana" and "High School Musical."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal Pictures replaced Chairmen Marc Shmuger and David Linde with its film marketing and production chiefs, after a string of box office flops including Will Ferrell's big-budget comedy "Land of the Lost".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move at Universal comes as ultimate parent General Electric prepares to try and sell entertainment giant NBC Universal. According to sources, GE is in talks to buy out partner Vivendi and sell a majority slice of NBC Universal to Comcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal and Disney have posted the poorest performances this year among major U.S. studios, outshone by the likes of Sony Pictures and Time Warner Inc's Warner Bros. That's despite analysts' predictions that 2009 would be a third straight record year for the domestic box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective immediately, Ross -- who experts say shares Cook's flair for personal dealings, but is a stranger to the hyper-competitive movie business -- will manage all film labels including Walt Disney, Touchstone, Miramax and Disney/Pixar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also will take on the integration of superhero franchise juggernaut Marvel Entertainment, which Disney in August said it would buy for $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larry Gerbrandt, principal at Media Valuation Partners, said appointing Ross to head its movie studio signaled a need for someone who can coordinate between different divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ross has little experience making movies, he turned the Disney Channel into the top-rated kids' cable network with successful franchises like "Hannah Montana" and "High School Musical" that morphed into consumer products, movies and theme park attractions, spurring billions in worldwide sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This strikes me as more of a corporate job than necessarily a creative or green-lighting job," Gerbrandt said. "I don't necessarily see him green-lighting (approving) Pixar or Marvel movies, at least not initially."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're going to see Pixar and Marvel being the primary drivers of production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TROUBLE IN THE MOUSE HOUSE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Box office revenue in the United States and Canada hit highs in 2007 and 2008, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, and appear headed for a third record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Disney counts just Disney-Pixar's "Up" and Touchstone's "The Proposal" as bona fide hits this year. It now commands just 11.7 percent of box office market share and Universal 8.6 percent, according to industry tracker Box Office Mojo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook, who steered hits like "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Chronicles of Narnia", told staff at his abrupt September 18 departure that he felt "like a square peg in a round hole".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio division suffered in recent quarters from rising costs, a downturn in DVD sales and a slate of poor performers like "Bolt" and "Bedtime Stories". Cook's reluctance to embrace Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger's call for more cross-pollination to work across business units also was reportedly a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney got about 19 percent of revenues from its movie studios in fiscal 2008. But Cowen and Co analyst Doug Creutz estimated the studio division would account for about 16 percent of revenue in the September quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal performed even worse at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months, it has churned out box office disappointments "Funny People," "Love Happens" and "Land of the Lost," a big-budget comedy that made only $62 million at worldwide box offices. Its sole, bona fide smash hit was the fourth installment of the "Fast and Furious" franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal's marketing head Adam Fogelson will now serve as chairman of the movie studio, and film production president Donna Langley will be co-chairman, reporting to Fogelson, Universal said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fogelson, who has been with the company since 1998, has served as president of marketing and distribution at Universal since October 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langley has served as president of production at the company since 2005, and Universal said that during that time she has been responsible for 14 films that have each made more than $100 million in the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney closed up 1.7 percent at $27.67, and shares of GE closed up 3 percent at $15.83 on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ross oversaw "Hannah Montana" and "High School Musical"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Known for working in collaboration with Disney divisions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alex Dobuzinskis and Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's new studio
chief Rich Ross has done a pitch-perfect job of putting
corporate goals set in 2005 by incoming CEO Bob Iger in motion
-- think global, embrace new technology and invest only in
products Disney can sell across all its business divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the head of Disney Channel Worldwide since 2004, Ross
oversaw a slate of pre-teen TV fare that rose to a ratings
crescendo with sitcom "Hannah Montana" and made-for-TV movie
"High School Musical".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both became multi-billion-dollar franchises that sold toys,
clothes, video games, music, and movie, stage show and theme
park tickets for Disney and spawned a new crop of tween TV hits
with earnest teeny-bop stars like the Jonas Brothers boy band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using Web- and music-based promotions to lure kids to new
shows, the Disney Channel under Ross soared to No. 1 among kids
9-14 for nine years running on shows like "Sonny With a
Chance," "Wizards of Waverly", "Suite Life of Zach and Cody"
and animated fare "Kim Possible" and "Phineas and Ferb"
rounding out its schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Ross's formula for TV-with-a-lesson translated well --
into 32 languages and 94 channels and programming streams
reaching 163 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Ross, who was promoted on Monday to chairman of Walt
Disney Studios to replace longtime studios chief Dick Cook, has
little experience making films for theatrical release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ross, 47, also is seen as less well-versed in the complex
social rules of Hollywood than the jovial Cook, who convinced
powerhouse directors Jerry Bruckheimer, Steven Spielberg,
Robert Zemeckis and Tim Burton to join Disney's movie stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pointing out that Cook had "strong personal ties" to actors
in Disney's biggest hits, Cowen  Co analyst Doug Creutz
recently expressed concern "that Cook's exit could have a
meaningful impact on the future" of those key franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More important to Iger, however, is Ross's knack for
getting Disney divisions to creatively work together to
maximize profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With his success in building the Disney brand across many
of our businesses, his astute marketing sensibility, his proven
ability in working effectively with talent and his skill at
navigating complex global markets, I'm confident he's the
perfect leader for our studio group," Iger said in a statement
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Los Angeles Times described Ross as "the ultimate team
player," and the New York Times said he is a Disney executive
who gets behind the brand, "donning plastic Mickey Mouse ears
and clapping along with the parade when necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I guess I'm lucky I work at a company that has all the
assets, so everybody can figure out what makes the most sense,"
Ross told TV Week last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ross joined the Disney Channel in 1996, after previously
working as an executive at cable channel FX Networks, a
division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NWSA.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was a member of the executive team that launched FX in
1994, and prior to that he worked at childrens' cable network
Nickelodeon.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today confirmed that thousands of Windows Live Hotmail account usernames and passwords had leaked to the Internet, but said the credentials were "likely" stolen in a phishing attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company denied that its Web-based e-mail service had been hacked and the account log-in information stolen because of some lapse on its part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Neowin.net reported that more than 10,000 accounts had been compromised and speculated that Hotmail had either suffered a breach or an aggressive phishing campaign had collected the usernames and passwords by duping people into divulging the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We determined that this was not a breach of internal Microsoft data and initiated our standard process of working to help customers regain control of their accounts," a Microsoft spokeswoman said in an e-mail to questions posed earlier today by Computerworld .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did acknowledge that Hotmail accounts had been compromised. "Over the weekend Microsoft learned that several thousand Windows Live Hotmail customers' credentials were exposed on a third-party site due to a likely phishing scheme," the same spokeswoman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a big result for a phishing campaign," said Dave Jevans, the chairman of the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), an industry association dedicated to fighting online identity theft. "But it's not outside the realm of possibility. We've seen 50,000 to 75,000 [compromised] accounts when phishers target an ISP with millions of users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotmail has about 400 million registered users, according to Microsoft, although the company declined to spell out how many are active users of the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A .05% rate, which is what 100,000 users would represent, isn't unreasonable for 10 to 20 million users," Jevans said. "They wouldn't have to spam every [Hotmail] user to get that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Neowin.net, which first reported the Hotmail incident, more than 10,000 accounts had been compromised. However, Neowin said it had seen only a partial list -- accounts with usernames starting with "A" or "B" -- and suspected that the total could be much larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the 10,000 accounts for A-B are extrapolated to the full alphabet, it's possible that over 100,000 accounts were compromised. "If that's the case, this would definitely be one of the biggest single phishing events," said Jevans. "But it could be the result of a long period of time, months and months of harvesting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the number of phishing attacks declined earlier this year, they have recent stormed back, said Jevans. "They're close to, or at, an all-time peak," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Microsoft and Jevans recommended that all Hotmail users change their passwords, just in case. "Change it, ASAP," urged Jevans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday that passwords belonging to some users of its Hotmail email service were exposed on an Internet site, but had since been taken down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company did not say how many users were affected, but some reports suggested that passwords to more than 10,000 accounts were exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are aware that some Windows Live Hotmail customers' credentials were acquired illegally by a phishing scheme and exposed on a website," a Microsoft spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phishing is a scam whereby fraudsters get hold of personal information by sending out emails under the guise of a bank, IT department or some other trustworthy source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the passwords had been removed from the offending website, which it did not identify, and said it had blocked access to all affected accounts and was helping users to reclaim their Hotmail accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software company said the exposure of the passwords was not a breach of any Microsoft servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM System z Expo - Tuesday, October 6, 2009 - Orlando, Florida
--(Business Wire)--
Title: Beyond Data Security: Meeting PCI Compliance and Other Regulatory Laws 

Overview: The IBM System z, or mainframe as it is often called, has historically
been considered secure because of the strong access control mechanisms. However,
given the number of breaches of credit card and other personally identifiable
information (PII), the Payment Card Industry`s Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
and other regulatory laws are mandating that data be encrypted. Along with
encryption comes the need to manage encryption keys and generating and logging
all actions by individuals. In addition to traditional encryption, other models
have surfaced including tokenization, which enables surrogate data to replace
the sensitive data, often using the IBM z as the central repository for a "data
vault." 

In this session attendees will learn for the IBM z:

* Encryption options 
* Key management requirements and best practices

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Oct 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Monday that passwords belonging to some users of its Hotmail email service were exposed on an Internet site, but had since been taken down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company did not say how many users were affected, but some reports suggested that passwords to more than 10,000 accounts were exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are aware that some Windows Live Hotmail customers' credentials were acquired illegally by a phishing scheme and exposed on a website," a Microsoft spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Phishing is a scam whereby fraudsters get hold of personal information by sending out emails under the guise of a bank, IT department or some other trustworthy source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft said the passwords had been removed from the offending website, which it did not identify, and said it had blocked access to all affected accounts and was helping users to reclaim their Hotmail accounts.    The software company said the exposure of the passwords was not a breach of any Microsoft servers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Gary Hill) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((bill.rigby@thomsonreuters.com; +1 206 418 9236; Reuters Messaging: bill.rigby.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MICROSOFT/HOTMAIL &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by IBM, Google, and the National Science Foundation (NSF), university researchers are gathering Monday to tout their respective cloud computing projects as part of the CLuE (Cluster Exploratory) program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In presentations at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, academics are hailing projects like "Scaling the Sky with MapReduce/Hadoop" at the University of Washington, "Commodity Computing in Genomics Research" at the University of Maryland, and "Dynamic Provisioning of Data Intensive Applications" at the University of California, San Diego. The meeting is for CluE Principal Investigators. IBM and Google presentations also are featured at Monday's event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Find out what's different about building cloud apps. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the efforts is being provided by the NSF, while Google is providing access to a 2,000-computer cloud and IBM is offering software, such as its Tivoli management software and WebSphere middleware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I really believe that [cloud computing is] the tool that will help us launch the era of modern computer science," said IBM's James Spohrer, director of Global University Programs at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif. &#160;This era involves massive data sets and processing and analyzing them, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's own Smarter Planet initiative is about increasing the number of sensors in the world to get more data about such subjects as transportation systems, water management, and waste management. With streams of data coming in, only powerful new tools like cloud computing will enable processing of the data and getting useful results, Spohrer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Google had announced in October 2007 a pilot phase of "Academic Cloud Computing Initiative," which offered access to&#160;computer cluster running the Hadoop open source distributed computing platform inspired by the Google file system and the MapReduce programming model. In February of last year, ACCI partnered with NFS to grant funding to academic researchers to explore large data applications, resulting in the CLuE program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, IBM and Google officials said cloud computing differs from previous concepts such as grid computing and utility computing in that the cloud relies on Internet access, offers high bandwidth and can analyze massive data sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other presentations scheduled &#160;Monday include: "Relaxed Synchronization and Eager Scheduling in MapdReduce," by Purdue University; "Large-Scale data Cleaning using Hadoop" by the University of California, Irvine; "Indexing Geospatial Data with MapReduce," by Florida International University amd "Towards Interactive Visualization in the Cloud," by the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.infoworld.com/node/94523&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Goldman comment, paragraphs 4-5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
Inc said on Monday that it is in talks to amend the terms of a
$3 billion loan to CIT Group Inc (CIT.N), the Wall Street
Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank is expected to receive about $1 billion
if commercial lender CIT were to file for bankruptcy, the Wall
Street Journal said. This is a point of contention as the
company battles to raise additional funds as part of its
broader restructuring plan, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIT is studying several options for the loan from Goldman
Sachs, one of which is trimming the $1 billion payment, the
Journal said, citing a person familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs is working with CIT and its creditors to
enable it to continue to use the facility, which we believe
gives it an attractive cost of funding, particularly relative
to the other financing that has been provided to CIT at less
attractive levels," Goldman Sachs said in a press release on
its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment
further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIT spokesman Curt Ritter declined to comment on the
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman extended $3 billion in funding to CIT in June 2008,
according to regulatory filings. The 20-year contract, which
was set as the credit markets froze, calls for CIT to pay
Goldman 2.85 percent of the maximum amount lent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That translates to about $85.5 million a year for the first
10 years of the agreement, the Journal said, and CIT would be
required to pay $1 billion if it were to file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing a Goldman Sachs internal memo, the Wall Street
Journal the financing for CIT required the bank to "establish
long-term funding" of its own, which it is obligated to pay
even if the CIT facility is paid off early or CIT files for
bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $1 billion payment is "designed to cover Goldman Sachs
in such an event," according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIT, a century-old company that is one of the largest
lenders to thousands of small and medium-size businesses, pays
roughly 10 percent interest on its latest loan. Goldman's loan,
made before CIT acknowledged massive financial problems,
charges about 3 percent interest, the Journal said.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - The financial crisis has squeezed even the richest Americans, but interest in philanthropy remains high, said Catherine Keating, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) U.S. Private Bank&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week the unit, which caters to ultra-rich families, hosted a meeting in New York for 50 private banking clients and members of the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation.

&lt;p&gt; * No Disney Channel successor named&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Oct 5 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on
Monday named Rich Ross, the head of Disney Channels Worldwide,
to head its struggling movie studios after last month's abrupt
departure of longtime chairman Dick Cook, effective
immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ross, who had been mentioned as a successor to Cook in
recent days, grew the U.S. Disney Channel into the top-rated
kids cable network on shows like "Hannah Montana" and "High
School Musical" but has little experience making movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He expanded the kids TV brand into a total of 94 channels
and channel feeds available in 163 countries and 32 languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He will oversee worldwide production, distribution and

Touchstone, Miramax and Disney/Pixar, as well as theatrical and
music groups, Disney said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ross joined Disney Channel in 1996 as a programming and
production executive and was promoted to president of the cable

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - A vaccine helped block the high felt by cocaine users in 38 percent of people who took it, U.S. researchers said on Monday, offering promise of a new approach to treating those addicted to the drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to prevent cocaine's rewarding effects -- the high -- in order to reduce cravings that trigger drug relapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The concept works," Dr. Thomas Kosten of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, whose study appears in the Archives of General Psychiatry, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocaine molecules on their own are too small to draw the attention of the immune system. To get the body to recognize cocaine, the researchers designed a vaccine that uses a harmless version of the cholera toxin with a few attached cocaine molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the immune system reacts to the toxin, it makes both cholera and cocaine antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These antibodies bind to the cocaine, preventing it from leaving the bloodstream," Kosten said. An enzyme called cholinesterase breaks down the cocaine and flushes it out of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, Kosten and colleagues studied 94 volunteers -- mostly users of crack cocaine, which is a solid, smokable form of the drug -- who were on methadone treatment at the Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over three months, the participants either got five shots of the vaccine or a placebo injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who had the highest antibody response were better able to stay cocaine-free. Although the vaccine does not wipe out cocaine cravings, it may help prevent relapse in some people, Kosten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that it does not create antibodies in everybody. "Twenty-five percent of the people who get the vaccine do not make much antibody response," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the vaccine represents a "promising step toward an effective medical treatment," Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STUDY PLANS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans are under way to study the vaccine in many sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 35.9 million Americans aged 12 and older reported having used cocaine, and 8.6 million reported having used crack. In 2006, cocaine accounted for about 14 percent of all admissions to drug abuse treatment programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosten said he plans to tinker with the vaccine to make it more effective. He has already tried a different carrier -- a modified version of a meningitis bacterium -- supplied by drug firm Merck  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies showed it produced five times the antibody response as the cholera carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has used a similar approach on a nicotine vaccine called TA-NIC now being tested in Europe. Both the cocaine and nicotine vaccines are being developed through private equity firm Celtic Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiss drugmaker Novartis and Nabi Biopharmaceuticals of Rockville, Maryland, are also developing nicotine vaccines based on the same principle. Last week, Nabi won a $10 million grant from the NIDA to develop its NicVax vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosten said he shared the results of the animal studies using Merck's vaccine carrier with the company. "They are sufficiently impressed that they will probably make a nicotine product out of it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Maggie Fox and Paul Simao)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Rich Ross, President of Disney Channels Worldwide, has been named Chairman of
The Walt Disney Studios (NYSE: DIS), it was announced today by Disney President
and CEO Robert A. Iger. 

Ross will oversee worldwide production, distribution and marketing for the
company`s range of live-action and feature animated film labels, including Walt
Disney, Touchstone, Miramax and Disney/Pixar. In his new role, which he assumes
immediately, he will also head Disney`s theatrical and music groups. 

In his thirteen years at Disney, Ross has consistently created hit original
programming, effectively expanded a worldwide creative and distribution
organization, skillfully built the Disney brand with global franchises that work
across borders and technology platforms and put in place a strong management
team. 

"Rich has an outstanding record of creating high-quality family entertainment
that delights audiences around the world," said Iger. "With his success in
building the Disney brand across many of our businesses, his astute marketing
sensibility, his proven ability in working effectively with talent and his skill
at navigating complex global markets, I`m confident he`s the perfect leader for
our studio group." 

"I am very excited to play a key role in continuing the storytelling legacy of
The Walt Disney Studios. There has never been a better time to entertain our
global audiences with high-quality and compelling content and introduce new
characters that will become family favorites. I look forward to working with
Bob, the team at the studios and all of our Disney family towards that goal,"
said Ross. 

Under Ross`s leadership, the performance of Disney Channels Worldwide has been
consistently strong in both creative and competitive terms, in the U.S. and
globally. The group now includes a total of 94 channels and channel feeds
available in 163 countries in 32 languages and features such brands as the
flagship Disney Channel, the boy-focused Disney XD and Playhouse Disney for
younger kids. 

Ross has also overseen the growth of Radio Disney and of the group`s
multiplatform offerings, which includes subscription video-on-demand and
content-rich broadband websites DisneyXD.com and DisneyChannel.com, the number
one kid`s entertainment website among Kids 6-14. 

In the U.S., Disney Channel has been the #1 TV network among Kids 6-11 and
Tweens 9-14 for the last seven and nine years respectively, buoyed by such
breakout series as Lizzie McGuire, That`s So Raven, The Suite Life of Zack and
Cody, Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place and Sonny With A Chance. Stars of
Disney Channel programs, including Raven-Symone, Selena Gomez, Jonas Brothers,
Demi Lovato and Miley Cyrus, have become household names. 

Disney Channel`s record with original movies is equally impressive. With recent
blockbusters like High School Musical 2, Wizards of Waverly Place The Movie and
Camp Rock, Disney Channel can claim cable`s top two movies of all time and three
of the top five. 

Disney Channel programming has also helped build other Disney businesses,
including the quadruple-Platinum-selling Hannah Montana soundtrack and the
number one US album in 2006, High School Musical soundtrack. Books, stage shows,
feature films, video games and merchandise featuring original Disney Channel
characters have become a critical part of The Walt Disney Company`s success in
recent years. 

Ross joined Disney in 1996 as Disney Channel`s Senior Vice President,
Programming and Production and was promoted to positions of increasing
responsibility before being named Disney Channel president in April 2004. Prior
to his tenure at Disney, he was a member of the executive team that launched FX
Networks. Ross also held several senior positions at Nickelodeon from 1986 to
1993 where he oversaw talent booking, casting and program development and was
involved in the launch of the channel`s first successful syndicated show and its
first international network. 

Ross is a member of the Board of Directors for Hollywood Radio Television
Society and Cable in the Classroom - an organization that represents the cable
telecommunication industry`s commitment to education. A native of New York and a
1983 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Arts degree
in International and English, Ross received his J.D. degree from New York`s
Fordham University in 1986.

&lt;p&gt;         * Vaccine worked in 38 percent of people who took it          * Similar approach used in nicotine vaccine          By Julie Steenhuysen          CHICAGO, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A vaccine helped block the high felt by cocaine users in 38 percent of people who took it, U.S. researchers said on Monday, offering promise of a new approach to treating those addicted to the drug.          The aim is to prevent cocaine's rewarding effects -- the high -- in order to reduce cravings that trigger drug relapses.          The concept works, Dr. Thomas Kosten of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, whose study appears in the Archives of General Psychiatry, said in a statement.          Cocaine molecules on their own are too small to draw the attention of the immune system. To get the body to recognize cocaine, the researchers designed a vaccine that uses a harmless version of the cholera toxin with a few attached cocaine molecules.          When the immune system reacts to the toxin, it makes both cholera and cocaine antibodies.          These antibodies bind to the cocaine, preventing it from leaving the bloodstream, Kosten said. An enzyme called cholinesterase breaks down the cocaine and flushes it out of the body.          For the study, Kosten and colleagues studied 94 volunteers -- mostly users of crack cocaine, which is a solid, smokable form of the drug -- who were on methadone treatment at the Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System.          Over three months, the participants either got five shots of the vaccine or a placebo injection.          Those who had the highest antibody response were better able to stay cocaine-free. Although the vaccine does not wipe out cocaine cravings, it may help prevent relapse in some people, Kosten said.          The problem is that it does not create antibodies in everybody. Twenty-five percent of the people who get the vaccine do not make much antibody response, he said.          Even so, the vaccine represents a promising step toward an effective medical treatment, Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, said in a statement.          STUDY PLANS          Plans are under way to study the vaccine in many sites.          According to a 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 35.9 million Americans aged 12 and older reported having used cocaine, and 8.6 million reported having used crack. In 2006, cocaine accounted for about 14 percent of all admissions to drug abuse treatment programs.          Kosten said he plans to tinker with the vaccine to make it more effective. He has already tried a different carrier -- a modified version of a meningitis bacterium -- supplied by drug firm Merck  Co (MRK.N).          Animal studies showed it produced five times the antibody response as the cholera carrier.          He has used a similar approach on a nicotine vaccine called TA-NIC now being tested in Europe. Both the cocaine and nicotine vaccines are being developed through private equity firm Celtic Pharma.          Swiss drugmaker Novartis and Nabi Biopharmaceuticals NABI.O of Rockville, Maryland, are also developing nicotine vaccines based on the same principle. Last week, Nabi won a $10 million grant from the NIDA to develop its NicVax vaccine.          Kosten said he shared the results of the animal studies using Merck's vaccine carrier with the company. They are sufficiently impressed that they will probably make a nicotine product out of it, he said.          (Editing by Maggie Fox and Paul Simao)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) needs to quickly follow its Windows Mobile 6.5 launch with a more competitive cellphone system or risk losing out to iPhone, BlackBerry and Android in the cutthroat smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 6, several manufacturers plan to unveil phones running Windows Mobile 6.5, Microsoft's latest software. It includes touchscreen capabilities, an applications store and the ability to customize certain phone display elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since consumers have seen similar features in rival phones for some time, analysts say Microsoft still lags well behind rivals Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Research In Motion RIM.TO, Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Palm Inc PALM.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're still significantly behind in terms of consumer user experience," said Current Analysis analyst Avi Greengart. "If they don't catch up soon they'll start losing relevance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Microsoft has a good position and room to grow among corporate customers, as Windows-based phones are a relatively easy and cheap option for technology managers who already use Microsoft's email and desktop computer software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a lack of prominence in the bigger market for mobile consumers could be a serious impediment going forward as consumers are instead drawn to iPhone's simplicity or Palm's tight integration of social networks like Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The majority of the market is consumer so even if (Microsoft) were to retain just the enterprise that would be missing out on the bulk of the opportunity," Greengart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research firm iSuppli sees Microsoft tripling cellphone shipments using its system to 67.9 million by 2013, iSuppli analyst Tina Teng sees it losing market share until such a time as it launches a substantially improved system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps the most glaring obstacles faced by Windows Mobile reside in its own shortcomings," Teng said in a research report. "The Windows Mobile user interface looks poor compared to some of its slicker competitors - particularly Google's Android and Apple's iPhone operating system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However Teng sees Microsoft launching Windows Mobile 7 next year, with upgrades to the user interface and browser as well as multi-touch controls, making it "much more competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDC analyst Ryan Reith sees Microsoft's global market share rising to 13.6 percent in 2013 from 9.2 percent mostly due to its enterprise business but in the same time period he sees Android's market share rising to 11 percent from 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAYING COMPETITIVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft director of product management Aaron Woodman said his company was already working on its next updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think you'll see faster and faster innovation from us," Woodman told Reuters, without giving any timetable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts say Microsoft needs a dramatic strategy shift to stay competitive with rivals such as Google's Android as phone makers are increasingly favoring that software over Windows Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many Microsoft's phone partners are still building devices based on Windows software, others, such as HTC Corp (2498.TW), are turning to Android for their most high-profile phones. One client, Palm, now favors its own webOS system, while another, Motorola Inc MOT.N, has reorganized its entire smartphone focus to Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One advantage Google has over Microsoft is that its Android software is free, whereas Microsoft charges licensing fees to phone makers that use its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fees will become increasingly difficult to justify unless Microsoft creates a more competitive mobile platform, analysts said. But an elimination of royalty fees would be difficult as software licenses are the lifeblood for the company which dominates the desktop computer software market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they remove the royalties then that poses big questions for a lot of Microsoft's other business units." said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight. "If you remove the license fee, where is Microsoft going to make its money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts say the company could boost the visibility of its mobile brand by developing its own phone with hardware that is tightly integrated with Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a device would likely be manufactured by another company, according to IDC analyst Ryan Reith. But Microsoft executives have long denied rumors that it is planning its own phones. And there is a danger it loses its phone software customers if it sets itself up as a rival, said CCS's Blaber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from attracting consumers, Microsoft also needs to capture the imagination of third-party application developers who have rushed to create a wide variety of iPhone applications, helping Apple boost iPhone sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Analysis' Greengart said Microsoft should instead revamp its own phone software by looking to other parts of its consumer business. He sees Microsoft latest Zune music player as a sign it can create appealing products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Zune HD interface is extraordinary," Greengart said, referring to the graphical display of musical information. "It is a more interactive music playback experience than Apple's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So re-purposing the Zune interface could be a good start for a compelling mobile platform, said Greengart who also noted that the success of Microsoft's Xbox game console is another sign that Microsoft can appeal to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on what they've seen in other areas I've no doubt Microsoft can do it. Windows Mobile 6.5 is not the answer," Greengart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Woodman declined to comment on future products but said Zune was a "wonderful example" of what Microsoft can do in the consumer arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we're doing the right first steps with 6.5. We're starting to leverage assets around the company to be successful in this space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sinead Carew; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) plans to expand its U.S. private banker force by 10 percent in the coming months as America's wealthy exit banks hit hard by the financial crisis, JPMorgan's top U.S. private banker said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are investing in people and we hope to add an additional 10 percent in the next year," Catherine Keating, chief executive of JPMorgan's U.S. private bank, said at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which traces its roots to 1799, oversees $350 billion in assets for wealthy clients in the United States and employs 375 advisers to guide them on where to invest their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each of the last two years, JPMorgan's U.S. private bank added more new clients than ever before. Another record might be set this year, Keating said. "It is a close call and we still have a quarter to go, but it could happen," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank, traditionally strong in the U.S. Northeast, is making a push to find new clients in the Southeast and on the West Coast, Keating said. JPMorgan acquired failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan came through last year's financial crisis in relatively better shape than many of its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: blogs.reuters.com/summits/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
iYogi, the on-demand tech services company with a unique global delivery
model, announced today that an encouraging 36 percent of consumers expect
to upgrade to Windows 7 on their existing PC. However, 68 percent are not
entirely comfortable that they will be able to easily move their favorite
applications over to the new Windows 7 platform. And nearly half (43
percent) expect to need more tech support help in order to move their
favorite applications over to the Windows 7 environment.

    These facts are among the results of a poll of more than 500 consumers
regarding adoption and application plans and predictions around the
upcoming launch of the new Microsoft Windows 7 operating system.

    Upgrade plans look healthy, with 28 percent expecting to move to Windows 7
this year alone. When asked what one word describes how they feel about
the upcoming launch, 31 percent said "excited."

    "We are very encouraged by the growing anticipation of the Windows 7
operating system, and from what we've seen it represents a significant
improvement in the user interface and manageability for users," said
Vishal Dhar, President of Marketing &amp; Co-founder of iYogi. "However, our
surveys show that more than 40 percent -- potentially tens of millions of
people -- will require additional computer support assistance of some
kind this year."


Additional survey findings reveal:

    -- 61 percent think they will upgrade to Windows 7 at some point
    -- 48 percent will make the move by the end of 2010
    -- 35 percent think that difficulties porting their favorite
       applications over to Windows 7 will discourage them from moving
       to the new operating system
    -- More current Windows Vista users (35 percent) are excited about
       the upcoming Windows launch than Windows XP users (29 percent)

&lt;p&gt;Veteran IBM executive Pat Toole was recently named corporate CIO at the company and given much broader responsibilities than his predecessors in the post, which now oversees a far more centralized IT operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toole, who joined IBM in 1984 and was most recently general manager of IBM's intellectual property unit, takes over an IT operation that has already reduced the number of data centers from 155 to five, and the application portfolio from 15,000 to 4,500 -- so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive consolidation effort includes a shift to centralized IT management, a move completed this year by outgoing CIO Mark Hennessy, who now heads strategy for IBM's sales operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's corporate CIO had previously focused on strategy and governance while working with the CIOs in the company's business units. In the new arrangement, Toole is responsible for IBM's overall IT strategy and operations, which means he handles everything from IBM's emerging strategy for cloud computing to worldwide crises and mundane daily operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toole said the broader charter will enable large-scale IT transformation, such as a current project to revamp IBM's SAP application infrastructure to match global processes. "In the past, SAP was optimized on a local level," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centralization of IT operations may be the wave of the future. In an IBM survey of 2,500 CIOs worldwide, three-fourths of the respondents said that they "anticipate having a strongly centralized infrastructure in five years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT centralization also helps CIOs focus on activities that spur innovation and use information for competitive advantage, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the survey, 83% of the CIOs cited business intelligence and analytics as the top area to focus on to enhance competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) idled
a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracker unit at its 503,000
barrel-per-day refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, late last
week due to a snag, trade sources said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They said the 120,000 bpd unit was likely to be offline for
about a week for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One of the FCC units apparently idled Friday. We heard
there was a leak in a feed line," one U.S. Gulf Coast oil
products trader said, adding he heard the unit would be down
for five to seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A second trader said U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline price
differentials moved up on Friday partly due to the Exxon
refinery problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon problem at Baton Rouge, one of two FCCs shut for 5-6
days from Thursday night on breakdown," the second trading
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the oil major declined to comment on the
reports, citing company policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With regard to Baton Rouge, I do not have any information
to share with you as our general policy is not to comment on
the operational status of our facilities," Kevin Allexon, a
spokesman for Exxon, told Reuters in an email.

&lt;p&gt;Negative Publicity Continues to Cast Shadow Over Oil Giant
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Chevron`s attempt to move the battle over its $27 billion environmental
liability in Ecuador to a secret international tribunal where indigenous groups
would not be represented has been blasted by the Los Angeles Times, which
characterized it as a "shifty shifting of venue" designed to avoid
accountability for the company`s devastation of the Amazon rainforest. 

"Let`s be clear," read the editorial, titled "Chevron`s shifty shifting of
venue," published on Oct. 2. "The case wasn`t brought by Ecuador. It was filed
by people who say they have suffered serious personal harm, illness and
environmental damage as a result of oil operations in their homelands. From the
very beginning, Chevron has been trying to turn the focus away from these people
and to pin the responsibility for the pollution on the government of Ecuador." 

The editorial also criticized the Chevron Corporation for "shopping&#8230; to yet
another court" in an effort that "shut(s) out the private citizens who brought
the suit." 

The Los Angeles Times is the largest newspaper in Chevron`s home state of
California. 

The editorial follows Chevron`s announcement that it has filed a claim against
Ecuador`s government under a U.S.-Ecuador trade pact. The claim, if it proceeds,
will be heard by a secret tribunal with no provision to accommodate the 30,000
residents of Ecuador`s Amazon region who live in the area where the oil giant
dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste when Texaco (now Chevron) operated an
oil concession from 1964 to 1990. 

An independent, court-appointed expert has estimated that damages in the case
could be assessed as high as $27.3 billion, and a judgment is expected in a few
months. 

The editorial notes that the underlying lawsuit is being heard in Ecuador`s
courts because Chevron argued in the U.S. federal court -- where the case was
originally filed in 1993 - that the claims "rightly belonged" in Ecuador. In
2001, after Chevron filed 14 expert affidavits praising the Ecuadorian courts
and agreeing to jurisdiction in Ecuador, a U.S. federal judge shifted the venue.


It was only after scientific evidence gathered during the trial in Ecuador began
to demonstrate that 100% of Chevron`s 378 former production sites are
extensively contaminated that the company began a campaign to discredit
Ecuador`s courts, trying to create "evidence" that could be used in the
international arbitration. 

The editorial said Chevron`s "real problem" has nothing to do with
jurisdictional or procedural issues. "The issue is the devastating contamination
in the Ecuadorean Amazon, the individuals whose lives have been affected and the
importance of accountability," the editorial said. "No matter where this case is
tried, that's not going to disappear." 

Under the rules of the trade arbitration process, which have been criticized as
being biased in favor of investors, representatives of the indigenous and farmer
communities impacted by Chevron`s operations will have no right to appear or
even be notified of the proceedings. 

"Chevron is trying to manipulate the international arbitration process to strip
away the legal claims of thousands of persons who are owed an answer in the
trial the company wanted," said Andrew Woods, an American legal advisor to the
plaintiffs. "This is profoundly unfair and implicates serious public policy and
issues." 

The Los Angeles Times editorial follows a spate of unflattering publicity
highlighting Chevron`s problems in Ecuador, which has been called the "Amazon
Chernobyl" by various experts. Reports about the pollution have appeared this
year on 60 Minutes, and in print in the WallStreet Journal, New York Times, and
Washington Post, among others. 

A May 15, 2009 New York Times article found that "evidence of the contamination
is unavoidable at well sites near Lago Agrio and other towns in the region&#8230;.Some
pools of waste dug by Texaco combining noxious drilling mud and crude oil still
lie exposed under the sun, seeping into nearby water systems&#8230;.the legal battle
is denting the company`s environmental image." 

An April 28, 2009 Washington Post article explained how Texaco failed to use in
Ecuador the same safety precautions it was adhering to in the U.S. at the time. 

About the Amazon Defense Coalition

The Amazon Defense Coalition represents the plaintiffs in the lawsuit and is
composed of dozens of rainforest communities and five indigenous groups that
inhabit Ecuador`s Northern Amazon region. The mission of the Coalition is to
protect the environment and secure social justice through grass roots

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS Oct 5 (Reuters) - Venezuela and U.S. company
Chevron on Monday shut a jointly operated oil upgrader in the
Orinoco region for 40 days of planned maintenance, a top
official at state-run oil company PDVSA said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron (CVX.N) has a 30 percent stake in the 180,000
barrel-per-day Petropiar joint venture. Since President Hugo
Chavez put major oil projects under state control in 2007,
PDVSA's stake is 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To offset the production loss while its upgrader is out,
Petropiar will mix the extra-heavy crude it produces with a
lighter oil. Output is expected to continue at 100,000 bpd to
110,000 bpd during the outage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stoppage at Petropiar has been planned for months but
was postponed during elections of new leaders of Venezuela's
oil unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today we are starting" the stoppage, PDVSA vice president
Eulogio Del Pino told Reuters by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources at Chevron confirmed the outage and said Petropiar
had been ready to begin the maintenance since September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maintenance on Venezuela's oil infrastructure frequently

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 5 (Reuters) - Global services and manufacturing
activity expanded for a second consecutive month in September,
with the manufacturing sector leading the way, a survey showed
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Global Total Output index, produced by JP Morgan with
research and supply management organisations, rose to 52.9 in
September from 52.0 in August. The index was above the 50 mark
that divides growth from contraction for the first time in 15
months in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Global services index rose to 52.2 in September from
50.5 in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "September PMI data round off a positive Q3 for the world
economy, with the outcome for global GDP growth set to be the
best since the end of 2007," said David Hensley, a director at
JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier data showed the euro zone's dominant service sector
returned to growth for the first time in 16 months in September
while the UK saw its service sector grow at its fastest pace for
two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Figures released in the United States showed its service
sector, which represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic
activity, expanded last month at a faster face than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the global employment index dipped to 46.0 in
September from 46.1 in August as firms continue to slash jobs to
cut costs and stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index combines survey data from countries including the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and
Russia.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded and removed from Rating Watch Negative 15 classes
of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC), mortgage
pass-through certificates. In addition, Fitch has assigned Loss Severity (LS)
ratings. 

The downgrades are the result of loss expectations for current specially
serviced loans and reflect Fitch's prospective views regarding commercial real
estate market value and cash flow declines. Fitch forecasts potential losses of
9.02% for this transaction, should market conditions not recover. Today's rating
actions are based on losses of 7.3% including 100% of the losses associated with
term defaults and any losses associated with maturities within the next five
years. Given the significant term to maturity, Fitch's actions only account for
25% of the losses associated with maturities beyond five years. The bonds with
Negative Rating Outlooks indicate classes that may be downgraded in the future
should full potential losses be realized. Fitch considers the Outlooks on the
super-senior classes to be Stable due to projected losses having limited impact
on credit enhancement when associated pay down is factored into the analysis. 

Fitch analyzed the transaction and calculated expected losses by assuming cash
flows on each of the properties decline 15% from year-end (YE) 2007 and property
values decline 35% from issuance. These loss estimates were reviewed in more
detail for loans representing 55% of the pool and, in certain cases, revised
based on additional information and/or property characteristics. 

Approximately 20.4% of the mortgages are scheduled to mature within the next
five years as follows: 2.9% in 2011, and 17.5% in 2012. In 2017, 66.8% is
scheduled to mature. 

Fitch identified 26 Loans of Concern (23%) within the pool, five of which (1.9%)
are specially serviced. None of the specially serviced loans are within the
transaction's top 15 loans (42.3%). Of the specially serviced loans, one (1% of
the pool) is current. Five (11.5%) of the transaction's top 15 loans are Fitch
Loans of Concern. 

Based on its analysis, Fitch expects 14 of the top 15 loans (40.9%) to default
during the term or at maturity, with loss severities ranging from approximately
1% to 11%. The largest contributors to loss on a pool level basis (by
outstanding balance) are as follows: Overlook III (2.7%), Ten Penn Center
(2.2%), and Sheraton Gunter (1.6%). 

Overlook II is a 438,709 square foot office building located in Atlanta, GA. The
sponsor is Parameter Realty Fund III, Inc. The major tenants at the property
consist of Citicorp Credit Services (14%), Club Management Enterprises, LLC
(8%), and Nations Builders Insurance (6%). Performance has declined due to
increased expenses and a slight decline in occupancy since issuance. The
servicer-reported debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) as of year-end (YE)
December 2008 was 1.17 times (x) down from 1.21x and 1.29x at issuance.
Occupancy as of June 2009 was 76% and 85% including the master lease. Fitch's
analysis of the loan resulted in a higher probability of default at maturity
based on the high loan to value. 

Ten Penn Center is a 670,857 square foot office property located in Philadelpia,
PA. The sponsor is Ten Penn Center Assocates, L.P. The major tenants at the
property consist of Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC (23%) and Sedgwick Claims
Management Services (7.5%). At issuance, the property was 67% occupied and
projected to have negative cash flow for the first three years of the loan term.
The property has not reached stabilization expectations. As of YE 2008, the
servicer reported DSCR was 0.74x, and the Fitch stressed DSCR at issuance was
1.11x. As of June 2009, the property was 74.6% occupied down from 85% YE 2007
but up from 67% at issuance. Fitch's analysis of the loan resulted in a higher
probability of default during the loan term based on declining performance. 

Sheraton Gunter is a full-service, 322 room hotel with meeting space located in
the heart of downtown San Antonio, TX. The loan sponsor is Michael S. Gallegos.
Although 2008 income increased, property performance continues to decline due to
current market conditions within the hotel sector combined with increased
expenses at the property. As of YE 2008, the servicer reported DSCR was 1.15x
down from 1.47x YE 2007 and 1.61x at issuance. Per the July 2009 STR report, the
property is currently lagging it's competitive set with occupancy at 69%
compared to 79%, average daily rate (ADR) at $105 compared to $116 and revenue
per available room (RevPAR) at $71 compared to $92. Fitch's analysis of the loan
resulted in a higher probability of default during the loan term based on
declining performance. 

Fitch downgrades, removes from Rating Watch Negative, and assigns Loss Severity
(LS) ratings to the following classes: 

--$197.2 million class A-J to 'BBB/LS4' from 'AAA'; Outlook Negative;

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Oct 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Fish &amp; Richardson won a major victory for Microsoft Corp. on September
11, 2009 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
overturned a $511.6 million damages award against Microsoft in its
long-standing patent infringement battle with Alcatel-Lucent. The court
found that the jury's damages award ($358 million plus interest) was
unjustified based on the evidence. This victory follows on the heels of
two recent jury verdicts for Microsoft in 2008 against Alcatel-Lucent,
and completes a clean sweep in the seven year litigation.

    This case, which relates to Microsoft's calendar date-picker tool, was
part of a much larger patent dispute between Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent
that has included seven separate cases over seven years, three jury
trials, three appeals to the Federal Circuit, and the reversal of over $2
billion in jury verdicts against Microsoft. This is the last case in this
epic litigation to be decided.

    Fish &amp; Richardson has served as lead counsel on all of the cases including
handling the 2008 Federal Circuit case that affirmed the overturning of
the $1.538 billion verdict against Microsoft -- the largest patent
infringement verdict in history. That verdict, on patents Lucent had
claimed covered every MP3 player in existence, had shaken the roots of
the MP3 system and had been reported in thousands of media outlets
worldwide.

    "These cases were significant not only for their immediate, multi-billion
dollar impact on the litigants themselves, but the staggering implications
for the entire digital music and digital video industries, since
Alcatel-Lucent had specifically targeted the international standards
governing the creation of MP3 music and DVDs," said John Gartman, the Fish
&amp; Richardson principal who was lead counsel on all of the cases. "It is no
stretch to say that if Microsoft had not stood up for these industries and
the international standards -- and won -- the cases would have touched
nearly every aspect of people's future digital lifestyles, from the
ubiquitous MP3s to DVDs and Blu-Ray movies."

    This litigation began in 2002 when Alcatel-Lucent sued Microsoft customers
Dell and Gateway, and Microsoft intervened to stand up for its customers.
Lucent claimed that many of the computers made by Gateway and Dell
infringed its patents by using Microsoft programs such as Windows Media
Player to play MP3 music and DVDs.

    The patent claims were split up into seven different cases organized by
technology type -- audio (music), video, speech, and a fourth group of
"user interface" patents. Many of the cases centered around patents that
Alcatel-Lucent called the "crown jewels" of its 7,000-plus Bell Labs
patent portfolio. Over the course of the litigation, Alcatel-Lucent
sought more than $50 billion in damages from Microsoft. Fish &amp; Richardson
has now won every case in Microsoft's favor.

    Fish &amp; Richardson is a leading global law firm unlike any other law firm
in the world. With over 425 lawyers practicing intellectual property,
litigation, and technology law, Fish has redefined IP law for a market
that values IP as a fundamental business asset. The firm offers unique

Managing Intellectual Property (MIP) magazine, with top rankings in eleven
categories, including Patent Prosecution, Patent Litigation, Life
Sciences, and the International Trade Commission (MIP, February 2009).
Fish handles more patent litigation than any other law firm (IP Law &amp;
Business, September 2009; IP Law360, January 2009), is the number one IP
firm for America's biggest companies (Corporate Counsel, September 2009),
and was recently named to the 2009 Appellate Hot List (The National Law
Journal, April 2009).

&lt;p&gt;Oct 5 (Reuters) - Large U.S. banks' normalized earnings
have surged 39 percent this cycle mostly on long-term accretive
deals, but banks' share prices do not fully reflect their
earnings power, Goldman Sachs said as it upgraded big banks to
"attractive" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analysts, including Richard Ramsden and Brian Foran,
upgraded Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) to "buy," Comerica Inc
(CMA.N) to "neutral" and added Capital One Financial Corp
(COF.N) to their conviction buy list in place of Fifth Third
Bancorp. [ID:nWNAB5939]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Wells Fargo and Capital One rose 5 percent to
$27.42 and $34.80 respectively, in pre-market trade on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market has failed to recognize the dramatic
improvement in earning power at the large banks versus the
regionals," Goldman analysts said, as they kept their
"cautious" view on regional banks citing permanent earnings
dilution and later cycle credit issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tangible assets per share have risen 29 percent for large
banks compared with a 25 percent fall for regionals, while
pre-provision earnings per asset has increased 7 percent for
large banks versus a 14 percent fall for regionals, the
analysts wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo is the 'big winner' this cycle as its tangible
assets per share have risen sharply by 70 percent in the second
quarter of 2009 compared with the same quarter in 2007, Goldman
analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While big banks normalized earnings are 39 percent higher
than in 2007 -- mostly on account of long-term accretive deals
such as Wells Fargo-Wachovia Corp and JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N)-Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK -- regional banks'
normalized earnings have fallen 36 percent, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Wells Fargo completed its $12.5 billion takeover
of Wachovia, while JPMorgan bought the banking units of failed
thrift Washington Mutual.

&lt;p&gt; * Focus on search deal with Yahoo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Growth still seen returning slowly, at lower levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * RD budget frozen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Georgina Prodhan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) does not
expect to make acquisitions to help the company challenge Google
Inc's (GOOG.O) dominance in the Internet search market, Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer told Reuters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No, I wouldn't expect it," he said when asked whether
acquisitions would be part of the strategy. Microsoft recently
agreed a search partnership with Yahoo! Inc (YHOO.O) after a
long and unsuccessful struggle to buy the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You'll continue to see us work hard and invest in the
marketing and the like, and of course we're trying to get the
Yahoo deal through regulatory," he said after a lecture to
Britain's CBI business lobby organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer also reiterated his opinion that global economic
growth was likely to return slowly and at lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Things have come down. I see them staying down and slowly
growing," he said in answer to a question from the audience,
adding, however: "I feel wholly unqualified with just a couple
of years of undergraduate economics to answer the question."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said information technology would play a key role in
driving efficiency and productivity gains to help the world out
of recession, while a joint study with industry research firm
IDC predicted the industry would drive the creation of 5.8
million new jobs worldwide by the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer also said Microsoft was freezing its research and
development budget, the world's largest, at $9.5 billion --
partly in order to preserve resources for the fight with Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CULTURAL REFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, whose Windows operating system runs on almost
nine in 10 of the world's PCs, suffered its first-ever drop in
annual revenue in its fiscal year to end-June -- a decline of 3
percent, including a 17 percent drop in the fourth quarter.
[ID:nN24471268]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was like a cultural reformation for us," he said. "We
said: 'First, let's lock the RD budget. Let's not necessarily
grow it the way we might have.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Let's make sure we keep the money we need to continue to
establish us in new businesses," he said. "We're trying to give
Google a little competition in the search business. They've been

market, according to industry tracker comScore's figures for
July. Yahoo comes a distant second with 8 percent and Microsoft
fourth with 3 percent, behind China's Baidu (BIDU.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft had cash and short-term investments of $31.4
billion as of the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the 10-year deal with Yahoo, Microsoft's new Bing
search engine will power queries on Yahoo's sites. In return,
Microsoft will pay Yahoo 88 percent of revenue from
advertisements generated from those sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In theory, that means Microsoft gets more traffic to refine
its search technology and build up its ad base, while Yahoo gets
revenue from search ads without the expense of managing its own
search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bing has made inroads in the United States since its launch
there four months ago, backed by a huge marketing campaign. But
its U.S. share slipped by more than 1 percentage point to 8.5
percent in September, according to analytics firm StatCounter.

about $5 billion, a senior company executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project will have a combined production capacity of
about 400,000 tonnes per year of carbon black, rubber and

told reporters at an industry conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plants, which will be based at the Kemya complex in
Jubail and the Yanpet complex in Yanbu, were expected to come
online between 2013 and 2014, Granier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Granier said that they will take a final investment decision
with Sabic by 2010 or 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think we have some key check points with our partner and
hurdles we have to overcome, probably we will go through an
appropriation of these projects not before end of 2010 or even
2011," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Granier said no contractor has been selected yet for the
engineering work which hung on a final investment decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to work with Sabic to make the project viable.
More information is needed like gas allocations and (to) find
ways to reduce the cost below $5 billion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and Saudi Aramco are investing $2.5 billion to reduce
sulphur from diesel and gasoline at their joint venture refinery
in Yanbu, Granier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This will not change the capacity of the 400,000 barrel per
day (bpd) oil refinery," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The clean fuel project would come on stream in 2011 or 2012,

Here are highlights from Friday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Employment Report in Depth

Going over 26 weeks for average unemployment is stunning. Keep in mind that
regular state unemployment benefits run out after 26 weeks. Benefits have been
extended as part of the stimulus package, but even those are scheduled to run
out soon for many. The House has approved another 13-week extension for those
people in high (over 8.5%) unemployment states, but the Senate has yet to act on
the bill. One may think this has to be an urgent priority, as an estimated 1.5
million people are scheduled to run out of even the extended benefits by the end
of the year. 

What are the odds that those people can continue to pay their mortgages? Not
very high, and that will lead to more of them being foreclosed upon, or simply
stop paying their mortgages and live as squatters in their own homes until the
sheriff shows up at the door. This will lead to more losses at the big banks
like Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), as well as
any institution that is holding the mortgage-backed paper. More and more, that
is you and me -- through the Federal Reserve, which has been in the process of
buying $1.25 Trillion of mortgage backed assets, as well as $200 billion of
Fannie (FNM) and Freddie (FRE) paper that is indirectly backed by mortgages. 

One interesting measure of this increase in the length of unemployment is the
ratio between short-term unemployed (less than 5 weeks) and long-term unemployed
(over 26 weeks). Prior to this year, the record for that ratio was 0.784 -- hit
in March of 1983, and the average since 1960 is 0.369. A year ago, it stood at
0.713. In September, it rose to 1.833 from 1.648 in August.

(See Our "Windows Mobile 6.5 Phone Gallery")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Mobile devices getting first-time looks encompassed the HTC Tilt 2 from ATT, the HTC Imagio from Verizon Wireless, and an as-yet-unnamed device built by Toshiba and anticipated for sale in the Japanese market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his keynote, Bach suggested this kind of hardware diversity is a key selling point for Microsoft in its struggles with Android, iPhone, Palm, and others for greater consumer mindshare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's iPhone, after all, has been available in very limited form factors, and the same has held true so far for Android phones promulgated by Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bach noted that while some users like large touchscreens, some practically can't live without keyboards, and others prefer slider architectures that give them a choice of using a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True to Bach's words, the Windows 6.5 smartphones displayed later in the day -- hung in and around artificial trees in a mock treehouse set up for the occasion -- sported a variety of different form factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although pre-loaded this time around with Windows 6.5, the Tilt 2 looks and feels quite similar to the original Tilt, a device known for its slider architecture, powerful speakers, and solid video performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's about the same size as the Tilt, and its screen size is a comparable 3.6-inches, the Imagio seems slightly thinner, and lacks a slideout keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The as-yet-unnamed smartphone from Toshiba -- so far codenamed the TG0I -- boasts a much larger screen, estimated by one Microsoft rep at 4.2 inches. But it also lacks a slider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a briefing during the event, Elizabeth Sloan, senior marketing manager for Windows Mobile pointed to another type of differentiator for Microsoft. Sloan contended that Apple targets its phones mainly at consumers, while RIM aims for corporate customers, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to provide both business- and consumer-oriented capabilities in a single mobile OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've figured out that the business user is often the same person as the one who uses the phone for personal things," Sloan noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sloan also honed in on some of the new features in Windows Mobile 6.5, including MyPhone; Windows Marketplace, Microsoft's answer to Apple's App Store; a mobile browser based on Internet Explorer (IE) 6.0; Theme Creator; and new, user-friendly screens such as the Today Screen, for accessing e-mail, calendar items, photos, favorites, and other frequently needed items from the same place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping users locate their lost cell phones, MyPhone lets users back up as much as 200 MB of contact info and other mobile data free of charge in the cloud, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MyPhone's phone-finding capabilities will work even when the smartphone has been turned off, according to Sloan. Microsoft can use GPS to locate a missing phone, and then "wake it up" remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering the phone-finding service free of charge for the first month. After that, the user will be charged $4.99 per incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/173232&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PISCATAWAY, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
IEEE and IBM today announced a publishing agreement to disseminate some of the
leading technical articles and papers in computer hardware, software and
information systems to a wider audience of researchers and interested readers
around the world. The IBM Journal of Research and Development, which now
includes the IBM Systems Journal, is one of the top-cited journals in the field
and addresses the latest advancements in computer science. Beginning in the
first quarter of 2010, all papers ever published in the IBM journals will be
available exclusively in the IEEE Xplore digital library
(www.ieee.org/ieeexplore). 

"IBM is proud to join with IEEE in the combined publication of the IBM Journal
of Research and Development and the IBM Systems Journal beginning in 2010," said
John Ritsko, editor-in-chief, IBM Technical Journals. "With more than four
million users coming to IEEE Xplore each month, this collaboration will achieve
the widest possible distribution for technical readers as well as enable
efficient and sustainable publication of these leadership journals." 

The IBM Journal of Research and Development and IBM Systems Journal, which have
been published online since 1998, merged into one fee-based online publication
in 2009. The production of future editions of the current publication, the IBM
Journal of Research and Development, will be handled by IEEE. IBM will be
responsible for the content acquisition and peer review, while IEEE assumes the
article production, copy editing, data conversion, online hosting and
maintenance. 

"The IBM journal is the #3 cited journal in computer science, hardware and
architecture according to the 2009 ISI Journal Citation Report and IEEE Xplore
contains some of the most highly cited technical journals in the world. By
adding high quality content such as the IBM Journal of Research and Development,
IEEE Xplore continues to be one of the most robust and valuable technical
libraries on the market today," said Tony Durniak, staff executive, IEEE
Publications. 

The research community will have the opportunity to purchase single IBM journal
articles via IEEE Xplore or a subscription package to the entire journal,
including all issues ever published, starting in 1957. IEEE members and digital
library subscribers also will be able to add the journals to their current
subscription packages. 

About IBM Journal of Research and Development

The journal was launched in 1957 by Thomas J. Watson Jr., IBM president and CEO,
who viewed it as "a strong indication of the increasing emphasis we at IBM want
to place in the future on fundamental science and technology." In 1962 as the
computer industry grew, the IBM Systems Journal was added to report advances in
software, software systems, and eventually services. These peer reviewed
journals have provided corporate professionals, academic faculty and students
with technical descriptions of key concepts, architectures, and engineering
principles that form much of the basis of today`s information technology
industry. As such, the IBM journals are among the most cited journals in
computer science.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made its holiday pitch Tuesday in New York giving a sneak peak at what its gadget lineup will look like. Here Microsoft stressed its portable music player Zune, Xbox, Windows Mobile 6.5 OS phones, and Windows 7. Microsoft's Robbie Bach, head of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, said this season it will stress the integration of "lifestyles" with "work-styles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All eyes were on Microsoft's Mobile 6.5 operating system which was announced today. The OS adds improvements to Internet Explorer Mobile, new navigation tools, Flash Lite support, and the introduction of Windows Marketplace for Mobile - a new app store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(See Related: Review of Windows Mobile OS 6.5 HTC Pure)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me Windows Mobile 6.5 seems like a transitional step to a future OS -- might it be called Windows Mobile 7? -- that could pose a more realistic challenge to Android, iPhone, and other mobile operating environments on the consumer side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Zune and Xbox, Microsoft says it will be rolling out a new feature that enables content downloaded to one of these devices to be played back on the other. The video quality will support an impressive 1080p high-definition (HD) video. Microsoft Zune representatives say the move will represent the first in a series of steps by Microsoft toward greater integration between various Windows-enabled hardware devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In attendance Tuesday was phone makers Samsung, HTC, LG, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba were all on hand delivering first looks at Windows Mobile 6.5 devices. Also on hand were mobile carriers Verizon Wireless, ATT, Sprint, Telus and Bell Mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, though, faces increasingly visible competition from both the Google Android and Apple iPhone camps in a struggle to expand beyond its relatively good position in the corporate smartphone space. Today Verizon and Google announced a partnership to bring Android-based smartphones, PDAs, and netbooks to market later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the CTIA show in Dallas, TX this week, Samsung and T-Mobile introduced the Behold II, a touchscreen phone that brings together the Linux-based Android operating system with Samsung's new TouchWiz user interface for one-touch access to the user's favorite features and applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/173214&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency in the data center is a top priority for Disney and Verizon, technology executives from the companies said last week. But the industry is still in the early stages of understanding how best to measure effectiveness, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has a companywide goal to reduce electricity consumption by 10% between 2006 and 2013, and the data center has to play a big role in achieving that objective, says Denis Weber, director of IT critical facilities infrastructure for the Walt Disney Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five tools to prevent energy waste in the data center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Disney, energy efficiency is being achieved through a series of small improvements, Weber said in an interview with Network World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of it just comes down to cleaning the facility up," Weber says. "And I don't mean with a dust pail and so on and a broom, but cleaning the data center up from obstructions and ensuring that every one of our floor tiles is sealed properly for air flow. Blanking panels -- not only that we have them but that they're in the right spot. Variable speed fans and motors on our CRAC units, increasing temperature settings across the board. These are all things that are not unique to Disney. But we have done it and that's where we've started to make progress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney and Verizon officials discussed their energy efficiency programs at the New York Stock Exchange last week during an event hosted by the Green Grid industry consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As much as people may look for silver bullets &#8230; it's really about all the [little] things," says Jeannie Diefenderfer, senior vice president of global engineering and planning for Verizon Services Organization. One key is finding the right temperature, and the right setting might vary across different parts of the data center, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you trying to make it cooler or hotter? Well it's both, right?" Diefenderfer says. "And that's exactly what we're all doing, trying to figure out if you can tolerate the hotter temperature in any of these centers by making sure the IT computing infrastructure can tolerate it, and making certain parts of the data center cooler so the critical infrastructure actually gets the cooling that it needs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Verizon is contemplating a more ambitious project involving solar energy. Diefenderfer says the company is trialing the use of solar for backup power sources, "with a full intent to use it if the results look positive." Verizon is also considering the use of hydrogen fuel cells, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Verizon and Disney are measuring Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which compares the total power used in a facility with the power devoted specifically to IT equipment. If a PUE is 2.0, that means for every watt of power used by IT equipment an additional watt is needed to cool and distribute power to that equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has been able to reduce the PUE in its main data center in Florida from 1.84 to 1.76 in the last nine months, resulting in some cost savings, Weber says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our main data center we have a number of power monitoring capabilities both from input power and out power outbound to the loads," Weber says. "We measure it every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week &#8230; and report it as an updated PUE every month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon just recently started measuring PUE, and ultimately plans to measure in all of its data centers, Diefenderfer says. In general, Disney and Verizon officials say it's a good metric for tracking the efficiency of a single data center over time, although it is less effective in comparing one company to another because of variations in how people measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies have also found it challenging to measure PUE in mixed-use facilities in which it is difficult to decipher how much power goes to IT and how much power goes to other business functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the industry gets used to PUE, the Green Grid is creating a broader metric that would look not just at power but at the amount of useful IT work achieved for each watt of energy used. The metric, a work-in-progress, is called DCeP, for data center energy productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measurements of productivity are subjective, notes Mark Monroe, a Green Grid board member who is director of sustainable computing for Sun Microsystems. But the Green Grid is developing a series of proxies to quantify the usefulness of work performed by data center equipment, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Power distribution effectiveness is one thing but what do I get out of that?" Monroe notes. "Is everything going toward screen savers, or is everything doing critical business transactions? And the proxies will tell us that kind of thing. The proxies will get us most of the way there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;VeriShield Protect is the Only Commercially Deployed Solution that Complies with
All 14 Data Field Encryption Best Practices Defined by Visa 
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
VeriFone Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: PAY), today announced that its VeriShield Protect
card payment data protection solution is in compliance with Visa`s best
practices for data field encryption, also known as end-to-end encryption, that
were published on October 5th. 

Visa`s announcement reflects growing momentum for implementation of end-to-end
encryption as a key payments security layer that can render any intercepted data
useless. 

"VeriShield Protect is the only commercially deployed solution that meets all
elements of Visa best practices for data field encryption and exceeds them in
some key areas," said VeriFone CEO Douglas G. Bergeron. 

"These data encryption best practices provide merchants and acquirers with a
scorecard for evaluating proposed end-to-end solutions," Bergeron continued.
"Three critical questions they should ask security vendors are: 

1. Does your key management technique protect against public key substitution? 

2. Do you protect keys utilizing industry-approved hardware security modules? 

3. Do you mutually authenticate the payment device to prevent man-in-the middle
attacks? 

"In addition, they need to determine what solution will support their existing
systems and can be implemented with little or no rewriting of their
applications." 

VeriShield Protect utilizes a unique format preserving encryption that achieves
the goals of Visa`s best practices and requires no changes to most POS software
and retail systems, or store procedures. 

The VeriShield Protect solution is installed into the security module of
VeriFone card-acceptance devices to encrypt cardholder data as soon as the card
is presented; encrypted data is transmitted to a Decryption Appliance installed
at a secure data center to ensure no unencrypted data can be intercepted.

 SEATTLE/PARIS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
introduced new software for mobile phones on Tuesday, promising
a range of devices to compete with Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone
and Research in Motion Ltd's RIM.TO BlackBerry.

The world's largest software company, in partnership with
phone makers and phone companies such as Samsung Electronics Co
Ltd (005930.KS), ATT Inc (T.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L),
said more than 30 new devices with the new Windows Mobile 6.5
software would be on the market in more than 20 countries by
the end of the year.

The new phones can play music, open Word and Excel
documents, and be synchronized over the Internet. But some
analysts worry that the new software is not enough of a leap to
keep up with rivals. [ID:nN05387476]

Investors generally welcomed the launch, sending Microsoft's
shares up 2.1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, in a
broadly higher market.

 Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer played down recent
industry talk that the company was developing its own
smartphone.

"We are not here to announce today that we are making
phones," he said at an event in Paris.

The market for phones is set to treble or quadruple in the
next few years, Ballmer said, and Microsoft is ready to
challenge other phone makers for market share.

He added that Windows Mobile's share of the mobile phone
market is equal to Apple's.

"We and Apple are neck and neck and we're chasing the two
other players," Ballmer said, referring to Nokia (NOK1V.HE),
the world's No. 1 smartphone maker, and Research in Motion.

 Microsoft has no plans to counter Google Inc's (GOOG.O)
move into the smartphone market with its free Android software,
according to Ballmer.

 "Free is not a business model," he said. "We are a
commercial company, we will look to gain revenue and profit
from our activities. You'll have to ask our competitors if
they'll make money on free things."

Microsoft also announced a new online application store,

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) has agreed to buy a stake in Ghana's Jubilee field, three sources close to the matter said on Tuesday, highlighting how a series of oil finds have brought West Africa to the center of the global oil stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest non-government controlled oil company by market capitalization beat off competition from western and Asian oil companies to purchase the interest in the multi-billion barrel field from private equity-backed Kosmos Energy, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Kosmos's partners in the field, UK-based oil explorer Tullow Oil (TLW.L) and Houston-based Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N), jumped on the news, on hopes the sale price, which was not disclosed by the sources, would imply higher valuations for the field than the market had so far ascribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The field could be worth $6/share to Anadarko. That's not reflected in the share price," one hedge fund manager said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anadarko shares traded up 4.8 percent at $64.62 at 1418 GMT (10:18 a.m. EDT), while Tullow shares traded up 7.7 percent at pence at 1,201 pence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale will likely yield a big payday for private equity groups Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Warburg Pincus WP.UL, Kosmos's backers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackstone shares traded up 4.5 percent at $14.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackstone invested $220.1 million in Kosmos in March 2004 from its fourth buyout fund BCP IV, according to an investor letter previously seen by Reuters. It valued that investment at $602 million at the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW OIL PROVINCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jubilee field is one of the biggest oil discoveries in recent years and a discovery by Tullow and Anadarko offshore Sierra Leone last month prompted hopes of a series of major fields running across Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosmos put its 30.875 percent stake in the West Cape Three Points block and an 18 percent interest in the Deepwater Tano block offshore Ghana, in which Jubilee is located, on the market earlier this year, industry sources previously said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction attracted bidding interest from Western oil majors and state-owned Asian energy giants, those sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Termination notices have been sent to the losing bidders, one of the sources close to the matter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have put widely varying valuations on the field. While some said it could be worth over $10 billion, one industry source said on Tuesday that a figure of $4 billion was more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, Anadarko, Kosmos and Tullow declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Matt Daily and Megan Davies in New York)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tom Bergin; Editing by Rupert Winchester and Elaine Hardcastle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Recovery Software Allows Systems Administrators to Retrieve Files Trapped
in Corrupted Virtual Disk Images 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
OfficeRecovery.com announces MediaHeal for Virtual Drives, a software utility
for data recovery from corrupted virtual disk images. 

Multiple RAID failures and malfunctions of virtualization systems are factors
that can lead to virtual disk image corruption. Unmountable and inaccessible by
the environments they are supposed to work with, corrupted virtual disks pose a
serious problem. Business-critical data becomes trapped in the disk image and
users lose access to files, email and databases. 

MediaHeal for Virtual Drives addresses the issue by extracting files stored in
corrupted virtual disks. Files are saved into a new safe location chosen by
user, allowing for quick return to normal business operation. 

The utility supports both VMware VMDK and Microsoft VHD virtual disk formats,
making data recovery possible for wide array of host systems, including vSphere,
ESXi, Virtual PC, Virtual Server and Hyper-V. 

"MediaHeal for Virtual Drives contributes to disaster recovery planning for
virtual environments, providing access to data that might be otherwise lost in
damaged images. It is important that the utility can be applied after the crash
and does not require any recovery agents and such to be installed in advance. I
think every IT department should get a license just in case," says Emil Sildos,
Recoveronix CEO. 

MediaHeal for Virtual Drives prices start at US $199 for a standard license. The
license allows one installation of the product, use for one host and data
recovery from disk images up to 10 Gb in size. Enterprise license allows two
installations, two hosts and unlimited disk image size. A special 1-Year Service
license is available for companies providing data recovery services. 

A free demo version of MediaHeal for Virtual Drives is available at
http://www.officerecovery.com/mediaheal-for-virtual-drives/. 

OfficeRecovery.com is a trade name for Recoveronix, a software company in the

&lt;p&gt; * Price of stake not disclosed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Field seen worth $4 bln to over $10 bln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds background, details, no comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tom Bergin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) has agreed to
buy a stake in Ghana's Jubilee field, three sources close to the
matter said on Tuesday, highlighting how a series of oil finds
have brought West Africa to the centre of the global oil stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest non-government controlled oil company by
market capitalisation beat off competition from western and
Asian oil companies to purchase the interest in the
multi-billion barrel field from private equity-backed Kosmos
Energy, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Kosmos's partners in the field, UK-based oil
explorer Tullow Oil (TLW.L) and Houston-based Anadarko Petroleum
(APC.N), jumped on the news, on hopes the sale price, which was
not disclosed by the sources, would imply higher valuations for
the field than the market had so far ascribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The field could be worth $6/share to Anadarko. That's not
reflected in the share price," one hedge fund manager said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anadarko shares traded up 4.8 percent at $64.62 at 1418 GMT,
while Tullow shares traded up 7.7 percent at pence at 1,201
pence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale will likely yield a big payday for private equity
groups Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Warburg Pincus [WP.UL],
Kosmos's backers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blackstone shares traded up 4.5 percent at $14.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blackstone invested $220.1 million in Kosmos in March 2004
from its fourth buyout fund BCP IV, according to an investor
letter previously seen by Reuters. It valued that investment at
$602 million at the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW OIL PROVINCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Jubilee field is one of the biggest oil discoveries in
recent years and a discovery by Tullow and Anadarko offshore
Sierra Leone last month prompted hopes of a series of major
fields running across Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kosmos put its 30.875 percent stake in the West Cape Three
Points block and an 18 percent interest in the Deepwater Tano
block offshore Ghana, in which Jubilee is located, on the market
earlier this year, industry sources previously said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The auction attracted bidding interest from Western oil
majors and state-owned Asian energy giants, those sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Termination notices have been sent to the losing bidders,
one of the sources close to the matter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have put widely varying valuations on the field.
While some said it could be worth over $10 billion, one industry
source said on Tuesday that a figure of $4 billion was more
likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, Anadarko, Kosmos and Tullow declined comment.

&lt;p&gt;SYRACUSE, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase and Syracuse University marked the grand opening today of the
JPMorgan Chase Technology Center at SU, an on-campus facility where students and
faculty will work side-by-side with bank employees conducting research and
running the bank`s global technology operations. 

SU Chancellor and President Nancy Cantor, JPMorgan Chase Chief Administrative
Officer and Operating Committee Member Frank Bisignano and New York State
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver were among those who cut the ceremonial ribbon
to officially open the facility, an important centerpiece of the unique
corporate-university collaboration established by JPMorgan Chase and SU in June
2007. 

The collaboration, which will bring hundreds of technology jobs to the region,
is one of the most comprehensive between business and a research university,
which leverages the best of both organizations and delivers exceptional value to
both and to the community. 

"We`re collaborating with JPMorgan Chase on a global scale and this Technology
Center provides a window into our precedent-setting relationship," says Cantor.
"From pioneering, joint research and discovery, to hands-on teaching and
learning, to extraordinary, real-world work experiences for our students, the
whole, dynamic range of mutual benefits can be seen right here. On top of all
that, this hub for global enterprise technology is bringing engaging,
information age jobs to our community. This is the very picture of innovation in
higher education." 

"This is as an investment in the University, in the upstate New York community
and in our bank," said Bisignano. "We are conducting cutting edge research and
working side-by-side with the University to change the way technology and
business students are trained, making them well prepared to enter the workforce
after graduation." 

The collaboration transformed the way the global enterprise technology courses
are developed and taught. University faculty and bank employees jointly
developed a new Global Enterprise Technology (GET) minor for the University and
conducted applied research projects with students in areas such as
cyber-security and risk management. JPMorgan Chase executives enhance the
curriculum via guest lectures and close collaboration with SU`s new Center for
Information Security and Assurance Technology. Nearly 450 students are enrolled
in courses this semester within the collaboration`s minor, and interest is
growing every semester since last fall. 

JPMorgan Chase also offers short and long-term internships to students for
school credit and in some cases for pay, to challenge and maximize talent.
Interns in the extended internship program have the opportunity to work in
offices around the United States and abroad. Thirty students are currently
engaged in academic year internships with the company. 

The technology center, which seats 125 workers and occupies the first two floors
of SU`s Lyman Hall, fosters an environmentally efficient and collaborative work
environment. It is a "paperless" office with minimal paper storage; has
innovative technology features such as wireless and virtual desktops, and
state-of-the-art collaborative and individual workspaces. 

JPMorgan Chase opened the application process this summer for more than 100
center-based new technology jobs. Forty-two full-time employees are currently
based there, with more to be hired in the coming year. Employees are working on
information technology and cyber security, risk analysis and application
development for JPMorgan Chase and its lines of business. Other positions within
the center include managing or assisting with the daily technology operations
and support. 

Candidates may apply for jobs online at
http://careers.jpmorganchase.com/career/careerhome, by clicking on the
"Experienced Opportunities" section, selecting "Search and Apply for Jobs" and
refining the search location to Syracuse, N.Y. 

The collaboration is illustrative of SU`s Scholarship in Action vision, which
encourages collaborations that both enrich student and faculty scholarship and
that address critical issues facing the world. 

Laura Perdiue from Fairfield, Conn., a senior majoring in marketing management
and information management and technology, was engaged in a GET extended
internship throughout the spring semester and the summer and worked in New York
City. 

"The entire process was a learning experience, and each day I was exposed to new
technologies, problems or situations where I had to absorb, ask questions and
help solve whatever was ahead," Perdiue says. 

Chancellor Cantor also announced today that Bisignano will receive the
Chancellor`s Medal for Outstanding Achievement from SU. Bisignano is being
recognized for his visionary leadership in forging an innovative form of
university-private sector partnership represented by the JPMorgan Chase-SU
collaboration, which yields not only enhanced opportunities for the students and
faculty of the University and for the corporation, but for the community. 

The Chancellor`s Medal is given to individuals in honor of their extraordinary
contributions to the University, to their areas of expertise and/or to the
community, recognizing qualities to which the University urges SU students to
aspire. Previous honorees include: Vice President Joseph Biden; "The Syracuse
Eight;" renowned acting and activist couple Ruby Dee and the late Ossie Davis;
Nobel Peace Prize recipient Shirin Ebadi; the late U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan; the late, eminent American composer Aaron Copland; The New Yorker
magazine columnist and best-selling author Kenneth Auletta; and former Secretary
of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala. 

The award will be conferred at a formal ceremony in New York City on a date to
be determined.

&lt;p&gt; * FDA document says Selzentry well tolerated * FDA advisory panel to meet Thursday * Company: more HIV drugs needed  (Adds company comment, background on drug, byline) By Susan Heavey WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) HIV drug Selzentry appears to be safe for wider use in certain patients with the disease who have not yet begun taking any medications, U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff said in a document released on Tuesday. The drug, also know by its generic name maraviroc, is already FDA-approved in combination with similar drugs for HIV patients who have tried other antiretroviral medications. Pfizer is seeking FDA permission to market Selzentry for HIV patients who have a certain variation of HIV-1 -- one of two strains of the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS -- who have not yet tried any medications. It would be taken with other antiretroviral drugs. An FDA staff document said the drug appeared to be well tolerated in patients in a company-funded study. A review of an FDA database also found no new reported safety concerns in HIV patients who have already been taking the drug. The agency's analysis of how well Selzentry worked also backed the company's findings that the drug reduced the virus in patients taking it, compared with those given efavirenz, the FDA said. Efavirenz is marketed as Sustiva by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N). The FDA released the document ahead of a public meeting on Thursday when the agency will ask its outside advisers for a recommendation on whether to approve the drug's wider use. It usually follows their advice. Pfizer said its trial showed the drug is safe and effective. As many HIV medications as possible are needed on the U.S. market now that the disease has transformed into more of a chronic condition, it added. Although there are other good treatment options available for patients, more are needed to meet the needs of a heterogeneous patient population, the drugmaker said in a separate document also released on Tuesday. If approved, Selzentry would only be indicated for adults with chemokine (c-c motif) receptor 5, or CCR5, tropic HIV-1, the FDA said. The drug aims to prevent the virus strain from entering the body's cells, it added. The documents were posted on the FDA's website here  (Reporting by Susan Heavey, editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Maureen Bavdek)

&lt;p&gt;Firm Earns More Overall "Best in Class" Ratings Than Any Other Administrator and
"Best in Class" Ratings in Every Category in Europe
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan was ranked as a top provider of private equity fund administration,
according to a key industry survey by Global Custodian magazine. 

J.P. Morgan received best-in-class recognition across 54 service categories,
securing more top ratings than any other administrator, according to the Global
Custodian 2009 Private Equity Fund Administration Survey. J.P. Morgan was
top-rated overall for the third consecutive year, since the inception of the
survey. Additionally, J.P. Morgan received best-in-class ratings across every
category in Europe, was the only provider to be rated across all asset
categories, and was one of only two providers to receive best-in-class awards in
multiple regions. 

According to the magazine, "J.P. Morgan maintains its perennial high standard.
The fact that J.P. Morgan has grown its business on the foundations of a private
equity fund manager [J.P. Morgan Partners], as opposed to setting up a third
party in-sourcing business of its own, is certainly noticed by clients who know
what matters to them." 

"We are thrilled to be top-rated for the third year in a row by Global Custodian
magazine," said James Hutter, global business executive for J.P. Morgan Private
Equity Fund Services. "We are gratified that we have maintained a deep
understanding of the client base, and have earned a reputation for exceptional
service delivery." 

The magazine noted that J.P. Morgan`s transition team is especially admired and
that the client service score is "exceptional." One client lauds "exposure to
many different funds/situations, which is very helpful when on-boarding new
funds." 

Other client comments in the survey included:

* "We often pat ourselves on the back for choosing J.P. Morgan." 
* "Excellent brand image &#8230;" 
* "There has never been a single instance, even after regular work hours, when
our manager has not been responsive to my e-mails and phone calls and has always
responded to me in a professional and respectful manner."

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CRUZ, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Evans Data Corp today announced that Google is the company that developers think
of as having the best ability to execute in a public cloud setting while IBM is
strongest for the private cloud, according to a recent survey of over 400
software developers published this week in an Evans Data Market Alert. 

The survey, conducted in September, measured developers` perceptions of leading
vendors in the cloud space including Amazon, Microsoft, AT, Rackspace, VMware,
Sun, and HP, among others. Adoption, adoption intentions, completeness of
offering, and ability to execute were rated by the developers along with
capabilities such as security, scalability, low latency, reliability, no vendor
lock-in, and cost to value ratio. In addition, developers positioned the vendors
as better suited to either public or private cloud offerings. 

The survey report, which is free with registration, can be found here. 

"The Cloud environment is currently very dynamic both in terms of development
and vendor offerings," said Janel Garvin of Evans Data Corp and author of the
report. "Many are evolving their cloud services to span both public and private
clouds and we`ll soon see some interesting competitors vying across the spectrum
as cloud becomes more pervasive." 

Amazon was seen as having the most complete solution today, but Google was
thought to have more ability to execute, and Google topped Amazon in most other
categories. Additionally, adoption intentions in the next 12 months were much
stronger for Google than for Amazon. IBM was thought to be able to provide the
most secure cloud environment and was also rated high in reliability and ability
to execute - qualities essential to large enterprises considering private or
hybrid clouds.

BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Interactive Studios today announced the availability of Disney Sing It:
Pop Hits, its hit-heavy multi-platform karaoke-style video game. A perfect
convergence of pop culture, Disney Sing It: Pop Hits features some of the
biggest names and chart-topping songs in pop music to create the ultimate video
game singing experience, complete with singing tips and vocal lessons with
singer and actress Tiffany Thornton, from the Disney Channel Original Series
"Sonny With A Chance." 

"Disney Sing It: Pop Hits offers a great collection of hit songs that today`s
teens will instantly recognize and players of all ages will come to love," said
Craig Relyea, senior vice president of global marketing, Disney Interactive
Studios. "Players can also improve their skills with vocal lessons and breathing
exercises in the game, helping them to become superstar performers in their own
living room." 

In Disney Sing It: Pop Hits for Wii, PlayStation3 computer entertainment system
and PlayStation2 computer entertainment system, players can match their talent

popular music videos from global fan favorites. Among the notable acts in this

head-to-head in multi-player modes. Players can also get tips in a newly
expanded "Sing It Pro" mode led by Tiffany Thornton. Tiffany shows players how

&lt;p&gt;IBM and Asustek said on Tuesday that they have entered into a broad patent cross-licensing agreement that ends all patent litigation between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement will be the basis for future collaboration between them, the two companies said in a statement. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent dispute dates back to December 2007 when IBM filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission alleging that certain computer products and components of the Taiwanese company and its U.S. subsidiary infringed IBM patents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three patents covered power supplies, computer cooling and computer clustering technologies, IBM said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2008, Asustek countered with a patent infringement lawsuit against IBM in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging IBM had infringed two of its patents.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I can confirm that the Fawley FCC and associated units were

following scheduled maintenance activity," said a spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit is used to make the motor fuel gasoline and was
shut in the first week of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 326,000 barrel a day Fawley refinery in southern England
is the UK's largest.

Here are highlights from Monday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Bank Failure Tally Reaches 98

The recession continues to weigh heavily on banks as U.S. regulators on Friday
shuttered three more banks in Michigan, Minnesota and Colorado. This takes the
total number of failed federally insured banks this year to 98, compared to 25
in 2008 and 3 in 2007. 

The failed banks were Warren, MI-based Warren Bank with about $538 million in
assets and $501 million in deposits; Spring Grove, MN-based Jennings State Bank
with total assets of $56 million and deposits of $52 million and Pueblo,
CO-based Southern Colorado National Bank with about $40 million in total assets
and $32 million in deposits. 

The failure of these institutions represents another sizable impact on the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation`s (FDIC) fund for protecting customer
accounts, as it has been appointed receiver for these banks. The failure of
Warren Bank is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund an estimated $275
million, Jennings State Bank`s failure will cost about $12 million and the
failure of Southern Colorado National Bank is expected to cost about $6.6
million. 

The FDIC insures deposits at 8,195 institutions with roughly $13.5 trillion in
assets. When a bank fails, it reimburses customers for deposits of up to
$250,000 per account. The outbreak of failing financial institutions has
significantly stretched the regulator`s deposit insurance fund. At June 30,
2009, the fund corpus fell to $10.4 billion, the lowest since 1993, from $13.0
billion in the prior quarter. 

The FDIC sold Warren Bank`s branches, deposits and about $83 million of assets
to Huntington National Bank, the main subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares
(HBAN). 

Central Bank of Stillwater, MN, agreed to assume Jennings State Bank's $52.4
million in deposits and the entire assets. FDIC and Central Bank agreed to share
losses on about $37.7 million of Jennings State Bank's assets. 

The FDIC sold Southern Colorado National Bank's deposits and almost all of its
assets to Legacy Bank of Wiley, CO. The FDIC and Legacy Bank agreed to share
losses on about $25.5 million of Southern Colorado National Bank's assets. 

In order to replenish the declining fund, the FDIC may ask the U.S. banks to pay
fees for three years in advance. Also, the regulators are considering requesting
the healthy banks to bail out the government as soon as it is necessary to
replenish the deposit insurance fund, which has slipped to 0.22% of insured
deposits, below the mandated minimum of 1.15%. 

In the second quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 416 from 305 in the first quarter. This is the highest
since the savings and loan crisis in 1994. Increasing loan losses on commercial
real estate are expected to cause hundreds more bank failures in the next few
years. The FDIC anticipates the bank failures to cost about $70 billion over the
next five years. 

The failure of Washington Mutual last year is the largest in the U.S. history.
It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (JPM). The other major acquirers of failed
institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), U.S. Bancorp (USB),
Zions Bancorp (ZION), among others.

leader in technology training**
--(Business Wire)--

 WHAT:     Grand opening and ribbon cutting ceremony for the JPMorgan Chase Technology Center at Syracuse University,        
           
an important on-campus centerpiece of the unprecedented corporate-university collaboration.                      
                                                                                                                             
 WHO:      JPMorgan Chase CAO Frank Bisignano                                                                                
           Chancellor Nancy Cantor

 WHY:      JPMorgan Chase and Syracuse University established their unique collaboration in June 2007 to make SU a leader    
           
in training technology students, while bringing real business benefits to the bank. Students and faculty will    
           
work side-by-side with JPMorgan Chase employees at the on-campus facility. The collaboration also benefits the   
           
broader Syracuse community by creating full and part-time technology jobs in upstate New York.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan's (JPM.N) private banking arm in Asia is positioning for a deceleration in the global economy in the second half of 2010 by staying underweight on equities, a senior executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank is favoring alternative return drivers that are less dependent on growth, such as hedge funds, commodities, currencies and credit, and beefing up its cash holdings instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has to do partly with how we see the world in the next six to twelve months and partly to do with the risk sensitivity of our clients," Ivan Leung, chief investment strategist with JPMorgan Private Bank in Asia, told the Reuters Wealth Management Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leung said the bank was 4 percent underweight on equities, 8 percent overweight on hedge fund strategies and 5 percent overweight on cash when compared with a balanced portfolio which has a 40 percent allocation to equities, 40 percent to fixed income and 20 percent to alternative assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rising tide has lifted all boats but once the policy measures begin to fade out, we may see that the U.S. consumer is still impaired and this has been a jobless growth," said Leung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not betting against the U.S. consumer but I don't want to bet my clients money on them either," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'FULLY VALUED'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leung said the private bank had managed to outperform the benchmark indexes so far this year both in returns and risk-adjusted returns as well as attract record inflows in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the private bank's clients who are first generation Asian entrepreneurs were reluctant to pile into equities earlier this year while their businesses were still floundering while others pulled money out of hedge funds after managers put up gates preventing redemptions last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk tolerance is rising now, but I will concede that the Asian equity markets are looking fully valued now. So this is the time to be even more careful," said Leung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vast majority of the private bank's clients in Asia fit a moderate risk profile, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many wealthy investors suffered heavily when financial markets tumbled in 2008. According to Capgemini and Merrill Lynch's global wealth report, the number of high net-worth individuals fell 15 percent last year, while their total worth declined by a fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong's high net-worth population fell the most, dropping 61 percent from the end of 2007 to around 37,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, however, managed to grow its private banking assets in 2008 primarily on inflows into its U.S. business as the bank weathered the storm better than its peers. Its private banking business manages $400 billion globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealth manager is still positive on growth in the Asian economies of China, India and Indonesia while it recently started investing in the middle-eastern equities which has lagged the rally in the emerging markets this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been telling clients that the easy money has been made and now is the time to trust professionals with your money. The next year or two will mark a sweet spot for active management," Leung said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEAWOOD, Kan.--(Business Wire)--
The American Academy of Family Physicians today announced the Consumer Alliance,
a new corporate partnership program, with its first alliance partner, The
Coca-Cola Company. 

The Consumer Alliance is a program that allows corporate partners like The
Coca-Cola Company to work with the AAFP to educate consumers about the role
their products can play in a healthy, active lifestyle. As part of this
partnership, The Coca-Cola Company is providing a grant to the AAFP to develop
consumer education content on beverages and sweeteners for FamilyDoctor.org, an
award-winning consumer health and wellness resource. 

"The AAFP recognizes the significant influence that consumer companies have on
consumer health," said Lori Heim, M.D., president-elect of the AAFP. "We look
forward to working with The Coca-Cola Company, and other companies in the
future, on the development of educational materials to teach consumers how to
make the right choices and incorporate the products they love into a balanced
diet and a healthy lifestyle." 

"We are proud to be the first company to partner with the AAFP and feature
content on FamilyDoctor.org," said Dr. Rhona Applebaum, vice president and chief
scientific and regulatory officer at The Coca-Cola Company. "Our partnership
will help provide Americans with credible information on beverages and enable
consumers to make informed decisions about what they drink based on individual
need." 

FamilyDoctor.org was recently named one of "Five Great Health Sites" on a
Newsweek.com blog, and one of the "`Top Ten` Most Useful Web Sites" by the
Medical Library Association. The new beverage and sweetener content is expected
to launch in January 2010. Visit familydoctor.org for more information. 

While the AAFP does not endorse any specific brand, product or service, the AAFP
Consumer Alliance will collaborate with companies that share the common goal of
informing consumers, as well as medical professionals, about new advances in
product science and best practices for good health. 

About The American Academy of Family Physicians

Founded in 1947, the AAFP represents more than 94,600 physicians and medical
students nationwide. It is the only medical society devoted solely to primary
care. 

Nearly one in four of all office visits are made to family physicians. That is
208 million office visits each year - nearly 83 million more than the next
largest medical specialty. Today, family physicians provide more care for
America`s underserved and rural populations than any other medical specialty. 

In the increasingly fragmented world of health care where many medical
specialties limit their practice to a particular organ, disease, age or sex,
family physicians are dedicated to treating the whole person across the full
spectrum of ages. Family medicine`s cornerstone is an ongoing, personal
patient-physician relationship focused on integrated care.

conditions, and wellness, please visit familydoctor.org. 

About the AAFP Consumer Alliance

In addition to health care providers, AAFP recognizes that consumer products
companies have significant influence over consumer health. Therefore, the
Consumer Alliance is a strategy whereby AAFP aims to partner with companies who
demonstrate good corporate stewardship and a strategic focus on consumer health.


FamilyDoctor.org, AAFP`s consumer health and wellness resource, is the
fundamental core of the AAFP Consumer Alliance. Through partnerships in the
Consumer Alliance, AAFP will continue to expand the reach and breadth of its
offerings on FamilyDoctor.org by adding more tools, trackers, videos, and
consumer-friendly education materials on important health and wellness topics. 

In addition to content development on FamilyDoctor.org, AAFP will work with
Consumer Alliance Partners to develop robust new programs and materials to
educate consumers and medical professionals about making better choices with
regard to food and beverage selections, physical activity, emotional well-being,
and other ways to achieve a balanced and healthy lifestyle.

&lt;p&gt; * DOJ probe is of mainframe business&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Scope of investigation is broad - CCIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * IBM says will cooperate with any DOJ inquiries
 (Adds IBM statement in paragraphs 7-9))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Diane Bartz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department
is investigating allegations that International Business
Machines (IBM.N) abused its dominance of the mainframe business
to squeeze rivals, Computer and Communications Industry
Association Chairman Ed Black said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CCIA had urged the Justice Department to open the
probe, accusing IBM of withdrawing licenses for its operating
systems from customers who use non-IBM hardware, retaliating
against business partners deemed disloyal, bundling its
mainframe operating systems with hardware and acquiring startup
PSI to stifle competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The non-profit trade group -- which counts software giants
Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Oracle ORCL.O, but not IBM, as members
-- also alleged that IBM refused to license its mainframe
operating systems to users of "Hercules" for installation on
machines other than IBM mainframes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hercules is open-source software that allows IBM's
mainframe operating systems to run on Intel-based (INTC.O) and
Advanced Micro Devices-based (AMD.N) personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are aware that Justice has begun the CID investigatory
process. The scope is quite broad," said Black, adding that one
of its focuses is antitrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A CID is the equivalent of a subpoena and indicates that an
investigation is under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news comes after software developer T3 Technologies had
filed an antitrust suit against IBM in Manhattan federal
district court. The judge threw out the suit on Sept. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined comment.
But IBM pointed out the T3 suit dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Just last week, a U.S. District Court dismissed T3's
claims against IBM in their entirety. We understand the
Department of Justice has asked T3 for documents from the
litigation," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM intends to cooperate with any inquiries from the
Department of Justice. We continue to believe there is no merit
to T3's claims, and that IBM is fully entitled to enforce our
intellectual property rights and protect the investments that
we have made in our technologies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black, however, said the Justice Department's decision
reflected "a pledge by the Obama administration that they're
going to take antitrust seriously. They mean it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The probe is similar to others it has opened into dominant
firms. The head of the Justice Department's antitrust division,
Christine Varney, said in May she planned to take a more
aggressive approach with firms that use their market power to
crush competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The department is also investigating telecoms companies for
potential antitrust violations. Smaller telcos have complained
that the giants -- ATT (T.N) and Verizon Communications (VZ.N)
-- used their market share to squeeze out smaller rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smaller firms have also protested against the exclusive
deals that cellphone companies made with handset makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're (the Justice Department) going to want to make
this stick," said antitrust attorney David Balto. "There's good
reason for IBM to be concerned."

&lt;p&gt;Eight months after announcing they would make their virtualization wares interoperable, Microsoft and Red Hat delivered the goods Wednesday on their first major collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies announced they have completed testing and validation and that they now fully support virtualization environments that combine Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a fairly big deal [in February 2009], there had never been an interoperability agreement between Microsoft and Red Hat," said Mike Evans, vice president of corporate development for Red Hat. Evans emphasized there was no financial arrangement, patent licensing or other deals. "It is straightforward interoperability testing," he said, hinting at other deals Microsoft has cut with Sun and Novell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cooperation on the virtualization front has become the order of the day as virtualization has established itself as an integral part of data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work by the duo helps expand support on both platforms. Red Hat already supports VMware, while Microsoft has a support deal with Novell and its Suse Linux platform. In July, Microsoft shocked the industry by contributing virtualization device drivers to the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The completed certifications include: Validation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 using the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor with Windows Server 2003, 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 guests; and certification of host platforms running Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, &#160;Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V and Microsoft Hyper-V with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Mike Neil, general manager of Windows Server and server virtualization, said in a blog post that the cooperation goes beyond the operating system and both companies "have select applications that would receive technical support when running on certified server virtualization software."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil said the Microsoft applications include BizTalk Server, Exchange Server, SharePoint server and others. On the Red Hat side, users can run JBoss Enterprise Middleware within a virtual machine guest on Hyper-V and receive coordinated technical support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans said the agreement grants support to any customer with a valid Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, while Microsoft customers with support agreements for Windows Server 2008 are eligible for support. Microsoft customers without agreements can purchase support per incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans said Red Hat is not discussing how it will support Windows Server 2008 guests within its management tools. He said there would be more information on that at year-end when Red Hat ships Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager, a set of management tools for desktops and servers. Red Hat also will ship a stand-alone hypervisor called Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor that will also support Windows guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 4.x and 5.x on its System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2, but will need to update its Virtual Machine Manager software to manage Red Hat guest operating systems on Hyper-V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow John Fontana on Twitter: twitter.com/johnfontana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has changed its proposed browser "ballot screen" to wrap up a nine-month antitrust case in the European Union, but rivals remained noncommittal today about whether the modifications are enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months ago, Microsoft told Brussels-based antitrust officials that it would give users a chance to download rivals' browsers with a "ballot screen," just one of the moves Microsoft has made since January in an effort to ward off fines or even more drastic measures by the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the commission said Microsoft had altered some provisions of the ballot screen, and that it would take comments on those changes from consumers, software makers and computer manufacturers until Nov. 9. The comment period is required by EU law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We agreed to make a significant number of changes to improve our proposals, and we believe that we've been able to do that," said Brad Smith, Microsoft's chief counsel, in a telephone press conference today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera Software and Google said they were studying the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Opera Software supports the concept of a ballot screen to give users easy access to better browsers," said Hakon Wium Lie, Opera's chief technology officer in an e-mail today. "The important question is how this ballot screen is implemented. We are still studying the announcement ... and will have further comments at a later stage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera's December 2007 complaint sparked the antitrust action, which the EC filed last January, accusing Microsoft of illegally bundling Internet Explorer (IE) with Windows and therefore shielding it from real competition .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proposal to increase consumer choice in browsers has just been made public and we, like many others, will be reviewing it with interest," a Google spokesman added from Brussels today. "The test will be whether people can easily choose the browser they want to use." Google's interest comes from its Chrome browser, one of the 12 that will be offered users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera, Google and Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, have been allowed to see the charges against Microsoft, study the July ballot screen proposal, and suggest changes. Mozilla criticized Microsoft's July idea, with top executives claiming that it favored IE and failed to install other browsers. Opera, meanwhile, called on Microsoft to offer the ballot screen to all customers, even though Microsoft is legally obligated to offer it only to EU Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's revised ballot screen proposal addresses several concerns of those rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the documentation ( download PDF ) released by the commission today, the "Install" link offered for the choices will not only download the selected browser -- which is what Microsoft had proposed before -- but will also install the application on the user's machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An 'install' link will connect to a vendor-managed distribution server, which, upon the user's confirmation, can directly download the installation package of the selected web browser for local execution  the resulting situation will therefore equal a scenario in which the user himself had downloaded and executed the installation package without being aided by the Ballot Screen," said Microsoft's new proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ballot screen will also display the choices -- Apple's Safari, Chrome, IE, Firefox and Opera on the first screen, an additional seven on a second -- in alphabetical order by the name of the browser maker -- a change from before, when Microsoft had placed IE in the first spot on the far left based on its market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other changes include a new screen that will provide some basic information about browsers, and remind users that they should be connected to the Internet before they proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also modified the timing of the ballot screen, which will be delivered to Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 users via Windows Update. Previously, Microsoft said it would push the ballot screen to Windows 7 owners on Oct. 22, or within two weeks of approval of the deal, then follow that three to six months later for Windows XP and Vista users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Microsoft has agreed to start offering the ballot screen to all Windows users eight weeks after EU antitrust officials sign off on the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, the EU seems satisfied with the revised ballot screen. "We believe this is an answer," said commission chief Neelie Kroes in a press conference today in Brussels. She also indicated that it was likely the commission would accept Microsoft's ballot screen revisions. "At the end of the day that's what we are looking for," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Kroes acknowledged that the revamped proposal may not make everyone happy. "A number of people are never 100 percent satisfied," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was "very pleased" with the EU's decision to move into the last month of the case, Smith said in his press conference. "We welcome the announcement by the European Commission to move forward with formal market testing of Microsoft's proposal relating to Web browser choice," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON -- IBM this week unveiled a new private cloud storage service for enterprise-class companies at its Information Infrastructure Analyst Summit conference here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also disclosed plans to release a new disk-based archive array called the IBM Information Appliance that can scale to 300TB and offers retention rules and customized policies. The company also said their SAN Volume Controller storage virtualization appliance now supports solid state disk drives, greatly increasing the throughput of the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's new Smart Business Storage Cloud private cloud service uses commodity components such as x86 servers in IBM's BladeCenter rack, and a scaled-down version of the company's high-performance General Parallel File System to offer a preconfigured rack-mountable file-based cloud storage offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service uses IBM's Scale-out File Services (SOFS) and can be configured with either IBM's WebSphere CloudBurst appliance or the XIV grid storage system it gained via the acquisition of XIV Ltd. in 2008. Both Cloudburst and XIV can be configured with IBM's BladeCenter or System X servers. The SOFS software, which creates a single global name space for files, enabling universal sharing of files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its cloud storage direction, IBM also announced it will begin shipping its Information Archive appliance that uses the XIV management software, its Enhanced Tamper Protection tool and IBM's BladeCenter servers to offer users a pre-configured, rack-mountable disk-based archive system in the first quarter of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al Zollar, general manager of IBM's Tivoli products unit, said the Information Archive appliance can be installed and running with a disk archive system in "a day or less." The archive box uses Tivoli Storage Manager software, enabling backup to tape archive behind the array while also de-dupicating it, removing any repetitive data blocks, files or e-mail attachments to consolidate storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zollar said the IBM Information Archive is designed for archiving a broad range of electronic records, including e-mail, digital images, databases, applications, instant messages, account records, contracts and insurance claim documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information Archive will be supported by IBM e-mail, content, data and report archiving software, including the IBM Optim Data Growth Solution, the IBM Content Collector and other Enterprise Content Management offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The IBM Information Archive leverages IBM's strengths in software disk and tape to deliver a solution that will help clients manage their information infrastructure needs," Zollar said. Pricing for the IBM Information Archive will be announced prior to its slated first quarter of 2010 availability, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Rudolph, vice president of IBM's System Storage, said that IBM also upgraded is storage virtualization appliance, SAN Volume Controller, by adding solid state drives. The upgrade culminates the company's QuickSilver proof of concept project that was launched a year ago. At the time, IBM showed off a demonstration of an upgraded QVC serving up 1 million input/output operations per second (IOPS). The company said it would have taken 6,000 Fibre Channel hard disk drives to achieve the same throughput.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SSD in the SAN Volume Controller is huge news," said Arun Taneja, of the Tenaja Group. "The biggest knock on IBM's virtualization appliance in the past was bandwidth. SSD increases that bandwidth by multiples."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coupled with its midrange TotalStorage DS4700 array, the SAN Volume Controller with SSDs is two and a half times faster than the previous generation SVC, IBM contended. "Just grabbing a bunch of SSD and stuffing them into an array wasn't necessarily the best way to do this," Rudolph said, saying the appliance will be able to manage various tiers of storage, including SSD "by policies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudolph also said IBM plans to optimize DB2 for SSD technology, but did not elaborate on the timeframe for that upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Solid state is coming into the market and it's less about the technology and more about the use case scenario," Steve Mills, senior vice president of group executive IBM software group. "How to optimize it for performance is what's important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM did not disclose pricing information for its new products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court dismissed a lawsuit of former employees of Washington Mutual WAMUQ.PK against JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) to recover their retirement account losses after the collapse of the thrift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs filed a case in November 2007 against Washington Mutual asserting the financial company breached duties it owed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by allowing them to invest their 401(k) funds in Washington Mutual stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funds declined as the stock of Washington Mutual, one of the largest U.S. financial institutions, plunged -- hurt by mounting losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Washington Mutual filed for bankruptcy in September 2009, the employees of the company added JPMorgan Chase as a defendant, after the second largest U.S. bank acquired some banking assets of the failed company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But earlier this year, JPMorgan asked the court to dismiss the action saying it had bought only assets of Washington Mutual and not the entire holding company, alleging it was not responsible for the collapse of the financial institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman dictated JPMorgan could not be liable for the mismanagement of the retirement funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re, Washington Mutual Inc Securities, Derivative  ERISA litigation, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 08-1919&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio; Additional reporting Emily Chasan and Elinor Comlay; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Salesforce Partners with Cisco

At a recent press release, cloud computing company Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM)
disclosed that it will, along with Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO), be
delivering a complete contact center in the cloud. The Customer Interaction
Cloud, formed by Cisco and Salesforce.com, will use the newly introduced service
cloud 2 from salesforce.com along with Cisco Unified Communications. 

This innovative solution will resolve the customer service issue of Small and
Medium Businesses (SMB) to a large extent, and enable them to run their customer
service operation through the cloud. 

This product is mainly targeted at the SMB clients, as demand for cloud
computing applications is strongest in this market. The company expects that by
using customer interaction clouds, the agents will be able to achieve better
solutions without incurring any extra cost on hardware, software or telephone
equipment. Service Cloud 2 is already catering to the customer service needs of
around 8000 companies. 

Salesforce seems to be going great guns with its cloud computing business. The
company is introducing all sorts of solutions by using its cloud computing
platform. Recently, Salesforce has set up a company named FinancialForce.com in
association with Unit 4 Agresso (UNI4), the parent company of financial software
specialist CODA, which sells accounting software. Both the companies will invest
in FinancialForce.com, which in turn will use CODA`s cloud accounting
application -- previously known as CODA 2go -- to deliver finance and accounting
solutions in the cloud. 

We believe, that by forming this joint venture with Cisco, Salesforce is on the
verge of creating another success story in the cloud computing space.
Competition is tough, but the company is combating well with other players like
Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) and Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) to
create its own place in the cloud computing world.

&lt;p&gt;All right, Microsoft, 'fess up: How many takes did you need for your video of Samsung Intrepid's TellMe feature, which sends text messages and searches the Web by voice, to go smoothly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because honestly, it's a pretty impressive feature. One that, given some of the things we've heard about Windows Mobile 6.5 in general, is particularly worthy of praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See, voice dialing has never really excited me. It's useful for those occasions when your hands are busy, but anyone comfortable with their phone can generally get to a number easily with buttons. Using voice to replace typing, however, can be more convenient in more scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how it works: The Sprint Intrepid has a dedicated button for the TellMe feature. Press it, and you can start a text message by saying "text" and the contact's name. Then, you can just dictate your message, and the phone will transcribe it. You are, of course, able to check it before sending the message. The search function is even easier, as you can just say what you're looking for, and in one step the phone initiates a Bing search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm aware that the Google Mobile app for Blackberry, Android, and the iPhone also lets you search the Web by voice (and it's fairly accurate, too), but the difference with the Intrepid is hardware. Even on the iPhone, you've still got to slide out of the phone's lock system or get out of whatever app you're using, find the Google Mobile app, and then lift the phone to your ear to start a voice search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By fusing TellMe's voice features to a dedicated button on the hardware, Microsoft and Samsung make texting and searching much easier. Indeed, I'd like to see other phone-makers (ahem, Apple) extend their phones' voice dialers to include these functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, did I just say other tech companies should copy Microsoft? I must be in the Bizarro world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/173268&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft has improved its offer to give users in Europe the chance to choose other Web browsers, EU antitrust regulators said on Wednesday and asked rivals to comment on the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amended offer could end the U.S. software giant's decade-long dispute with the European Commission over charges it infringed EU antitrust rules that has to date landed the company with a total 1.68 billion euros ($2.47 billion) in fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission's preliminary view is that Microsoft's commitments would indeed address our competition concerns," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The important thing is that the user would have a meaningful choice between Internet Explorer and its competitors," she said, adding she hope to issue a decision making the commitments legally binding before the end of the year when her mandate ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivals, computer makers and other interested parties will have until November 7 to comment on Microsoft's offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commitments, if accepted by the Commission, will be valid for five years in the 27-country EU, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;END OF MICROSOFT' EU WOES?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft welcomed the EU move.

 (Adds Opera comment, Microsoft shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Foo Yun Chee and Bate Felix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has improved
its offer to give users in Europe the chance to choose other Web

with a total 1.68 billion euros ($2.47 billion) in fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Commission's preliminary view is that Microsoft's
commitments would indeed address our competition concerns,"
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The important thing is that the user would have a
meaningful choice between Internet Explorer and its
competitors," she said, adding she hope to issue a decision
making the commitments legally binding before the end of the
year when her mandate ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rivals, computer makers and other interested parties will
have until Nov. 7 to comment on Microsoft's offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commitments, if accepted by the Commission, will be
valid for five years in the 27-country EU, Iceland, Norway and
Liechtenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; END OF MICROSOFT' EU WOES?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft welcomed the EU move. By early afternoon in New
York Microsoft shares were down 0.2 percent at $25.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For Microsoft, today's decision is a significant step

what browsers are, with 'tell me more' buttons detailing the
different options. The Commission can review the remedy after
two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU executive said it also welcomed Microsoft's
improvements in the field of interoperability which the firm
will publish on its website as a public undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This followed a probe last year by the Commission on a
complaint by industry body ECIS alleging that Microsoft had
refused to disclose information that would allow third parties
to design programmes compatible with its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ECIS, whose members include IBM (IBM.N), Nokia (NOK1V.HE),
Oracle Corp ORCL.O, Sun Microsystems JAVA.O and Opera, said
the settlement fails to tackle many issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ECIS notes that the settlement does not appear to deal with
the inadequacies of Microsoft's standards of compliance, unfair
pricing practices or other concerns related to patent abuse or
standards manipulation," it said in a statement.

&lt;p&gt;tString := StoryDateLine + " (" + @Text(StoryFiledDate) + ") - ";
@If(datelineinbody = "No"; tString; "")Microsoft appears to have reached an agreement with the European Commission that concludes an antitrust battle that has lasted a decade, Europe's top competition regulator said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A proposal the company offered in July to address charges of monopoly abuse were dismissed as insufficient by the Commission as well as by rivals in the software industry. But the latest iteration appears to have mollified the EC's regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this is an answer," said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes in a press conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is a trustful deal we are making. There can't be a misunderstanding because it is the final result of a long discussion between Steve Ballmer and me," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has occupied Kroes during her entire five-year tenure as Europe's top antitrust cop, a position she is scheduled to step down from in about a month. People close to the commissioner have said she is keen to conclude the case, but she has always stressed that she would not force a settlement if it was not the right one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new settlement offer addresses charges that Microsoft distorted competition in its favor in the market for web browsers, by giving its Internet Explorer (IE) browser an unfair advantage over rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also addresses accusations that Microsoft hides important interoperability information from rivals, preventing them from competing fairly against Microsoft Office, as well as other software products, the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the browser case the software giant has offered to create a new ballot screen inside its Windows operating system that lists a maximum of 12 browsers and gives them all exactly the same visibility and ease of use as IE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier offer was criticized for still granting IE a slight advantage over other browsers on the ballot screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft has made renewed assurances that it will provide rivals, including open source software vendors, ready access to the interoperability information they need in order to make products that work properly with Windows, the operating system running over 95 percent of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday the Commission will distribute the new offer from Microsoft to interested third parties in the case, including rival software manufacturers and consumer groups. They will have one month to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes said she is sure some of Microsoft's rivals will not be satisfied by the new offer. "A number of people are never 100 percent satisfied," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she would take serious criticism of the offer seriously but added that in her view Microsoft's offer would restore effective competition. "At the end of the day that's what we are looking for," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a press conference Wednesday morning, Microsoft counsel Brad Smith acknowledged that the proposed settlement helps the company as it looks to address other issues, such as gaining regulatory approval for its search deal with Yahoo. "Until now questions of competition law in relation to IT have all been about Microsoft but now that period is drawing to an end. We can now look ahead at the competition issues in search and paid search advertising," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also wants to turn his attention to Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems, to which Microsoft objects. "Today there's a different industry, a different agenda, and closure like this of the antitrust dispute lets us think about the broader issues," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One outstanding legal issue that Microsoft has with the Commission concerns the fines imposed on it for failing to abide by a 2004 antitrust ruling. Wednesday's rapprochement does not deal with that. Microsoft has appealed to the  Court of First Instance in Luxembourg and is awaiting a date for a hearing. Representatives declined to comment on the matter Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS), a trade group representing IBM, Oracle and other Microsoft rivals, gave a cautious welcome to the new settlement offer, which it can't examine until Friday but will look at closely during the month-long comment period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ECIS notes that the settlement does not appear to deal with the inadequacy of Microsoft's standards compliance, unfair pricing practices, or other concerns related to patent abuse or standards manipulation," ECIS Legal Counsel Thomas Vinje said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also questioned whether Microsoft's offer to resolve interoperability issues went far enough. "Microsoft's interoperability commitment takes the shape of a public undertaking relying on private enforcement. Our experience over the last decade has shown that scrutiny by public authorities is critical to ensure Microsoft's effective compliance and must accompany private enforcement mechanisms," Vinje said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECIS said it's vital that a settlement includes "vigorous enforcement mechanisms" such as regular monitoring to make sure that Microsoft lives up to its part of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Oct 7 (Reuters) - An improved offer by Microsoft
(MSFT.O) to settle the antitrust concerns of European Union
regulators needs to be tweaked to make it more effective,
Norwegian browser maker Opera (OPERA.OL) said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The proposal announced today will not effectively remedy

Opera's Chief Technology Officer Hakon Wium Lie said in a

&lt;p&gt; * GNPC will pass deal to energy ministry - source&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Financial and technical criteria to be studied&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACCRA, Oct 7 (Reuters) - State-run Ghana National Petroleum
Corp (GNPC) is studying an agreement by Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) to
buy Kosmos Energy's stake in the Jubilee oil field in Ghana
before passing it to the energy ministry for its blessing, a
Ghanaian government source said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "GNPC is required to look at the entire deal as negotiated,"
said the government source involved in the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The idea is to ensure that it is the best offer not only in
monetary terms but also it should come with the technical
expertise," the source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Jubilee field is one of the largest oil finds in West
Africa in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources close to the matter said on Tuesday Exxon had agreed
to buy a stake which analysts have previously valued at up to $5
billion. The sources did not say how much Exxon, which beat off
western and Asian rivals for the stake, would be paying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity-backed Kosmos put its interests in the field,
which it co-owns with UK-based oil explorer Tullow Oil (TLW.L)
and Houston-based Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N), on the market
earlier this year, industry sources previously said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kosmos has a 30.875 percent stake in the West Cape Three
Points block and an 18 percent interest in the Deepwater Tano
block offshore Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GNPC itself has a 10 percent stake in the West Cape Three
Points and Deepwater Tano concession areas, plus a 3.75 percent
additional stake in the Jubilee field straddling the two
concession areas, according to its website. Ghana suggested
earlier this year GNPC could be interested in the Kosmos stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the Ghanaian vetting process for the deal, the energy
ministry will pass it on to President John Atta Mills' cabinet
for approval, the government source said without giving a
timeframe for a decision.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft appears to have reached an agreement with the European Commission that concludes an antitrust battle that has lasted a decade, Europe's top competition regulator said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposal the company offered in July to address charges of monopoly abuse were dismissed as insufficient by the Commission as well as by rivals in the software industry. But the latest iteration appears to have mollified the EC's regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this is an answer," said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes in a press conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is a trustful deal we are making. There can't be a misunderstanding because it is the final result of a long discussion between Steve Ballmer and me," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new settlement offer addresses charges that Microsoft distorted competition in its favor in the market for web browsers, by giving its Internet Explorer (IE) browser an unfair advantage over rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also addresses accusations that Microsoft hides important interoperability information from rivals, preventing them from competing fairly against Microsoft Office, as well as other software products, the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the browser case the software giant has offered to create a new ballot screen inside its Windows operating system that lists a maximum of 12 browsers and gives them all exactly the same visibility and ease of use as IE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier offer was criticized for still granting IE a slight advantage over other browsers on the ballot screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft has made renewed assurances that it will provide rivals, including open source software vendors, ready access to the interoperability information they need in order to make products that work properly with Windows, the operating system running over 95 percent of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday the Commission will distribute the new offer from Microsoft to interested third parties in the case, including rival software manufacturers and consumer groups. They will have one month to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes said she is sure some of Microsoft's rivals will not be satisfied by the new offer. "A number of people are never 100 percent satisfied," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she would take serious criticism of the offer seriously but added that in her view Microsoft's offer would restore effective competition. "At the end of the day that's what we are looking for," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was holding a press conference Wednesday morning to offer its perspective on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
According to a new report from Visant Strategies, "PTP Microwave 2010: the World
Market for PTP Microwave Radio 2009 to 2015," the use of point-to-point
microwave in wireless networks for backhaul of higher capacity network
components will provide additional growth opportunities. 

"Despite a cyclical slowdown experienced by some vendors in the first part of
2009, the PTP microwave market will remain strong due to the continuing global
build-out of mobile wireless networks, including the continued upgrade in many
parts of the world to 3.5G and 4G," said Visant Strategies Senior Analyst Andy
Fuertes. "The PTP market continues to show great resistance to the global
economic slowdown and wireless backhaul is important in both emerging and
established markets since, in many cases, wireline backhaul is not available." 

Shipments of PTP microwave radios for wireless backhaul will more than double
from 2008 to 2015, accounting for an over $8 billion market for wireless
backhaul in 2015 with an overall PTP market of almost $11 billion the same year,
according to the report. PTP shipments for enterprise and private networks will
also almost double by 2015. 

"Software-defined radios and the use of application specific integrated circuits
have made PTP microwave radios lower in price and more capable," said Larry
Swasey of Visant Strategies. "We are also seeing utilization of higher capacity
radios that support TDM and I/P traffic natively and the use of higher frequency
radios as operators look for more available spectrum for backhaul use." 

The report details network deployment patterns and provides through 2015 global
mobile subs, 3.5G/4G subs and all base station and 3.5G/4G base station
deployments as well as collector point, BSC/RNC and MSC deployments. Also given
through 2015 are PTP shipments and revenues for mobile backhaul, trunking,
enterprise and private networks, broadcast and last mile use. Shipments by
capacity, operating frequency and transport mode are provided for the like
period. Regional trends and forecasts are detailed along with vendor strategy
and market share.

&lt;p&gt;Server Virtualization Certifications Provide Customers with Joint Support for
Today's Leading Virtualization and Operating System Platforms
RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Red Hat (NYSE: RHT), the world`s leading provider of open source solutions,
today announced that customers can now deploy fully supported virtualization
environments that combine Microsoft Windows Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
In response to customer demand for interoperability in their IT environments,
Red Hat and Microsoft have completed testing and validation for mutual customers
using server virtualization. Joint support from Red Hat and Microsoft for these
configurations is available today. 

In February 2009, Red Hat and Microsoft announced agreements to validate and
support the companies' corresponding virtualization and operating system
platforms. The agreements have enabled today's delivery of expanded
virtualization interoperability through the cross-certification of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and Microsoft Windows Server. 

Customers can now deploy tested and supported heterogeneous, virtualized Red Hat
and Microsoft solutions. The completed certifications include:

* Validation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4, using the Kernel Virtual Machine
(KVM) hypervisor, with Windows Server 2003, 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2
guests. 
* Certification of Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008,
Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V and Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 R2 host with
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 guests.

Additionally, Microsoft products certified on Windows Server and Red Hat
products certified on Red Hat Enterprise Linux are also supported in these
heterogeneous virtualized environments, providing customers with increased
deployment choice and flexibility. 

"IT administrators supporting heterogeneous infrastructures certainly understand
the pain of having to deal with multiple independent technical support
organizations. Often, environment failures are not owned by any one specific
support team despite established contracts and SLAs," said Steve Brasen,
Principle Analyst at Enterprise Management Associates. "With this announcement,
Red Hat and Microsoft are ensuring their customers can resolve any issues
related to Microsoft Windows on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux operating on Microsoft Hyper-V, regardless of whether the
problem is related to the operating system or the virtualization
implementation." 

"We are happy to offer our customers added choice and interoperability in
virtualization - the ability to deploy mixed virtualization environments with
Red Hat and Microsoft platforms -- with coordinated support by both companies,"
said Mike Evans, vice president, Corporate Development at Red Hat. "Red Hat
customers have the flexibility to run their applications in environments that
span from bare-metal servers, to virtualized servers, to public clouds - and
this additional support will broaden their deployment choices even further." 

"This work is a step forward for customers, partners and hosting providers who
want to offer their customers the main x86 virtualized operating systems to run
applications," said Mike Neil, general manager of Windows Server and Server
Virtualization at Microsoft Corp. "Customers now get improved virtualization
support between the two companies so they can confidently deploy new
applications and services."

&lt;p&gt;ACCRA Oct 7 (Reuters) - State-run Ghana National Petroleum
Corp (GNPC) is studying an agreement by Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) to
buy Kosmos Energy's stake in the Jubilee field in Ghana before
passing it to the energy ministry for its perusal, a Ghanaian
government source said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "GNPC is required to look a the entire deal as negotiated --
the idea is to ensure that it is the best offer not only in
monetary terms but also it should come with the technical
expertise," the government source involved in the energy sector
told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources close to the matter said on Tuesday Exxon had agreed
to buy a stake which analysts have previously valued at up to $5
billion. The sources did not say how much Exxon would be paying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity-backed Kosmos put its interests in the field,
which it co-owns with UK-based oil explorer Tullow Oil (TLW.L)
and Houston-based Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N), on the market
earlier this year, industry sources previously said.

&lt;p&gt;  CAMPBELL, CA, Oct 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Market research firm Infonetics Research released excerpts from its new
SDP Deployment Strategies and Vendor Ratings: Global Service Provider
Survey, conducted to determine worldwide operator thinking about service
delivery platform drivers, barriers, strategies, and vendors. The survey
is part of Infonetics' Next Gen OSS and Policy Continuous Research
Service (CRS).

    ANALYST NOTE

    "Our SDP survey confirms that getting services to market faster is the top
driver for operators deploying service delivery platforms. In a market
where Web-based competitors can create new services in a matter of
minutes, incumbent operators understand that they must overcome their
legacy constraints and improve the time it takes to deliver new services
to their subscribers," notes Shira Levine, directing analyst for next gen
OSS and policy for Infonetics Research.

    SDP SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS


-- 82% of service provider respondents say getting services to market
   faster is definitely a driver for deploying service delivery platforms
-- Messaging is a key application driving service providers to deploy SDPs,
   as more operators seek to integrate messaging services with social
   networking and other third-party applications
-- In an open-ended question about service delivery platform market
   leaders, most service providers named Oracle as the top SDP vendor,
   followed by IBM
   -- Other companies making the list include Accenture, Aepona,
      Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, HP and Nokia Siemens

    
Service providers participating in Infonetics' SDP survey rated five
SDP vendors (Accenture, Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, IBM, Oracle) on 8
criteria: technology, product roadmap, security, management,
price-to-performance ratio, pricing, financial stability, and service and
support.

    The service providers participating in the survey include four of the
industry's largest Tier 1 operators, as well as smaller incumbents, cable
operators, MSOs, and wireless carriers that together represent 22% of the
world's telecom capex and 25% of the world's carrier revenue, as reported
in Infonetics' Service Provider Capex, Opex, ARPU, and Subscribers
service.

    Survey respondents are purchase decision-makers at service providers that
have already deployed an SDP (82%) or will by 2010 (18%). The bulk of
respondents are in North America (45%) and Western Europe (46%), where
most of the early SDP adopters are located; the remainder are based in
Asia Pacific (9%).

&lt;p&gt;GE`s Jenbacher CHP Units to Support European Union Energy Efficiency Goals, Help
Eliminate up to 40 Percent of a Plant`s Annual CO2 Emissions
PLOIESTI, Romania--(Business Wire)--
In line with a major initiative by the European Union (EU) to reduce emissions,
GE Energy, the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. and the energy
development company ContourGlobal today celebrated the opening of a new
cogeneration plant at Coca-Cola Hellenic`s Ploiesti bottling facility near
Bucharest. 

The Romania natural gas-fueled cogeneration plant represents the first of a
planned group of 15 combined heat and power (CHP) plants that will be installed
at Coca-Cola Hellenic`s facilities in 12 European countries. 

Cogeneration is inherently more energy efficient than using separate power and
heat generating sources, making it an effective anti-pollution strategy. As a
result, the EU in recent years has begun urging member states to modernize their
industrial and municipal cogeneration systems to improve energy efficiency and
curtail regional emissions. 

"For such a large energy initiative, we needed to find a reliable power
generation equipment supplier that could support our project on behalf of Coca
Cola Hellenic under a very tight delivery schedule," said ContourGlobal
President and Chief Executive Officer Joseph C. Brandt. 

Each of the bottling plants utilizing GE Energy`s Jenbacher CHP engines will be
able to eliminate up to 40 percent of their annual carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions, which demonstrates the ongoing commitment to reduce the carbon
footprint of the bottling operations in support of EU goals while also reducing
the operational costs by generating their own onsite power. 

Under the first phase of the Coca-Cola Hellenic CHP initiative, GE Energy is
supplying ContourGlobal, the project developer, with 19 Jenbacher gas
engines-representing a total output of 58 megawatts (MWel). The first two of
GE`s Jenbacher cogeneration modules were installed at Coca-Cola Hellenic`s
Romania bottling facility while the other units will be installed at Coca-Cola
facilities in six other European countries: Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Greece,
United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and Italy. 

The new CHP plants will supply a highly efficient, reliable onsite supply of
electricity, as well as hot and chilled water, to Coca-Cola Hellenic`s bottling
facilities. 

"With the European Union emphasizing the role of energy efficiency in its
efforts to reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions, we are very excited to
showcase how our Jenbacher technology can help energy developers and industrial
operators like ContourGlobal and Coca-Cola Hellenic meet with their energy and
environmental goals," said Prady Iyyanki, CEO of GE Energy`s Jenbacher gas
engine business. 

Subsequent project phases call for additional CHP plants to be installed at
bottling facilities in Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Serbia as well as
in the African nation of Nigeria. 

The new Romania cogeneration plant is powered by two of GE`s three-MW J620
Jenbacher gas engines, providing the factory with a reliable source of onsite
power while helping support the EU`s emissions reduction goals. 

The initiative supports the European Commission's goal to adopt more stringent
environmental targets for member states to help Europe achieve a 20 percent
reduction in emissions by 2020. 

GE Energy's Jenbacher gas engines will be delivered throughout 2009 and 2010,
with commissioning scheduled as the plants are ready. The equipment is being
built at GE's gas engine manufacturing center in Jenbach, Austria.

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission plans to seek feedback from the software industry and consumers on a new offer from Microsoft to address charges that it is competing unfairly in the market for web browsers, the regulator said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;European competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said Microsoft's latest settlement offer in its long-running antitrust case in Europe "is an answer" to the  charges it faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is a sign of detente in Microsoft's antitrust battle with Europe's top regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We welcome today&#8217;s announcement by the European Commission to move forward with formal market testing of Microsoft&#8217;s proposal relating to web browser choice in Europe," its top counsel in the affair, Brad Smith, said in a written statement. "We also welcome the opportunity to take the next step in the process regarding our proposal to promote interoperability with a broad range of our products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Microsoft offered to provide a choice of Web browsers with its upcoming Windows 7 operating system. The proposal included a "ballot screen" on which Windows 7 users could select a competing Web browser as their default choice and disable Microsoft's Internet Explorer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Smith's statement, Microsoft has been engaged in extensive discussions with the Commission over the last month, "during which we agreed to make numerous changes to improve these proposals.  For Microsoft, today&#8217;s decision is a significant step toward closing a decade-long chapter of competition law concerns in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2004 the EU fined the company &#8364;497 million ($794 million) and ordered it to sell a version of Windows in Europe that did not include Microsoft's Windows Media Player software, to restore competition in that market.&lt;/p&gt;

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical will showcase its ongoing commitment and technology
leadership to the global rubber industry at The Rubber Expo in Pittsburgh, PA
from October 13-15, 2009. The company offers the rubber industry a broad
portfolio of polymer solutions, including specialty elastomers, polymer
modifiers (PM) and butyl polymers. At the conference, ExxonMobil Chemical will
make a number of presentations that demonstrate its technology expertise across
this product portfolio. 

Three presentations will highlight ExxonMobil Chemical's 40 years of expertise
in EP(D)M2 technology. Topics covered in the presentations include:

* Metallocene EPDM polymers with enhanced low temperature performance 
* Comparisons of conventional and metallocene EP(D)M elastomers, and their
binary blends, designed for low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) cable
insulation 
* An overview of polymerization processes for the manufacture of conventional
and metallocene EPDM polymers.

One of the largest producers of metallocene and conventional EP(D)M elastomers
in the world, ExxonMobil Chemical is expanding its performance capabilities with
the introduction of new EPDM grades. These will be targeted at a variety of low
temperature, molded and extruded applications, including weatherseals and hose. 

To effectively supply increasing demand for Vistalon EPDM and support the
expansion of its product portfolio, ExxonMobil Chemical is adding capacity in
Singapore, which includes a 300,000 tons per year elastomers unit. Start-up is
expected in 2011. 

ExxonMobil Chemical also will feature its wide range of Elevast polymer
modifiers (PM) at The Rubber Expo (booth number 1639). Elevast PM are specialty
hydrocarbon fluids that improve mechanical properties across an extended range
of service temperatures for applications ranging from wire and cable to
automotive and industrial belts, weatherstrip, hoses and mechanical goods such
as seals, gaskets and wiper blades. 

The EPDM presentations will take place in the David L. Lawrence Convention
Center, as follows: 

Tuesday, October 13, 2009: 9:00am

"Amorphous Metallocene EPDM for Superior Low Temperature Properties" reviews the
recent advances in metallocene solution polymerization and will compare the
physical properties of amorphous EPDM prepared by metallocene technology and
conventional Ziegler Natta methods. Results indicate that polymers with uniform
compositional distribution and low ethylene content prepared by metallocene
catalysts offer a balance of mechanical properties and low temperature elastic
properties. 

Wednesday, October 14, 2009: 8:30am

"Insulation Compounds Made From Vistalon EP(D)M Polymers" compares conventional
EP(D)M elastomers, metallocene EP(D)M elastomers and their binary blends in
filled compounds designed for low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) cable
insulation. Key performance attributes such as cure characteristics, physical
properties, heat-aged physical properties and wet electrical properties are
discussed. 

Wednesday, October 14, 2009: 3:45pm

"EPDM - Past, Present and Future" provides a comparison of the processes used to
make EPDM with Ziegler-Natta catalysts and metallocene catalysts. The range of
products produced between these two platforms will be discussed, highlighting
the influence of process chosen on energy efficiency versus the breadth of
product characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) - Wealthy clients believe the worst of the crisis is probably over and have started to come back to higher-risk assets such as hedge funds, a top banker at JP Morgan Private Bank (JPM.N) said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felipe Godard, Head of European International Markets at JP Morgan Private Bank, also told the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit in Geneva he was on the lookout for buys in his region and expected double-digit revenue growth in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen a return of risk appetite. Clients are comfortable with the risks of hedge funds if those risks are explained," said Godard, whose bank is the world's second-largest hedge fund manager by assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did see a pull back at the beginning of the year/end of lat year. Flows are coming back now. Flows this year for hedge funds are positive, in our experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan Private Bank, the world's number six wealth manager with about $600 billion in managed assets, had typically allocated about 20 percent of a client's portfolio to alternative investments before the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Toward the third and fourth month of this year hedge funds started to offer the returns they were supposed to offer," Godard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUITABLE PARTNER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Godard also said JP Morgan, which caters for the super rich with $25 million and above, was hoping to find a suitable target in the consolidation wave that is shaking up the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenge for us in EMEA or Switzerland is to find a partner suitable for the segment of the market we are going after," Godard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have analyzed different banks, but we haven't found what we're looking for. We are looking for opportunities in EMEA," he said, adding the bank sought a target that catered for the ultra rich and that had a good pan-European presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julius Baer BAER1.VX said on earlier on Wednesday it had agreed to buy the Swiss private banking assets of Dutch bank ING (ING.AS) for 520 million Swiss francs ($507 million), the European wealth management industry's biggest deal since the crisis began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Godard, who sees the wealth management segment booming on the back of the expected wealth creation in large emerging markets such as Brazil, China and India, said he was confident his region could boost its future revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am expecting our area to grow 15-20 percent per year over the next five years. I think it is achievable," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: blogs.reuters.com/summits/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Jucca, Editing by Hans Peters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUNICH (Reuters) - Microsoft's release of its new Windows 7 operating system is expected to increase demand for personal computers only slightly, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told journalists in Munich on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There will be a surge of PCs but it will probably not be huge," Ballmer said in answer to a question at a news conference about the likely effect on the market of the new system, which will replace the unpopular Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major new software updates from Microsoft, whose Windows operating system runs about 90 percent of the world's PCs, are in general eagerly awaited by computer makers who hope for a sales boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in a survey of more than 1,000 companies released by ScriptLogic in July, six in 10 companies said they planned to skip the purchase of Windows 7, partly due to spending cuts and partly over concern about compatibility with existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer reiterated he saw the technology sector returning to growth only slowly, and said it would take time to reach pre-recession levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 will be generally available on October 22, far earlier than originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jens Hack; editing by Simon Jessop)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KUKA Robotics Corporation announces the introduction of the RoboSim 4-D
Simulator to the North American Entertainment Marketplace at INNOVENTIONS.
CLINTON TOWNSHIP, Mich.--(Business Wire)--
KUKA Robotics Corporation is pleased to announce the usage of the RoboSim 4-D
Simulator ride system as part of a new exhibit at INNOVENTIONS in Epcot&#174; at the
Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The addition of the
RoboSim 4-D Simulator is an expansion of KUKA`s current presence at INNOVENTIONS
at Epcot&#174;. KUKA currently sponsors Rockin` Robots - a 2,000 plus square foot
interactive exhibit allowing guests to conduct a robotic band located in the
INNOVENTIONS West building. "The popularity and expansion of INNOVENTIONS
coupled with KUKA`s unique and innovative robotic and educational solutions in
this exciting entertainment and education project will enhance the KUKA brand
presence while strengthening our continued growth in the North American market."
stated Stu Shepherd, President of KUKA Robotics Corporation. "We are excited for
the opportunity to demonstrate KUKA`s unique capabilities in a market that
drives progress and interest in learning." 

The KUKA RoboSim 4-D Simulator creates a 4-dimensional experience through 3-D
robotic motion and "wind", by controlling air movements to stimulate the senses
providing a more realistic simulation experience involving high speeds, quick
direction changes and different climates for a unique sensation. The appeal of
the 2-seat simulator is that it does not fully enclose the rider, but allows the
rider`s legs and feet to be suspended. The spherical carbon-fiber hood, which is
integrated as part of the unique KUKA RoboCoaster&#174; ride system, immerses the
rider into a true sensory experience by using high definition video combined
with stereo sound and controlled air motion. "The KUKA RoboCoaster&#174; programmable
robotic ride system utilizes 6 axes and 6 degrees of total directional freedom

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
According to catastrophe risk modeling firm AIR Worldwide Corporation (AIR),
shortly after 2:00 am local time on Thursday, Super Typhoon Melor made landfall
in central Japan`s Aichi prefecture (population 7 million). It arrived as a weak
Category 1 storm with sustained winds of about 119 kilometers per hour (74 mph),
according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Using the available
meteorological parameters for Super Typhoon Melor, AIR estimates insured losses
to onshore properties in Japan to range from JPY 75 billion (850 million USD) to
JPY 130 billion (1.5 billion USD). AIR`s loss estimates for Japan reflect
insured damage to property (residential, commercial, industrial) and contents. 

Melor`s winds and heavy rain-up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) in some
regions-flooded roads, cut off electricity to hundreds of thousands of people,
and blew off roof tiles. Even before Melor made landfall, heavy frontal
precipitation (50 mm/hr) developed as the storm was undergoing extratropical
transitioning. This frontal precipitation spawned several tornadoes in Ibaraki
prefecture, north of Tokyo. The storm has weakened considerably since landfall. 

"In the regions most affected by Typhoon Melor, wood frame homes dominate
residential construction," said Dr. Peter Sousounis, principal scientist at AIR
Worldwide. "Many have heavy, clay tile roofs, meant to prevent damage from wind.
At Melor`s wind speeds, these homes are expected to have minor roof damage and
little or no structural damage. Larger multi-family apartment buildings, as well
as commercial and industrial structures, are generally engineered and made of
reinforced concrete or steel, making them less vulnerable to winds of Melor`s
intensity. At Melor`s wind speeds, these structures would be expected to
experience minor damage to roofs and siding, with minor to moderate damage to
decorative elements and signage." 

Officials report that the storm did not result in the damage they had feared.
Dr. Sousounis continued, "Three days prior, Melor had been a much stronger
Category 5 storm. However, its interaction with cooler waters and strong wind
shear weakened it considerably before landfall early Thursday. Melor was
downgraded to a tropical storm Thursday night before exiting off the
northeastern coast of Honshu."

&lt;p&gt;With Google and Microsoft both looking to ink a deal with Twitter for its real-time data, the microblogging company could have finally found a way to turn tweets into dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the titans of tech may have found a way to boost their real-time search efforts in the midst of their raging search war .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intense rivals are in separate talks with the new online darling Twitter to set up their own data-mining deals , says a report from The Wall Street Journal 's AllThingsD Web site. The "advanced talks" are said to be over licensing deals that would allow them to integrate real-time Twitter feeds with their search engines, Google's search and Microsoft's Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the three companies would respond to requests for information about the reported negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AllThingsD reported today that the individual deals could mean upfront payments worth several million dollars, or involve revenue-sharing plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, this could be a way for Twitter to make some money , and maybe more than just a little money," said Dan Olds, an analyst with The Gabriel Consulting Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It finally means a business model for Twitter, or at least the beginnings of one. And, of course, it means real revenue, which is very important. Not just in licensing revenue from Google or Microsoft, but also in potentially getting a piece of the action on an ongoing basis. So there could be considerable upside here for Twitter," Olds said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry watchers have been waiting not so patiently for Twitter to come up with a business plan and actually start making some real money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter co-founder Biz Stone has said for months that the company has wanted to focus on building features into the site before worrying about the business end of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If either, or both, of these deals go ahead, they would solve some big income issues for Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The data is valuable," said Ezra Gottheil, an analyst at Technology Business Research Inc. "It allows the search engines to front-end Twitter. And it also clues them in to what people on the Web are talking about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What people are now twittering about is what people are now interested in...," Gottheil said. "So the engines could include tweets as indexed content, either through an option, a separate search page, or a search window."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gottheil said he doubts that either Google or Microsoft would allow the other to have the only license with Twitter. If one deal goes through, the other would most likely follow, he said. In the ongoing battle for supremacy , neither company would want the other to gain a real-time search advantage .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Microsoft and Google, it's more ammunition they can use to beat the hell out of each other," said Olds. "It's probably more important for Microsoft to secure a deal than Google, but I would expect that there will be deals with both of them..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hype around Twitter currently has it being considered to be one of the very best ways to gauge what people are talking about and what they're interested in. This is a direct benefit from Twitter becoming so large. It's the value of a huge user-footprint," Olds said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To read the headlines in the business and technical press during the last several years, you'd think that the once world-beating IBM had fallen off the face of the earth. Google, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft -- those seem to be the names that garner all the publicity. IBM comes off at best as an afterthought, and at worst as a company slipping into dotage, about to fade into oblivion along with other brands that were once well known, such as PanAm airlines and Woolworth's department stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised, then, to learn that IBM is flying high these days, a success as much driven by its forward-thinking services and software businesses as by its ability at the same time to milk its old cash cow, the mainframe line. Even as the rest of the economy tanked, IBM's second-quarter net income in 2009 was $3.1 billion, up 12% from a year earlier . And it's as well positioned as any technology company for reaping benefits from big changes in technology in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's recent launch of LotusLive iNotes, a cloud-based e-mail, calendaring and contact management system , shows why IBM still matters. IBM recognizes that for businesses of all sizes, cloud computing is the future, and it plans to be there in a very big way. LotusLive iNotes aims at taking away business from Microsoft's Exchange as well as users of Google Apps Premier Edition. In years past, IBM would have sold the hardware that runs a system like LotusLive iNotes, rather than selling it as a service. But the company realized a decade ago that its future was in software and services rather than hardware, and it began selling off much of its lower-margin hardware businesses, while retaining mainframes. Those moves have paid off handsomely and could be even more profitable if companies do indeed opt for a cloud-based future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM s success has clearly gotten under the skin of its competitors, notably Microsoft, whose CEO, Steve Ballmer, went so far as to criticize IBM's move away from hardware. He told The New York Times that "I.B.M.'s footprint is more narrow today than it was when I started. I am not sure that has been to the long-term benefit of their shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I point out in my blog posts, "Ballmer: IBM should ignore profits, get back into the hardware business" and "Here's why Ballmer has been badmouthing IBM," that's wishful thinking on Ballmer's part, because he's worried about the IBM's competition in cloud-based computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is also well positioned to take advantage of another long-term trend in IT -- greening IT infrastructures. The pressure to go green will only grow in the coming years, with the potential for regulations governing carbon emissions. A year ago, IBM launched its green consulting practice, and it didn't stop with green IT. The practice also focuses on using technology to green the rest of an enterprise as well, including how to make a product's entire life cycle more green. It also has a "Green Sigma" consulting service that applies the Lean Six Sigma method of improving efficiencies to corporate energy and water use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time that it's looking ahead, the company also reaps benefits from older big-iron hardware. For example, when Bernie Madoff powered the computing infrastructure of his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, he turned to a trusty IBM AS/400 to cook the books . OK, scratch that example -- we can only hope that Ponzi schemes aren't a growth business. But IBM mainframes power countless Fortune 500 companies, and are also in widespread use in education and government as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So IBM seems to have the best of both worlds, getting old-time profits from old-time technology, while riding the wave of cloud and green computing. It doesn't sound like a bad business to me. I'll take profits over publicity every time -- and I think IBM will as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston Gralla is a contributing editor for Computerworld.com and the author of more than 35 books, including How the Internet Works (Que, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced today that it will abandon its decades-old Works entry-level suite, and will instead offer a stripped-down, advertising-supported version of Office 2010 on new PCs next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubbed Office Starter 2010, the new edition will include only Word 2010 and Excel 2010, dropping PowerPoint 2010 and OneNote 2010 -- the other applications that will be bundled with the lowest-priced package, Home  Student -- as well as Outlook 2010, which is part of the next-level-up Home  Business edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Starter 2010 will not be a trial edition that times out, said a Microsoft manager today. "Office Starter is different than a trial, in the sense that there's no expiration," said Scott Kahler, the test manager for the new suite, in a video posted on a company blog. "You can continue using it until your needs exceed what Starter can give you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, Microsoft hopes that users will pay for a more substantial version. "We insure that when you've upgraded, all your documents come across," added Brian Albrecht, Office's group program manager, in the same video clip. "There's no conversion or anything that needs to happen, and everything's there for you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Takeshi Numoto, the corporate vice president for Office, users who want to upgrade to the Home  Student, Home  Business or Professional editions from Starter will be able to do so within Microsoft's software by purchasing a product activation key online or on a card that will be available at major electronics retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the bits for those three editions will be installed on new PCs that offer Officer Starter; a purchased key will simply "unlock" the appropriate version, so that no additional software need be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starter 2010's two applications will be "reduced-functionality" editions, said Numoto. But with one exception, he declined to get specific about what would be included in Word Starter 2010 and Excel Starter 2010, or what features within the for-money versions would be omitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They'll suit the basic productivity needs for consumers," he argued, adding that their functionality would be on par with Microsoft Works, which has been criticized for not offering full file compatibility with Office itself. "Word Starter 2010 users won't be able to create SmartArt, for example," said Numoto, citing the single example of a missing feature in the free version. "But they'll be able to edit [other content] in documents that include SmartArt, then return them to the original user without losing any formatting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Starter will include on-screen advertisements, acknowledged Numoto, making it the first edition of Microsoft's long-standing desktop suite to do so. "There will be a tile in the lower-right-hand side of the window," he said, where an ad will be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also use a new technology, called Click-To-Run, to deliver Office 2010 trial editions to owners of older PCs. The technology, which the company debuted in the Technical Preview of Office 2010 that went out to an invitation-only group of testers in July, "streams" pieces of the suite to users who begin a download, letting them start using the suite within minutes. While users work with the trial, the remainder of the code is downloaded in the background by Click-To-Run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's almost like you're 'playing' the application," Numoto said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numoto declined to say whether users upgrading from Office Starter will pay a lower price than the list price of retail boxed copies. "We're not getting into price points at this time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has launched invite-only previews of the desktop version of Office 2010 , as well as the online edition, pegged as Office Web Apps . The latter, which include lightweight versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint, will be made available to millions free of charge in the first half of next year, the suite's current ship window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a way for us to reach a lot of customers that we haven't reached before," Numoto said, explaining Microsoft's strategy behind Office Starter, Click-To-Run and the new card-based licenses to be sold at retail. "This will get people a taste for Office, people who may not have been exposed to Office before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

TOPIC:

A recent study conducted by IBM found that Business Intelligence (BI) and
analytics were top priorities amongst Chief Information Officers (CIOs). The
survey of more than 2,500 CIOs found that 83% cited the ability to see patterns
in vast amounts of data and extract actionable insights as the way to make their
organizations more competitive. 

According to the CIO of IBM, Pat Toole, CIOs are investing in BI and analytics
to help them make decisions - at all levels. "In addition, in this challenging
economy, CIOs understand that analytics can be key to new growth markets,
whether it's new ways to manage a utility grid or smarter health care systems,"
said Toole. "Managing and leveraging new intelligence through analytics is
something that today's CIO is pursuing to gain competitive advantage in these
new markets."

&lt;p&gt;  MIAMI, FL and CORAL GABLES, FL, Oct 08 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
NearshoreJournal.com blog today issued an analysis of IBM's Gmail
alternative -- LotusLive iNotes (www.lotuslive.com).

    Zagada's posting of this latest high-level, in-depth podcast interview
with Sean Poulley, vice president of IBM Cloud Collaboration Services is
the 4th in its Cloud Sourcing series.

    The interview comes on the heels of IBM's recently announced enterprise
collaboration service based on its LotusLive iNotes cloud-based service
platform.

    Produced by Moodstudio, the podcast interview is conducted by Philip
Peters, Zagada's CEO, and is now available at the company's
NearshoreJournal.com blog.

    Having previously been a part of CrossWorlds -- a US$100 million company
-- which IBM acquired -- Sean's tenure at IBM is approaching 15 years and
embraces a portfolio of senior roles with the US$100 billion
service-leader firm.

    Sean shares with Philip some of the key insights and management thinking
about IBM's strategic understating and deployment of its Cloud solution.
Important highlights include:


--  Cloud computing represents a fundamental platform shift

--  Cloud computing should be seen as a disruptive opportunity

--  The Cloud represents a new consumption and delivery model

--  The Cloud mandates security reliability and Service Level Agreement
    (SLA) fidelity from serious providers, and,

--  The Cloud offers a new cost reduction business value and should be
    executives' focus.
    

    
Listeners will find the podcast relaxed but engaging as Sean shares
his breath of experience by consistently dove tailing his responses to
Philip's question on the Cloud's business value and IBM's focus on

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said higher oil prices would lead to significantly better profits from exploration and production in the third quarter than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company said on Thursday its downstream results, on the other hand, would be flat, with depressed refining margins holding broadly steady overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's U.S. oil-equivalent production in July and August rose 6 percent to 741,000 barrels per day from 700,000 a quarter before, while international output fell 24,000 bpd to 1.946 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total of nearly 2.69 million bpd is ahead of Chevron's increased 2009 output forecast of 2.66 million bpd in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half the international output decline was due to civil unrest in Nigeria, while the U.S. growth was driven by the startup of its Tahiti platform in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmark U.S. crude oil futures prices averaged $68 per barrel in the quarter, up from nearly $60 in the second quarter, but down from $118 in the same quarter a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron anticipated "unfavorable" foreign currency effects in its results, as the dollar fell by 4 percent versus a basket of currencies .DXY over the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company said upstream results would benefit from $400 million connected with project approval and sales of interests in its $37 billion Gorgon gas project in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron reports third-quarter results on October 30. Prior to Thursday's update, analysts had expected a profit of $2.7 billion, or $1.39 per share, on revenue of $46.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's up from 87 cents per share last quarter, but a far cry from the $79 billion in revenue and $3.85 per share earned by the San Ramon, California-based company in the third quarter last year, when oil futures prices hit record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOWN BY THE BAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's U.S. refinery crude-input fell 55,000 bpd, or 6 percent, mainly due to maintenance at its San Francisco Bay refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter refining margins rose on the U.S. West Coast by nearly a dollar a barrel, but fell on the Gulf Coast by about the same amount. They are squeezed across the industry as rising prices for the input, oil, are not matched by growth in demand for what refiners produce, due to economic weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival ConocoPhillips (COP.N) warned last Friday that its results would take a hit from low North American natural gas prices, though that was expected and its plans for a higher dividend and asset sales lifted its shares in the past two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares rose 0.8 percent to as high as $72 in after-hours trading Thursday, after closing 1.3 percent higher at $71.45, on a day when Conoco jumped 3.4 percent and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) rose 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's stock is down 3 percent in 2009, compared with a 14 percent rise for the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil companies .OIX, with energy production-focused rivals faring better than those in the slumping refinery business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to provide business agility, IBM is rolling out on Thursday a slew of products in the version 7 upgrade to its WebSphere middleware portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Available later this year, the products run the gamut from the BPM space to an enterprise service bus and a hardware-based messaging appliance. The rollout focuses on what the company calls the SOA, BPM, and business strategy layers for IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Also this week, Tibco upgraded its BPM platform, offering business intelligence capabilities. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we've done is we have invested [in] and are releasing concurrently the version 7 of our portfolio that is aligned to bring about the value of business agility," through the three layers, said Craig Hayman, general manager of WebSphere at IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM with its WebSphere release is incorporating agile development practices, said Brad Shimmin, principal analyst for application infrastructure at Current Analysis. "They're able to better release features the users want in a more timely manner," Shimmin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WebSphere BPM suite is being fitted with a native container as part of the platform's SCA (Service Component Architecture) capabilities. With this container, users can take the definition of a business process and turn it into an executing system in one click, Hayman said. SCA, Shimmin said, enables IBM to make its software more modular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also featured is "in-flight" change management for business processes. "You'll be able to modify that business process as it is executing," said Hayman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated governance and policy management is featured in the BPM suite to better bridge the conversation between business and IT leaders, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also has improved its cloud-based BPM BlueWorks environment for understanding business management. "We have enhanced the prebuilt industry content," adding capability and process maps across a variety of industries, said Hayman. &#160;BlueWorks allows for testing new and existing processes by modeling them in a cloud environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The version 7 WebSphere rollout, which functions with the WebSphere 7 application server introduced last year, also includes IBM WebSphere Ilog JRules 7.0, for managing business rules. Capabilities are featured for automating decisions in mainframe applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM acquired Ilog last year. "We have now integrated Ilog with our version 7 release," Hayman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebSphere Process Server v7, which is the engine inside IBM's BPM stack, is being introduced to provide standards-based process solutions with capabilities for administering human workflow processes. Providing for integrated governance and policy management is WebSphere Registry and Repository and Advanced Lifecycle Edition v7. It boosts business/IT awareness with interface and analysis tools and offers a view of services with federated impact analysis and change management, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another part of the rollout, WebSphere Business Events and Extreme Scale v7, enables responses to high-volume, real-time events, including events from industry applications. WebSphere Message Broker v7 and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus v7 provide business information across SOA domains with a service federation management capability and standards support. The two technologies also enable improved dynamic business interactions by exploiting integration with WebSphere technologies such as WebSphere MQ and the application server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM with its ESB is providing its own set of cueing and error-handling routines for transactions, saving developers themselves from having to develop these, Shimmin said. "With this version of the ESB, the ESB itself does that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hardware appliance, DataPower XB60, connects with trading partners through improved business-to-business messaging protocol support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other products in the rollout include:&lt;/p&gt;

WebSphere Industry Content Packs, which are templates for deploying industry assets across more processes .
WebSphere Transformation Extender, for transforming data between different endpoints. Prebuilt transformations are featured for health care standards such as HIPAA. &lt;p&gt;This story, "IBM boosts business agility in WebSphere middleware upgrade," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;In Light of Today`s FDA Advisory Committee Approval-and Likely Market Expansion
for Selzentry-AHF Urges Drug Giant to Lower Price Immediately

Current Selzentry Cost: Average Wholesale Price of $13,767 per-patient per-year
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Responding to today`s news that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Antiviral
Advisory Committee has approved Pfizer Inc.'s AIDS therapy, Selzentry
(maraviroc), for use in therapy-na&#239;ve patients, AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF)
strongly criticized Pfizer for its current pricing of the drug at an Average
Wholesale Price (AWP) of $13,767 per-patient per-year-which, if this price
remains when use is expanded, would make it the most expensive first-line AIDS
drug on the market. 

Selzentry was originally approved by the FDA in August 2007 as a salvage
drug-utilized in patients who do not respond favorably, or have developed
resistance, to other AIDS drugs-and priced at $12,528 per-patient per-year. In
just two years, the price for Selzentry-which must be taken with at least two
other AIDS drugs-has increased by nearly 10%. Pfizer reported $46 million in
sales for Selzentry in 2008, according to the Associated Press.

"In this time of growing national concern over ballooning healthcare costs, it
is simply criminal for Pfizer to continue to price Selzentry at the salvage
therapy rate, especially now that the market for the drug will be vastly
expanded by the FDA`s likely upcoming approval of the drug for first-line use,"
said Michael Weinstein, President of AIDS Healthcare Foundation. "Government
programs such as AIDS Drug Assistance Programs and Medicaid are likely to be the
largest purchaser of Selzentry. Where exactly does the burden of Pfizer`s
price-gouging fall? On the taxpayers. And for what reason? So that the largest
pharmaceutical company in the world, Pfizer, can make just a little more
profit-while bankrupting government programs already hurting for funds as they
work to ensure that Americans living with HIV/AIDS receive the lifesaving
treatment they need." 

"While any new HIV/AIDS drug on the market is welcome, we urge Pfizer to use
restraint and to lower the price of Selzentry immediately upon FDA approval for
this expanded use," said Michael Weinstein, President of AIDS Healthcare
Foundation. 

An estimated 1.2 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV/AIDS. As a
result of antiretroviral treatment, many more people are living longer with
HIV/AIDS, and a greater burden has been put on the health care system, including
several of the federally funded, state-run AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP)
nationwide. State ADAPs are funded by the federal Ryan White CARE Act and are
the primary source of HIV/AIDS medications for uninsured and underinsured
Americans. Funding for AIDS care has been largely flat-funded or saw only minor
funding in recent years-increases which are not proportional to the need, nor
able to support inflated pharmaceutical prices. 

AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) is the US` largest non-profit HIV/AIDS
healthcare provider. AHF currently provides medical care and/or services to more
than 100,000 individuals in 21 countries worldwide in the US, Africa, Latin
America/Caribbean and the Asia Pacific Region. www.aidshealth.org

Here are highlights from Wednesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

BofA Vows Not to Hike Card Rate

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) said on Tuesday that it will not raise
rates or change terms on consumer credit card accounts before the new law (CARD
Act) intended to reform industry practices takes effect early next year. 

To manage costs in light of the sweeping new reforms to the credit card
industry, in August 2009, BofA along with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company (NYSE: JPM)
switched most fixed-rate cards to variable rates. Discover Financial Services
(NYSE: DFS) moved some of its cardholders from fixed to variable rates in June. 

Since most of the cards of Bank of America carry a variable rate, customers
could still see rising interest rates as the interest is tied to the rise and
fall of the prime rate. 

BofA also said that it will continue to re-price customers who are late on two
or more payments in a one-year period. 

The CARD Act will restrict credit card issuers to raise fees and interest. As a
result, many companies have started increasing charges and rates in the recent
months. However, Bank of America said that it will not implement any change in
terms of consumer credit card accounts between now and the effective date of the
Act. Last month, U.S. Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Barney Frank
introduced a legislation that could speed up the implementation of new credit
card rules to December 2009. 

The new CARD Act will negatively impact major credit card issuers including
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company, Citigroup (NYSE: C) and Capital One Financial Corp.
(NYSE: COF).

&lt;p&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20091008005931/en

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported in its interim update that
earnings for the third quarter 2009 are expected to be higher than in the second
quarter 2009. Upstream earnings are projected to increase significantly,
reflecting higher prices for crude oil, as well as approximately $400 million of
gains related to asset sales and tax items. Downstream results are expected to
be relatively flat. Unfavorable foreign currency effects are anticipated in the
upstream and downstream business segments though the U.S. dollar weakened less
in the third quarter against most major currencies than in the second quarter. 

Basis for Comparison in Interim Update

The interim update contains certain industry and company operating data for the
third quarter 2009. The production volumes, realizations, margins and certain
other items in the report are based on a portion of the quarter and are not
necessarily indicative of Chevron's quarterly results to be reported on October
30, 2009. The reader should not place undue reliance on this data. 

Unless noted otherwise, all commentary is based on two months of the third
quarter 2009 versus full second quarter 2009 results. 

UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

The table that follows includes information on production and price indicators
for crude oil and natural gas for specific markets. Actual realizations may vary
from indicative pricing due to quality and location differentials and the effect
of pricing lags. International earnings are driven by actual liftings, which may
differ from production due to the timing of cargoes and other factors.

Compared with the average for the second quarter 2009, net U.S. oil-equivalent
production during the first two months of the third quarter increased 41,000
barrels per day mainly due to the ramp-up of production at Tahiti in the Gulf of
Mexico. 

International net oil-equivalent production decreased 24,000 barrels per day
compared with the second quarter. The liquids component of oil-equivalent
production decreased 13,000 barrels per day reflecting disruptions to operations
in Nigeria related to local civil unrest. These effects more than offset higher
volumes in Kazakhstan following planned maintenance in the second quarter and
increased production associated with continued ramp-up at the Agbami Field
offshore Nigeria. Net natural gas production decreased 85 million cubic feet per
day, largely due to planned maintenance at North Sea fields. 

U.S. crude oil realizations for the first two months of the third quarter
increased $9.26 per barrel to $62.47. International liquids realizations
increased $8.52 to $61.69 per barrel. U.S. natural gas realizations increased
$0.20 to $3.47 per thousand cubic feet and average international natural gas
realizations increased $0.23 per thousand cubic feet to $3.96. 

International upstream results are projected to include gains and related tax
effects of about $400 million connected with formal project approval and
previously announced sales of partial interests in the Gorgon project in
Australia. 

DOWNSTREAM - REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

The table that follows includes industry benchmark indicators for refining and
marketing margins. Actual margins realized by the company will differ due to
crude and product mix effects, planned and unplanned shutdown activity and other
company-specific and operational factors.

 For the full third quarter, U.S. and international refining indicator margins were mixed. Marketing indicator margins were higher in the United States but lower in the Asia-Pacific / Middle East / Africa area. 
                                                                                                                               
 During the first two months of the third quarter, daily U.S. refinery crude-input volumes were down 55,000 barrels per day, or about six percent, primarily resulting from planned maintenance at the Richmond refinery in California. Outside the United States, refinery crude-input volumes were up 25,000 barrels per day following planned second quarter maintenance at the Yeosu refinery in South Korea. 
                                                                                                                               
 International downstream results in the full third quarter are expected to be lower, in part due to the absence of gains from the sales of marketing businesses in Kenya and Cameroon recorded in the second quarter and unfavorable tax effects.

to foreign currency effects and the potential for irregularly occurring accruals
related to income taxes, pension settlements and other matters, actual results
may significantly differ from the guidance range or current projections. Total
net charges in the third quarter are expected to be lower than the guidance
range.

Morgan, Citigroup and Costco Wholesale Corporation</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Guess? (NYSE: GES) as the Bull of the Day and
Washington Federal (Nasdaq: WFSL) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup (NYSE: C) and
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Nasdaq: COST). Full analysis of all these stocks
is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Guess? (NYSE: GES) reported better-than-expected results for the first half of
2010, thanks to strong North American sales, operating cost controls and smart
inventory management. In addition, the company's strong cost-control efforts
helped it maintain a lower operating cost structure, which in turn helped it
navigate through the difficult economic conditions. 

Management also issued optimistic guidance for the third quarter, although it
declined to provide guidance for fiscal year 2010. For the third quarter, Guess
expects revenue of $465-$485 million and EPS of 46-49 cents. 

Given the company's positive outlook and strong control mechanisms, we upgrade
the shares of Guess Inc. from Neutral to Outperform. 

Bear of the Day: 

Washington Federal's (Nasdaq: WFSL) third quarter earnings were in line with the
Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the results significantly deteriorated from
the prior-year quarter due to a huge increase in provision for loan losses,
primarily in response to a deteriorating residential land and construction
portfolio. 

Credit quality drastically worsened during the quarter. However, declining
deposit rates helped improve funding concerns to a great extent and capital
position remained strong. 

Though margin expansion and increased market share through acquisitions will be
a great support going forward, we are concerned about the company's significant
exposure to real estate markets and suspect that it will continue to experience
credit quality deterioration. Therefore, we recommend the shares as
Underperform.

Fed to Be On Hold a Long Time

There is a chance, however, that this policy could start to develop a bubble in
stocks. There is a lot of money that has been pushed into the system. There is
not that much demand by corporations -- especially the solvent ones that the
banks would like to lend to -- to borrow lots of money to build new plants, or
even take on more inventory. That money will try to find a home, and if it can't
find it in the real economy, it will gravitate to the financial economy. 

Thus, while keeping rates low does pose a risk, that risk looks mostly
theoretical at this point. The very low Fed Funds rate means that there will
also be a very steep yield curve. 

This is good news for the banks, since their core economic function is to borrow
short term -- for example by taking in checking deposits -- and to lend long
term, for example making commercial and industrial loans. This will help big
banks like J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) and Citigroup (NYSE: C) earn enough from
their current loans to help offset the massive losses they have hidden on other
books of previous loans that have gone bad. 

Costco Beats Zacks Estimates

Costco Wholesale Corporation (Nasdaq: COST), the fifth largest general retailer
in the U.S., has reported better-than-expected fourth quarter fiscal 2009
results with net income of $374 million or 85 cents per share, compared to $398
million or 90 cents in the year-earlier quarter. The quarterly earnings well
surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents per share. 

For fiscal year 2009, net income was $1.09 billion or $2.47 per share compared
to $1.28 billion or $2.89 per share in the previous fiscal year. The
year-over-year decrease in the fiscal results was primarily due to the
continuing softness in the U.S. economy, higher employee benefit costs and
negative impact of foreign currency translation. 

Net sales during the quarter totaled $21.89 billion compared to $22.63 billion
in the year-ago quarter, while net sales in fiscal 2009 were $69.89 billion
compared to $70.98 billion in fiscal 2008. Although both the quarterly and
yearly sales declined year over year, the figures were comparatively better than
analysts` expectations, suggesting an overall improvement in the weak U.S.
retail environment.

&lt;p&gt; * FDA panel votes 10-4 to OK wider Selzentry usage * Some advisers express 'ambivalence,' 'anxiety' over drug  (Adds details from panel, company comment, share price, byline) By Susan Heavey WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Thursday recommended Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) HIV drug Selzentry be approved for wider use in certain patients with the disease, despite concern from several panel members that they were underwhelmed by the data. Pfizer is seeking U.S. approval to market Selzentry for HIV patients who have a specific type of HIV-1 -- one of two strains of the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS -- who have not tried any medications yet. It would be taken with other antiretroviral drugs. In a 10-4 vote, panel members backed the wider use, saying it did offer doctors and patients another choice even if more data is needed. We're not looking for the absolute best, we're looking for an option, said panelist Dr. Victoria Cargill, who heads minority research at the National Institutes of Health's Office of AIDS Research, and voted for the drug. FDA officials will weigh the panel's vote before making its final approval decision. Pfizer said it expects a decision by Nov. 20. Selzentry, also known as maraviroc, is already approved for use along with other drugs for HIV patients who have tried other antiretrovirals but have developed a resistance to them. If approved, Selzentry would be expanded to adults with chemokine (c-c motif) receptor 5, or CCR5, tropic HIV-1 who have not yet begun treatment. Patients would need to first be tested for that particular strain before taking the medication, the company said. But a number of panelists, even those who opted for the drug, said they were conflicted about backing the wider use given the company's somewhat limited data. Panelist Dr. Russell Van Dyke, professor at Tulane University School of Medicine, said he voted for the expanded use despite feeling some anxiety about it. I worry that it's not quite as potent as we'd like it to be, he said. Pfizer officials said their trial, which compared Selzentry to efavirenz, showed its drug helped reduce viral load. Efavirenz is marketed as Sustiva by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N). But some panelists said that a number of other options have hit the U.S. market in recent years. Several panelists said the company's data was underwhelming, especially given other available drugs. They noted concerns about the number of patients in the study who stopped using the drug because of side effects like dizziness or rash as well as those who developed a resistance. We have several first-line options available to us in 2009. I'm not convinced that this drug is my first choice for patients who are new to HIV medications, said Dr. Barbara McGovern, a professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine who voted against the drug. Overall, panelists said they wanted Pfizer to gather more data on the effect of the drug in pregnant women as well as patients with hepatitis or tuberculosis. They also urged FDA officials to make the drug's limitations clear on its label. While the FDA does not factor costs into its approval decisions, some consumer advocates after the panel's vote called on Pfizer to lower the price of Selzentry, which it says has risen 10 percent since its initial approval in 2007 to $13,767 per patient for a year's worth of treatment. While any new HIV/AIDS drug is welcome, we urge Pfizer to use restraint and to lower the price of Selzentry immediately, said AIDS Healthcare Foundation President Michael Weinstein, whose nonprofit groups provides health care to HIV and AIDS patients around the world. Some panelists also mentioned the drug's cost. Pfizer reported $46 million in Selzentry sales in 2008. In a statement, Pfizer said it was pleased with the panel's vote and would work with the FDA on the drug's label. Shares of the drugmaker closed up 1 cent to $16.70 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.   (Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing Bernard Orr and Carol Bishopric)

&lt;p&gt;IBM is facing an antitrust inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice for recent actions the company has taken in the mainframe computer market, according to the trade group that filed the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOJ has begun issuing formal requests for information related to a complaint filed against IBM in September, according to the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), the trade group that filed the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCIA's complaint against IBM alleges that the company has refused to issue licenses for IBM's mainframe OS to competitors, as required in a series of actions the DOJ took against IBM dating back to the 1970s and earlier. In some cases, IBM has yanked the OS license from customers trying to switch from IBM mainframe hardware to a competitor's, said Ed Black, CCIA's president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ abandoned a long-standing antitrust consent decree with IBM in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several large and small companies would like to compete with IBM in the mainframe market, particularly in software and services for mainframes, but IBM's actions have allowed it to maintain a monopoly, Black said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a really big case," added Heather Greenfield, a CCIA spokeswoman. "There are tons of companies cheering that aren't willing to be quite so public because they have to deal with IBM in other ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ will not comment on the complaint, a DOJ spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM believes there is no merit to antitrust claims brought by competitor T3 Technologies, said Tim Breuer, director of external relations for the IBM Systems and Technology Group. The DOJ has apparently asked T3 for documents related to its lawsuit, Breuer said. IBM intends to cooperate with any inquires from the DOJ, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, a U.S. district court in New York dismissed a lawsuit brought by mainframe vendor T3, Breuer noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T3, partly owned by Microsoft, had accused IBM of yanking its IBM reseller agreement when T3 refused to stop selling technology that allowed customers to end older versions of IBM's mainframe operating systems on Intel-based servers. The T3 dispute with IBM is part of CCIA's complaint filed with the DOJ, as well as part of an antitrust investigation against IBM launched by the European Union in mid-2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to believe there is no merit to T3's claims, and that IBM is fully entitled to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect the investments that we have made in our technologies," Breuer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of CCIA's complaint stems from the tech giant's treatment of former competitor Platform Solutions. IBM had little competition in the mainframe market when Platform Solution, early this decade, began work on servers that could mimic the behavior of more expensive IBM mainframes, CCIA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform Solutions, based on past mainframe agreements between IBM and the DOJ, requested copies of IBM's OS and technical information under a licensing agreement. IBM declined to grant Platform Solutions a license and prohibited customers from transferring IBM software licenses to Platform Solutions machines, said CCIA, which has members that are potential competitors of IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, IBM sued Platform Solutions over licenses the smaller company had purchased from Amdahl, a division of former mainframe competitor Fujitsu. IBM's lawsuit alleged that the licenses infringed its intellectual property. Platform Solutions filed a countersuit. In 2008, IBM purchased Platform Solutions, putting an end to the legal wrangling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also refused to license its mainframe OSes to users of the Hercules open source mainframe project trying to run mainframe software on non-IBM hardware, CCIA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the complaint goes "way beyond" the Platform Solutions, T3 and Hercules cases, Black said. Many mainframe customers would like to find cheaper alternatives, but IBM has prevented them from doing so, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a number of things they have done to numerous companies," he said. "In a time of economic troubles, government deficits and corporate problems, there's a lot of customers that [would find] a choice and lower costs really desirable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration`s (FDA) Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee voted (10 to 4) to
recommend the approval of Selzentry&#174; (maraviroc) tablets for use in
treatment-na&#239;ve adult patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus as part of
combination therapy. 

"Pfizer is pleased that the Committee has recognized the effectiveness and
safety profile of maraviroc in patients who are starting HIV therapy," said Dr.
Howard Mayer, Pfizer`s executive director and disease area leader, antivirals.
"Today`s discussion marks an important step in expanding available treatment
options for patients with HIV infection and we look forward to working with the
FDA to further address the points raised by the panel." 

Selzentry was granted accelerated approval in August 2007 and full approval in
November 2008 by the FDA for use in treatment-experienced adult patients with
only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus in combination with other antiretroviral therapies.
Selzentry is an oral medicine that blocks viral entry to human cells. Rather
than fighting HIV inside white blood cells, Selzentry prevents the virus from
entering uninfected cells by blocking its predominant entry route, the CCR5
co-receptor. 

In making its decision, the Advisory Committee reviewed 48- and 96-week efficacy
and safety data from the ongoing Phase 3 MERIT (Maraviroc versus Efavirenz
Regimens as Initial Therapy) trial and MERIT ES (analysis of the MERIT study
with the enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay). 

Results of MERIT at 48-weeks showed that Selzentry plus Combivir&#174;
(zidovudine/lamivudine) was as effective as Sustiva&#174; (efavirenz) plus
zidovudine/lamivudine at reducing viral load for the co-primary endpoint of &lt;400
copies/mL, but did not show non-inferiority for the co-primary endpoint of &lt;50
copies/mL at 48-weeks. Safety results at 96-weeks showed that among those
patients who remained on therapy, less than half the number of malignancies were
observed in patients taking Selzentry compared to those taking efavirenz.
Additionally, no new safety signals were identified in association with
Selzentry at 96-weeks. The most frequently reported adverse events were nausea,
headache, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, and
vomiting. Patients were screened into the study using the original Trofile assay
which is no longer available. 

MERIT ES is a retrospective analysis, which utilized the enhanced sensitivity
Trofile assay in screening samples from the MERIT trial. Results of MERIT ES at
48-weeks showed that treatment-na&#239;ve patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 taking
Selzentry plus zidovudine/lamivudine experienced comparable virologic
suppression to undetectable levels (&lt;50 copies/mL) to those taking efavirenz
plus zidovudine/lamivudine. The enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay used in the
MERIT ES analysis has been the only available version of the Trofile assay since
June 2008. 

The FDA often seeks the advice of its Advisory Committees when evaluating
potential treatments, but is not required to follow its recommendation. Through
the joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline, which is expected to close in the fourth
quarter of 2009, Pfizer remains committed to the expansion of
Selzentry/Celsentri`s current indications to include appropriate treatment-na&#239;ve
populations throughout the world. 

At the end of 2006, an estimated 1.1 million people in the U.S. were living with
HIV infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates
that in 2006 approximately 56,300 people were newly infected with HIV in the
U.S. (the most recent year that data are available). 

About Selzentry

Selzentry has been approved for use in treatment-experienced adult patients with
only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus detectable in combination with other antiretroviral
therapies, in several other markets around the world including the U.S., Canada
and the European Union. 

Maraviroc is marketed under the trade name Selzentry&#174; in the U.S. and Celsentri&#174;
in all other countries in which it is approved.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms and assigns a Negative Rating Outlook to class C of J. P.
Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. 2003-PM1. Fitch also affirms
with Stable Outlooks classes A-2 through A-4. A detailed list of rating actions
follows at the end of this release. 

The Negative Outlook for class C is due to increasing expected losses on the
specially serviced loans, as well as the small size of the class by balance.
Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any rating changes over the next one to
two years. 

There are currently six loans in special servicing (8%), four of which have
appraisal reductions. The largest specially serviced loan (5.7%) is
collateralized by a retail center in West Palm Beach, FL suffering from
significant occupancy issues, including the loss of two anchor tenants, Dillards
and Macys. An appraisal reduction was performed in September 2009 and Fitch
believes further declines in value are possible if additional tenants vacate.
The loan is currently in foreclosure. In total, Fitch expects losses on five of
the six specially serviced loans. 

Classes D through P are currently on Rating Watch Negative. Fitch expects to
resolve the Rating Watch status following a detailed review of the entire
transaction. 

Fitch affirms and assigns an Outlook to the following class: 

--$13 million class C 'AAA'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch affirms and assigns Outlooks to the following classes: 

--$309.2 million class A1A 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$24.4 million class A-2 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$82.6 million class A-3 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$282 million class A-4 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-1 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microblogging service Twitter is in advanced talks with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) about licensing its data feed to the companies' search engines, a Web blog associated with the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter's discussions with Microsoft and Google are being conducted separately and would allow each company to incorporate the 140-character messages, or "tweets," that Twitter is known for into their Internet search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to cull through the flood of tweets as they are posted, known as real time search, is gaining popularity as an important new way to search the Internet for up-to-the-minute information on the latest news events and happenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AllThingsDigital blog quoted unidentified sources as saying the companies are discussing several types of deals. Details could include Twitter receiving a payment of several million dollars and various types of revenue-sharing agreements to allow Twitter to benefit from the ad revenue that Microsoft and Google generate from search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has emerged as one of the fastest-growing Internet social media services. But the company has yet to generate any significant revenue from its free service. Twitter has cited advertising and premium features as two potential money-making plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Twitter received $100 million in new funding from investors including T.Rowe Price and Insight Venture Partners, based on a $1 billion valuation for Twitter, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Twitter were not immediately available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has placed the following eight classes of J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2004-CIBC9, commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates on Rating Watch Negative: 

--$27.5 million class B 'AA'; 

--$13.8 million class C 'AA-'; 

--$20.7 million class D 'A-'; 

--$11 million class E 'BBB+'; 

--$15.2 million class F 'BBB-'; 

--$9.6 million class G 'BB+'; 

--$17.9 million class H 'B-'; 

--$2.8 million class J 'B-'. 

The Rating Watch Negative placements are due identification of the classes by
Fitch's downgrade screener due to delinquencies. 

Subsequent to the previous Fitch rating action, three loans, representing 2.3%
of the pool, transferred to the special servicer. In addition, a more recent
appraisal was obtained for the specially serviced Country Club Plaza loan
(4.3%), and a further decline in value is indicated. 

Once more information is known about the loans, including valuations and workout
strategies and timing, Fitch will revisit the ratings.

&lt;p&gt;Staffing industry leader expects increased productivity, efficiency and
significant ROI
BOCA RATON, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Medical Connections Holdings, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: MCTH), one of the
nation`s fastest growing healthcare staffing companies specializing in allied
health, nurse and physician staffing and recruiting services, said that it has
finalized all of the systems implementation and integration with its recently
acquired ERP software. The company had engaged Tribridge as its consultant to
provide the necessary expertise for the project. 

"The Microsoft Dynamics solution carries with it a uniquely designed data
management system that is robust enough to support Medical Connections`
anticipated expansion over the next decade," explained Brian R. Neill, Chief
Financial Officer and the software project sponsor. "Now that the system is
finalized, we will see an increase in productivity and a streamlining of our

integrate future acquisitions. 

"We are pleased that we have finalized and implemented all systems, and trained
our staff," said Joseph Azzata, CEO of Medical Connections. "This system will
integrate our sales floor with our financial department, and it also has the
capability to be integrated with other systems so that when we acquire other
staffing companies, we can simply `plug` their operating and back office systems
right into ours -- with no down time and little learning curve. We continue to
expect a very significant return on our investment in the new ERP system," he
added.

&lt;p&gt;IBM is facing an antitrust inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice for recent actions the company has taken in the mainframe computer market, according to the trade group that filed the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOJ has begun issuing formal requests for information related to a complaint filed against IBM in September, according to the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), the trade group that filed the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCIA's complaint against IBM alleges that the company has refused to issue licenses for IBM's mainframe OS to competitors, as required in a 1970s antitrust consent decree with the DOJ that was terminated in 2001. In some cases, IBM has yanked the OS license from customers trying to switch from IBM mainframe hardware to a competitor's, said Ed Black, CCIA's president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several large and small companies would like to compete with IBM in the mainframe market, particularly in software and services for mainframes, but IBM's actions have allowed it to maintain a monopoly, Black said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a really big case," added Heather Greenfield, a CCIA spokeswoman. "There are tons of companies cheering that aren't willing to be quite so public because they have to deal with IBM in other ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ will not comment on the complaint, a DOJ spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM didn't have an immediate comment on the DOJ investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of CCIA's complaint stems from the tech giant's treatment of former competitor Platform Solutions. IBM had little competition in the mainframe market when Platform Solution, early this decade, began work on servers that could mimic the behavior of more expensive IBM mainframes, CCIA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform Solutions, based on past mainframe agreements between IBM and the DOJ, requested copies of IBM's OS and technical information under a licensing agreement. IBM declined to grant Platform Solutions a license and prohibited customers from transferring IBM software licenses to Platform Solutions machines, said CCIA, which has members that are potential competitors of IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, IBM sued Platform Solutions over licenses the smaller company had purchased from Amdahl, a division of former mainframe competitor Fujitsu. IBM's lawsuit alleged that the licenses infringed its intellectual property. Platform Solutions filed a countersuit. In 2008, IBM purchased Platform Solutions, putting an end to the legal wrangling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the complaint goes "way beyond" the Platform Solutions case, Black said. Many mainframe customers would like to find cheaper alternatives, but IBM has prevented them from doing so, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a number of things they have done to numerous companies," he said. "In a time of economic troubles, government deficits and corporate problems, there's a lot of customers that [would find] a choice and lower costs really desirable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROTTERDAM, Netherlands Oct 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O)
has no plans to develop a digital book reader to compete with
the fast-growing popularity of Amazon's (AMZN.O) Kindle or a

after the online retailer vastly expanded its Kindle reading
device's global footprint to 100 countries. [ID:nSP442719]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would love to see companies like Amazon and others bring
their books to the PC," Ballmer said. "Hopefully we can get that

Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But no, we are not interested in e-readers ourselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; E-readers are expected to be a hot gift item in the upcoming
holiday season, and industry research firm Forrester this week
hiked its forecast for U.S. e-reader sales by 50 percent to 3
million units. [ID:nN06442999]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple is reportedly developing a new device that can work as
a digital reader, and technology watchers have said Microsoft
may also be considering such a move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software maker already markets its Microsoft Reader for
PC-based book reading and supports tablet PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Georgina Prodhan and David Cowell)

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 8 (Reuters) - Two lawmakers want JPMorgan
Chase (JPM.N), the second largest U.S. bank by assets, to
answer a few questions about how many customers were affected
when a computer tape with their personal information was lost
earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Representatives Joe Barton, the top Republican on the
Energy and Commerce Committee, and George Radanovich, the top
Republican on the subcommittee on commerce, trade and consumer
protection, wrote JPMorgan Chase Bank CEO James Dimon on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Breaches like this are of concern because of the variety
of malicious crimes that can be perpetrated using stolen
personal information," wrote Barton and Radanovich, who asked
for a response to their questions by Oct. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The congressmen wanted to know how many customers were
affected and how many were notified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank, which declined on Thursday to say exactly when or
where the incident occurred or how many customers were
involved, did say it sent letters offering their customers
"identity protection" for one year free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The letters notified the customers that their Social
Security numbers and addresses may have been on the missing
backup computer tape, but that it contained no banking or
financial information, a Chase spokesman said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Letters about the breach were sent to customers in August
although there has been no indication that the information has
been misused, said bank spokesman Thomas Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You need special software to read the data," said Kelly,
who declined to say how many people's information were on the
tape.

&lt;p&gt;Twitter's discussions with Microsoft and Google are being conducted separately and would allow each company to incorporate the 140-character messages, or "tweets," that Twitter is known for into their Internet search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to cull through the flood of tweets as they are posted, known as real time search, is gaining popularity as an important new way to search the Internet for up-to-the-minute information on the latest news events and happenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AllThingsDigital blog quoted unidentified sources as saying the companies are discussing several types of deals. Details could include Twitter receiving a payment of several million dollars and various types of revenue-sharing agreements to allow Twitter to benefit from the ad revenue that Microsoft and Google generate from search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has emerged as one of the fastest-growing Internet social media services. But the company has yet to generate any significant revenue from its free service. Twitter has cited advertising and premium features as two potential money-making plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Twitter received $100 million in new funding from investors including T.Rowe Price and Insight Venture Partners, based on a $1 billion valuation for Twitter, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Twitter were not immediately available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) likely broke a string of three straight losses in the third quarter, while chief rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) extended its dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing mismatch between the last two big names on Wall Street is illustrated by analysts' forecasts: Goldman earnings are expected to more than double, while Morgan Stanley is seen just eking out a profit, lagging far behind its year-earlier results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the third quarter was a resilient one for the banks, with strong sales and trading results and gains in asset management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are two companies that have two less major competitors than they did last year with the failure of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns," said Bill Hackney, chief investment officer with Atlanta Capital Management. "We think the outlook for both of these companies is very strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is expected to post earnings of $4.24 per share before one-time items, up from $1.81 a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Morgan Stanley is expected to report 29 cents a share, down from $1.32, hurt by debt-valuation adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, whose embarrassment of riches is setting it up for a possible bonus bonanza at year-end, earned $4.93 per share in the second quarter, while Morgan Stanley lost $1.10 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman plans to report third-quarter results on October 15; Morgan Stanley has not yet set a date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORGAN REBOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Morgan Stanley did manage to turn a profit in the third quarter, it was with a sigh of relief. The bank has suffered three straight quarterly losses and has been slow to join Wall Street's rebound party after the near-collapse of the financial services industry a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts remain concerned about the bank's continued losses on real estate principal investments and the accounting ramifications of improvements in its debt prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years banks recorded big gains on the declining market value of debt they issued, because they could buy back the debt cheaply. But as banks' prospects have improved in the last few quarters, the value of their debt has jumped, forcing them to reverse earlier gains, weighing on earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley "will take some pain in terms of writing up their own debt yet again," said Steve Stelmach, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, though, looks to be well past the troubles that continue to plague its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BONUS BONANZA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is in a very sweet spot and they should do very well," said Marshall Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's position is so strong that analysts expect it to stash away an additional $5 billion to $6 billion -- about half of third-quarter revenue -- for bonuses, lifting the year-end bonus pool to more than $16 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which has repaid $10 billion it received under the U.S. Treasury bailout program, has been criticized by lawmakers and consumer advocates for setting aside so much for bonuses so soon after the assist from taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has to "walk this fine line between paying their people too much and sending the wrong signal to government and taxpayers," said Michael Hecht, an analyst with JMP Securities, who expects Goldman to set aside far less for compensation in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hecht recently boosted his third-quarter earnings forecast for Goldman to $4.35 per share. He reduced his view on Morgan Stanley to 30 cents a share, saying he expects results to "remain noisy at best and lackluster at worst."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Goldman, Morgan Stanley also has repaid $10 billion borrowed from taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is preparing for CEO John Mack to step down at year-end. Co-President James Gorman will become CEO and Mack will become chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upcoming Webcast Offers Immigration Management Strategies for the New World
Post-Recession 
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
While the worldwide recession and record low unemployment levels have prompted
many countries to re-examine their existing immigration system and increase
their entry requirements, VISANOW, leading global immigration services provider,
purports that these protectionist tactics restrict the international movement of
labor, hindering innovation and overall long-term competitiveness. In the
October issue of Mobility, the magazine of the worldwide Employee Relocation
Council, an organization dedicated to global workforce mobility, VISANOW
rationalizes this perspective by taking a global look at the two sides of the
debate - the international movement of labor or globalist perspective versus the
protectionism retreat of clamping down on immigration. Regardless of which way a
country`s responds to the recession, it is evident that a new world of corporate
immigration is upon us, and to help corporations effectively deal with the
post-recession immigration changes, VISANOW has partnered with HR.com to present
the complimentary webcast: "After the Recession: Immigration Strategies for a
New World" on October 29 at 11:00 a.m. ET /10:00 a.m. CT. 

Encouragement of International movement of Labor versus Protectionism

One of innovations roots is workforce diversity and having access to the best
and brightest from around the world with the immigration doors hinged wide open
for highly skilled workers. The European Union and Canada are two examples of
countries that realize the importance of the international movement of labor and
are actually refining their immigration strategies to fast-track work and
residency permits for highly skilled workers, becoming more attractive
destinations for top talent and subsequently harboring innovation. Conversely,
countries like the UK and U.S. have responded to the recession by implementing
stricter regulations and more diligent enforcement in an effort to protect local
labor markets and boost the economy. The short-sighted protectionist response
actually closes the door on immigration and drives emigration of highly skilled
workers - ultimately leading to a brain drain, the polar opposite of innovation.


"While countries may intend to protect its highly skilled labor by hiring
locally, limiting the available labor/talent pool through erecting immigration
barriers likely impedes innovation, actually hindering economic recovery,"
commented Amberley Johnson, Global Immigration Services Manager at VISANOW. 

For additional VISANOW commentary on the protectionist-immigration debate, read
Amberley Johnson`s ERC editorial. 

"After the Recession: Immigration Strategies for a New World" Webcast

Whether your country`s immigration response to the worldwide recession is to
open its immigration doors wider or to clamp down on immigration, companies must
be able to adapt their corporate immigration strategies accordingly and ensure
compliance. To help corporations navigate the new world of the immigration and
the protectionist-immigration consequences, VISANOW has partnered with HR.com to
present a free webcast "After the Recession: Immigration Strategies for a New
World" on October 29 at 11:00 a.m. ET /10:00 a.m. CT. 

The webcast will cover global best practices in response to the challenges of
this new corporate immigration world. Attendees will learn how to manage more
stringent immigration legislation and regulations, minimize legal non-compliance
risks and demonstrate cost diligence without sacrificing results. In addition,
VISANOW will explore immigration opportunities presented by the economic
recession.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan`s Depositary Receipts (DR) Group today announced that it is
launching Issuance &amp; Cancellation (I) Lock, a new patent pending solution that
allows broker dealer clients to purchase a contract that establishes a future
rate for DR issuance and cancellation activity. 

By purchasing an I Lock, broker dealers will have the right, but not the
obligation, to execute issuance and cancellation transactions in the future at a
predetermined rate. This will provide greater flexibility for meeting their DR
investment and trading strategy objectives. The I Lock contracts are issued
and maintained by J.P. Morgan`s DR Execution Desk. 

"The I Lock solution further demonstrates J.P. Morgan`s leadership and
innovation in the DR marketplace," said Claudine Gallagher, global head of J.P.
Morgan`s DR group. "No other depositary bank can offer this patent pending
product today." 

"As broker dealers gain greater control of their costs by moving DR fees from a
variable to fixed cost structure, they will have incentive to trade more, which
leads to greater liquidity in the marketplace," said James Proctor, global head
of J.P. Morgan`s DR Execution Desk.

award-winning Web site www.adr.com. For more information on J.P. Morgan`s DR

&lt;p&gt;Oct 8 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank began coverage of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) with "buy,"
and said the two U.S. banks will stay well capitalized even
under the likely increased regulatory capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The outlook for capital markets activity is favorable for
the industry given improving economic growth, rising confidence
and better pricing, but this is even more positive for the two
banks because of their relative positioning and recent market
share gains, analyst Michael Carrier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the near term, Goldman will likely generate superior
earnings growth and a healthy return on equity partly due to
its superior risk management and improving capital market
trends, the analyst wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Morgan Stanley too, Carrier expects to see an improving
book value growth and return on equity, with strategic
initiatives and capital deployment creating significant
long-term potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the longer term, the two are likely to deploy excess
capital to pursue buybacks in order to generate superior
returns for shareholders, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While Goldman is not immune to regulation and we expect
required capital levels to increase, the firm's risk management
culture is in a league of its own and Goldman remains well
positioned relative to the industry," Carrier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Group of 20 leading industrial nations agreed in
September to finalise new capital rules by the end of 2010 and
set an end-2012 date for implementing the tougher capital rules
for banks. [ID:nLP433144]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carrier set a price target of $220 on the shares of Goldman
and $36 on those of Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman closed at $190.48 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange, while Morgan Stanley shares closed at
$31.16.

&lt;p&gt;Investors Bring Reality Mobile`s Instant, Real-Time Collaboration Technology to
the Energy Industry
HERNDON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Reality Mobile today announced that it has secured $6.5 million in expansion
capital in a round led by Energy Ventures, the leading independent venture
capital firm providing competent capital to high-growth oil and gas technology
companies, in conjunction with CTTV Investments LLC, the venture capital arm of
Chevron Technology Ventures LLC and communications investor, the Dobson
Partnership. The funding will allow Reality Mobile to bring its enterprise-class
real-time mobile collaboration platform - proven in the government and defense
markets - into the energy sector,and launch a Houston office with sales and
support staff. 

All three funding partners were drawn to the unique features of Reality Mobile`s
solution. The technology has clear applications in the broad range of industries
where the ability to instantly connect high-value assets with the right
expertise in real-time can mean the difference between success or failure. 

"In many industries, and especially in energy, experts are a strained commodity.
Giving field teams visual access to the right experts in real time will improve
and speed decision making, while helping companies avoid costly downtime and
dangerous situations," said Leif Andr&#233; Skare, partner with Energy Ventures.
"Reality Mobile allows organizations to immediately bring the right perspective
to any issue and better leverage their highly skilled resources in situations
where their expertise is both needed and critical to maintaining and improving
operations." 

Built on industry-standard infrastructure and operable on any wireless network
including cellular and satellite, Reality Mobile`s software allows enterprise
users to collectively visualize high-value assets and data with colleagues
anywhere in the world. With the RealityVision&#174; platform, users can securely
transmit live video from virtually any camera source, from cell phones to
high-definition cameras, and share it immediately with any and all system users.


"We are dealing with an increase in globalization, a rise in security threats
and increased competition. Having true `eyes` in the field that can be accessed
instantly from anywhere in the world is critical to growing business in this
24/7 digital world," said Everett Dobson, managing partner with Dobson
Partnership, and founder and former CEO of telecommunications leader Dobson
Communications. "We are pleased to help make Reality Mobile`s leading technology
more accessible to enterprises that need it to stay one step ahead." 

Using the RealityVision&#174; ScreencastTM capability, users can stream a portion of
their computer screen to anyone on the network. For example, geophysicists in
the office can capture a dynamic section of a seismic data simulation and stream
it in real time to another user, such as an expert in an overseas office or
field personnel in the Gulf of Mexico. 

"RealityVision allows you to be in the same place as your colleagues around the
world. Whether they are in the office interpreting data, or on a rig off the
coast of Angola, you can bring key personnel to the same level of visual
understanding of an asset with a push of a button," said Patrick McVeigh,
chairman, Reality Mobile. "The expertise you need can be virtually by your side
in moments." 

By providing applications that enhance an organization`s situational awareness
through the sharing of critical data and GPS tracking, Reality Mobile has
developed the missing link between people, processes, technologies and
geographies. A true extension of the enterprise to mobile users, Reality Mobile
enables key information and visuals to be securely shared with the people who
need to see it most, particularly when seconds count. 

About Reality Mobile

Founded in 2003, Reality Mobile is expanding the frontiers of mobile technology
by giving users access to video, data and expertise throughout their
organization and the world at the push of a button. With the RealityVision&#174;
software platform users access real-time, forensic grade video to be virtually
on-the-ground with their colleagues to proactively address problems and improve
employee safety and security, incident response, loss prevention and other
critical functions. With the RealityVision&#174; ScreencastTM feature, users can
stream any portion of a computer screen to any user on the network, sharing
video, dynamic data visualizations and critical information in an instant.

&lt;p&gt;Beach Boys Co-Founder to Record Two Albums, Including Covers of George and Ira
Gershwin Classics

Wilson to Craft Collaborative Compositions from Previously Unpublished Music
from George Gershwin
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Two giants of popular entertainment have come together as Brian Wilson, the
pioneering musical genius who co-founded the Beach Boys and wrote many of the
band's greatest hits, has signed with Walt Disney Records. 

In the months ahead, Wilson will record two new solo albums for the label's
Disney Pearl imprint, including one featuring covers of classic songs by great
American songwriters, George and Ira Gershwin. For that recording, the Gershwin
estate has given Wilson access to rare, unfinished pieces of music by George
Gershwin, with which he will craft collaborative compositions unlike anything
the world has seen. 

He will follow that with an album of classic Disney songs, which the artist
promises to "Brian-ize" with his trademark vocal stacks and unique arrangements.
Release dates for each album have yet to be determined. 

Said David Agnew, Walt Disney Records president and general manager of the
Disney Music Group, "We are honored to be in business with one of the greatest
musical artists of all time. It is impossible to overstate the impact Brian has
had on contemporary music and culture -- it has been nothing less than profound.
We look forward to partnering with Brian on this exciting new voyage in his
musical journey." 

"I've always tried to make music that entertained people," Wilson said. "I also
wanted my music to last, to be able to speak to any generation. Thankfully,
nearly 50 years since the Beach Boys were born, that seems to have come true.
Now, a new musical chapter begins for me, and teaming up with Disney means it's
going to be a chapter to remember. I promise." 

Wilson chose to record George and Ira Gershwin songs because he considers the
late composers of classics like "Someone to Watch Over Me," "Rhapsody in Blue"
and "Summertime" as a critical influence on him. "I've always loved George
Gershwin. The earliest music I remember hearing is 'Rhapsody in Blue,'" says
Wilson, referring to Gershwin's groundbreaking 1924 orchestral piece. "Along
with Irving Berlin, Gershwin basically invented the popular song, but he did
something more. He had a gift for melody that nobody has ever equaled yet his
music is timeless and always accessible. This is the most spiritual project I've
ever worked on." 

Said Todd Gershwin (George Gershwin estate) and Michael Owen (Ira Gershwin
estate): "The Gershwin families are delighted that the legendary musician Brian
Wilson has chosen to record a collection of George and Ira Gershwin songs for
his next project. In every generation, American music has been pushed forward by
visionaries, from the Gershwin brothers to Brian Wilson. This latest
interpretation will be a new opportunity to discover the magic of Gershwin
music." 

Like Gershwin, Brian Wilson is one of the great composers of the last 100 years.
The Southern California native, along with his brothers, a cousin and a friend,
formed the Beach Boys while still in his teens. With Wilson as chief songwriter
and arranger, the band not only enjoyed dozens of hits, but changed music
forever thanks to Brian's innovative melodies and harmonies. Songs like "I Get
Around," "Help Me, Rhonda," "California Girls," "Wouldn't It Be Nice," and the
#1 smash "Good Vibrations" remain indispensable staples in the rock 'n' roll
canon. The band's "Pet Sounds" (1966) is regarded as one of the greatest albums
of all time. 

Wilson continued to make great music after the Beach Boys, with 10 solo albums
including his breathtaking "Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE," which he began
recording in the 1960s and finally completed in 2004 to thunderous critical
acclaim and Top 20 chart success (as well as earning a Grammy). A member of the
Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, a Kennedy Center
honoree and recipient of multiple Gold and Platinum records, Brian Wilson has
earned his well-deserved pop music immortality.

&lt;p&gt;The CCIA had urged the Justice Department to open the probe, accusing IBM of withdrawing licenses for its operating systems from customers who use non-IBM hardware, retaliating against business partners deemed disloyal, bundling its mainframe operating systems with hardware and acquiring startup PSI to stifle competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-profit trade group -- which counts software giants Microsoft and Oracle, but not IBM, as members -- also alleged that IBM refused to license its mainframe operating systems to users of "Hercules" for installation on machines other than IBM mainframes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hercules is open-source software that allows IBM's mainframe operating systems to run on Intel-based and Advanced Micro Devices-based personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are aware that Justice has begun the CID investigatory process. The scope is quite broad," said Black, adding that one of its focuses is antitrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CID is the equivalent of a subpoena and indicates that an investigation is under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes after software developer T3 Technologies had filed an antitrust suit against IBM in Manhattan federal district court. The judge threw out the suit on September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined comment. But IBM pointed out the T3 suit dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just last week, a U.S. District Court dismissed T3's claims against IBM in their entirety. We understand the Department of Justice has asked T3 for documents from the litigation," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM intends to cooperate with any inquiries from the Department of Justice. We continue to believe there is no merit to T3's claims, and that IBM is fully entitled to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect the investments that we have made in our technologies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black, however, said the Justice Department's decision reflected "a pledge by the Obama administration that they're going to take antitrust seriously. They mean it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probe is similar to others it has opened into dominant firms. The head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Christine Varney, said in May she planned to take a more aggressive approach with firms that use their market power to crush competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department is also investigating telecoms companies for potential antitrust violations. Smaller telcos have complained that the giants -- ATT and Verizon Communications -- used their market share to squeeze out smaller rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller firms have also protested against the exclusive deals that cellphone companies made with handset makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're (the Justice Department) going to want to make this stick," said antitrust attorney David Balto. "There's good reason for IBM to be concerned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Lawsky and Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capping our list of top IT news stories this week, Microsoft and the European Commission reached accord on the ongoing antitrust case against the company. While this will free up some room in future top-news lists, we expect that we'll continue to have no end of bad news related to phishing scams, of which there was plenty this week as well. Thankfully, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison added some levity to the mix, though his brand of joking undoubtedly fell flat at Salesforce.com.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;1. Microsoft, EU reach accord in antitrust battle over IE browser: Microsoft and the European Commission agreed to terms to end the decade-long Web-browser antitrust case against the company. "I think this is a trustful deal we are making. There can't be a misunderstanding because it is the final result of a long discussion between Steve Ballmer and me," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Hotmail accounts breached by suspected phishing attacks and Gmail and Yahoo also caught in massive phishing scam: Extremely rude people posted information online about more than 10,000 compromised Hotmail accounts, presumably to gloat over their success in getting others to turn over personal information. Not content to stop at 10,000, webmail attackers then posted information about thousands more Gmail and Yahoo and AOL mail accounts. Read on for more news about scammers ... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Phishing arrests highlight massive problem: Good news came in the War on Phishing with word that U.S. authorities broke up a huge scam, indicting 53 people on an assortment of charges, while Egyptian authorities arrested 47 people allegedly involved in the same scam. Alas, those arrests scarcely took a drop from the great sea of phishers out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. DOJ tries to step in front of IBM mainframe steamroller: The U.S. Department of Justice in the Obama administration continues to signal that it means business when it comes to antitrust -- next up is, apparently, IBM, with the agency opening a preliminary investigation into whether the company abused its mainframe computer monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. FCC's Genachowski to enter wireless hot house and Genachowski lays out FCC mobile strategy: U.S. Federal Communications Commissioner Julius Genachowski grabbed headlines out of the CTIA conference, underscoring that the FCC is serious about dealing with mobile communications issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Click Forensics: Bahama botnet stealing traffic from Google: A sophisticated network of compromised computers known as the Bahama botnot is causing click fraud for online advertisers, but in what is perhaps an even cheekier aspect of its nefarious work, the botnet is stealing Web traffic, and therefore revenue, from Google. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.  NASA hacker Gary McKinnon refused Supreme Court appeal: Gary McKinnon cannot appeal his extradition to the U.S. to the U.K.'s Supreme Court, the U.K. High Court ruled in a decision that leaves the British hacker with fewer legal options. McKinnon has admitted that he broke into U.S. military and NASA computers, saying he was looking for evidence of UFOs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Ellison mocks salesforce.com's 'itty bitty' application: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison turned his trademark sarcastic sense of humor toward Salesforce.com, calling its software an "itty bitty" application that relies on Oracle's middleware. In an interesting twist, Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff is supposed to speak at Oracle OpenWorld next week. Although the CEOs had a falling out sometime ago, Salesforce.com is a sponsor of the Oracle show this year and Benioff's speech may have been seen as an indication that the hatchet had been buried. But, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. OpenWorld to shed light on Oracle's Java plans and What to expect at Oracle OpenWorld: Many IT professionals will have their eyes on OpenWorld, hoping to get a better sense of Oracle's plans for Java after its acquisition of Sun Microsystems closes. Undoubtedly, there will be plenty of other news from the conference, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. Microsoft plans monster Patch Tuesday next week: Tuesday could be a grim day for systems administrators and the like as Microsoft has given notice that it will release its biggest ever slew of security patches.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Thursday`sAnalyst Blog: 

IBM Faces Antitrust Hurdle

International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has been charged by the Computer and
Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a non-profit trade group organized
by IBM`s rivals Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL). The
allegation is directed at its Mainframe computer business, which is taking
revenues and pressurizing profits of its competitors by withdrawing the license
access to customers using non-IBM hardware operating systems. 

The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) is investigating the allegations against IBM
for its conduct in the Mainframe business. Some smaller companies in the
banking, government and health care sector develop technologies that would allow
the software to run on cheaper hardware. Thus, to freeze competition, IBM has
combined its mainframe operating systems with hardware and acquired startup
Platform Solutions Inc. 

Moreover, it has been alleged that IBM has curbed license of its mainframe
operating systems to users of Hercules, which is an open-source software that
allows IBM's mainframe operating systems to run on Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) and
Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) devices. 

Last year, IBM acquired Platform Solutions, which complained to European
regulators about IBM's restriction on the usage of its mainframe operating
software on non-IBM computers.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has halted patient enrollment in a late-stage lung cancer trial of its experimental drug, figitumumab, for safety reasons, the drugmaker said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The halt was recommended by independent safety monitors overseeing the study. In their review, the monitors found more serious adverse events, including deaths, with patients receiving figitumumab, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said currently enrolled patients may continue their treatment in consultation with their physicians. As of Sept 30, 681 patients were enrolled in the Phase 3 study out of a target of 820, a company spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it notified all clinical trial investigators and regulatory agencies and will work closely with the safety monitoring committee on analyzing the data before issuing further guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enrollment halt is a blow for Pfizer, which is seeking new medicines as many of its top sellers face patent expirations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Cowen  Co had estimated figitumumab would have sales of $400 million in 2015, making it a modest seller by large drug company standards. Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez had been more optimistic, forecasting global revenue of $1.2 billion in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the enrollment halt, however, Fernandez removed potential figitumumab sales from his financial models, noting that metabolic side effects were evident with the drug in mid-stage studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite trials in other types of cancer such as breast and prostate, we... were most enthusiastic about prospects for this drug in lung cancer based on Phase 2 efficacy responses," Fernandez said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst lowered his 2015 earnings forecast for Pfizer, which is buying U.S. rival Wyeth, by 3 cents per share, to $2.33 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a disappointment, but not unrecoverable for Pfizer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, known as Advigo 1016, patients with non-small cell lung cancer receive figitumumab in combination with two older therapies, carboplatin and paclitaxel, or just the older drugs. The goal is to assess the safety and efficacy of figitumumab as a potential initial treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Phase 3 lung-cancer study evaluating figitumumab in combination with Roche and OSI Pharmaceuticals' Tarceva is continuing to enroll new patients, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed up 1.3 percent at $16.92 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is moving to boost its market share in credit cards for wealthy customers and small businesses, threatening American Express Co's (AXP.N) longtime dominance of those clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Express -- the largest U.S. credit card company by purchases -- has long enjoyed a leading position among affluent and corporate customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It widened its lead as the credit card industry was busy targeting subprime borrowers, which at the time seemed like a profitable niche given the chance of charging fees or increasing interest rates when customers fell behind in their payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strategy backfired when credit card losses spiked to record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A law to limit the ability to increase fees and interest rates will make subprime borrowers even less attractive, forcing card issuers to seek other customers to make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express also grew in recent years thanks to subprime customers, but that always remained a smaller part of its business compared with those of its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the third-largest U.S. credit card issuer by purchases, is likely to emerge as a winner from the overhaul of the card industry, given its conservative expansion strategy and low default rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could be threaten American Express's dominance among wealthy customers and companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other rivals pose less of a threat to American Express, as they are either smaller -- like Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) -- or struggling with losses and government bailouts -- like Citigroup Inc (C.N) or Bank of America Corp BAC.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chase is trying to identify attractive customers including the more affluent and small businesses, where there is potentially less credit risk, but still potentially attractive economics," said Brad Ball, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann. "The Chase franchise could pose a competitive threat to the leadership of American Express."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express executives downplayed the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are trying to fish where the fish are, and we have been fishing in those waters for 50 years," said Ralph Andretta, general manager of Membership Rewards at American Express. "We've got a lot of hooks in those waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not afraid of competition," said Andretta, adding that the company has eliminated some fees and increased rewards promotions to court customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRENGTH OR LOYALTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, AmEx said its growth strategy would focus on wealthy and corporate customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan now has a similar strategy. In the last two months, the second largest U.S. bank by assets launched its Sapphire card, targeting the top 15 percent of U.S. households by income, and three credit cards for small companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase, which already had sent out more promotional mail aimed at signing up small business cardholders than any other card issuer, also increased its leadership in that category in the second quarter, according to a report of Mintel Comperemedia. Chase nearly doubled its percentage of total mailings to small businesses, while American Express appears to have reduced its mailings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do think there's opportunities to go into the external market, so our goal is to gain market share over time," said Eileen Serra, president of Affluent/High Net Worth Business at JPMorgan Chase, adding that the bank is not only targeting American Express.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan also launched its first charge, rather than credit, card, entering into a market dominated for decades for American Express. It is also the first Visa and MasterCard charge card, two well-known brands that could attract customers, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe for certain consumers Visa and MasterCard might be a more attractive option," said Scott Valentin, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan could also use the muscle of its nationwide presence, its nearly 5,500 retail branches, and cheap funding resources to squeeze American Express.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it will not be a cakewalk. Rewards are going to be key, and American Express still is ahead of rivals in that area; its Membership Rewards program is highly valued by its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express ranked first in a J.D. Power poll about consumer satisfaction with cards; Chase was eighth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of brand loyalty to American Express; a lot of that brand loyalty is driven by the rewards programs and that makes it more difficult to get customers to change issuers," said Richard Shane, an analyst at Jefferies  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Could their market share be eroded? Yes; but it's hard to see someone displacing them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has created a research group to look into how the company can extend its reach into social networking.  The new research team will be called Future Social Experiences (FUSE), and will be headed by Microsoft General Manager Lili Cheng.  The new group was announced in an e-mail sent to Microsoft employees by Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie, who will oversee the project, according to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FUSE reportedly merges three existing research groups within Microsoft into a larger collaborative group.  Ozzie's memo explaining the project is scarce on details, and only emphasizes broad concepts that will guide the new research lab.  In Ozzie's world, social networking is transforming how we use computers including our computer's operating system.  So FUSE will focus on products "where 'social' meets sharing; where 'social' meets real-time; where 'social' meets media; where 'social' meets search; where 'social' meets the cloud plus three screens [PC, mobile device, television and online] and a world of devices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last quote may sound like a bunch of nonsense, but it does give us a vague idea of what Microsoft might be trying to do.  Clearly, Microsoft isn't too interested in creating another Facebook or MySpace competitor; instead, Microsoft's concept of social is more likely to focus on collaboration and sharing information instead of posting photos and sending pokes on a Website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is already trying things like this with Office 2010's SharePoint Workspace collaboration software, as well as Office 2010's Web apps.  We could also see items similar to the Xobni plug-in for Outlook that turns your e-mail client into a social networking hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These may be just guesses, but you can bet that unlike Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks, Microsoft is interested in introducing products that it can sell and make money from on day one. &#160; So whatever FUSE does work on, I think it's safe to assume the group's projects for everyday consumers will be tied to new or existing desktop programs, with a focus on Microsoft's productivity applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/173399&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It couldn't have happened at a worse time. Micro-blogging service Twitter suffered an outage Thursday, just as it reportedly was negotiating a licensing deal with either Google or Microsoft. The up-and-down day for Twitter mirrors the service's bigger struggles as it grapples with technical SNAFUs, a business model, and its blockbuster success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First the Downs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of Thursday, users could post tweets to their own streams, but updates from their followers were scarce at best. After admitting to a totally unspecified "unplanned site outage" late Wednesday, Twitter waited until almost 2 p.m. ET Thursday to elaborate on the problem. It explained in vague terms that "timelines remain stale for users."  It wasn't until sites such as TechCrunch started speculating that Twitter had fallen victim to a DDOS attack that Twitter posted an official statement explaining: "The problems this morning were caused by a bug triggered by an edge case in one of the core services that powers Twitter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At precisely 3:54 pm on Thursday, Twitter was reporting that "Most users are seeing freshly updated timelines. However, due to the previous problems, users of our SMS service may experience some missing tweets." As of about 10 pm ET on Thursday, Twitter hadn't updated its status any further. A search of Twitter.com under the "outage" search term on Thursday night yielded no new reports of user issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the Ups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile All Things Digital reported Thursday that Twitter is in talks with both Google and Microsoft about the prospect of multimillion deals to integrate Twitter in some way with outside search engines. News agency Reuters chimed in with a report stating Twitter's discussions with Microsoft and Google are taking place separately, and that if negotiations work out, the potential partners would be able to incorporate Twitter tweets into Internet search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would users actually benefit from a Twitter partnership with a major search engine? As I see it, only if the search engines were discriminating enough to combine useful information feeds from Twitter with other search results, while screening out less pertinent data about "what you're doing right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, some type of real-time Twitter trending of topic popularity could help search engines deliver more relevant results. By pairing hot tweet topics with topical search results Bing, for example, could boost relevancy in its search results. For example, nobody cares what one individual thought of a movie last night, but if a search engine could generate an instant movie thumbs up or thumbs down based on millions of tweets that could help the movie going public find a movie to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Search for a Business Model, Can Google Help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search for some type of practical business model has been a cloud hanging over Twitter's head for some time now. Many wonder if the popular service can sustain itself without generating significant revenue. Would service outages plague Twitter if it subsisted on a shoestring budget? I suspect yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has no fully-disclosed revenue model, yet places its total valuation at about $1 billion. Huh?Meanwhile investors are dumping more money into the service. It is reported venture capitalists poured $100 million into Twitter recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flying in the face of conventional business wisdom, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone denied that the company will take on any advertising this year when speaking at 140 Twitter conference in September. He didn't comment on whether ads might appear next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter Too Big To Fail?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, Twitter has turned into a crucial business and social resource. If that is the case, does Twitter deserve a financial rescue should it be in danger of failing? Some suggest that the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay Scott, former content director at COXnet, the Internet arm of Cox Newspapers, points out that many businesses today rely heavily on Twitter and other social networks for promoting products and delivering customer service. Twitter outages carry social, political, and entertainment ramifications, according to Scott, who is now an independent social networking consultant. Twitter played a significant role in helping Iranian protesters this summer both organize and communicate with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, depending too much on a single social network has significant drawbacks. If everyone from Madison Avenue advertisers to Iranian revolutionaries become too reliant on one communication tool, what will happen to the world if Twitter never discovers a workable business model?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/173383&lt;/p&gt;

restarted a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracker at its
503,000 barrel-per-day Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery after
an unplanned shutdown late last week, traders said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several trading sources told Reuters they believe the

were not sure when it will be back at planned rates. The
refinery is the second largest in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Believe it has (restarted)," said one cash oil products
trader, seconding views from other market players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon officials were not immediately reachable for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early this week, a spokesman for the oil major declined to
comment on the reports of the outage, which traders said at the
time was caused by a leak in a feed line with the total down
time expected to be around five to seven days.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM's (IBM.N) dominance in large computer systems called mainframes may make it look like the U.S. government has an open and shut case of monopoly, but upon closer examination it appears there is more competition than critics suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the mainframes in question represent a small segment of the broader server market, where rivalry is heating up due to Oracle Corp's ORCL.O planned acquisition of Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O, as well as, network equipment giant Cisco Systems Inc's (CSCO.O) recent market entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), which urged the U.S. Justice Department to investigate International Business Machines Corp, said the vendor of technology hardware and services had a 100 percent grip in mainframe operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM does dominate when it comes to supplying mainframe systems that run on its own operating system. But analysts say competition exists in other kinds of high-end servers, which similarly process large workloads and serve as the central nervous system for ATMs and airline bookings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology research firm IDC's data shows IBM's high-end mainframe products, called System z, accounts for around 10 percent of worldwide server revenue of $53.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In overall servers, IBM had 34.5 percent market share, with HP holding around 28.5 percent share, according to IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said that since customers can switch to other mainframes or other servers, it made sense to look at the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not as though people don't have other choices or can't turn to other products to do the work," said Jeffrey Hewitt at Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDC analyst Jean Bozman said mainframe workloads can be moved to other high-end servers like Unix servers made by Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Sun, and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, however, that a switch would take time and in some cases require new software, and could be particularly difficult in the case of custom applications written specifically for IBM mainframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research said he saw little merit in the investigation, noting that mainframe was not considered a growing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a small part of a declining market and therefore I cannot possibly see any basis... that you can allege monopolistic behavior," he said. Djurdjevic owns IBM stock along with shares in competitors including HP, Dell Inc DELL.O, and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also said a weak economy and demand for efficient data center technology was leading to more mergers and acquisitions, increasing rivalry in the broad server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle's planned purchase of Sun will combine software and hardware expertise, making it a formidable competitor to IBM, which sells a combination of technology services, software and hardware to corporate and government clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like IBM and HP are also now competing with Cisco, which is the world's biggest network equipment maker and recently entered the server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LENGTHY PROCESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite analysts' doubts over whether IBM had a monopoly in mainframes, many said the case could still drag on as investigators take a close look at IBM's sales and licensing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCIA accuses IBM of withdrawing licenses for its operating systems from customers who use non-IBM hardware, retaliating against business partners deemed disloyal and stifling competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this adds a note of uncertainty for the shares and might initially result in higher legal staff expenses as the company cooperates with any inquiries by the DOJ," said Standard  Poor's Equity Research analyst Tom Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he and other analysts remain upbeat about the company's long-term prospects and doubted the investigation would weigh too much on IBM's stock.

&lt;p&gt;On the eve of Oracle Corp.'s OpenWorld user conference, IBM today unveiled a new clustering feature that it says contends will help its flagship DB2 database trump Oracle Corp.'s rival product on scalability, speed and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM says the new pureScale feature will enable companies to "scale out" their DB2 clusters without paying an enormous performance cost. IBM says Oracle's long-running Real Application Clusters (RAC) technology does significantly affect performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available in December for IBM Power 550 Express and Power 595 servers running Unix, IBM i and Linux, pureScale gives IBM a weapon to battle Oracle's heavily-hyped Exadata Database Machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an Exadata-killer, in the sense that it is much more economical and scalable," said Bernie Spang, director of product strategy for IBM's information management division, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merv Adrian, an analyst with IT Strategy, calls the pureScale announcement a "well-timed shot across the bow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle hasn't shown off many Exadata customer wins since its launch a year ago, said Adrian, in part because it had to quickly pull Hewlett-Packard Co. servers out of Exadata in favor of hardware from, Sun Microsystems Inc., which it has agreed to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The likelihood is that it will be a head-to-head battle" between Oracle and IBM, he said. "We should see some shots fired back and forth as the two firms jockey for position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM did not disclose the price of pureScale, which calls for customers to deploy Power-based servers in a cluster using high-speed Infiniband networking technology. One or two servers in the pureScale cluster serve as "traffic cops" that control the grid and make it appear as one node to all applications connected to it, said Spang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traffic cop servers are very efficient, says IBM, because of a technology called Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), which lets DB2 database servers directly query the cache memory of the pureScale traffic control servers as it were on their own motherboard, going around the pureScale server's CPU in the process, said Handy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to IBM tests, that allows 64-node pureScale-based clusters to waste less than 10% of their processing power on grid-related overhead. That increases to about 20% for 100-node clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, claims IBM, is much more efficient than Oracle's RAC technology today. First introduced in 2001, RAC remains inefficient and poor at scaling out, say critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle is expected to announce enhancements to RAC at the OpenWorld conference in San Francisco next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will also let pureScale customers who have spiky workloads, such as a lot of month-end accounting work, pay for server capacity on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Handy, it would work like this the on-demand option calls for companies to buy enough server and database licenses to satisfy their regular workload and then install some DB2 servers that would be used only sporadically. IBM would charge users upfront a small fraction of the normal cost for the hardware and licenses, and then charge the users a daily rate whenever they ran the extra DB2 databases, said Handy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

scam have been acquitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The acquittal of our employees has just been announced to
us," Freeport spokeswoman Margaret Kabamba told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two Congolese staff and Dirk Vanhooymissen, the
administrator of Freeport's huge Tenke Fungurume Mining joint
venture, were arrested in August for allegedly stealing several
million dollars in visa and work permit fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The announcement comes as officials from U.S.-based Freeport
visit Congo with the aim of negotiating a protracted dispute
over the contract governing the TFM mine project, widely
considered to be the largest and highest grade undeveloped
copper and cobalt project in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeport has a 57.75 percent stake in the Tenke mine.
Toronto-listed Lundin Mining (LUN.TO) owns 24.75 percent with
Congolese state miner Gecamines holding 17.5 percent.

&lt;p&gt;Company positioned for Microsoft`s upcoming Exchange 2010 launch 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Intermedia, the global leader in Microsoft Exchange hosting, today enhanced its
hosted Exchange 2010 beta offering - the world`s first - with two new features.
The hosted Exchange 2010 beta feature set leaves the company positioned for a
production-ready experience. 

Both new features were developed by Intermedia and are critical for
compliance-sensitive industries such as law and financial services. The new
hosted Exchange 2010 beta features include:

* Intermedia`s MessageMirror: Creates a copy of every message - incoming and
outgoing - in a separate folder, for easy staff monitoring. 
* Intermedia`s Company Disclaimer: Allows hosted Exchange account administrators
to enforce a company-wide email disclaimer policy.

The two features are already available on Intermedia`s hosted Exchange 2007
offering as well as Intermedia`s hosted Exchange 2010 beta offering. 

"Intermedia is clearly a leader in the hosted Exchange market, having been the
first hosted provider for Exchange 2007 and the first host to market with Office
Communications Server (OCS) and OCS for BlackBerry," says Michael Osterman of
industry analyst firm Osterman Research. "The company is leading the charge for
hosted Exchange 2010 and has had a working beta since May. Any small- to
mid-sized business running an earlier version of Exchange - or considering the
migration to the latest version of Exchange - should give Intermedia a very
close look." 

About Intermedia`s Hosted Exchange 2010 Beta

Because Intermedia's Exchange 2010 beta is hosted, no software downloads or
installations are necessary. The company's proprietary HostPilot control panel,
which partners and customers use to manage their Exchange accounts, supports
Exchange 2010. Unique in an industry that relies on generic control panels,
HostPilot provides business executives with a simple way to adjust common
Exchange settings - and IT administrators with a level of control comparable to
an on-premise Exchange installation. 

Intermedia`s hosted Exchange 2010 beta continues a tradition of practical
innovation. The 14-year-old company was the first to market Microsoft Exchange
2007 as a hosted service. Today, more than 200,000 premium Exchange mailboxes -
and 400,000 mailboxes overall - are under Intermedia`s management. Premium
mailboxes use Microsoft`s full MAPI license, which includes a downloadable copy
of Microsoft Outlook, the power to share calendars, and other features essential
to business. 

Exchange 2010 and its Outlook Web Access interface introduce several features
designed to enhance the user experience, such as conversation-style email
formats and full compatibility with Safari and Firefox browsers. Users can apply
to be considered for Intermedia`s invitation-only beta at
www.exchange2010beta.com. 

ABOUT INTERMEDIA

Intermedia is the leading provider of hosted Microsoft Exchange and business
email to the small- and medium-sized business market. The company specializes in

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Oct 9 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on
Friday it was assisting an antitrust investigation into
technology services company IBM (IBM.N) by the U.S. Justice
Department but had not launched a formal probe of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Department of Justice said on Wednesday it was looking
into allegations that IBM abused its dominant position in the
mainframe computer market by trying to squeeze out rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in contact with the DoJ but it is not like there is
some kind of joint investigation," Jonathan Todd, a spokesman
for the 27-country European Union's executive Commission, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. computer firm T3 Technologies Inc filed a complaint
with the European antitrust watchdog in January, accusing IBM of
abusing its power in the mainframe computer industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; T3 Technologies said IBM was preventing sales of competing

&lt;p&gt;Oct 9 (Reuters) - Raymond James began coverage on JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N) with a "strong buy", saying the bank is
poised to benefit from acquisitions, organic growth and market
share gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Additionally, it has a fortress-like balance sheet and is
expected to be one of the first banks 'out of the gates' to a
more normalized earnings level," analyst Anthony Polini wrote
in a research note dated Oct. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst, who set a price target of $60 on the stock,
said JPMorgan was one of the first banks to pay back troubled
asset relief program (TARP) money and has maintained positive
momentum throughout the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He expects earnings per share for JPMorgan, which acquired
Bear Stearns Cos and Washington Mutual Inc last year, to grow
at an annualized rate of more than 40 percent over the next
three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although credit quality is expected to deteriorate and
loss rates will likely remain high, we do not believe the
company will need to aggressively build reserves," the analyst
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every $1.0 billion added to reserves equates to about 16
cents per share in forgone earnings, the analyst said, adding
that the company added $2.0 billion to reserves in the second
quarter and $4.2 billion in the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan were up 10 cents at $45.40 in morning
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; * Further gains seen in gold after this week's record highs

 * Silver forecast for 2010 lifted nearly 18 percent

 * Base metals forecasts also raised

 


 LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) lifted its 2009
price forecasts for gold and silver on Friday and said new
record highs for gold at $1,050-1,100 were likely in early 2010.

 In a research note, the bank said it has revised its 2009
price view for gold XAU= up to $948 an ounce from $939 an
ounce predicted in July. It said it now sees silver XAG= at
$14.30 an ounce, against a previous forecast of $13.90.

 For next year, it lifted its gold and silver forecasts to
$1,006 an ounce from $950 and $15.80 an ounce from $13.40
respectively -- a rise of nearly 18 percent in silver's case.

 "Overall we are looking for gold to average around $1,000 an
ounce in the fourth quarter... but new highs between $1,050 and
$1,100 look likely for early 2010," it said.

 The bank said, however, that investors may currently be
paying too high a price for gold as an inflation hedge.

 "We do remain concerned that gold as an 'inflation trade' is
both expensive and premature," it said. "But the flows speak for
themselves, as gold has been the overwhelming beneficiary of
investment allocations to commodities all year."

 Spot gold hit record highs on three successive sessions this
week, peaking at $1,061.20 an ounce on Thursday. At 1012 GMT on
Friday it was at $1,048.10 an ounce.

 The bank also lifted its forecasts for base metals copper,
aluminium, nickel, zinc and lead for 2009 and 2010, though it
said it expects 2010 to be "a year of consolidation in the base
metals, as opposed to a year of new highs or lows in price".

  JPMorgan said it now sees copper averaging $4,998 a tonne
this year, up from a previous forecast of $4,775, and raised its
price view for aluminium to $1,647 a tonne in 2009 from $1,608.

 Next year it sees copper at $5,950, against a former view of
$5,563, and aluminium at $1,844, up from $1,775.

 "All of the base metals markets are in surpluses, not just
in 2009 but also in 2010," JPMorgan said.

 "While the expected restocking activity will deliver a
significant fillip to prices and allow a solid Q1 price recovery
relative to an expected soggy Q4 performance, we are not
confident that rallies can be sustained."

 Lead saw the largest percentage rise in forecast, however.
The bank lifted its 2009 price forecast for the battery material
by 10.7 percent to $1,658 a tonne, and its 2010 price view by
22.1 percent to $1,863 a tonne.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said higher oil prices would lead to significantly better profits from exploration and production in the third quarter than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company said on Thursday its downstream results, on the other hand, would be flat, with depressed refining margins holding broadly steady overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's U.S. oil-equivalent production in July and August rose 6 percent to 741,000 barrels per day from 700,000 a quarter before, while international output fell 24,000 bpd to 1.946 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total of nearly 2.69 million bpd is ahead of Chevron's increased 2009 output forecast of 2.66 million bpd in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half the international output decline was due to civil unrest in Nigeria, while the U.S. growth was driven by the startup of its Tahiti platform in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmark U.S. crude oil futures prices averaged $68 per barrel in the quarter, up from nearly $60 in the second quarter, but down from $118 in the same quarter a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron anticipated "unfavorable" foreign currency effects in its results, as the dollar fell by 4 percent versus a basket of currencies .DXY over the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company said upstream results would benefit from $400 million connected with project approval and sales of interests in its $37 billion Gorgon gas project in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron reports third-quarter results on October 30. Prior to Thursday's update, analysts had expected a profit of $2.7 billion, or $1.39 per share, on revenue of $46.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's up from 87 cents per share last quarter, but a far cry from the $79 billion in revenue and $3.85 per share earned by the San Ramon, California-based company in the third quarter last year, when oil futures prices hit record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOWN BY THE BAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's U.S. refinery crude-input fell 55,000 bpd, or 6 percent, mainly due to maintenance at its San Francisco Bay refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter refining margins rose on the U.S. West Coast by nearly a dollar a barrel, but fell on the Gulf Coast by about the same amount. They are squeezed across the industry as rising prices for the input, oil, are not matched by growth in demand for what refiners produce, due to economic weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival ConocoPhillips (COP.N) warned last Friday that its results would take a hit from low North American natural gas prices, though that was expected and its plans for a higher dividend and asset sales lifted its shares in the past two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares rose 0.8 percent to as high as $72 in after-hours trading Thursday, after closing 1.3 percent higher at $71.45, on a day when Conoco jumped 3.4 percent and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) rose 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's stock is down 3 percent in 2009, compared with a 14 percent rise for the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil companies .OIX, with energy production-focused rivals faring better than those in the slumping refinery business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- ProPay`s End-to-End Data Security Solution, ProtectPay, in Line with All of
VISA`s Data Field Encryption Recommendations -
LEHI, Utah--(Business Wire)--
ProPay today confirmed that its ProtectPay E2E data security solution,
commercially available since early 2009, meets or exceeds all of the best
practices for end-to-end encryption recommended in Visa`s Data Field Encryption
Best Practices, released on Monday, October 5th.
(http://corporate.visa.com/media-center/press-releases/press941.jsp). ProPay
uses advanced encryption as follows:

* Stored Data: ProtectPay securely stores the encrypted data for merchants and
provides them with unique transaction IDs or "tokens" so no card holder data is
exchanged in the clear for future transactions, such as repeat/recurring billing
or refunds, against the stored data. 
* Face-to-Face: ProtectPay eliminates the need for merchants to process or
transmit card data in the clear by providing a swipe device (MicroSecure Card
Reader) that utilizes robust encryption and key management technology 
* Card-Not-Present: ProtectPay removes the need for merchants to touch card data
by utilizing a secure online Virtual Terminal, IVR phone system, email invoice,
and interfaces for eCommerce sites and Call Centers.

By removing the data from the Merchants` systems, ProtectPay reduces and may
even eliminate the risks merchants face around sensitive payment data
compromises. 

ProPay began using its ProtectPay E2E services in its own production environment
in mid 2008 and deployed the services commercially in February of 2009. ProPay
has several thousand merchants ranging from multi-billion-dollar companies to
small businesses using aspects of ProtectPay to remove card data from their
systems and process card data securely. 

VISA Best Practices

VISA describes its new document as an effort to "further the payment industry's
efforts to develop a common, open standard while providing guidance to
encryption vendors and early adopters." VISA goes on to note that data field
encryption protects card information from the swipe to the acquirer processor
with no need for the merchant to process or transmit card data in the "clear." 

"We wholeheartedly support VISA`s recommendations and we are extremely pleased
that our ProtectPay solution meets or exceeds them," said Gary Goodrich, ProPay
CEO. "For ProPay, E2E security is more than a marketing claim, and our position
is further validated by VISA`s recommendations. While some service providers are
claiming E2E data protection or simply talking about their future ideas, ProPay
is successfully delivering full commercial solutions today." 

"ProPay`s commitment to security is allowing them to fulfill a leadership
position that is helping to drive the payments industry forward," said noted PCI
Expert and founder of the Society of Payment Security Professionals, Chris Mark.
"Their ability to meet or exceed VISA`s recommended Best Practices before the
report was issued truly underscores their commitment to full security and is
fundamental to ProPay and its product and service offerings. ProPay's offerings
richly compliment PCI compliance and provide security for merchants and other
companies involved in the payments industry."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration`s (FDA) Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee voted (10 to 4) to
recommend the approval of Selzentry&#174; (maraviroc) tablets for use in
treatment-na&#239;ve adult patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus as part of
combination therapy. 

"Pfizer is pleased that the Committee has recognized the effectiveness and
safety profile of maraviroc in patients who are starting HIV therapy," said Dr.
Howard Mayer, Pfizer`s executive director and disease area leader, antivirals.
"Today`s discussion marks an important step in expanding available treatment
options for patients with HIV infection and we look forward to working with the
FDA to further address the points raised by the panel." 

Selzentry was granted accelerated approval in August 2007 and full approval in
November 2008 by the FDA for use in treatment-experienced adult patients with
only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus in combination with other antiretroviral therapies.
Selzentry is an oral medicine that blocks viral entry to human cells. Rather
than fighting HIV inside white blood cells, Selzentry prevents the virus from
entering uninfected cells by blocking its predominant entry route, the CCR5
co-receptor. 

In making its decision, the Advisory Committee reviewed 48- and 96-week efficacy
and safety data from the ongoing Phase 3 MERIT (Maraviroc versus Efavirenz
Regimens as Initial Therapy) trial and MERIT ES (analysis of the MERIT study
with the enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay). 

Results of MERIT at 48-weeks showed that Selzentry plus Combivir&#174;
(zidovudine/lamivudine) was as effective as Sustiva&#174; (efavirenz) plus
zidovudine/lamivudine at reducing viral load for the co-primary endpoint of &lt;400
copies/mL, but did not show non-inferiority for the co-primary endpoint of &lt;50
copies/mL at 48-weeks. Safety results at 96-weeks showed that among those
patients who remained on therapy, less than half the number of malignancies were
observed in patients taking Selzentry compared to those taking efavirenz.
Additionally, no new safety signals were identified in association with
Selzentry at 96-weeks. The most frequently reported adverse events were nausea,
headache, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, and
vomiting. Patients were screened into the study using the original Trofile assay
which is no longer available. 

MERIT ES is a retrospective analysis, which utilized the enhanced sensitivity
Trofile assay in screening samples from the MERIT trial. Results of MERIT ES at
48-weeks showed that treatment-na&#239;ve patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 taking
Selzentry plus zidovudine/lamivudine experienced comparable virologic
suppression to undetectable levels (&lt;50 copies/mL) to those taking efavirenz
plus zidovudine/lamivudine. The enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay used in the
MERIT ES analysis has been the only available version of the Trofile assay since
June 2008. 

The FDA often seeks the advice of its Advisory Committees when evaluating
potential treatments, but is not required to follow its recommendation. Through
the joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline, which is expected to close in the fourth
quarter of 2009, Pfizer remains committed to the expansion of
Selzentry/Celsentri`s current indications to include appropriate treatment-na&#239;ve
populations throughout the world. 

At the end of 2006, an estimated 1.1 million people in the U.S. were living with
HIV infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates
that in 2006 approximately 56,300 people were newly infected with HIV in the
U.S. (the most recent year that data are available). 

About Selzentry

Selzentry has been approved for use in treatment-experienced adult patients with
only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus detectable in combination with other antiretroviral
therapies, in several other markets around the world including the U.S., Canada
and the European Union. 

Maraviroc is marketed under the trade name Selzentry&#174; in the U.S. and Celsentri&#174;
in all other countries in which it is approved.

risks and uncertainties about (i) a potential additional indication for
Selzentry/Celsentri, including its potential benefits, that is under review by

Evaluation Agency (EMEA), and (ii) the closing of an agreement with
GlaxoSmithKline to create a joint venture company. Such risks and uncertainties

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney will celebrate "Opposite Day." The studio is developing a high-concept comedy with that title and has hired "Nancy Drew" scribe Tiffany Paulsen to write it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Opposite," based on an idea by studio production president Oren Aviv, centers on a corporate hatchet man who wakes up one morning and finds he must follow the exact opposite of his normal routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulsen wrote 2007's "Drew," an adaptation of the classic children's detective series for Warners. She also is attached to write "Further Adventures in Babysitting," Disney's reboot of the 1980s teen hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aviv has conceived of a number of movie ideas that became hit Disney projects, including the adventure franchise "National Treasure," for which he received a story credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's Oil Ministry is considering revised offers from Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Lukoil (LKOH.MM) for West Qurna, one of several oilfields for which Iraq failed to secure a developer in a June auction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auction was the centerpiece of Iraq's efforts to revive its lucrative but crumbling oil sector, battered by years of war and sanctions. Of eight fields offered, only one deal was signed after firms balked at the Oil Ministry's stiff payment terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Iraqi Oil Ministry is studying new offers from Exxon Mobil and Lukoil for West Qurna phase 1," Abdul-Mahdy al-Ameedi, deputy director of the ministry's contracts and licensing directorate, told Reuters on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq also expects an offer from France's Total (TOTF.PA) for West Qurna, and says it has received another bid from Italy's ENI (ENI.MI) for Zubair, which also went unawarded in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Qurna phase 1 has reserves of 8.7 billion barrels while Zubair's reserves are estimated at 4 billion barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had talks with ENI on Zubair (and) ENI has submitted a new offer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether Iraq had sweetened the original contracts to lure back bidders. The country relies on oil sales for almost all its income and desperately needs to boost revenues to rebuild its dilapidated infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only long-term service contract awarded in June went to Britain's BP (BP.L) and China's CNPC, who agreed to a remuneration fee of $2 per barrel to develop super-giant field Rumaila.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRAQ TO REAP $100 BLN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ameedi said that Exxon and Lukoil had agreed to a remuneration fee of $1.90 per barrel for West Qurna, but that negotiations over other terms were ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq aims to offer another 10 oilfields to oil majors in December, and has said the signature fee for those contracts -- a payment to secure the right to develop the block -- would be less than the $500 million charged for Rumaila, although, unlike the Rumaila terms, the money would not be returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq expects to make a final decision on the revised West Qurna and Zubair bids next month, Ameedi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is also expected to make a new offer for Zubair, he said, but would first wait to see the results of its Qurna bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment in Iraq's oil sector has been dogged by a lack of updated hydrocarbon laws, whose passage has been hampered by a spat between Baghdad and Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region over the right to sign oil deals and a host of other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The row is seen as more likely to scare off smaller firms from investing in Iraq rather than the oil majors the government has invited to bid in its contract auctions [ID:nLB40655].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said that foreign firms' investment in West Qurna phase 1, Zubair and Rumaila would bring Iraq $100 billion, according to an Oil Ministry spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minister also forecast that three fields' combined output would reach 7 million barrels a day in six years, the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mohammed Abbas and Missy Ryan; Editing by Jack Kimball and Simon Jessop)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds background, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ahmed Rasheed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BAGHDAD, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Iraq's Oil Ministry is
considering revised offers from Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Lukoil
(LKOH.MM) for West Qurna, one of several oilfields for which
Iraq failed to secure a developer in a June auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The auction was the centrepiece of Iraq's efforts to revive
its lucrative but crumbling oil sector, battered by years of war
and sanctions. Of eight fields offered, only one deal was signed
after firms balked at the Oil Ministry's stiff payment terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Iraqi Oil Ministry is studying new offers from Exxon
Mobil and Lukoil for West Qurna phase 1," Abdul-Mahdy al-Ameedi,
deputy director of the ministry's contracts and licensing
directorate, told Reuters on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iraq also expects an offer from France's Total (TOTF.PA) for
West Qurna, and says it has received another bid from Italy's
ENI (ENI.MI) for Zubair, which also went unawarded in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; West Qurna phase 1 has reserves of 8.7 billion barrels while
Zubair's reserves are estimated at 4 billion barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a Factbox on the oil and gas fields offered in the June
auction, click: [ID:nLM718284]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have had talks with ENI on Zubair (and) ENI has
submitted a new offer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was unclear whether Iraq had sweetened the original
contracts to lure back bidders. The country relies on oil sales
for almost all its income and desperately needs to boost
revenues to rebuild its dilapidated infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only long-term service contract awarded in June went to
Britain's BP (BP.L) and China's CNPC, who agreed to a
remuneration fee of $2 per barrel to develop super-giant field
Rumaila. For further details of the Rumaila contract, click
[ID:nL6265378]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IRAQ TO REAP $100 BLN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ameedi said that Exxon and Lukoil had agreed to a
remuneration fee of $1.90 per barrel for West Qurna, but that
negotiations over other terms were ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iraq aims to offer another 10 oilfields to oil majors in
December, and has said the signature fee for those contracts --
a payment to secure the right to develop the block -- would be
less than the $500 million charged for Rumaila, although, unlike
the Rumaila terms, the money would not be returned.
[ID:nL6265378]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iraq expects to make a final decision on the revised West
Qurna and Zubair bids next month, Ameedi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon is also expected to make a new offer for Zubair, he
said, but would first wait to see the results of its Qurna bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment in Iraq's oil sector has been dogged by a lack of
updated hydrocarbon laws, whose passage has been hampered by a
spat between Baghdad and Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region
over the right to sign oil deals and a host of other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The row is seen as more likely to scare off smaller firms
from investing in Iraq rather than the oil majors the government
has invited to bid in its contract auctions [ID:nLB40655].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said that foreign firms'
investment in West Qurna phase 1, Zubair and Rumaila would bring
Iraq $100 billion, according to an Oil Ministry spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The minister also forecast that three fields' combined
output would reach 7 million barrels a day in six years, the
spokesman said.

&lt;p&gt;Contacts, calendar entries, photographs and other personal information of Sidekick users has almost certainly been lost for good following a service disruption at Sidekick provider Danger, the Microsoft subsidiary said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of data and number of users affected wasn't disclosed by Microsoft or T-Mobile, but the Sidekick support forums are buzzing with pleas from users looking for tips on how to restore their devices or get their data back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Microsoft said any data that users had on their devices and is no longer there has almost certainly been permanently lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That said, our teams continue to work around-the-clock in hopes of discovering some way to recover this information. However, the likelihood of a successful outcome is extremely low," T-Mobile said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problems have been going on since earlier this week and have been compounded by users who attempted to reset their devices to restore functionality. The reset clears the Sidekick of stored data -- data which is usually backed to the Danger servers but has now been lost from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to advise customers to NOT reset their device by removing the battery or letting their battery drain completely, as any personal content that currently resides on your device will be lost," T-Mobile said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile and Microsoft said they would provide an update on data recovery efforts on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service failure is an embarrassment for Microsoft and T-Mobile and again highlights the potential danger of entrusting trusting personal data to the cloud, a model that many service providers are pushing as a safe and more convenient way to handle data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlucky T-Mobile Sidekick owners lost their contacts, calendar entries, to-do lists and photos this weekend when Microsoft subsidiary Danger suffered a technical glitch. Not all T-Mobile Sidekick owners were impacted, and the actual extent of the data loss is unclear. However, those affected have little hope of recovering lost data, according the Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile said that the loss is a result of a server failure at Microsoft, who acquired startup company Danger in February 2008. Danger operates the cloud computing service that stores the information for T-Mobile Sidekick customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are over one million Sidekick users. It is approximated that thousands of Sidekick customers could have lost their personal data, according to sources. Microsoft is reportedly working on a fix for the problem, and will try to get the Sidekick devices that still have personal data on them to sync back to the servers. Microsoft and T-Mobile said that users who reset their Sidekick by removing the battery or draining it fully are most at risk of losing their data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad News For Windows Mobile?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft stresses that it wasn't its own technology to blame in the Sidekick data loss, but rather Danger's technology, which the Redmond company inherited when it acquired Danger in 2008 for $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the embarrassment for Microsoft comes as there is no apparent backup of Sidekick users' data, according to a report from HipTop3. It is also unclear whether Microsoft will be able to recover any of the lost customers' data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bu the unfortunate coincidence is Microsoft's launch of Windows Mobile 6.5 devices last week, which in association with this weekend's Sidekick data loss could translate into reduced customer trust from potential Windows Phone buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/173470&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Friday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Trade Deficit Improves

While the year-over-year improvement in the trade deficit is very good news, the
reason for it is not so good. It was a reflection of the overall collapse in
world trade, something that makes everyone poorer. As far as the GDP
calculations are concerned, it does not make any difference -- a decline in the
trade deficit is a decline in the trade deficit -- and it is something that
feeds directly into the calculations. 

However, it is not like there has been a big surge in people buying domestically
produced Fords (NYSE: F) rather than foreign produced Hondas (NYSE: HMC).
Rather, the fall in imports has been simply fewer people buying cars, period.
Currently, for every dollar of goods and services we export, we import $1.24 --
down from $1.38 a year ago, but still way out of whack. 

It was not until the price of oil crashed last fall that we started to see real
improvement in the overall deficit. Now that benefit is largely gone. While the
price of imported oil has a bit of a lag with the prices in the pits, there is
clearly a relationship. The price of imported oil bottomed in February at $39.22
and was $64.75 in August. It will most likely go up again in September. 

It is somewhat ironic that the most dramatic part of the improvement in the
trade deficit came as the dollar dramatically strengthened a year ago in the
flight-to-safety trade. The path of the trade deficit has not yet been greatly
affected by the path of the dollar, for two major reasons. 

First, a very large part (over half) of our trade deficit is due to oil imports,
and when the dollar is weak, the price of oil tends to go up to compensate.
Second, our biggest single deficit is with China, which has effectively pegged
the Yuan to the dollar. In August, the China deficit fell to $20.2 billion from
$20.4 billion, but still represented 65.1% of the total deficit. Put another
way: in August, our deficit with China was more than our deficits with OPEC, The
European Union, Japan and Mexico...combined! 

The flight-to-safety dollar trade is now unwinding, and the greenback is almost
back to the levels it was at before the fall of the House of Lehman. Over time,
this should lead to further improvements in our non-oil trade deficit -- if not
with China, then with the rest of the world. It might even indirectly help with
the Chinese deficit even though the value of the Yuan is effectively fixed to
the price of the dollar. 

This would happen at the expense of the Japanese or the Europeans, as the
Chinese decide to buy their heavy earth-moving equipment from Caterpillar (NYSE:
CAT) rather than from Komatsu, or airplanes from Boeing (NYSE: BA) rather than
Airbus. 

Chevron`s Positive Upstream Update

Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) released its third-quarter interim update, covering
the first two months of the quarter. On the whole, the update is positive, with
earnings expected to be higher than in the previous quarter. 

The company expects the upstream segment to benefit from an increase in crude
oil prices as well as from gains of about $400 million associated with asset
sales and tax items. Downstream results are likely to be relatively flat, as it
continues to be hurt by weak refining margins. Chevron further said that
unfavorable foreign currency movements will affect the segment profitability. 

The best part of the update pertained to upstream volumes, highlighting
Chevron`s attractive growth profile among the super-majors. The company reported
that oil and natural gas production average 2.687 million oil-equivalent barrels
per day - better than estimates and nearly 10% above the third-quarter 2008
level. Compared to the second quarter of 2009, production would be up by about a
percentage.

&lt;p&gt;Sidekick users have blasted Microsoft in thousands of messages on T-Mobile USA's support forum over the server failure that lost their smartphones' data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some users said that they would ditch their phones, while others called for a class-action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Microsoft announced that users' data stored on its servers " almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft/Danger," referring to Danger Inc., the Microsoft subsidiary that provides data services for Sidekick phones sold by T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile said that it would credit users' accounts one month's worth of the data service, and offered an FAQ with tips on rebuilding their contact lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That didn't mollify most users posting messages on T-Mobile's support forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to be reimbursed for my data or a free upgrade, but if they don't say anything, new iPhone here I come," said a user identified as "kangchaehee" on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Say goodbye to the Sidekick," added another user, "ttc7152" on the same thread, which boasted more than 3,600 messages as of mid-day today. "And Microsoft can write off any plans to even think of competing with iPhone/Android. Losing data on this scale is unprecedented -- and totally inexcusable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others wanted users to initiate a class-action lawsuit against T-Mobile or Microsoft, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just spoke to a lawyer and explain[ed] the entire situation," said a user tagged as "Calsmail" last Thursday. "He informed me he would be happy to start a class-action suit against T-Mobile. He said he could not only get us out of our contracts but can more than likely get $50 per contact lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint message from T-Mobile and Microsoft posted on the former's support forum Saturday, the two companies said that although engineers were working on the problem, "the likelihood of a successful outcome is extremely low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message also warned users not to reset their Sidekicks by removing the battery or letting the battery drain completely, or "any personal content that currently resides on your device will be lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile and Microsoft promised to update users later today on the progress, if any, that's been made in recovering the lost data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

up to 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One Equity said in a statement it would make an offer for
the remaining stake at 38.67 euros per share, a slight premium
to Monday's closing price of 37.79 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Constantia B.V. has been trying to use its stake in
Constantia Packaging, worth just under 420 million euros ($618
million) at Monday's closing share price, to settle a financial
claim that Austrian real estate group Immoeast IMEA.VI has
against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Constantia BV said earlier this month that it had offered
to pay Immoeast 164 million euros in cash and hand over assets
of more than 200 million euros to settle the claim.

&lt;p&gt;Landmark Deal Signifies Growing Confidence in a U.S. Regulated Carbon Market
NEW YORK &amp; SALT LAKE CITY &amp; SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS), Blue Source, and CE2 Carbon Capital
today announced a $12 million U.S. carbon offset transaction. This is the
largest publicly announced U.S. offset transaction to date and signifies
confidence in the role carbon offsets will play in a U.S. regulated carbon
market. 

The transaction involves offsets originating from Blue Source`s portfolio of
emission reduction projects. The offsets are generated from U.S. based projects
including forestry, landfill gas and coal mine methane. These projects meet the
rigorous quality standards of the Climate Action Reserve and Voluntary Carbon
Standard. Included in the transaction is the Alligator River Forestry Project in
North Carolina, the first forestry project located outside the state of
California to be listed by the Climate Action Reserve. 

Goldman Sachs and Blue Source have a strategic alliance in which Blue Source
develops and manages projects that generate carbon offsets and Goldman Sachs
off-takes, structures and markets the Blue Source offsets. Through the strategic
alliance, the companies provide carbon offset products to a broad range of
buyers in the North American market. 

CE2 Carbon Capital is one of the largest investors and owners of carbon
commodities and carbon emission reduction projects in the U.S. The transaction
underscores CE2 Carbon Capital`s continued focus on investments in environmental
markets. 

"This transaction is an important addition to our expanding portfolio of carbon
commodities and projects under ownership and in development," said Greg Arnold,
President of CE2 Carbon Capital. "This transaction also expands the U.S. carbon
offset market by better defining transaction structure and value, enabling
capital to flow more freely." 

"We are pleased to be involved in this landmark transaction and drive activity
within the U.S. carbon economy," said Greg Spencer, President of Blue Source.
"This is a continuing signal both to offset purchasers and potential project
owners that capital is moving, and there is a high degree of confidence that
investment returns can be achieved today." 

The transaction creates environmental and economic benefits as the U.S. works
toward achieving emission reductions through state, regional and federal
cap-and-trade programs.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background, updates share price movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 12 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse upgraded credit card
giants Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) to "outperform"
from "neutral," saying improvement in spending volumes should
translate into improving revenue growth at the two firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of both Visa and MasterCard rose about 2 percent
before the bell Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a global economic downturn, the "secular shift from
cash to plastic continues," and this combined with improvement
in spending could lead to higher multiples for the stocks,
analysts at the brokerage said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Debit is a key advantage for the networks at Visa and
MasterCard and the lack of a debit card business is a key
competitive disadvantage for the American Express (AXP.N)
network and should contribute to a lower relative valuation for
it over time," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts added that debit will likely be source of a
significant growth in the coming years as availability of
consumer credit has declined, and this decline could continue
into 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect that over the longer-term, credit and debit card
volume growth will continue to grow several percentage points
per year faster than global gross domestic product as plastic
continues to take share of global payments from cash and
checks," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's larger debit business puts it at a slightly
competitive advantage over MasterCard, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Overall, we believe that Visa's dominant position gives it
financial advantages in terms of generating higher margins and
a sustainable growth rate," they said. "We expect Visa to
maintain a 200 basis points advantage on marketing ratio over
MasterCard."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts added that they expect both Visa and
MasterCard to continue to look for areas to raise fees, similar
to the currency conversion fee initiated in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They raised their price target on Visa stock by 20 percent
to $84, and on MasterCard stock by 21 percent to $255.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    BUY CREDIT CARD COS :FBR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, FBR Capital Markets said a recent weakness in
the stocks of credit card issuers presents a buying
opportunity, and added that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
(FDIC) is unlikely to alter the safe harbor status on these
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any change in the safe harbor policy would result in lower
credit card receivables securitization activity, causing
reduced availability of consumer credit, contrary to the intent
of both the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury, analysts at
FBR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The uncertainty over whether the FDIC will continue to
grant safe harbor status to the securitizations of banks in
receivership, as new accounting rules go into effect, may spur
negative rating actions on top-rated credit card securities,
Moody's warned in a report in September. [ID:nN30538667]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The American Securitization Forum, a leading financial
industry group, submitted a proposal to the FDIC in late
September, on behalf of market participants to address those
concerns as new accounting rules get set to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If this issue remains an overhang on shares of credit card
issuers, we would urge investors to take advantage of weakness
to build or add to positions," FBR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa shares were trading at $74.30 before the bell Monday.
They closed at $72.94 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard shares were trading at $218. They closed at
$214.42 Friday.

&lt;p&gt;Spanish Bank Migrates its Lotus and SAP Applications to Red Hat Enterprise Linux
on IBM System z
RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), the world`s leading provider of open source solutions, and
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Banco Pastor, the seventh largest Spanish
banking group with 650 branch offices in Spain and a presence in the US and the
main capital cities in Europe and Latin America, has migrated its critical human
resources and corporate emailing systems running SAP NetWeaver and SAP ERP and
IBM Lotus Notes for Collaboration software to Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Through
a combination of Red Hat Enterprise Linux on IBM System z10, Banco Pastor has
experienced decreased annual IT costs of 30 percent for the platform supporting
its emailing system, improved performance and increased scalability for the
platforms running its SAP and IBM Lotus Notes applications. 

By the end of 2008, Banco Pastor looked to update its human resources management
system and opted for SAP solutions for its payroll, career and training systems.
Banco Pastor desired a new operating platform that would help it to scale with
growth, reduce costs and provide flexibility for the infrastructure supporting
those applications. The bank's email system, based on IBM Lotus Notes, also
needed an updated operating platform base to provide the reliability, security
and efficiency needed to serve its professional workforce, as well as the
critical internal applications that rely on the platform. Banco Pastor`s
selection of Red Hat Enterprise Linux on IBM System z10 reflects its confidence
in one of the world`s most sophisticated business servers, with the equivalent
computing capacity of nearly 1,500 x86 servers with an 85 percent smaller
footprint and up to 85 percent lower energy costs. 

Having previously utilized Red Hat Enterprise Linux on distributed platforms,
Banco Pastor was familiar with Red Hat's technology, its support and ability to
deliver reliable, secure, enterprise-class solutions with reduced costs. This
experience, coupled with Red Hat's close relationship with IBM and SAP, prompted
Banco Pastor to select Red Hat Enterprise Linux for its critical SAP systems and
Lotus applications. Today, Banco Pastor's SAP and Lotus infrastructure is based
on two IBM System z10 Business Class Mainframes running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
5. 

"Our consolidation project and upgrade to the SAP system is a critical component
of our business strategy and we needed to ensure that we selected the optimal
operating platform and hardware for immediate results and future scalability. We
valued the close integration with Red Hat, SAP and IBM and with Red Hat's
service and technical support, we knew we made the right decision. The
performance of our Red Hat systems has matched our expectations as well," said
Montserrat Torres, computer systems manager at Banco Pastor. 

The combination of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, IBM System z and SAP applications
has provided Banco Pastor with a significant reduction in annual IT costs, a
strengthened ability to scale with continued business and IT platform growth and
the ability to manage resources easily and with optimal performance. 

"With our Red Hat solution, we have achieved annual cost savings of up to 30
percent in recurring expenses. But more importantly, Red Hat Enterprise Linux on
IBM System z has enabled our IT team to plan the resources required to manage
the SAP system in a dynamic way, without having to increase the number of
machines, and consequently to reduce the complexity of the platform and control
the management costs," said Torres. "Red Hat provides proven enterprise-class
solutions at an affordable price. We make our IT decisions with our business,
the required performance and the associated operating costs in mind. In that
sense, running SAP and Lotus Notes applications on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
delivers maximum value to our business." 

"Through the server consolidation benefits of Red Hat Enterprise Linux on IBM
System z10 Business Class, customers like Banco Pastor can invest in innovative
solutions that deliver important cost reductions and improve their services and
security," said Carlos Rold&#225;n, IBM System z manager in Spain, Portugal, Greece
and Israel. "The proven performance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux on System z
allows Banco Pastor to increase their response capability and the availability
of their business applications."

"In some way or another, I have always loved trains."-Walt Disney
KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(Business Wire)--

as he celebrated the unveiling of a traveling art exhibit that pays homage to
Walt`s lifelong love of trains. He also unveiled the latest Mickey
Mouse-inspired toy train set, Mickey`s Magic Choo Choo, releasing in time for

The Art Exhibit

The exhibit captures the history of Walt`s and Mickey`s love of trains with a
nod to life on the railroad in the early 20th century. Introducing visitors to
rare animation art, historic photography and some of Walt`s personal
train-related artifacts, the gallery tells the story of a simpler time when
Mickey and friends traveled by rail and Walt himself was building one-of-a-kind
miniature railroads in his backyard for friends and family. Including
photographs of Walt riding the "Lilly Belle" or Mickey rushing to catch a train
in an early animation sketch from Mr. Mouse Takes A Trip, this unique art
collection comprised of nearly two dozen pieces, will be on display at Union
Station from October 10-11, 2009; select images will then move to the Travel
Town Railroad Museum in Los Angeles, Calif. 

Mickey Mouse`s Virtual Train Tour

Mickey Mouse`s virtual train tour will take him from Kansas City through the
Rocky Mountains, to the Grand Canyon, through Hollywood , and finally, to Los
Angeles` Union Station, where he will arrive to Travel Town Railroad Museum in
time for a viewing party with local preschoolers to celebrate the premiere of,
Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Choo Choo Express. The train-themed special which debuts
Sunday, October 25 (7:00-7:45 p.m., ET/PT) on Disney Channel, stars Mickey
Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Donald, Daisy and Pluto as they climb aboard the
Clubhouse Choo Choo train for a snow-filled adventure. 

Mickey`s Magic Choo Choo toy train set

The latest toy celebrating the company`s rich train history, Mickey`s Magic Choo
Choo is a delightful train set for preschoolers from Disney Consumer Products
(DCP) and Fisher Price. It lays its own tracks as it moves and comes with a
Mickey figure, features Mickey`s voice, plays fun music and makes train-like
sound effects (SRP $49.99, available at Disney Store, www.DisneyStore.com and
retailers nationwide). The toy is inspired by Disney`s 1929 animated short,
Mickey`s Choo Choo, as well as the forthcoming primetime episode on Disney
Channel's #1 Playhouse Disney preschool series Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. 

Holiday Giving

Representatives from the United States Marines will be on hand at Mickey`s
farewell in Kansas City`s Union Station and at his arrival to the Travel Town
Museum event in Los Angeles to help Mickey kick off Disney`s annual Toys for
Tots campaign as guests collect and sort toys for distribution to needy families
this holiday season. Additionally, DCP`s Disney Toys will contribute $10,000
worth of toys to Toys for Tots bringing smiles to thousands of families across
the country. Walt Disney`s involvement with Toys for Tots dates back to 1947,
when he designed the original Toys for Tots logo, a train on its way to deliver
gifts for children.

featuring Mickey Mouse. The pump-style handcar was an instant success. It came
with a circle track and was priced at 90 cents. 
* June 1949 - The Disney family purchases the five acre hilltop property on
Carolwood Dr.

television series, and appears on thousands of items of merchandise. He inspired
the world's most famous Theme Parks and continues to fulfill his role as the
muse for everything Disney.

&lt;p&gt;SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(Business Wire)--
Market research firm, In-Stat (www.instat.com), believes we are entering a very
critical time for smartphone OSs, as exemplified by four major smartphone
announcements on October 6 from AT, Verizon Wireless, Palm, and Microsoft. 

"With Android on the upswing, Palm`s Web OS starting to expand, and Apple`s
iPhone not showing signs of slowing down, the battleground, and subsequent
weeding-out phase of the smartphone OS war has started," according to In-Stat
analyst, Allen Nogee. 

AT announced that it would now allow VoIP applications that run over its
cellular network to be installed on iPhones. In-Stat believes AT has been
watching the FCC become more serious about network neutrality in the mobile
space; it may be only a matter of time before AT would be forced to allow
these applications anyway. Currently, many high-voice usage customers are
business customers. These subscribers likely won`t switch to VoIP in the
near-term as their business pays for their service. Still, the AT announcement
will have long-term implications for the current US cell phone billing model. If
AT and other operators can`t charge high prices for voice, they will likely
make it up by raising prices for data. 

Verizon announced that it was adopting phones with Android and allow the Google
Voice application on its phones. In-Stat assesses that Verizon has given up on
prospect of selling the iPhone anytime soon, and it`s likely that AT and Apple
will extend their exclusive iPhone agreement at least another year. Verizon,
looking toward LTE, needs to get its ducks in a row not next year but now. 

Microsoft announced that Windows Mobile 6.5 was finally ready. Microsoft has
been slowly bleeding market share over the years. Windows Mobile 6.5 is
Microsoft`s best hope of slowing the defectors. Is it too little too late? While
users may wait for a Microsoft for a PC OS update, In-Stat believes this is not
the case in mobile. Even for a giant like Microsoft, it will be difficult to
rebound as the smartphone OS market heats up. 

Palm announced that it was opening up the Web OS doors to its developer program,
with developers getting a 70% cut of profits similar to the Apple model. In
contrast to Apple or Google, Palm promises minimal oversight or rejection of
legitimate applications. Palm will provide the developer with a link in return
for submissions, so that users can install the application on their phone. 

Let the battle begin and the best smartphone OSs emerge. The fight will not be
pretty.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Fox's "Family Guy" special will air November 8 with an exclusive Microsoft sponsorship, the network announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The half-hour show, whose working title is "Family Guy Presents: Seth  Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show," will air at 8:30 p.m. and star series creator Seth MacFarlane and his co-star Alex Borstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special will air without traditional commercials and instead will feature Microsoft-branded programing that Fox said will blend with the show's content.

&lt;p&gt;Adobe issued a security update today that patched 29 vulnerabilities in its popular PDF viewing and editing applications, most of them bugs that attackers can use to grab control of personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update, Adobe's second since it announced that it would patch Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat quarterly -- and on the same day that Microsoft delivers its monthly security updates -- fixed one flaw that hackers have already been using in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These vulnerabilities could cause the application to crash and could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system," Adobe acknowledged in the advisory that accompanied the updates to versions 9.2, 8.1.7 and 7.1.4 of both Reader and Acrobat. "Updates apply to all platforms: Windows, Macintosh and UNIX," the advisory added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe tagged 13 of the 29 bugs with the phrase "could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution," security-speak for vulnerabilities that could be exploited to hijack a system. Like Apple, but unlike Microsoft, Oracle and other large software vendors, Adobe does not apply a rating system to the flaws it fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four of the bugs may be exploitable, Adobe confirmed, saying that for the quartet, "arbitrary code execution has not been demonstrated, but may be possible." Many of the rest could be used to crash Reader or Acrobat, but were not likely to lead to a compromised computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Adobe confirmed that one of the vulnerabilities patched today was being exploited using rigged PDF files in "limited targeted attacks," and promised then that it would fix the flaw today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, several security vendors, including Trend Micro and Sophos , reported that they had captured samples of the malformed PDFs. Trend Micro's analysis noted that the malicious PDF includes embedded JavaScript that utilizes "heap spraying" to compromise the machine, then extracts an also-embedded backdoor Trojan which is planted on the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backdoor Trojan, dubbed "Protux" by Trend Micro, is no malware newcomer; it's been the payload for attacks that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Office suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in the Adobe patch mix today were fixes for the Reader plug-ins used by Mozilla's Firefox, Google's Chrome and Opera Software's Opera browsers. While the Firefox plug-in bug was considered critical, the one in the plug-in used by Chrome and Opera was less serious, although it could be used by identity thieves to hoodwink users into believing they were at a legitimate Web site when they actually had been shunted to a phony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe has struggled this year to keep up with a rising tide of Reader and Acrobat vulnerabilities. In March, the company quashed a PDF bug that attackers had been using for more than two months , patched Reader and Acrobat again in May to block another zero-day and fixed a Flash-related PDF flaw in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's update was the fourth this year that plugged a hole already being used by hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft patched more vulnerabilities today (34) than did Adobe, at least one researcher pegged the latter as the company that needs to step up its security game. "The lower-hanging fruit isn't Microsoft, it's Adobe," said Wolfgang Kandek, chief technology officer at security vendor Qualys. "They seem to be getting a decent amount of attacks against their software."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe has made moves to improve its security bottom line, the biggest being a promise in June to follow Microsoft's lead and release regular security updates for Reader and Acrobat. Originally, Adobe intended to post its second quarterly update last month, but a scramble during July to fix several flaws, including some introduced by Microsoft in a code "library" used by Adobe developers, ruined that plan. It announced more than a month ago that it would instead push the patch date into October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat 9.2, 8.1.7 and 7.1.4 for Windows, Mac and Linux can be downloaded from Adobe's Web site using the links included in today's advisory . Alternately, users can use the programs' built-in update mechanism to grab the new versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The number of airplanes smuggling cocaine through Honduras has surged since the United States suspended drug cooperation in the wake of an army coup, the Central American country's drugs chief said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honduras has been internationally isolated since soldiers exiled President Manuel Zelaya at gunpoint on June 28, and it lost $16.5 million of U.S. military aid after the putsch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs chief Julian Aristides said Honduras' de facto government, engulfed in a serious political crisis, had no clear anti-drugs strategy, although he added that Zelaya's government had also not fought trafficking well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last month alone, authorities have found 10 planes abandoned on runways and remote highways. Aristides, a former army general, said there were just four such cases last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are the facts, the flights have intensified," he told Reuters in his modest office in the Honduran capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase could undermine the anti-drugs fight in Mexico, where President Felipe Calderon has sent thousands of troops to try to weaken powerful drug cartels and quell turf wars that have killed more than 14,000 people since late 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sparsely populated Honduras has little radar coverage and traffickers with night vision goggles fly small planes under the cover of darkness to load the drugs into trucks or boats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. agencies are still sharing intelligence with Honduran officials, but can no longer participate in operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the coup, the United States loaned helicopters to Honduras' under-equipped air force and provided the navy with fuel and logistics for advanced interception boats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the substitution of the president this has been suspended, we don't have the support that was so important given our lack of technology," Aristides said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEADED TO U.S. ADDICTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central America is a major trafficking route for cocaine taken by Colombian and Mexican traffickers to the United States, and regional governments are struggling to fight the smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guatemala is facing a budget squeeze because of the global economic slowdown, leaving it less money for its anti-drugs plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some Latin American leaders want U.S. President Barack Obama to take tougher measures against Honduras' de facto government, critics at home complain he has already done too much to support the leftist Zelaya and that the cut in aid threatens U.S. security interests by easing the pressure on drug gangs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all the planes found in Honduras recently were painted with Venezuelan registrations, and the pilots are usually Colombian, Aristides said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is the population of the United States that will suffer, because the more drugs that arrive in Honduras, the more drugs can arrive in the United States," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations says the Venezuelan coast is being used by drug cartels to traffic cocaine via Honduras, and anti-narcotics experts say Mexican and Colombian cartels are training Central American traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Pascal Fletcher and Pat Markey; Editing by Kieran Murray)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CIOs are spending about 55 percent of their time driving innovative activities such as rolling out new technologies and business initiatives or managing nontechnology business issues, says a study by IBM called "The New Voice of the CIO."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data for the Global CIO Study 2009 was collected during face-to-face interviews conducted by IBM execs with 2,598 CIOs, working in organizations across 78 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click here to see the full survey results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When choosing from a list of 20 ways to increase competitive advantage within their industry, 83 percent of respondents identified business intelligence and data analytics as the most important factors in optimizing their businesses. Security and data reliability also ranked high as a common concern, with 71 percent of the CIOs planning more spending for compliance and risk management reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies surveyed were grouped into high, medium and low growth levels by using profit data from 2004 to 2007. The top three themes common among successful CIOs at high-growth companies were a sharper focus on innovation, business impact and strategies to raise the ROI of IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also showed a significantly different focus for CIOs in each group. High-growth CIOs, for example, emphasize innovative change to the business while CIOs at low-growth firms focus more heavily on tactical IT management. "As the business changes, IT can either respond as usual or challenge the traditional IT operating model at the core" says Dave Patzwald, VP of IT at Schneider Electric. "This is a transformational shift, not just a short-term challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you Tweet? Follow me on Twitter @SimoneLevien.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today delivered a record 13 security updates that patched 34 vulnerabilities in every version of Windows, including the not-yet-for-sale Windows 7, as well as in Internet Explorer (IE), Office, SQL Server and other parts of its software portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 34 flaws were also a record number for Microsoft, the most holes patched in one sitting since Microsoft switched to a regular monthly update schedule six years ago. The closest competitor was December 2008, when the company quashed 28 bugs .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To anyone following Apple, this isn't a big surprise," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, referring to Microsoft's operating system rival, which typically issues security updates that include scores of fixes. "But this is certainly an unprecedented month for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ranked 8 of the 13 updates and 21 of the 34 vulnerabilities as "critical," the top rating in its four-step scoring system. The remainder of the bulletins were judged "important," the next threat level down, while nine of the flaws were also pegged important, and the final 4 were tagged as "moderate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among today's patches were several for zero-day vulnerabilities -- bugs for which exploit code had already gone public. One of the zero-day vulnerabilities was undisclosed until today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft patched three vulnerabilities in SMB (Server Message Block) 2, a Microsoft-made network file- and print-sharing protocol that ships with Windows; two bugs in the FTP server that's included with older editions of its Internet Information Services (IIS) Web server; and two in the Windows Media Runtime. The flaws in SMB 2 and IIS had been public knowledge since early September, but the Windows Media vulnerabilities included one that Microsoft said was already in the wild, but had not leaked to the usual public sources, such as security mailing lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Storms urged everyone to deploy the MS09-051 update, which patches the Windows Media bugs, as soon as possible. "At first glance, [MS09-]051 should be patched immediately," he said. "What's interesting today is that we're learning it's in the wild. More important, it can be exploited in drive-by attack situations, just be getting people to go to a [malicious] Web site."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early last month, Microsoft revealed the SMB 2 vulnerability , but although attack code went public, security researchers have not seen any actual attacks. The flaw affects Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and preview releases of Windows 7, but not the final edition slated for retail release next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FTP flaw , on the other hand, was disclosed by Microsoft Sept. 1, when the company confirmed that its security team was investigating attack code that hit the street on the last day of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also fixed a slew of flaws today that go back to a programming error in one of its code "libraries," Active Template Library (ATL). The company had acknowledged the error last summer. Today's patches quashed three ATL-related bugs in Office and set "kill bits" to disable four or more Microsoft-made ActiveX controls for Windows Live Mail, the MSN Photo upload tool, and various Office document viewers used by Internet Explorer (IE) to display spreadsheets, charts and databases on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And we have the token IE patches today, too," noted Storms, talking about MS09-054, which plugs four holes, all critical, in Microsoft's browser. Included in the four, said Storms, was one apparently accidently disclosed at the Black Hat security conference several months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of today's record update, Microsoft also patched eight vulnerabilities in GDI+, (Graphics Device Interface), a component that debuted in Windows XP and is a core part of Windows Vista and Windows 7, as well as the server-side operating systems, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackers could exploit the GDI+ bugs by sending specially-crafted image files in a variety of formats -- including BMP, PNG, TIFF and WMF -- to a user via e-mail, or by convincing users to visit sites that contain malicious image files. By triggering the vulnerabilities, attackers could then follow up with additional malware to hijack a system or steal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms, however, discounted exploits of the GDI+ vulnerabilities. The audio codec bugs [in MS09-051] will be so much easier to exploit," he reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would put the two items in the public domain, MS09-050 [the SMB 2 flaws] and MS09-053 [the FTP bug in IIS] at the top of the list," said Storms. "And then MS09-051 and the IE updates, the latter because those kind of client-side bugs get a lot of attention from attackers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's security updates can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ten drugs planes found in a month, up from four in 2008 * U.S. aid cut, de facto government without drug strategy * Light aircraft carry Venezuelan registrations By Frank Jack Daniel TEGUCIGALPA, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The number of airplanes smuggling cocaine through Honduras has surged since the United States suspended drug cooperation in the wake of an army coup, the Central American country's drugs chief said on Tuesday. Honduras has been internationally isolated since soldiers exiled President Manuel Zelaya at gunpoint on June 28, and it lost $16.5 million of U.S. military aid after the putsch. Drugs chief Julian Aristides said Honduras' de facto government, engulfed in a serious political crisis, had no clear anti-drugs strategy, although he added that Zelaya's government had also not fought trafficking well. In the last month alone, authorities have found 10 planes abandoned on runways and remote highways. Aristides, a former army general, said there were just four such cases last year. These are the facts, the flights have intensified, he told Reuters in his modest office in the Honduran capital. The increase could undermine the anti-drugs fight in Mexico, where President Felipe Calderon has sent thousands of troops to try to weaken powerful drug cartels and quell turf wars that have killed more than 14,000 people since late 2006. Sparsely populated Honduras has little radar coverage and traffickers with night vision goggles fly small planes under the cover of darkness to load the drugs into trucks or boats. U.S. agencies are still sharing intelligence with Honduran officials, but can no longer participate in operations. Before the coup, the United States loaned helicopters to Honduras' under-equipped air force and provided the navy with fuel and logistics for advanced interception boats. Since the substitution of the president this has been suspended, we don't have the support that was so important given our lack of technology, Aristides said. HEADED TO U.S. ADDICTS Central America is a major trafficking route for cocaine taken by Colombian and Mexican traffickers to the United States, and regional governments are struggling to fight the smugglers. Guatemala is facing a budget squeeze because of the global economic slowdown, leaving it less money for its anti-drugs plans. While some Latin American leaders want U.S. President Barack Obama to take tougher measures against Honduras' de facto government, critics at home complain he has already done too much to support the leftist Zelaya and that the cut in aid threatens U.S. security interests by easing the pressure on drug gangs. Almost all the planes found in Honduras recently were painted with Venezuelan registrations, and the pilots are usually Colombian, Aristides said. It is the population of the United States that will suffer, because the more drugs that arrive in Honduras, the more drugs can arrive in the United States, he said. The United Nations says the Venezuelan coast is being used by drug cartels to traffic cocaine via Honduras, and anti-narcotics experts say Mexican and Colombian cartels are training Central American traffickers.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) has one of the most highly anticipated
dates in the earnings confessional this week. According to Thomson Reuters, the
financial firm is slated to report third-quarter figures before the opening bell
on Thursday, Oct. 15. Ahead of the event, option traders are rushing to place
their pre-earnings bets, with intraday call volume skyrocketing to nearly three
times the norm. 

More specifically, so far today, GS has seen roughly 40,000 calls change hands,
compared to its average daily volume of fewer than 15,200 contracts. Garnering
the most attention is the out-of-the-money October 190 call, which has seen
close to 12,800 contracts cross the tape. Meanwhile, the soon-to-expire October
185-, 195- and 200-strike calls have each seen more than 6,100 contracts traded
so far.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 13 (Reuters) - Prominent banking analyst Meredith
Whitney downgraded Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to "neutral"
from "buy," citing the recent rise in share price, but said the
company still had strong fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The stock, which has risen 34 percent in the past three
months, has exceeded her price target of $186, and upside could
be limited over the medium term, Whitney said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe at current prices, the secret is out with
respect to strong second half earnings, and expect the company
to beat third- and fourth-quarter estimates," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman fell 2 percent to $186.23 Tuesday
afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. They touched a low of
$185.12 earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we are fundamentally constructive on Goldman Sachs
over the long term, we prefer to invoke a 'why be greedy'
rationale and lock in profits at these levels," Whitney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plain vanilla debt market continues to be robust and
spreads continue to benefit from fewer players, but "that fact
is well broadcasted at this point," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In July, Goldman said quarterly earnings surged 33 percent
on blowout trading results, trouncing forecasts.

&lt;p&gt;News Outlets Expose Discrepancies in Chevron Account; Ecuador Calls for DOJ to
Investigate Possible Criminal Violations
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Questions are mounting over Chevron`s continued refusal to respond to new facts
that suggest the company manufactured secret videos to undermine a civil trial
in Ecuador where it faces a $27 billion environmental liability as Ecuador`s top
lawyer called on the U.S. Justice Department to investigate the oil giant for
possible criminal violations, according to news reports and representatives of
the plaintiffs. 

(A complete list of Chevron`s unanswered questions about the purported bribery
scandal, compiled by the plaintiffs in the underlying civil case, is available
online at
http://chevrontoxico.com/assets/docs/20090925-unanswered-questions.pdf.) 

The New York Times on Saturday exposed a number of discrepancies in Chevron`s
initial account of a purported $3 million bribery scheme that the company
claimed implicates an Ecuador trial judge overseeing the civil lawsuit, which
will determine whether the oil giant will be forced to pay for the clean-up of
billions of gallons of toxic waste in the Amazon. 

The article also reported that Ecuador`s Attorney General, Washington Pesantez,
has called on the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate Chevron for
possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), a U.S. law that
prohibits American businesses from bribing foreign officials. Chevron`s current
management team already pled guilty to an FCPA violation in 2007 in Iraq, paying
a $30 million fine. 

"As more and more facts become available, it looks increasingly like Chevron`s
`smoking gun` videos could be part of an elaborate hoax designed by the
company," said Andrew Woods, an American legal advisor to the 30,000 plaintiffs
in the underlying civil lawsuit. Woods, in light of the new evidence, again
called on the Department of Justice to conduct a full investigation and
interview all key witnesses in the case that are located in the U.S. and out of
reach of the government of Ecuador, which is conducting its own investigation. 

Chevron`s potential damages in Ecuador were determined by a court-appointed
Special Master who reviewed more than 200,000 pages of evidence and tens of
thousands of chemical sampling results, most provided by Chevron. The costs
mostly cover remediation for the dumping of billions of gallons of toxic waste
by Texaco (which Chevron bought in 2001) into Ecuador`s Amazon from 1964 to
1990, along with compensation for 1,401 cancer deaths related to the
contamination. 

The trial against Chevron is taking place in Ecuador at the company`s request
after it filed 14 sworn affidavits praising Ecuador`s judicial system, thereby
convincing a U.S. judge to transfer the case to the South American nation. Once
the Ecuador trial began in 2003 and produced evidence that pointed to Chevron`s
guilt, the company launched a campaign to discredit Ecuador` courts of which the
video saga appears to be just the latest chapter, according to the plaintiffs. 

Chevron is using three major public relations firms - Edelman Worldwide, Hill &amp;
Knowlton, and Sard - to try to discredit Ecuador`s courts. 

On August 31, just weeks before a final decision was expected in the trial,
Chevron posted the videos on YouTube that showed one of its contractors trying
to arrange a bribe with a person who claimed he was a member of Ecuador`s ruling
party to secure a clean-up contract in the event Chevron were to lose the trial.
Chevron claimed that the contractor, Ecuadorian Diego Borja, and an American
businessman, Wayne Hansen, shot the videos from micro-cameras hidden in a watch
and a pen and that they made the recordings on their own. 

However, media outlets that have begun to dig further into the facts surrounding
the bribery scandal have raised several disturbing questions that seem to point
to Chevron`s deepening involvement in the planning and execution of the
operation. 

The New York Times noted that there is no apparent motivation for why Borja and
Hansen would secretly record themselves engaging in conduct that exposes them to
criminal liability if not to assist Chevron`s attempt to discredit the judge in
exchange for compensation or some other benefit, which in Borja`s case involved,
at a minimum, being relocated to the United States at Chevron`s expense. The
article also pointed out that Chevron`s initial claim that the trial judge was
implicated in a bribe was not clearly backed up by the contents of the tapes,
which the judge says were edited in a manipulative fashion. 

Hansen, the so-called American businessman, asserted in the tapes that he owned
a remediation company but no evidence has been found to back up the claim.
Hansen also was in Ecuador continuously for several weeks during the bribery
scandal, and left the country the day after the final video was shot, according
to immigration records. 

"The lack of credibility of Hansen and Borja is becoming more apparent by the
day as gaping holes threaten to swallow Chevron`s entire story," said Karen
Hinton, a representative of the plaintiffs. 

Bloomberg News Service and other media outlets previously reported that many of
Chevron`s representations about the scheme were not fully disclosive or were
outright misleading. For instance, Chevron never revealed that Borja worked for
the oil giant as a field technician during the civil trial mere weeks before the
filming of the secret videos and that the former Chevron contractor has an
office in a small building where Chevron`s local Ecuadorian legal team also
maintains its offices. Nor did the company reveal that it had secured both men
criminal lawyers and were paying their fees, apparently to ensure they were not
questioned, said Hinton. 

Similarly, Chevron`s claim that Patricio Garcia (the Ecuadorian seen on the
tapes discussing the bribe with Hansen and Borja) was a government official
appears to be false. Garcia, according to several news accounts, is actually a
car salesman and his name is not among the 350,000 registered on the voter rolls
of Alianza Pais, the ruling political party in Ecuador. Garcia also has stated
to media outlets in Ecuador that he met with Borja in Chevron`s local law office
and that he was entrapped by the company. 

Some of the key unanswered questions about Chevron`s role in the bribery scandal
are:

* What contacts did Borja and Hansen have with Chevron`s lawyers in Ecuador and
the United States in planning the secret video recordings? 
* How much has Chevron, or its local law office, paid Borja for his services? 
* Who paid Hansen`s expenses when he was in Ecuador for several weeks to shoot
the video recordings? 
* What was the involvement of Chevron`s U.S.-based legal department in planning
the videos, particularly the fourth taped meeting which by Chevron`s admission
occurred after it received the first three video recordings? 
* Why did Chevron ensure that Borja and Hansen are represented by criminal
lawyers? What is the company`s analysis of the criminal exposure faced by these
individuals? 
* Why did Chevron ensure that Borja and Hansen were unavailable for questioning
when the company released the videos on YouTube and said it would make all
information public? 
* Why has Chevron refused to release the full recordings or explain how and who
edited them?

&lt;p&gt;Just a day before Microsoft was to have retired Office 2004 for Mac by ending updates and fixes, including security patches, the company said Monday that it would instead extend the five-year-old suite's support until Jan. 10, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced the 27-month reprieve on its Mac Business Unit's (MacBU) blog , saying that the extension was meant to give Office 2004 users, who can utilize Visual Basic-based macros, enough time to migrate to the next edition of the application suite, which isn't scheduled for release until late 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The date has been extended to 2012 specifically to ensure continuous cross-platform compatibility for Office 2004 customers reliant on [Visual Basic for Applications] until support for VBA is released in the next version of Office for Mac," said Mike Tedesco, a senior product manager for MacBU, in the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft scrubbed Visual Basic from Office 2008 for Mac, a move it tacitly admitted was a mistake when it said in March 2008 that the next upgrade would again support the scripting language .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The still-unnamed Office, which Microsoft has only promised by the holiday selling season next year, will also include a Mac-specific version of Outlook as a substitute for the little-loved Entourage e-mail application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Tedesco stressed that the stay of execution would not change Microsoft's policy of supporting Mac versions of Office for only five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Microsoft labels Mac Office as a "consumer" product, it supports the suite only five years, half as long as the Windows versions. Office for Mac receives what Microsoft calls "mainstream support," which generally runs five years, but it is ineligible for the additional five years of "extended support," a phase that includes security updates but provides other fixes only to companies that have purchased support plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This extension does not change the five-year support policy for other Office for Mac products, including future versions," Tedesco said. "Nor does it affect any other Microsoft products, including Office on the Windows platform. With the additional support [for Office 2004], we will continue delivering all the types of support associated with mainstream support, including security updates and non-security bug fixes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of late Monday, Microsoft's site had not been updated to reflect the new Jan. 10, 2012, support deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft late Monday held out a glimmer of hope to Sidekick users, saying that it may be able to recover some data previously believed lost in a massive server failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Recent efforts indicate the prospects of recovering some lost content may now be possible," a Microsoft spokesman said in a statement that was duplicated on T-Mobile's support site . "We will continue to keep you updated on this front; we know how important this is to you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news came two days after Microsoft and T-Mobile confirmed that a server failure "almost certainly" meant that users' data had been lost. In a joint message at the time, the companies said that although engineers were working on the problem, "the likelihood of a successful outcome is extremely low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outage sparked users to post thousands of messages on T-Mobile's support forums, where most customers raged at the loss , calling it "inexcusable" and beating the drum for a class-action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, hints surfaced that Microsoft might have made progress in restoring the lost data, as some users said that personal data had reappeared on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidekicks use the servers run by Microsoft subsidiary Danger Inc. to synchronize the smartphone's content, including contacts, appointments and photos, with a cloud-based storage service. When the servers went down and data on them was lost, that same data was then deleted from Sidekicks whose users had removed the battery in an attempt to reset the device, or had let the phone's battery completely drain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some reports had linked the server failure to an upgrade of Danger's storage area network (SAN). Microsoft, however, declined to confirm those reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile promised customers $100 for their troubles, but with significant caveats. "In the event certain customers have experienced a significant and permanent loss of personal content, T-Mobile will be sending these customers a $100 customer appreciation card," the mobile carrier said. "This will be in addition to the free month of data service that already went to Sidekick data customers. This card can be used towards T-Mobile products and services, or a customer's T-Mobile bill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affected customers will be automatically notified within the next two weeks, T-Mobile added. "We however remain hopeful that for the majority of our customers, personal content can be recovered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Monday, Microsoft provided some additional information about what happened at Danger, the Sidekick software and services developer it acquired in 2008 . "A server failure at Microsoft/Danger caused an outage that affected the applications and services available on the Sidekick devices," a Microsoft spokesman said Monday afternoon. The failure, the spokesman added, "impacted both the main and backup databases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft also made a point to distance its own cloud-based plans from the disaster. "The Sidekick runs on Danger's proprietary service that Microsoft inherited when it acquired Danger in 2008," said Microsoft's spokesman. "The Danger service is built on a mix of Danger-created technologies and third-party technologies.

&lt;p&gt;  WALLINGFORD, CT, Oct 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
VBrick announced today that its flagship Enterprise Media System (VEMS)
can now seamlessly integrate with the IBM Lotus Sametime unified
communications platform, allowing enterprise users to assimilate IP video
streaming with key unified communications applications, from instant
messaging and telephony to Web conferencing. VBrick first announced its
product integration with Sametime in March 2008. The integration has
resulted in unparalleled collaboration benefits for users, who can now
search for and view live and on-demand video (and rich media
presentations), share contacts and chat with content creators, all
without leaving the Sametime client.

    VEMS, announced Oct. 5 in a separate release entitled "VBrick Unveils
Industry's Most Complete Solution to Distribute Live and On-Demand Video
Across the Enterprise," can scale to manage IP video streaming for tens
of thousands of concurrent users across an enterprise, using advanced
bandwidth optimization and sophisticated search capabilities to optimize
video viewing and management.

    The VEMS Plug-In for Sametime makes live and stored enterprise video
assets available via Sametime with a simple Plug-In that lists IP video
content within the Sametime portal. This allows users to easily integrate
IP video streaming into some of Sametime's most popular features, such as
instant messaging. Moreover, the video watching experience is highly
interactive as users can chat with video content creators, as well as
comment and quickly share videos with friends and colleagues on their
"contacts" lists.

    "Our integration with IBM Lotus Sametime signals our determination to
establish IP video streaming as an essential component to an enterprise
unified communications strategy," said Vince Graziani, chief executive
officer, VBrick. "Sametime users around the world -- and in every industry
-- are now recognizing the power of IP video streaming to more effectively
broadcast internal and external communications."

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/289fd7/the_smarts_in_ibm) has
announced the addition of the "The smarts in IBM's Smart Analytics System"
report to their offering. 

IBM's Smart Analytics announcement might have been overshadowed by its planned
$1.2 billion acquisition of analytic firm SPSS. However, it arguably will have a
greater impact on IBM's longer-term analytics delivery strategy. At first
glance, the Smart Analytics System seems to be another take on BI and data
warehousing appliances -pre-integrated hardware and software combos that are
calibrated to work smoothly together. 

Like appliances, IBM's system promises faster and lower-cost deployment without
compromising performance. There is also a smarter query optimisation engine
being built in. But the most important takeaway of this announcement is how IBM
is packaging the analytic system for customers. The company seems to be
reverting to a strategy of providing vertically integrated systems sold as
single, complete IBM offerings aligned with the delivery of its consulting and
professional services. 

If the company gets the balance right, it could well shake up the piecemeal
integration that has characterised the BI and data warehousing market.

&lt;p&gt;Avnet to Also Integrate Scale`s Intelligent Clustered Storage (ICSTM) Technology
Onto IBM`s System X Servers
INDIANAPOLIS &amp; SAN ANTONIO--(Business Wire)--
Avnet Technology Solutions, the solutions distribution leader and an operating
group of Avnet, Inc. (NYSE: AVT) and Scale Computing, a developer and
manufacturer of ICSTM (Intelligent Clustered Storage) technology, today
announced that Avnet will assist with Scale Computing`s product development and
assembly by integrating Scale Computing`s ICS technology onto the IBM System X
server platform to create a complete storage appliance solution - the iSN1000.
Avnet also will help Scale Computing expand its customer base by making the
iSN1000 available through Avnet`s IBM value-added reseller partners in the
United States and Canada. 

"This is the first time that Avnet Technology Solutions, Americas, will assist
in both development and distribution of the same storage appliance," said Mark
Martin, vice president of marketing and business development, Avnet Technology
Solutions, Americas, IBM Solutions group. "We strongly believe the IBM System X
hardware with Scale`s ICS technology is a complete, end-to-end midmarket storage
solution that is competitively priced. It will help our IBM-focused reseller
partners enhance their storage solutions offerings by addressing key technology
challenges facing their midmarket customers." 

In addition to running on IBM`s System X server line, Scale`s ICS technology
uses IBM GPFS (General Parallel File System) as its core file system. GPFS is a
sophisticated, symmetrical, parallel file system. ICS taps into many of its
features and adds others of its own including the ability to run CIFS, NFS and
iSCSI protocols simultaneously, creating a unified SAN/NAS environment. 

"Scale`s ICS technology offers some of the most aggressive, advanced features
for the price. IBM midmarket customers and resellers will benefit tremendously
by having this storage solution available on an IBM platform," said Bill
Mottram, storage analyst, Veridictus Associates. 

The iSN1000 is a 1 usable TB storage node. Customers must make an initial
purchase of (3) iSN1000s to create a 3 usable TB cluster, called the StarterSAN.
Scale`s MSRP for the 3 usable TB StarterSAN is $18,300. 

"As an IBM reseller, I am extremely excited about this product," said Jorge
Quintero, President, QCM Technologies, Scottsdale, AZ. "This gives us a
competitive, IBM branded, midmarket storage solution with enterprise-class
features." 

iSN1000 with ICS Technology Features

While many other leading storage vendors use a monolithic architecture that
requires control units with limited scalability and single points of failure,
the iSN1000 with ICS technology is a clustered storage system that can scale per
TB to more than 2.2 PBs on a single file system. 

Features include: 

Future Proof

The iSN1000 with ICS will work together with future iSNs of greater density and
drive size. Because ICS is a clustered system, the 1TB iSN1000 will work in the
same cluster with 2TB, 4TB and even 32TB iSNs (when they are released). 

Snapshot/Replication Included

The iSN1000 with ICS includes advanced snapshot / replication features at no
additional cost above the MSRP. 

Data Aware Drives

Many other storage systems sold in the SMB are asymmetrical, meaning they store
metadata in a controller. Such designs not only create a single point of
failure, but also make data recovery much more difficult. The iSN1000 with ICS,
however, is symmetrical. All drives are "data aware" as information is mirrored
and striped across the entire cluster. 

Linear, Low Cost Scaling

The iSN1000 with ICS is designed to scale linearly, to more than 2.2 PBs, 1
usable TB at a time. While others require tiered scaling by more than 1TB and at
a greater cost, iSN1000 clusters are versatile and scale within the IT budget. 

Zero Service Disruption While Scaling

To grow capacity, IT managers add extra iSNs to the cluster without disrupting
services. ICS technology quickly identifies the node and, adds its capacity to
the existing cluster, and begins mirroring and striping data to the new node. 

"Avnet`s embedded team has done a stellar job integrating our product, and we
are very excited to now be working with their distribution experts. The ability
to have both distribution, and product development and integration with one
partner is a tremendous asset to our business," said Alan Hahn, VP of Worldwide
Sales, Scale Computing. "We`re confident this product will sell quickly to IBM
resellers and customers." 

About Scale Computing

Scale Computing is a data storage developer offering enterprise-class scalable
and clustered storage solutions. Scale Computing`s enterprise storage solution,
ICSTM, allows users to add storage hardware, known as storage nodes, as
necessary without suspending services or migrating data. By combining commodity
hardware with a clustered file system commonly found only in the world`s largest
supercomputers, a Scale storage cluster grows seamlessly while reducing costs by
up to seventy-five percent compared to traditional enterprise storage solutions.

insights needed to develop new prospects in high-growth markets such as

Homeland Security. Additionally, the events include applicable market trend
information developed through Avnet`s solutions practices, such as Avnet
VirtualPath, Avnet SecurePath and Avnet StoragePath, coupled with business
assessments and real-world examples. Each event is designed to enable Avnet`s
partners to assist end-user customers in effectively preparing for their future
technology needs. Avnet also facilitates the event management process, including
content development, meeting planning, invitations and recruitment, post-event
lead generation and attendee follow up.

 (Adds further detail)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Oct 13 (Reuters) - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
(BAC.N) has hired Tan Chong Lee, who was last at Goldman Sachs
(GS.N), as its head of Southeast Asia investment banking, two

worked with BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), comes after Merrill lost some
key bankers in the region in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and Merrill declined to comment on the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill is trying to rebuild its team to tap into deals in

which is optimized not just for mobile access, but for the role of the
individual accessing the application.Using the Isolate &amp; Target approach project
managers are presented with capabilities specific to their function, individual
team members or project stakeholders will view controls and displays targeted
for their use.

"We are proud to announce Bamboo Solutions as the first major SharePoint
technology provider to adopt the Mobile Entr&#233;e platform," says Mike Herres, CEO
of H3 Solutions."Bamboo`s comprehensive portfolio of packaged solutions for
SharePoint represents a vast range of capabilities that work extremely well in a
mobile context."

"Mobile Entr&#233;e provides Bamboo with an elegant and cost efficient means of

&lt;p&gt; * Banks fall; Goldman's rating cut &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Investors eye U.S.; Johnson  Johnson and Intel results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * UK September inflation data misses expectations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * U.S. Q3 results in focus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By David Brett&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 share index
was down 0.1 percent by mid-session on Tuesday, as banks
retreated following a downgrade of U.S. giant Goldman Sachs and
while investors awaited U.S. corporate results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1035 GMT the FTSE 100 .FTSE was 5.73 points lower at
5204.44, having gained 48.30 points, or 0.9 percent to 5,210.17
on Monday, its highest close since late September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It could be an emotional and rocky third quarter both sides
of the pond," said Manus Cranny Senior Market Commentator of MF
Global Spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "UK banks are decidedly queasy on the back of the Goldman
Sachs downgrade (by Meridith Whitney Banking Associates) and it
is Barclays that will bear the brunt of a shift in sentiment in
the banking sector," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British banks were weaker as investors awaited results later
this week from several U.S. peers. Barclays (BARC.L) shed 2.9
percent, while Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS.L), and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) lost 1.1 to
2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HSBC (HSBA.L) shed 1 percent after SABB 1060.SE, its Saudi
affiliate, reported a worse than expected 19.8 percent fall in
third-quarter net profit, hit by an increase in the scale of its
provisions for bad loans. [ID:nLD552432]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. banks JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N), Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) are all scheduled to
release third-quarter results later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later on Tuesday earnings data is expected from healthcare
firm Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N) and, after the U.S. markets
close, from the world's biggest chip-maker Intel (INTC.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stock index futures pointed to a slightly lower opening
on Wall Street, with futures for the SP 500 SPc1, Dow Jones
DJc1 and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 all down around 0.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Life insurers fell as investors banked profits following the
sector's recent good run, which has been underpinned by MA
speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legal  General (LGEN.L), a rumoured target for Resolution
RSL.L dipped 2.7 percent, while Aviva AVL.L, Prudential
(PRU.L) and Friends Provident FP.L fell 1.1-1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MINERS MIXED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavweight mining stocks were mixed with some profit taking
following Monday's rally, offset by bullish news from Kazakhmys
and gold XAU= hitting an historic high during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the fallers, Eurasian Natural Resources ENRC.L,
Vedanta Resources (VED.L), Antofagasta (ANTO.L) and BHP Billiton
(BLT.L) shed 0.2 to 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Copper producer Kazakhmys (KAZ.L) gained 1.5 percent after
the company announced it was in negotiations over a potential $2
billion loan facility to help fund major growth projects.

hotel and restaurant operator's first-half pretax results
impressed investors by beating expectations. [ID:nLC355283]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy shares rose as the crude oil price steadied above $74
a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BG Group (BG.L), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Cairn Energy
(CNE.L) added between 0.1 and 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tobaccos and beverages were among the top performing sectors
as defensive considerations returned, with drinks group Diageo
(DGE.L) up 0.9 percent and British American Tobacco (BATS.L)
ahead 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors pushed aside weaker than expected British consumer
price inflation data, which hit its lowest annual rate in five
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Office for National Statistics said the annual rate fell
to 1.1 percent, the lowest since September 2004 and below
analysts' forecasts for an easing to 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inflation is now well below the Bank of England's 2 percent
target, as a result sterling fell against a basket of
currencies.

&lt;p&gt;IBM will add support for SSDs to version 5.0 of its SAN Volume Controller and is promising a big boost in performance with or without flash storage.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SVC 5.0, due to ship on Nov. 6, is the latest version of a storage virtualization appliance that can control storage capacity from IBM and other system vendors. It will take advantage of technology IBM researchers developed in Project Quicksilver, which the company said last year had achieved 1 million read operations per second using SSDs (solid-state drives). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though SVC 5.0 falls slightly short of those lab results, clocking in at 800,000 read operations, for the first time it allows enterprises to put SSDs inside the SVC. It also includes upgrades that will boost the performance of HDDs (hard disk drives) in the virtualized storage environment, according to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSDs are fast emerging as a favored place to store data that applications such as transactional databases need to access quickly. Because they have no moving parts, they can outperform groups of linked HDDs while making better use of available capacity, space and energy. But capturing the full benefits of SSDs requires more than simply sliding an SSD into a slot, industry analysts advise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's SVC can be linked over a SAN (storage-area network) to storage systems from other vendors, including Hewlett-Packard, EMC, Sun Microsystems and NetApp. It virtualizes the combined capacity as a single pool of storage, giving enterprises greater flexibility in provisioning and using storage resources. It can control a maximum of 8 petabytes of storage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mark of 1 million read operations with Project Quicksilver was achieved using a nonstandard configuration of the SVC, said Chris Saul, IBM's marketing manager for storage virtualization. The shipping product will be able to deliver 800,000 read operations with four pairs of SVC systems linked together, he said. SVCs, which are servers one rack unit high (1U), are sold in pairs for redundancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SSDs each will have 146GB of capacity, and there are slots for four of them in a single SVC, with mirrored SSDs in its pair. A base configuration of a single pair, without the SSDs, will cost US$40,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other improvements in the coming upgrade are designed to improve the performance of any storage used with the controller. For the first time, the SVC comes with four 8Gb-per-second Fibre Channel interfaces, up from the four 4Gbps ports in the previous version. In addition, the new hardware has three times the maximum cache, at 24GB per pair, and a faster processor. Though results will vary depending on how much storage is attached to the controller, the SVC 5.0 platform will be able to deliver as much as double the I/O operations and megabytes per second of the previous SVC, Saul said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adding SSDs, IBM has taken a high-performance product and given it more speed, said analyst Mike Kahn of The Clipper Group. In the past, some enterprises have worried about virtualizing some of their high-demand storage because of possible limitations in the horsepower of an appliance such as IBM's SVC, he said. A virtualization appliance, like a middleman, needs to find each bit of data within all the storage it controls. Companies have to build storage virtualization systems with enough speed to withstand their busiest possible day for applications such as transactional databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its high-performance SSDs, IBM has boosted the scalability and speed of an SVC to a point where more enterprises can confidently use it with a large part of their storage, Kahn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'll get by with fewer appliances in your solution," Kahn said. By the same token, a virtualization environment with many SVCs can be even larger, he added. In the largest organizations, that may mean using storage virtualization on a large scale for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday wrapped up a months-long job of patching a critical bug it accidently introduced in a crucial code "library," one of the researchers who uncovered the flaw said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They finally released the last patch of Microsoft products yesterday, at least the last for the big attack vectors," said Ryan Smith, the principal research scientist for the Denver-based security consultant company Accuvant. "The patches for [Microsoft] Office closed the last big attack vector for the ATL flaw."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith and researchers Mark Dowd and David Dewey, who work for IBM Internet Security Systems' X-Force team, uncovered the bug and first publicly demonstrated how it could be used to attack PCs using Internet Explorer (IE) last July at the Black Hat security conference. Microsoft convinced the trio to stop publicly disclosing their findings until it was able to rush users a pair of emergency updates , which it delivered the day before the Smith-Dowd-Dewey Black Hat presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same day it delivered the out-of-band updates, Microsoft also acknowledged that an extraneous "" character in its Active Template Library (ATL), a code library used by both Microsoft and third-party developers to build software, was the root of the bug Smith, Dowd and Dewey discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fix the flaw, Microsoft was forced to patch its popular Visual Studio development platform, then urged third-party software companies to recompile any applications or code created with the buggy ATL. Microsoft also rooted through its own software for ATL-related bugs, and patched five vulnerabilities in August. At the time, security experts called the ATL-bug update, MS09-037, "awful" and "a handful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, as part of a record-setting security update , Microsoft patched three ATL-related bugs in its Office suite. Smith was credited with reporting two of the three vulnerabilities, while Dewey was named for the third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is the end of it for Microsoft," said Smith today, adding that the Office ATL flaws were the only remaining vulnerabilities that he, Dowd and Dewey had uncovered last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the same, Smith said he was shocked that attackers didn't take advantage of the ATL vulnerabilities before they were patched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The original proof of concept was probably the easiest way at the time to exploit a Web browser, and the fact was that it could also be exploited in the same way in Office," said Smith. "So the fact that it wasn't picked up is incredibly surprising to me, considering all the different attack vectors that were available."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secrecy was key to keeping hackers at bay. "It wasn't public knowledge that [the ATL bug] could be exploited through Office," said Smith. "We tried hard to keep that quiet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also issued a special "kill bit" update Tuesday to disable 15 different ActiveX controls created with the flawed ATL code. The company often sets the kill bits of vulnerable ActiveX controls as a protective measure in lieu of a patch, or as a stop-gap until a patch is available. Among the 15 ActiveX controls, all built by Microsoft for use in IE, were ones called on by its Windows Live Mail, Windows Live Messenger, MSN Photo Upload Tool and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said he expected that Microsoft will eventually patch some, if not all, of the disabled ActiveX controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft delivered the ATL patches for Office yesterday at 1 p.m. ET via its Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through the enterprise-grade Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Oct 14 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said a
planned overhaul of the hydrocracking complex at its 279,000
barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in El Segundo,
California started on Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The 59,500-bpd hydrocracker was shut by a power outage at
the refinery Wednesday afternoon, the company said in a

night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This electrical interruption resulted in the shutdown
occurring slightly ahead of schedule and we have commenced our
planned turnaround activities," spokeswoman Lily Craig said in

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Countries need to forge new trade rules governing the movement of electronic data across borders as the world becomes increasingly connected, a Microsoft official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 14 (Reuters) - Countries need to forge new
trade rules governing the movement of electronic data across
borders as the world becomes increasingly connected, a
Microsoft (MSFT.O) official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As more and more software services are provided over the
Internet, "people will be calling on computers located around
the world," said Brad Smith, senior vice president and general
counsel for the U.S. software giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a patchwork of laws around the world that is
increasingly creating a very confusing almost quagmire for
information providers," Smith said at the Global Services
Summit -- a meeting that brought together banking,
telecommunications, shipping and other service industry
professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One country may insist that e-mails be kept for a year for
security purposes while another requires they be erased after
six months to protect privacy, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If that's the case, it's very difficult to locate a data
center in one country and provide that service to consumers in
another country," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology will continue to change and "the trade rules
will need to change in order for these benefits to continue to
flow around the planet," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, in a

potentially could be addressed through the World Trade
Organization or bilateral forums, Cowhey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those include a conflict between globally coordinated
standards for information communication technology and national
standards some countries have pursued, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also is important that legitimate efforts to boost
cybersecurity are done in a way that maximizes global
efficiency and commerce, Cowhey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer choice and data privacy issues, as well as the
procedures that governments follow when they restrict access to
global information services are other areas that might be ripe
for international rule making, he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) robust $3.6 billion quarterly profit could prove a tough act for rivals to follow as its investment bank capitalized on the disappearance of some rivals and the weakness of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second largest U.S. bank by assets, and largest by market capitalization, reported much-better-than-expected results as bond trading revenue surged and it benefited from last year's purchases of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, which boosted the bank's shares 3.3 percent to a 52-week high, cement JPMorgan's position as one of the few banks that has emerged stronger from last year's Wall Street meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've come through the crisis impeccably well," said Bill Fitzpatrick, analyst at Optique Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivals Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), which report on Thursday and Friday respectively, already lag JPMorgan's investment bank -- which is ranked number one in global league tables for debt and equity underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That unit reported net income of $1.9 billion, up from $882 million a year earlier, and made up the lion's share of JPMorgan's 580 percent increase in earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's earnings were not uniformly positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, losses on loans still rose and net charge-offs on consumer loans climbed to $7 billion. But Citi and Bank of America may get even harder hit by such losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America and Citi -- the largest and third largest banks respectively -- also labor under $45 billion in bank bailout funds that tie them to compensation restrictions and hobble their ability to compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year to date, JPMorgan shares have climbed 50 percent and Bank of America shares are up 32 percent. Citi shares have fallen 26 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, former investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which reports its results on Thursday, is the firm most likely to rival JPMorgan's performance. Goldman's shares have more than doubled this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The higher quality companies like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have been able to take market share away and I think that trend will continue," said Robert Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both are clearly picking up client business, it is unclear whether they can maintain high profits from trading. Both reported a record first half from their investment bank divisions and JPMorgan's fixed income division delivered an eye-popping $5 billion in revenue in the third quarter -- JPMorgan executives warned that this is not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan as a whole posted third-quarter net income of 82 cents a share, compared with 9 cents in the same quarter last year and soundly beat analysts' forecast of 52 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OFFSETTING CREDIT LOSSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Goldman, JPMorgan also has the advantages and disadvantages of running a large commercial bank and credit losses there showed signs of stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, whose risk avoidance skills have commanded growing respect on Wall Street and in Washington, warned on a conference call that it is too early to conclude the tide has turned on rising loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lost $700 million in its credit card business, compared with a $292 million profit a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loan losses jumped overall and the bank reported $7 billion in net charge-offs on consumer loans on its books and held by investors, up from $3.3 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, revenue rose 79 percent to $28.8 billion, bolstered by last year's Washington Mutual takeover which added deposits to the retail bank and Bear Stearns, which lifted JPMorgan in the investment bank league tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said the bank could boost its annual per-share dividend to around 75 cents or $1 early next year "if we're lucky." The bank cut the annual dividend to 20 cents a share from $1.52 in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strong investment banking results follow a recent shakeup which saw asset management head Jes Staley named as its head, raising questions about who was best positioned to succeed Dimon. Cavanagh has also been cited as a potential successor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 53, is not expected to leave any time soon. He told analysts the management changes were part of his efforts to protect the longer-term health of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another bid to look after the bank longer term, Dimon -- who received about $19.7 million in compensation in 2008 -- said he is committed to paying staff appropriately and believes the bank's pay guidelines are broadly in line with those coming from regulators globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has set aside $8.79 billion for compensation in its investment bank unit so far this year. That amounts to $353,834 per employee, up from $210,854 per employee in the equivalent period a year ago. Median household income in the United States for 2008 was about $50,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Wednesday that Wall Street pay "has to be based on a reasonable assumption of risk, not speculation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan posted third-quarter earnings of $302 million in its treasury and securities services unit, down 26 percent from the same quarter last year. That may bode poorly for earnings from companies in similar businesses, such as Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O) and State Street Corp (STT.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, additional reporting by Steve Eder and Dan Wilchins; editing by John Wallace and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) set a high standard for other banks with its results on Wednesday, and should any of its rivals' earnings fall short of expectations, shares could be headed lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks rallied after JPMorgan reported profits much higher than expected, helping to send the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closing above 10,000 for the first time in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) all still set to report this week and other banks, including Northern Trust (NTRS.O), to post later this month, investors are eager to see if JPMorgan's news gets repeated across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much is riding on the banks. The Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX has rebounded 61 percent since the market's early March lows, and the KBW Bank Index is up 164 percent since a closing low of 18.62 on March 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does raise the bar for other banks, certainly the ones that have active trading units," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sector is expected to show year-over-year earnings growth of 81 percent for the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan gained 3.3 percent to $47.16 to close at a 52-week high Wednesday, while other financials were strong as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, a trading powerhouse, has been buoyed by steadily rising expectations. The company is expected to earn $4.24 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, up from 30 days ago, when expectations were for $3.58 a share. The stock rose 8.2 percent over that time. Howard Chen, bank analyst at Credit Suisse, said for brokers, "strong trading results are leading the way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling short of that figure "could spell doom for the stock," wrote analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, estimates for Citigroup and Bank of America have been falling, as they could be hit even harder by loan losses than JPMorgan. Still, an earnings surprise could help the shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said regional banks could suffer due in part to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;weak commercial real estate market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported net income of 82 cents a share, compared with 9 cents in the same quarter a year ago, while net revenue on a GAAP basis was $26.6 billion versus Thomson Reuters estimates for $25 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Goldman Sachs and Citigroup set to report results Thursday, options activity was picking up on the bullish side. Volume in bullish call options was outstripping bearish put options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, said the action reflected an optimistic outlook. "Because of JPMorgan earnings there is a certainly a bullish tone to the stock and option trading in the financial stocks as well as in the financial ETF," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, financials were helped by surprising results. Massive short bets had to be covered by bearish investors, accelerating rallies in those companies. Credit Suisse in a research note questioned whether the short-covering would reoccur to the same extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial sector is expected to have the highest earnings growth rate of any SP sector this reporting period, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings for SP 500 companies overall, though, are expected to decline 23.7 percent from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak and Doris Frankel; Editing by Kenneth Barry)&lt;/p&gt;

bumper $3.6 billion quarterly profit could prove a tough act to

disappearance of some Wall Street firms and the weakness of
others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second largest U.S. bank by assets reported
much-better-than-expected results as bond trading revenue
surged. JPMorgan benefited from last year's purchases of
investment bank Bear Stearns and captured market share from
weakened rivals in key securities businesses such as
underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only former investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N),
which is reporting on Thursday, is expected to better JPMorgan.
Goldman's shares have more than doubled this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results, which boosted the bank's shares 3.3 percent to
a 52-week high, cement JPMorgan's position as one of the few
banks that has emerged stronger from last year's Wall Street

Bill Fitzpatrick, analyst at Optique Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rivals Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp
(BAC.N), which report on Thursday and Friday respectively,
already lag JPMorgan's investment bank -- which is ranked
number one in global league tables for debt and equity
underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That unit reported net income of $1.9 billion, up from $882

according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OFFSETTING CREDIT LOSSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike Goldman, JPMorgan also has the advantages and
disadvantages of running a large commercial bank and credit
losses there showed signs of stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, whose risk avoidance
skills have commanded growing respect on Wall Street and in
Washington, warned on a conference call that it is too early to
conclude the tide has turned on rising loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan lost $700 million in its credit card business,
compared with a $292 million profit a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loan losses jumped overall and the bank reported $7 billion

who received about $19.7 million in compensation in 2008 --
said he is committed to paying staff appropriately and believes
the bank's pay guidelines are broadly in line with those coming
from regulators globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has set aside $8.79 billion for compensation in
its investment bank unit so far this year. That amounts to
$353,834 per employee in that unit, up from $210,854 per
employee in the equivalent period a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect Goldman to put aside an additional $5
billion to $6 billion for bonuses in the third quarter, which
would take its year-end bonus pool to more than $16 billion.
That would be about $544,217 per employee, based on total staff
numbers at the end of the second quarter. [ID:nN14266482]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Median household income in the United States for 2008 was
about $50,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Wednesday that
Wall Street pay "has to be based on a reasonable assumption of
risk, not speculation." [ID:nN14258726]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan posted third-quarter earnings of $302 million in
its treasury and securities services unit, down 26 percent from
the same quarter last year. That may bode poorly for earnings
from companies in similar businesses, such as Northern Trust
Corp (NTRS.O) and State Street Corp (STT.N).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase's (JPM.N) investment banking employees made a lot of money in the third quarter, but they are still a country mile behind Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of the third quarter, JPMorgan had set aside about $8.8 billion to compensate employees in its investment banking unit so far this year, or about $353,834 per employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman Sachs in the first two quarters of this year had set aside $11.36 billion for the year, or $386,429 per employee. In other words, Goldman employees made more in two quarters than JPMorgan's have in three quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compensation figures are always a matter of intense interest on Wall Street, but after the financial sector lost hundreds of billions of dollars and required $750 billion of U.S. bailout money, politicians and the broader public have grown increasingly focused on Wall Street pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest is whether employees are being overpaid. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said in July that compensation at many major banks has no reasonable basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Panel said on Wednesday that Congress is looking at compensation at companies that received significant taxpayer funds, and the White House warned pay must be reasonable. Special Master Kenneth Feinberg is looking at Wall Street compensation practices and calling for some contracts to be renegotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global leaders are trying to fix the problem. World leaders at the G20 meeting last month said bank compensation must be reformed and proposed measures, including banning guaranteed bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even some bank heads agree change is necessary. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said at a recent conference in Frankfurt there was good reason for anger over bankers' compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most calls for reform have fallen short of calling for outright pay caps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's employees are in line to earn more than JPMorgan in large part because they have generated more revenue -- Goldman's per employee revenue for the first two quarters exceeded JPMorgan's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the numbers are not be completely comparable. Some businesses that generate revenue for Goldman Sachs, such as private equity investments, are not included in JPMorgan's investment bank segment results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - If only everyone had Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) chief problem -- too much success leading to a surplus of riches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a growing public relations nightmare for Wall Street's dominant firm as it prepares to report another round of robust profits and update its bonus pool, which is on a pace to top $20 billion for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Goldman is headed for record bonuses so soon after repaying a $10 billion government bailout is unlikely to play well in Washington or on Main Street at a time when the jobless rate is soaring and consumers are hurting, image consultants said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the story of Goldman's bonus pool is overshadowing how well the firm is performing, and how it handles the criticism will shape its image for a long time to come, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining that earnings are not just cash rewards, but based on performance and largely paid in stock, will be central to justifying them to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chiefly, Goldman will need to show that the wider community can share in its success and wealth. This could involve some kind of charitable initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have got to embrace the idea that they are part of the face of Wall Street and part of the 'enemy list' in America right now," said Jesse Derris, a crisis communications consultant with Sunshine, Sachs  Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to respond and talk and embrace the idea of speaking with the media in a much smarter way," said Derris, who represents John Thain, a former Goldman executive and former Merrill Lynch chief executive who had a major image problem over excessive compensation and perks earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criticism leveled at Goldman has reached a fever pitch in recent months, with talk-show hosts and magazines using the firm's wealth and government connections as fodder. Most famously, a Rolling Stone magazine article labeled the firm a "vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, on the eve of Goldman's third-quarter earnings announcement, four organizations with religious ties, including the Benedictine Sisters of Mt. Angel, Oregon, urged Goldman's board to review pay practices at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein has been in the public arena in recent weeks, speaking about the company's strategy and even addressing questions about bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month alone he has been interviewed for a Wall Street Journal story, penned a column for the Financial Times, and is scheduled for a breakfast with Fortune magazine. He appeared last month at the Clinton Global Initiative to speak about Goldman's 10,000 Women initiative, a program that has invested millions in educating underserved women across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More charity could be on the way, news reports have suggested. CNBC reported this week that Goldman might ask its employees to devote a portion of their bonuses to charitable causes. It was not clear how much they might donate or who would receive the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SERIOUS APPROACH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman plan for giving to charity would be a serious approach to handling concerns about its bonus pool, said Michael Robinson, a financial and crisis public relations consultant with Levick Strategic Communications. But he cautioned that Goldman cannot do it as a one-time thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it is done as a one-off, people will see it as a one-off," Robinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of a Wall Street firm leaning on employees to give to charity is nothing new. From the 1970s until it was acquired by JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) last year, investment bank Bear Stearns Co required all senior managing directors to give at least 4 percent of their annual income to charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A charitable campaign would help, but ultimately Goldman must do a better job of showing the public how it aids the larger economy, said Scott Tangney, a consultant with public relations firm Makovsky + Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It boils down to transparency and trust, and they have to work very hard to build that, not only within the industry, but with the consumer," Tangney said. "They really need to reach out to consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may be easier said than done. JPMorgan boasted on Wednesday, as it reported strong quarterly earnings, about helping homeowners avoid foreclosure and extending credit to small and medium-sized businesses. But Goldman is still largely an investment bank, which means most of its profit comes from being smart about trading financial instruments and helping companies do deals and raise money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman could, however, look to start a community-reaching initiative, perhaps one that assists small businesses with financing, consultants said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Goldman handles its image now will have a lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will affect Lloyd Blankfein not only now, but how he is written into the history books and how Goldman is thought of for years to come," Tangney said. "The American public is angry. The pitchforks are out and the torches are lit, and they are looking for, basically, the culprits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Millions expected to try new ride at Disney World&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Raytheon hopes to woo students into engineering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Andrea Shalal-Esa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - A new ride at Disney's Epcot
Center that lets guests use math tools to design their own
roller-coaster, bobsled or plane ride and then "feel" it using
sophisticated simulators is Raytheon Co's (RTN.N) latest
attempt to attract students to careers in math and science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raytheon and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) unveiled the new ride,
"The Sum of All Thrills" at the Disney World Resort in Orlando
on Wednesday after nearly two years of work on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The point, says Raytheon Chief Executive Bill Swanson, is
to address a troubling U.S. trend away from math and science
learning that threatens to leave defense companies such as
Raytheon without enough engineers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our research showed that you needed innovative approaches
to making math fun," Swanson told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Partnering with Disney means an estimated 6 million
visitors could experience the new ride each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the "Sum of All Thrills" should help students
"connect the dots that math and science are important and they
should be fun," said Swanson, a trained engineer himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a short video that highlights major engineering
developments in history, Disney guests can design their ride on
a computerized light board, using rulers and speed dials to add
corkscrews, inversions or steeper hills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guided by an animated character named "Crash," students use
math and engineering principles to determine how much energy is
needed for a jet airplane to take off or for a roller coaster
train or toboggan to make it up its first climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once the ride is completed, guests can save it on a digital
card and proceed to one of four robotic simulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For now, guests can choose to build a roller coaster,
bobsled ride or jet plane ride. In the future, the technology
could be expanded to other activities, including jet skiing,
downhill skiing, or even a boat ride, Swanson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORPORATE FOCUS ON EDUCATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under Swanson, Raytheon focused 60 percent of its corporate
charitable giving on education to encourage students to replace
millions of American engineers due to retire in the next few
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he heard that more than half of high school students
would rather take out the trash than do math homework, Swanson
said he knew something had to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2005, Raytheon founded MathMovesU, a program for
students aged 10 through 14 that offers interactive learning
and tutoring, contests, events and scholarships. With the help
of more than 10,000 Raytheon volunteers, it has reached 1
million students, teachers and parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The program, at www.mathmovesu.com, also has a link to a
modified online version of the new Disney ride. Within a year,
the company hopes to let Disney guests design a ride on their
home computer and then bring it on a memory card to use at the
resort, Raytheon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company awards more than $2 million in scholarships and
grants each year to students, teachers and schools. Raytheon is
also a main sponsor of the MATHCOUNTS National Competition, and
holds other engineering and robotics events around the
country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swanson said the approach is starting to pay off, based on
dozens of letters he receives each year from scholarship
recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's anecdotal, but I know we're making a difference
because of the feedback," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recently, a high school student who won a Raytheon-
sponsored trip to the Paris Air Show for his work in a local
rocketry group told the company he decided to pursue a career
in aeronautical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's the jackpot," said Swanson.

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman sees Brazil growth potential at 5 pct a year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Country urged to become more investment friendly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO Oct 14 (Reuters) - Brazil could grow at 5
percent annually in coming years but must address economic
weaknesses, such as the need for more investment friendly
policies, Jim O'Neill, head of global economic research at
Goldman Sachs, said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The taming of inflation in Brazil has made it possible for
the country to leave behind its economic turmoil and expand
consistently, O'Neill said at a briefing with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is possible that Brazil is entering a period where it
could grow by more than 5 percent for many years," said
O'Neill, who in 2001 coined the term BRIC to describe the
combined muscle of the Brazilian, Russian, Indian and Chinese
emerging markets. "Brazil is in a very sweet spot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet the government needs to keep inflation in check and
draw in investment to hasten that growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of companies "are thinking about investing in
Brazil for the first time ever," he said. "It's really
important that the government today and the next government
encourage that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brazilians will elect a new leader in October 2010 to
succeed President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who took office in
2003 and has steered the country through its biggest economic
boom in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus far the candidates have presented little divergence
from the economic path laid down by Lula and the central bank,
which includes aggressive management of the rate of inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The specter of inflation still looms large in Brazil where
years of hyperinflation dragged down the economy in the 1980s
and early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That began changing after the country introduced a new
currency in 1994 and adopted an inflation-targeting regime in
1999. The resulting stability helped propel Brazil to its
current position as a potential leader on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brazil's benchmark consumer price index has risen 4.34
percent in the 12 months through September, below the
government's target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The country slid into contraction in the fourth quarter of
2008 but resumed growth in the second quarter this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The way Brazil has handled this external shock is a huge
testimony of how different Brazil is these days," O'Neill
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet the 72 percent increase so far this year in Brazil's
benchmark Bovespa index .BVSP means that Brazilian stocks are
no longer quite as attractive as they were at the start of the
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I wish I would have invested more in" the index, he joked.
Because of the gains in stock prices, investors could find
cheaper exposure to the Brazilian market through foreign
companies expanding into emerging markets.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Oct 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Competition Bureau announced today that it has reached an agreement
with Pfizer Inc. and Wyeth requiring, among other things, that the
companies divest a significant number of animal health products to
resolve competition concerns with respect to their proposed merger.

    Under the terms of an agreement with the companies, Pfizer and Wyeth will
divest certain animal pharmaceutical and vaccine products to Boehringer
Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc. Additionally, Pfizer will amend the terms of
its existing arrangement with Paladin Labs Inc. governing the
distribution, marketing and sale of Pfizer's human pharmaceutical
product, Estring, in Canada to ensure continued competition in the supply
of hormone replacement therapy products.

    "The Bureau is very pleased with this result," said Melanie Aitken,
Commissioner of Competition. "The parties' commitments address our
concern that the merger would lessen competition substantially in the
supply of certain human and animal health products."

    Mergers in Canada are subject to review by the Competition Bureau under
the Competition Act to ensure that they will not result in a substantial
lessening or prevention of competition. The Consent Agreement with the
parties follows an extensive analysis of numerous animal and human health
product markets, including interviews with a wide range of industry
participants. Over the course of the review, the Bureau cooperated
closely with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and received valuable
input and expert advice from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and
Health Canada's Veterinary Drugs Directorate.

    The full text of the Consent Agreement filed with the Competition
Tribunal will be available shortly on the Tribunal's Web site (link to CT
site http://www.ct-tc.gc.ca/).

    The Competition Bureau is an independent law enforcement agency that
contributes to the prosperity of Canadians by protecting and promoting
competitive markets and enabling informed consumer choice.

&lt;p&gt; * EU to start talks on visa free travel and trade * EU members that have not recognised Kosovo support move  By Fatos Bytyci PRISTINA, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The European Commission has proposed negotiating visa-free travel and a trade agreement with Kosovo even though five EU countries have not recognised its independence. The absence of an agreed position on Kosovo's status does not prevent the EU from substantial engagement with Kosovo, says a study document presented by the European Commission in Brussels and Pristina on Wednesday on Kosovo's EU future. We propose to start a visa dialogue with Kosovo with the perspective of visa liberalisation when the conditions will be fulfilled, Pierre Mirel, the head of European Commission for Western Balkans said in Pristina. We also propose to start preparing for a trade agreement. Mirel has urged Kosovo authorities to undertake the necessary technical reforms to make the Commission's proposals work. The citizens of neighbouring Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro will travel to EU countries without visas from January 2010. Bosnia and Albania hope to do this by the middle of next year. Kosovo's path towards joining the 27-bloc is not clear because five countries - Spain, Romania, Greece, Cyprus and Slovakia - have not recognised its statehood. Mirel said the new agenda for Kosovo was supported by the five countries. Kosovo is recognised by 62 world states but not by its former master Serbia as well as Russia and China. Kosovo's government saluted the decision on visas and trade. From today there is a new area for relations between the EU and the Republic of Kosovo, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci told a news conference. From now, Kosovo has a very clear perspective towards the EU. In a separate, 2009 Progress Report, the Commission urged Kosovo to do more to reform its judiciary, fight corruption and organised crime. The weak rule of law, widespread corruption, and uncertainty over property rights continued to be major impediments to economic development, it said. A 40 percent unemployment rate has remained unchanged since 2008. Around 30,000 young people enter the job market every year and many of them continue to leave the country and find work abroad, says the report. One of the main challenges is to encourage the participation of Kosovo Serbs in public life and local elections scheduled for next month. Some 120,000 remaining Kosovo Serbs, backed by Belgrade, refuse to cooperate with Pristina institutions. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost ten years after NATO bombing drove out Serb forces to stop the killing of Albanians in a two-year counter-insurgency war. The bloc's largest EU mission, the EU police and justice mission (EULEX), with 2,000 police customs, officers, judges and prosecutors, helps and monitors local institutions.

&lt;p&gt;New Mini PackagingOption Allows Consumers to Open a Little Happiness and Better
Manage What They Drink


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
A little happiness in a stylish new package is coming soon to your refrigerator.
Coca-Cola today introduced a new 90-calorie sleek mini can to give consumers a
better way to manage their calories. 

"As the world`s largest beverage company, we take seriously the need to help
consumers balance calories consumed with calories expended," said Sandy Douglas,
president, Coca-Cola North America. "The Coca-Cola mini can innovation
reinforces the Company`s support for healthy, active lifestyles." 

The 7.5-fluid ounce mini can carries the distinct Coca-Cola contour-shaped
bottle image in white with a red background. Additional brands that also will
feature the sleek mini can packaging include: Sprite, Fanta Orange, Cherry
Coca-Cola and Barq`s Root Beer. It will be sold in eight-packs. 

Consumers in Washington, D.C. and New York City will get a first glimpse of the
90-calorie sleek mini can when it debuts in December. The rollout will expand to
the rest of the country and be well underway by March 2010. 

"The Coca-Cola mini can is a great option for smaller thirst occasions, and for
calorie-conscious consumers," said Hendrik Steckhan, president and general
manager, Sparkling Beverages, Coca-Cola North America. "Our new sleek mini can
supports the idea of moderation and offers people yet another way to enjoy their
favorite Coca-Cola beverage." 

The package introduction comes in the wake of a recent global commitment from
Coca-Cola to put calories front-of-package on nearly all its products. Coca-Cola
also recently announced a new partnership with the Healthy Weight Commitment
Foundation, which advocates a common-sense approach to helping reduce obesity by
2015. A core objective of the group is to remind consumers that achieving and
maintaining a healthy weight is about balancing the calories consumed in a
sensible diet with calories expended through physical activity. 

"Research shows that calories count when trying to lose or maintain weight, so
this 90-calorie mini can is another way for people who love Coca-Cola to get the
taste they enjoy while managing their calories - taste, refreshment and
hydration all in one can," said Dr. Rhona Applebaum, chief scientific and
regulatory officer, The Coca-Cola Company.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co has gradually increased the risk it takes trading commodities and the second-largest U.S. bank is approaching levels last seen before the financial crisis rocked global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which reported earnings on Wednesday, has increased the risk it takes in commodities by about 36 percent since the first quarter of 2009 but levels are down 7 percent from this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think you're seeing momentum in the markets now but momentum is something that could be a vicious thing. It can help you or kill you," said Matt McCormick, a banking analyst at Bahl  Gaynor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk is typically measured by the maximum amount of money a bank could lose in a single day, or its value-at-risk (VaR). In the third quarter of 2009, JPMorgan risked $38 million a day, up from $34 million in the second quarter and $28 million in the first quarter. At this time last year, JPMorgan's VaR was $41 million. It was as high as $46 million in the third quarter of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts read that as a sign of JPMorgan's caution over trading risks since the financial crisis erupted, despite the rebound in financial markets. Aside from its commodities exposure, JPMorgan's VaR in equities was down 65 percent from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a widely watched barometer for commodities, hit 11-month highs on Wednesday. The SP 500 index of top U.S. stocks is up 20 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political pressure could also be a reason for JPMorgan to contain its risk appetite, McCormick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My guess is that while they want to be in a sweet spot where they can have their commodity trades accredited to earnings, they don't want their VaR to increase dramatically and be potentially detrimental to future earnings," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think anybody wants to go through another situation where they have to have capital raises, especially with politicians focusing on the type of risks they've had."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan did not give a breakdown for its commodity earnings. But it said trading gains from fixed income markets -- which usually includes commodities -- rose to $5 billion, up from $800 million a year earlier. It posted a third-quarter net income of $3.6 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $527 million, or 9 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's commodities operations also expanded in the third quarter, with headhunters reporting that it hired four coal industry specialists for its London operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the first among Wall Street banks to report third-quarter results. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are due to report on Thursday and Bank of America on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
has gradually increased the risk it takes trading commodities
and the second-largest U.S. bank is approaching levels last
seen before the financial crisis rocked global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which reported earnings on Wednesday, has
increased the risk it takes in commodities by about 36 percent
since the first quarter of 2009 but levels are down 7 percent
from this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think you're seeing momentum in the markets now but
momentum is something that could be a vicious thing. It can
help you or kill you," said Matt McCormick, a banking analyst
at Bahl  Gaynor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Risk is typically measured by the maximum amount of money a
bank could lose in a single day, or its value-at-risk (VaR). In
the third quarter of 2009, JPMorgan risked $38 million a day,
up from $34 million in the second quarter and $28 million in
the first quarter. At this time last year, JPMorgan's VaR was
$41 million. It was as high as $46 million in the third quarter
of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts read that as a sign of JPMorgan's caution over
trading risks since the financial crisis erupted, despite the
rebound in financial markets. Aside from its commodities
exposure, JPMorgan's VaR in equities was down 65 percent from a
year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index .CRB, a widely watched
barometer for commodities, hit 11-month highs on Wednesday
[ID:nWEN4664]. The SP 500 index of top U.S. stocks is up 20
percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Political pressure could also be a reason for JPMorgan to
contain its risk appetite, McCormick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My guess is that while they want to be in a sweet spot
where they can have their commodity trades accredited to
earnings, they don't want their VaR to increase dramatically
and be potentially detrimental to future earnings," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think anybody wants to go through another
situation where they have to have capital raises, especially
with politicians focusing on the type of risks they've had."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan did not give a breakdown for its commodity
earnings. But it said trading gains from fixed income markets
-- which usually includes commodities -- rose to $5 billion, up
from $800 million a year earlier. It posted a third-quarter net
income of $3.6 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $527
million, or 9 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
[ID:nN13183184]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's commodities operations also expanded in the
third quarter, with headhunters reporting that it hired four
coal industry specialists for its London operations.
[ID:nN12142222]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is the first among Wall Street banks to report
third-quarter results. Citigroup (C.N) and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) are due to report on Thursday and Bank of America
(BAC.N) on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Lisa Shumaker)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 14 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said on
Wednesday it will launch 90-calorie mini cans of soda to help
consumers manage their calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's largest soft drink maker said the smaller
packages will be available for the Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta
Orange, Cherry Coca-Cola and Barq's Root Beer brands. The cans
will be sold in packages of eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mini cans will debut in New York and Washington D.C. in
December. Their nationwide roll-out should be "well under way"
by March, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Atlanta-based company said last month it would include
calorie information on the front of nearly all its packages as
it intensifies efforts to raise consumer awareness about
nutrition and a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moves come in the wake of increasingly vocal calls in
Washington for taxes on sugary drinks and junk food to help
fight the problem of obesity in the United States.

&lt;p&gt;New Mini PackagingOption Allows Consumers to Open a Little Happiness and Better
Manage What They Drink


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
A little happiness in a stylish new package is coming soon to your refrigerator.
Coca-Cola today introduced a new 90-calorie sleek mini can to give consumers a
better way to manage their calories. 

"As the world`s largest beverage company, we take seriously the need to help
consumers balance calories consumed with calories expended," said Sandy Douglas,
president, Coca-Cola North America. "The Coca-Cola mini can innovation
reinforces the Company`s support for healthy, active lifestyles." 

The 7.5-fluid ounce mini can carries the distinct Coca-Cola contour-shaped
bottle image in white with a red background. Additional brands that also will
feature the sleek mini can packaging include: Sprite, Fanta Orange, Cherry
Coca-Cola and Barq`s Root Beer. It will be sold in eight-packs. 

Consumers in Washington, D.C. and New York City will get a first glimpse of the
90-calorie sleek mini can when it debuts in December. The rollout will expand to
the rest of the country and be well underway by March 2010. 

"The Coca-Cola mini can is a great option for smaller thirst occasions, and for
calorie-conscious consumers," said Hendrik Steckhan, president and general
manager, Sparkling Beverages, Coca-Cola North America. "Our new sleek mini can
supports the idea of moderation and offers people yet another way to enjoy their
favorite Coca-Cola beverage." 

The package introduction comes in the wake of a recent global commitment from
Coca-Cola to put calories front-of-package on nearly all its products. Coca-Cola
also recently announced a new partnership with the Healthy Weight Commitment
Foundation, which advocates a common-sense approach to helping reduce obesity by
2015. A core objective of the group is to remind consumers that achieving and
maintaining a healthy weight is about balancing the calories consumed in a
sensible diet with calories expended through physical activity. 

"Research shows that calories count when trying to lose or maintain weight, so
this 90-calorie mini can is another way for people who love Coca-Cola to get the
taste they enjoy while managing their calories - taste, refreshment and
hydration all in one can," said Dr. Rhona Applebaum, chief scientific and
regulatory officer, The Coca-Cola Company.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 14 (Reuters) - European shares surged to their

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/5139dc/the_jpeg_2000_suit) has
announced the addition of John Wiley and Sons Ltd's new report "The JPEG 2000
Suite" to their offering. 

The JPEG 2000 Suite provides a comprehensive overview of the baseline JPEG 2000
standard and its extensions. The first part of the book sets out the core coding
system, additions to the standard and reference software. The second part
discusses the successful deployment of JPEG 2000 in application domains such as
video surveillance, digital cinema, digital television, medical imaging, defence
imaging, security, geographic imaging and remote sensing, digital culture
imaging and 3D graphics. The book also presents implementation strategies
accompanied by existing software and hardware solutions.

* Describes secure JPEG 2000 (JPSEC), interactivity protocols (JPIP), volumetric
image data compression (JP3D) and image compression in wireless environments
(JPWL), amongst others. 
* Uses a structure which allows for easy cross-reference with the components of
the standard. 
* Sets out practical implementation examples and results. 
* Examines strategies for future image compression techniques, including
Advanced Image Coding and JPEG XR. 
* Includes contributions from international specialists in industry and academia
who have worked on the development of the JPEG 2000 standard.

The JPEG 2000 Suite is an excellent introduction to the JPEG 2000 standard and
is of great appeal to practising electronics engineers, researchers, and
hardware and software developers using and developing image coding techniques.
Graduate students taking courses on image compression, digital archiving, and
data storage techniques will also find the book useful, as will graphic
designers, artists, and decision makers in industries developing digital
applications.

Wednesday after JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) posted a surge in
profit, following stronger numbers from Intel Corp (INTC.O) a
day earlier in an auspicious start to third-quarter earnings
season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the first major U.S. bank to report quarterly
earnings, said profit rose sharply as underwriting revenue at
its investment bank offset deeper losses on credit cards and
other consumer loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's profit and the stronger outlook from chip maker
Intel set an early tone for earnings that many expect to
underscore the stock market's seven-month rally and the
prospects for economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "It's a really good start. These are major companies

Eric Kuby, chief investment officer for North Star Investment

over, a government report showed total sales at U.S. retailers

&lt;p&gt;Burton Group Research Lists the `Short List` of Players in the Productivity
Suite Market
SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
Burton Group, a research and consulting firm focused on in-depth analysis of
enterprise information technologies, says that the productivity suite market is
in the midst of a rebirth. 

After years of quiet, the productivity suite market is now active, bolstered by
new competitors, more price points, more delivery models, and a broader vision
of functionality. Although Microsoft remains the market leader, it is being
challenged by suppliers on Burton Group`s 'Short List' including IBM,
OpenOffice.org, and Sun. 

The productivity suite market will continue to evolve, with changes occurring on
four fronts: lower and value-based pricing, simpler licensing, a combination of
SaaS and software delivery models, and the addition of document sharing and
collaboration features. These changes are bringing new players to the
marketplace. 

In the report "Market InSight: Productivity Suites 2009," Burton Group analyst
Guy Creese notes, "This is not the productivity suite market of four years ago,
and enterprises should make sure they know their options. Otherwise, they may be
squandering their money, their productivity, or both." 

Join Burton Group analyst Guy Creese on a complimentary webcast for an overview
of the productivity suite market and follow the Burton Group Blog: Content and
Collaboration Blog for industry news.

profit following stronger numbers from Intel Corp (INTC.O) a
day earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the first major U.S. bank to report quarterly
earnings, said profit rose sharply as underwriting revenue at
its investment bank offset deeper losses on credit cards and
other consumer loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's profit and a stronger outlook from chip maker
Intel Corp late on Tuesday lifted futures and set the tone for

a little bit of growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares rose 4.2 percent to $47.56 in premarket
trade and Intel shares added 4.3 percent to $21.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Underscoring optimism that the worst of the recession was

points, and Nasdaq futures NDc1 rose 24.50 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil rose for a fifth straight day on Wednesday to a 2009

  (Adds comment, quote; changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jessica Mortimer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The dollar slid to a 14-month low
against a basket of currencies and the euro on Wednesday, dented
as solid JPMorgan Chase results, rising equities and commodities
stoked optimism about an improving global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) reported a sharp rise in
third-quarter results as underwriting revenue at its investment
bank offset deeper losses on credit cards and other consumer
loans. [ID:nLE225971]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The buoyant results followed forecast-beating earnings from
Intel Corp (INTC.O) late on Tuesday and upbeat Chinese trade
data on Wednesday, all of which helped brighten the economic
outlook and encouraged investors to move into perceived riskier
and higher-yielding currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. dollar meanwhile remained under broad selling
pressure on the view that U.S. interest rates will stay at very
low levels for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Anything that points to a global recovery is hurting the
dollar at the moment," said James Hughes, market analyst at CMC
Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "The JP Morgan results were pretty good and that has helped
drag it lower still," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The better-than-forecast results from JP Morgan and Intel
Corp helped push the MSCI all-country world index
.MIWD00000PUS to a one-year high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

world stocks, click here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1150 GMT, the euro EUR= had hit $1.4921 according to
trading platform EBS, its highest since August 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many in the market see the euro climbing higher and some
analysts see a break above $1.50 in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the dollar's value
against a basket of currencies, slid to 75.436, a trough last
seen in August 2008. The Swiss franc CHF= rose to around
1.0167 francs versus the dollar, its highest since July 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Australian and Canadian dollars AUD=D4 CAD=D4 also
hit their strongest since August 2008, while the Norwegian crown
NOK= rose to its firmest since September 2008 as U.S. crude

[O/R] [GOL/]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEGATIVE DOLLAR SENTIMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said negative dollar sentiment was the day's main
driver, adding that data showing a 0.9 percent month-on-month
rise in euro zone output offset a poll showing a fall in German
sentiment on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today's data eased some concerns about the euro zone
economy after yesterday's weak ZEW survey," said Jeremy Stretch,
strategist at Rabobank in London, adding that this had helped to
prod the euro higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also pressuring the dollar were comments from Federal
Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, who on Tuesday said the
economy would not snap back quickly from its deep recession,
bolstering the view for low U.S. rates. [ID:nN13198041]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Next up, U.S. retail sales for September will be released at
1230 GMT. Expectations are for a 2.1 percent fall from August,
when sales rose 2.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said higher share prices would continue to pummel
the dollar on the view that an improving economy would decrease
demand for safe-haven dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have seen the correlation between the equity market and
euro/dollar has declined slightly in the past month, but it is
still high by historical standards," said Kasper Kirkegaard,
currency strategist at Danske Markets in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Elsewhere, the yen pared some of its earlier gains after
earlier drawing support from a senior Japanese official who
signalled yen-weakening intervention was undesirable.

&lt;p&gt;NORTH ANDOVER, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Converse today announced the launch of the Weapon Evo, an all-new, court-ready,
basketball shoe evolved from the original Weapon, which was worn by superstars
during the game's "Golden Age." The Weapon Evo will be branded with the iconic
Star Chevron logo, which will now be the primary logo on all Converse basketball
footwear. 

"The Star Chevron logo represents a defining time in basketball history," said
Geoff Cottrill, Chief Marketing Officer. "This logo first appeared on footwear
when players changed basketball by bringing their unique style to the sport.
Converse still stands for that today and we celebrate those who create positive
change and challenge the status quo." 

The shoe's design is inspired from the original Weapon. It features an ankle
support Y-bar and the original "broken Herringbone" traction pattern that allows
increased grip. The iconic Weapon toe and heel overlays, along with bold color
blockings, give the shoe a retro look for off-court appeal. 

The Weapon Evo also debuts Converse Balls Technology, an all-new cushioning
system in the shoe's heel that provides excellent impact protection. The heel of
the shoe has several polyurethane balls that rebound and push back when
compressed during play. The cushioning system creates unique, low profile
support that reacts to the athlete's foot as it responds to the demands of the
game. The balls are enclosed in a clear TPU cage to provide stability and
attractive visible technology. The Evo also features a perforated leather upper
for enhanced breathability, fit and feel and an additional lateral support
overlay to help contain splay during hard cuts. 

The Weapon Evo brings Converse's independent attitude to players, both pro and
pick-up - with Converse Balls Technology and a refreshed design that brings
Converse heritage to today's game. Converse introduced the Weapon Evo to
musicians this summer at the first-ever Band of Ballers tournament. Jim Jones,
Asher Roth, Pac Div, Matt and Kim and others laced up the Weapon Evo and squared
off on the court in gritty 3-on-3 contents where Jim Jones walked away a
champion. Content from the event is posted online in webisodes on Converse.com. 

The Weapon Evo hit stores with two premium colorways that pay homage to the
original Weapon, worn by two of basketball's greatest on-court rivals. The
premium colorways retail for MSRP $90 and are available now at select Finish
Line stores, FinishLine.com and Converse.com. The Weapon Evo will continue to
roll out in nine team colorways for MSRP $80 at nationwide sports specialty
retailers in September. Two additional in-line colorways roll out for MSRP $80
at nationwide sports specialty retailers in October 2009. The Weapon Evo is also
available on converse.com.

&lt;p&gt;  * Sentiment boosted by JPMorgan, Intel results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  * For up-to-the-minute market news, click [STXNEWS/US]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Updates with JPMorgan results)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Edward Krudy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
pointed to a rise of more than 1 percent at the open on
Wednesday after JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) posted a surge in
profit following stronger numbers from Intel Corp (INTC.O) a
day earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the first major U.S. bank to report quarterly
earnings, said profit rose sharply as underwriting revenue at
its investment bank offset deeper losses on credit cards and
other consumer loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's profit and a stronger outlook from chip maker
Intel Corp (INTC.O)  late on Tuesday lifted futures and set the
tone for a a much-anticipated earnings season that many expect
to underscore the stock market's seven-month rally and the
prospects for economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Obviously the (JPMorgan) results look much better than
expected, on both the top line and the bottom line. It's an old
leader in the industry, but it certainly delivered," said Peter
Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak  Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares rose about 4 percent in premarket trade on
the better-than-expected results. Intel shares rose 4.7
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 rose 14.60 points and were above
fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 rose 118
points, and Nasdaq futures NDc1 rose 23.00 points.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co reported a nearly seven-fold increase in third-quarter results as strong results at its investment bank offset rising losses on credit cards and other consumer loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second largest U.S. bank reported net income for common shareholders of $3.6 billion, or 82 cents a share. That compares with $527 million, or 9 cents, in the year ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average forecast earnings of 52 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were up 2.8 percent in premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANTON SCHUTZ, PRESIDENT, MENDON CAPITAL, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like a lot of the beat was in fixed income. I still see JPMorgan as being the first big bank to restore dividends. Their capital ratios look pretty healthy. If their numbers keep getting stronger, which I think they will, they'll be overcapitalized relatively soon. I could see them restoring dividends this quarter, or next quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEITH BOWMAN, ANALYST AT HARGREAVE, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't come as a surprise that they've posted positive results -- you'd have to say the sort of trading environment we've had over the last few months would certainly appear to have suited someone like JPMorgan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVID MORRISON, MARKET STRATEGIST AT GFT MARKETS, LONON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have got JPMorgan today, we have got Goldman Sachs tomorrow. They are in a golden situation at the moment where you have got a very steep yield curve, although there isn't much volatility in the market. There has been a lessening of competition within the investment banking arena. Activity is basically picking up. There has been expectation that both banks should do very well. Certainly JPMorgan results today have shown that expectation was completely warranted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GEOFF WILKINSON, HEAD OF INVESTMENT RESEARC AT MINT, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results are very good for the sector. It is very hard to sell the market at all if we're seeing the main U.S. banking indices also very near their highs. It's an absolutely definitive catalyst for a positive market and has a very positive impact on sentiment. The one point is that if the broad U.S. banking indices are supported by this then everything else will be supported as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL HOLLAND, PRESIDENT OF HOLLAND  CO IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is off-the-charts performance. This is stellar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their fortress balance sheet continues to be the envy of the rest of the banking industry. If things don't get dramatically better in the economy, once again this kind of performance continues to separate JPMorgan from several of its competitors because of the ability to make a fortress balance sheet even better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One would be surprised that Jamie Dimon and his management team was able to surprise so positively, since they have surprised so positively in the past. In this environment, this is a championship performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think you can infer from this that the financial sector is home free at this point. To the contrary, it shows one thing -- JPMorgan has performed brilliantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST AT MILLER TABAK  CO IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously the results look much better than expected, on both the top line and the bottom line. It's an old leader in the industry, but it certainly delivered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ryan Vlastelica, Tricia Wright, Dominic Lau, Harpreet Bhal and Steve Eder)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Mylan can launch generic Vfend in U.S. in Q1 2011&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Co believes it will get 180 days as lone generic seller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 14 (Reuters) - Mylan Inc (MYL.O) will have
the right to start selling a U.S. generic version of Pfizer
Inc's (PFE.N) Vfend antifungal drug in the first quarter of
2011 under a settlement and licensing agreement, Mylan said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement relates to the 50 milligram and 200-mg doses
of Vfend, known generically as voriconazole. Those dosages had
U.S. sales of $164 million for the year through June, Mylan
said, making it a small seller for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Mylan believes it will be entitled to 180 days as
the lone generic marketer of generic Vfend once it launches, a
reward granted to companies that challenge patents, making it a
more lucrative opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mylan, the world's No. 3 generic drugmaker, declined to
release further details of the agreement, which is subject to
the review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported third-quarter 2009 net income of
$3.6 billion, compared with net income of $527 million in the third quarter of
2008. Earnings per share were $0.82, compared with $0.09 in the prior year. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "Our net income of
$3.6 billion in the quarter reflected the strong earnings power of the company,
with broad-based growth across the Investment Bank, Asset Management, Commercial
Banking and Retail Banking. However, credit costs remain high and are expected
to stay elevated for the foreseeable future in the Consumer Lending and Card
Services loan portfolios. Accordingly, we have added $2.0 billion to our
consumer credit reserves, bringing the firmwide total to $31.5 billion, or 5.3%1
of total loans. Tier 1 Common Capital, another key element of our fortress
balance sheet, was also strengthened through capital generation during the
quarter, to $101 billion, or 8.2%." 

Dimon further remarked: "JPMorgan Chase continues to help consumers and
communities in this challenging economy. We recently announced the decision to
revamp our overdraft policies to make it easier for customers to have more
control over the fees they pay. In addition, our Card Services business has
developed new innovative products that enhance the way customers manage their
spending and borrowing. We are also aiding communities by working with
struggling mortgage customers to modify their loans. We have approved more than
262,000 new trial modifications under the U.S. Making Home Affordable Program
and our own modification program, nearly 90% of which include a reduction in
payments for the homeowner. Since 2007, we have helped families by initiating
782,000 actions to prevent foreclosure, and we are committed to doing our part
to support economic recovery going forward." 

Discussing the firm`s outlook, Dimon concluded: "While we are seeing some
initial signs of consumer credit stability, we are not yet certain that this
trend will continue. Despite this near-term uncertainty about the path of the
economy, our strong capital position and underlying earnings power will enable
us to continue to invest in our businesses, creating a lasting franchise for
many years to come." 

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded; and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line
of business, see page 12.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion from the third quarter
of 2008. These results included the negative impact of the tightening of the
firm`s credit spread, offset by the positive impact of counterparty spread
tightening and gains on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage-related positions.


Net revenue was $7.5 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 85%, from the
prior year. Investment banking fees were up 4% to $1.7 billion, consisting of
equity underwriting fees of $681 million (up 31%), debt underwriting fees of
$593 million (up 19%) and advisory fees of $384 million (down 33%). Fixed Income
Markets revenue was $5.0 billion, up by $4.2 billion, reflecting strong results
across most products and gains of approximately $400 million on legacy leveraged
lending and mortgage-related positions, compared with markdowns of $3.6 billion
in the prior year. These results also included losses of $497 million from the
tightening of the firm`s credit spread on certain structured liabilities,
compared with gains of $343 million in the prior year from the widening of the
spread on those liabilities.Equity Markets revenue was $941 million, down by
$709 million, or 43%, which included losses of $343 million from the tightening
of the firm`s credit spread on certain structured liabilities, compared with
gains in the prior year of $429 million from the widening of the spread on those
liabilities. The current period`s results also included solid client revenue,
particularly in prime services, and strong trading results. Credit Portfolio
revenue was a loss of $102 million, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges
of retained loans, largely offset by a combination of the positive net impact of
credit spreads on derivative assets and liabilities, and net interest income on
loans. 

The provision for credit losses increased to $379 million, compared with $234
million in the prior year. The increase in the provision reflected higher
charge-offs of $750 million, partially offset by a reduction of $371 million in
the allowance for credit losses. The resulting allowance for loan losses to
end-of-period loans retained was 8.44%, compared with 3.62% in the prior year.
Nonperforming loans were $4.9 billion, up by $4.5 billion from the prior year
and $1.4 billion from the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $4.3 billion, up by $458 million, or 12%, from the prior
year. The increase was driven by higher performance-based compensation,
partially offset by lower headcount-related expense1.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $7 million, a decrease of $57 million from the third quarter of
2008, as an increase in the provision for credit losses was largely offset by
the positive impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Compared with the
prior quarter, net income decreased by $8 million, reflecting a decrease in
mortgage production revenue, an increase in the provision for credit losses,
higher noninterest expense and lower loan balances; these effects were largely
offset by positive MSR risk management results and wider loan and deposit
spreads. 

Net revenue was $8.2 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion, or 66%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $5.2 billion, up by $1.9 billion, or 60%,
reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan spreads
and higher deposit balances offset partially by lower loan balances. Noninterest
revenue was $3.1 billion, up by $1.3 billion, or 77%, driven by the impact of
the Washington Mutual transaction, higher net mortgage servicing revenue and
higher deposit-related fees, partially offset by lower mortgage production
revenue. 

The provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion
from the prior year. Weak economic conditions and housing price declines
continued to drive higher estimated losses for the home equity and mortgage loan
portfolios. The provision included an addition of $1.4 billion to the allowance
for loan losses, compared with additions of $730 million in the prior year and
$1.2 billion in the prior quarter. Included in the third-quarter 2009 addition
to the allowance for loan losses was a $1.1 billion increase related to
estimated deterioration in the Washington Mutual purchased credit-impaired
portfolio. Home equity net charge-offs were $1.1 billion (4.25% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $663 million (2.78% net charge-off rate) in the prior
year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $422 million (12.31% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $273 million (7.65% net charge-off rate) in the prior
year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs were $525 million (3.45% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $177 million (1.79% net charge-off rate) in the prior
year. 

Noninterest expense was $4.2 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 51%. The
increase reflected the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher
servicing expense, partially offset by lower mortgage reinsurance losses. 

Retail Banking reported net income of $1.0 billion, up by $320 million, or 44%,
from the prior year. Compared with the prior quarter, net income increased by
$73 million, or 8%, due to a decline in the provision for credit losses, wider
deposit spreads and higher deposit-related fees; these were offset largely by
higher noninterest expense and lower deposit balances. 

Net revenue was $4.6 billion, up by $1.7 billion, or 61%, from the prior year.
The increase reflected the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
deposit balances, higher deposit-related fees and wider deposit spreads. 

The provision for credit losses was $208 million, compared with $70 million in
the prior year, reflecting higher estimated losses for Business Banking loans. 

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up by $1.1 billion, or 67%. The increase
reflected the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
headcount-related expense1 and higher FDIC insurance premiums.

 Key Metrics and Business Updates:

* Checking accounts totaled 25.5 million, up 4% from the prior year and 1% from
the prior quarter. 
* Average total deposits were $339.6 billion, up 62% from the prior year
(primarily due to the Washington Mutual transaction) and down 2% from the prior
quarter. 
* Deposit margin was 2.99%, compared with 3.06% in the prior year and 2.92% in
the prior quarter. 
* Average Business Banking and other loans were $17.7 billion, compared with
$16.6 billion in the prior year, and originations were $589 million, compared
with $1.2 billion in the prior year. 
* Branch sales of credit cards were down 16% from the prior year and 18% from
the prior quarter. 
* Branch sales of investment products increased by 42% from the prior year and
18% from the prior quarter. 
* Overhead ratio (excluding amortization of core deposit intangibles) was 56%,
compared with 52% in the prior year and 55% in the prior quarter. 
* Number of branches declined to 5,126, down 5% from the prior year and 1% from
the prior quarter, primarily due to Washington Mutual branch consolidation. 
* Successfully completed the second phase of Washington Mutual deposit
conversions, migrating nearly 8 million consumer banking and small business
accounts across 694 branches onto the Chase deposit platform.

Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $1.0 billion, compared with a net loss
of $659 million in the prior year and $955 million in the prior quarter.
Compared with the prior quarter, results decreased by $81 million, reflecting a
decrease in mortgage production revenue, an increase in the provision for credit
losses and lower loan balances, largely offset by higher MSR risk management
results and wider loan spreads. 

Net revenue was $3.6 billion, up by $1.5 billion, or 72%, from the prior year.
The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
higher mortgage fees and related income and wider loan spreads, partially offset
by lower loan balances. Mortgage production revenue was negative $70 million,
compared with positive $66 million in the prior year, as an increase in reserves
for the repurchase of previously-sold loans was predominantly offset by wider
margins on new originations. Operating revenue, which represents loan servicing
revenue net of other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, was $508 million,
compared with $264 million in the prior year, reflecting growth in average
third-party loans serviced as a result of the Washington Mutual transaction. MSR
risk management results were $435 million, compared with $108 million in the
prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, compared with $2.0 billion in
the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the home equity and mortgage
loan portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for
credit losses, above, for further detail). 

Noninterest expense was $1.6 billion, up by $351 million, or 29%, from the prior
year, reflecting higher servicing expense due to increased delinquencies and
defaults and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, partially offset
by lower mortgage reinsurance losses.

Discussion of Results:

Card Services reported a net loss of $700 million, a decline of $992 million
from the third quarter of 2008. The decrease was driven by a higher provision
for credit losses, partially offset by higher net revenue. 

End-of-period managed loans were $165.2 billion, a decrease of $21.3 billion, or
11%, from the prior year and $6.3 billion, or 4%, from the prior quarter. The
decrease from the prior year was due to lower charge volume and a higher level
of charge-offs. Average managed loans were $169.2 billion, an increase of $11.6
billion, or 7%, from the prior year and a decrease of $4.9 billion, or 3%, from
the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
end-of-period and average managed loans were $144.1 billion and $146.9 billion,
respectively. 

Managed net revenue was $5.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 33%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $4.3 billion, up by $1.1 billion, or
34%, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and wider loan
spreads. These benefits were offset partially by higher revenue reversals
associated with higher charge-offs, lower average loan balances and a decreased
level of fees. Noninterest revenue was $831 million, up by $185 million, or 29%.
The increase was driven by higher merchant servicing revenue related to the
dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture and the impact of
the Washington Mutual transaction. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $5.0 billion, an increase of $2.7
billion from the prior year, reflecting a higher level of charge-offs and an
increase of $575 million in the allowance for loan losses. The managed net
charge-off rate for the quarter was 10.30%, up from 5.00% in the prior year and
10.03% in the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 5.99%, up
from 3.91% in the prior year and 5.86% in the prior quarter. Excluding the
impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, the managed net charge-off rate for
the third quarter was 9.41%, and the 30-day delinquency rate was 5.38%. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $112 million, or 9%, from
the prior year, due to the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint
venture and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $341 million, an increase of $29 million, or 9%, from the third
quarter of 2008. Higher net revenue, reflecting the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction, was predominantly offset by a higher provision for credit
losses and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of $334 million, or 30%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $985 million, up by $248 million, or 34%,
driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Excluding Washington
Mutual, net interest income was flat compared with the prior year, as spread
compression on liability products and lower loan balances were offset by wider
loan spreads, a shift to higher-spread liability products and overall growth in
liability balances. Noninterest revenue was $474 million, an increase of $86
million, or 22%, reflecting higher lending- and deposit-related fees. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $771 million, an increase of $42 million,
or 6%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $232
million, an increase of $8 million, or 4%, from the prior quarter. Revenue from
Mid-Corporate Banking was $278 million, an increase of $42 million, or 18%, from
the prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $121 million, an increase
of $30 million, or 33%, from the prior year due to the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction. 

The provision for credit losses was $355 million, compared with $126 million in
the prior year, reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment
across all business segments, particularly real estate-related segments. Net
charge-offs were $291 million (1.11% net charge-off rate), compared with $40
million (0.22% net charge-off rate) in the prior year and $181 million (0.67%
net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. The allowance for loan losses to
end-of-period loans retained was 3.01%, up from 2.30% in the prior year and
2.87% in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were $2.3 billion, up by $1.5
billion from the prior year and up by $191 million from the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $545 million, an increase of $59 million, or 12%, from
the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and
higher FDIC insurance premiums.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $302 million, a decrease of $104 million, or 26%, from the third
quarter of 2008. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue offset partially
by lower noninterest expense. Net income decreased by $77 million, or 20%, from
the prior quarter, reflecting a decline of seasonal activity in securities
lending and depositary receipts. 

Net revenue was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $165 million, or 8%, from the prior
year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $869 million, a decrease of
$138 million, or 14%. The decrease was driven by lower securities lending
balances, primarily as a result of declines in asset valuations and demand,
lower spreads and balances on liability products, and the effect of market
depreciation on certain custody assets. Treasury Services net revenue was $919
million, a decrease of $27 million, or 3%. The decrease reflected spread
compression on deposit products offset by higher trade revenue driven by wider
spreads, and higher card product volumes. TSS firmwide net revenue, which
includes net revenue recorded in other lines of business, was $2.5 billion, a
decrease of $149 million, or 6%, primarily due to declines in Worldwide
Securities Services. Treasury Services firmwide net revenue was $1.7 billion,
flat compared with the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $13 million, a decrease of $5 million from
the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $59 million, or 4%. The
decrease reflected lower headcount-related expense1, partially offset by higher
FDIC insurance premiums.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $430 million, an increase of $79 million, or 23%, from the third
quarter of 2008, as higher net revenue and lower noninterest expense were offset
partially by a higher provision for credit losses. 

Net revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of $124 million, or 6%, from the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of $100 million, or 6%,
due to gains on the firm`s seed capital investments and net inflows, largely
offset by the effect of lower market levels and decreased placement fees. Net
interest income was $404 million, up by $24 million, or 6%, from the prior year,
due to wider loan spreads and higher deposit balances, largely offset by
narrower deposit spreads and lower loan balances. 

Revenue from the Private Bank was $639 million, up 1%, from the prior year.
Revenue from Institutional was $534 million, up 10%. Revenue from Retail was
$471 million, up 18%. Revenue from Private Wealth Management was $339 million,
down 4%. Revenue from Bear Stearns Private Client Services was $102 million, up
10%. 

Assets under supervision were $1.7 trillion, an increase of $108 billion, or 7%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.3 trillion, an increase of
$106 billion, or 9%. The increases were due to inflows in liquidity, fixed
income and equity products, partially offset by the effect of lower market
levels and outflows in alternative products. Custody, brokerage, administration
and deposit balances were $411 billion, up by $2 billion, due to brokerage
inflows in the Private Bank, partially offset by the effect of lower market
levels on custody and brokerage balances. 

The provision for credit losses was $38 million, an increase of $18 million from
the prior year, reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, down by $11 million, or 1%, from the prior
year. The decrease was due to lower headcount-related expense1, offset by higher
performance-based compensation and higher FDIC insurance premiums.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $3.6 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion from the third quarter
of 2008. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, partially
offset by increases to both the provision for credit losses and noninterest
expense. 

Managed net revenue was $28.8 billion, an increase of $12.7 billion, or 79%,
from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $14.0 billion, up by $8.7 billion,
or 167%. The increase was driven by higher principal transactions, primarily
related to the absence of markdowns on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage
positions and strong trading results in the Investment Bank, as well as higher
investment portfolio trading income in Corporate. These results also benefited
from the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Net interest income was
$14.8 billion, up by $3.9 billion, or 36%, due to the impact of Washington
Mutual, wider loan spreads and higher investment portfolio net interest income. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $9.8 billion, up by $3.1 billion, or
47%, from the prior year. The consumer-managed provision for credit losses was
$9.0 billion, compared with $5.7 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher
net charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for credit losses in the home
lending and credit card loan portfolios. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were
$7.0 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in the prior year, resulting in managed
net charge-off rates of 6.29% and 3.39%, respectively. The wholesale provision
for credit losses was $779 million, compared with $962 million in the prior
year. The current-quarter provision reflected higher net charge-offs, partially
offset by a reduction in allowance in the Investment Bank. Wholesale net
charge-offs were $1.1 billion, compared with $52 million in the prior year,
resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.93% and 0.10%, respectively. The firm`s
nonperforming assets totaled $20.4 billion at September 30, 2009, up from the
prior-year level of $9.5 billion. 

Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion, up by $2.3 billion, or 21%, from the
prior year. The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction and higher performance-based compensation expense, partially offset
by lower headcount-related expense1.

1. Notes on financial measures:

a. In addition to analyzing the firm`s results on a reported basis, management
analyzes the firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a
managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm`s definition of
managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the
following adjustments. 

First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of
credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit
losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services
results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been
securitized and sold still remain on the balance sheet, and that the earnings on
the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on
retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of
managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial
performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded
and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and
capital, based on managed financial information. In addition, the same
underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on
the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the
sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing
customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards;
accordingly, the customer`s credit performance will affect both the securitized
loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes
managed-basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand
both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet
and the firm`s retained interests in securitized loans. 

Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each
of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax
credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the
comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The
corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income
tax expense. 

See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase`s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (third
quarter 2009) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase`s income statement from a
reported basis to a managed basis. 

b.The ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes
the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale;
purchased credit-impaired loans; the allowance for loan losses related to
purchased-credit impaired loans; and, loans from the Washington Mutual Master
Trust, which were consolidated on the firm's balance sheet at fair value during
second quarter of 2009. Additionally, Consumer Lending net charge-off rates
exclude purchased credit-impaired loans. The allowance related to the purchased
credit-impaired portfolio was $1.1 billion at September 30, 2009. 

c. Tier 1 Common Capital ("Tier 1 Common") is calculated, for all purposes, as
Tier 1 Capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust
preferred securities and qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries. 

d. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits, and other
noncompensation costs related to employees. 

e. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total
net revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into
consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate
the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective
competitors.

 (b) Effective January 1, 2009, the Firm implemented new FASB guidance for participating securities. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been revised as required. For further discussion of the guidance, see Per share-related information on page 36 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement. 
 (c) The calculation of second quarter 2009 earnings per share includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital.                                                                                   
 (d) Ratios are based upon annualized amounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 (e) The calculation of second quarter 2009 net income applicable to common equity includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. Excluding this reduction the adjusted ROE and ROTCE were 6% and 10% for the second quarter 2009, respectively. The Firm views the adjusted ROE and ROTCE, non-GAAP financial measures, as meaningful because it increases the comparability to prior periods. 
 (f) Net income applicable to common equity divided by total average common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities. The Firm uses return on tangible common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of the Firm.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported third-quarter 2009 net income of
$3.6 billion, compared with net income of $527 million in the third quarter of
2008. Earnings per share were $0.82, compared with $0.09 in the prior year. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "Our net income of
$3.6 billion in the quarter reflected the strong earnings power of the company,
with broad-based growth across the Investment Bank, Asset Management, Commercial
Banking and Retail Banking. However, credit costs remain high and are expected
to stay elevated for the foreseeable future in the Consumer Lending and Card
Services loan portfolios. Accordingly, we have added $2.0 billion to our
consumer credit reserves, bringing the firmwide total to $31.5 billion, or 5.3%1
of total loans. Tier 1 Common Capital, another key element of our fortress
balance sheet, was also strengthened through capital generation during the
quarter, to $101 billion, or 8.2%." 

Dimon further remarked: "JPMorgan Chase continues to help consumers and
communities in this challenging economy. We recently announced the decision to
revamp our overdraft policies to make it easier for customers to have more
control over the fees they pay. In addition, our Card Services business has
developed new innovative products that enhance the way customers manage their
spending and borrowing. We are also aiding communities by working with
struggling mortgage customers to modify their loans. We have approved more than
262,000 new trial modifications under the U.S. Making Home Affordable Program
and our own modification program, nearly 90% of which include a reduction in
payments for the homeowner. Since 2007, we have helped families by initiating
782,000 actions to prevent foreclosure, and we are committed to doing our part
to support economic recovery going forward." 

Discussing the firm`s outlook, Dimon concluded: "While we are seeing some
initial signs of consumer credit stability, we are not yet certain that this
trend will continue. Despite this near-term uncertainty about the path of the
economy, our strong capital position and underlying earnings power will enable
us to continue to invest in our businesses, creating a lasting franchise for
many years to come." 

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded; and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line
of business, see page 12.

The following discussion compares the third quarter of 2009 with the third
quarter of 2008 unless otherwise noted.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion from the third quarter
of 2008. These results included the negative impact of the tightening of the
firm`s credit spread, offset by the positive impact of counterparty spread
tightening and gains on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage-related positions.


Net revenue was $7.5 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 85%, from the
prior year. Investment banking fees were up 4% to $1.7 billion, consisting of
equity underwriting fees of $681 million (up 31%), debt underwriting fees of
$593 million (up 19%) and advisory fees of $384 million (down 33%). Fixed Income
Markets revenue was $5.0 billion, up by $4.2 billion, reflecting strong results
across most products and gains of approximately $400 million on legacy leveraged
lending and mortgage-related positions, compared with markdowns of $3.6 billion
in the prior year. These results also included losses of $497 million from the
tightening of the firm`s credit spread on certain structured liabilities,
compared with gains of $343 million in the prior year from the widening of the
spread on those liabilities.Equity Markets revenue was $941 million, down by
$709 million, or 43%, which included losses of $343 million from the tightening
of the firm`s credit spread on certain structured liabilities, compared with
gains in the prior year of $429 million from the widening of the spread on those
liabilities. The current period`s results also included solid client revenue,
particularly in prime services, and strong trading results. Credit Portfolio
revenue was a loss of $102 million, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges
of retained loans, largely offset by a combination of the positive net impact of
credit spreads on derivative assets and liabilities, and net interest income on
loans. 

The provision for credit losses increased to $379 million, compared with $234
million in the prior year. The increase in the provision reflected higher
charge-offs of $750 million, partially offset by a reduction of $371 million in
the allowance for credit losses. The resulting allowance for loan losses to
end-of-period loans retained was 8.44%, compared with 3.62% in the prior year.
Nonperforming loans were $4.9 billion, up by $4.5 billion from the prior year
and $1.4 billion from the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $4.3 billion, up by $458 million, or 12%, from the prior
year. The increase was driven by higher performance-based compensation,
partially offset by lower headcount-related expense1.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $7 million, a decrease of $57 million from the third quarter of
2008, as an increase in the provision for credit losses was largely offset by
the positive impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Compared with the
prior quarter, net income decreased by $8 million, reflecting a decrease in
mortgage production revenue, an increase in the provision for credit losses,
higher noninterest expense and lower loan balances; these effects were largely
offset by positive MSR risk management results and wider loan and deposit
spreads. 

Net revenue was $8.2 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion, or 66%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $5.2 billion, up by $1.9 billion, or 60%,
reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan spreads
and higher deposit balances offset partially by lower loan balances. Noninterest
revenue was $3.1 billion, up by $1.3 billion, or 77%, driven by the impact of
the Washington Mutual transaction, higher net mortgage servicing revenue and
higher deposit-related fees, partially offset by lower mortgage production
revenue. 

The provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion
from the prior year. Weak economic conditions and housing price declines
continued to drive higher estimated losses for the home equity and mortgage loan
portfolios. The provision included an addition of $1.4 billion to the allowance
for loan losses, compared with additions of $730 million in the prior year and
$1.2 billion in the prior quarter. Included in the third-quarter 2009 addition
to the allowance for loan losses was a $1.1 billion increase related to
estimated deterioration in the Washington Mutual purchased credit-impaired
portfolio. Home equity net charge-offs were $1.1 billion (4.25% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $663 million (2.78% net charge-off rate) in the prior
year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $422 million (12.31% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $273 million (7.65% net charge-off rate) in the prior
year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs were $525 million (3.45% net charge-off
rate1), compared with $177 million (1.79% net charge-off rate) in the prior
year. 

Noninterest expense was $4.2 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 51%. The
increase reflected the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher
servicing expense, partially offset by lower mortgage reinsurance losses. 

Retail Banking reported net income of $1.0 billion, up by $320 million, or 44%,
from the prior year. Compared with the prior quarter, net income increased by
$73 million, or 8%, due to a decline in the provision for credit losses, wider
deposit spreads and higher deposit-related fees; these were offset largely by
higher noninterest expense and lower deposit balances. 

Net revenue was $4.6 billion, up by $1.7 billion, or 61%, from the prior year.
The increase reflected the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
deposit balances, higher deposit-related fees and wider deposit spreads. 

The provision for credit losses was $208 million, compared with $70 million in
the prior year, reflecting higher estimated losses for Business Banking loans. 

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up by $1.1 billion, or 67%. The increase
reflected the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
headcount-related expense1 and higher FDIC insurance premiums.

Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $1.0 billion, compared with a net loss
of $659 million in the prior year and $955 million in the prior quarter.
Compared with the prior quarter, results decreased by $81 million, reflecting a
decrease in mortgage production revenue, an increase in the provision for credit
losses and lower loan balances, largely offset by higher MSR risk management
results and wider loan spreads. 

Net revenue was $3.6 billion, up by $1.5 billion, or 72%, from the prior year.
The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
higher mortgage fees and related income and wider loan spreads, partially offset
by lower loan balances. Mortgage production revenue was negative $70 million,
compared with positive $66 million in the prior year, as an increase in reserves
for the repurchase of previously-sold loans was predominantly offset by wider
margins on new originations. Operating revenue, which represents loan servicing
revenue net of other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, was $508 million,
compared with $264 million in the prior year, reflecting growth in average
third-party loans serviced as a result of the Washington Mutual transaction. MSR
risk management results were $435 million, compared with $108 million in the
prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, compared with $2.0 billion in
the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the home equity and mortgage
loan portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for
credit losses, above, for further detail). 

Noninterest expense was $1.6 billion, up by $351 million, or 29%, from the prior
year, reflecting higher servicing expense due to increased delinquencies and
defaults and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, partially offset
by lower mortgage reinsurance losses.

Discussion of Results:

Card Services reported a net loss of $700 million, a decline of $992 million
from the third quarter of 2008. The decrease was driven by a higher provision
for credit losses, partially offset by higher net revenue. 

End-of-period managed loans were $165.2 billion, a decrease of $21.3 billion, or
11%, from the prior year and $6.3 billion, or 4%, from the prior quarter. The
decrease from the prior year was due to lower charge volume and a higher level
of charge-offs. Average managed loans were $169.2 billion, an increase of $11.6
billion, or 7%, from the prior year and a decrease of $4.9 billion, or 3%, from
the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
end-of-period and average managed loans were $144.1 billion and $146.9 billion,
respectively. 

Managed net revenue was $5.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 33%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $4.3 billion, up by $1.1 billion, or
34%, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and wider loan
spreads. These benefits were offset partially by higher revenue reversals
associated with higher charge-offs, lower average loan balances and a decreased
level of fees. Noninterest revenue was $831 million, up by $185 million, or 29%.
The increase was driven by higher merchant servicing revenue related to the
dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture and the impact of
the Washington Mutual transaction. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $5.0 billion, an increase of $2.7
billion from the prior year, reflecting a higher level of charge-offs and an
increase of $575 million in the allowance for loan losses. The managed net
charge-off rate for the quarter was 10.30%, up from 5.00% in the prior year and
10.03% in the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 5.99%, up
from 3.91% in the prior year and 5.86% in the prior quarter. Excluding the
impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, the managed net charge-off rate for
the third quarter was 9.41%, and the 30-day delinquency rate was 5.38%. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $112 million, or 9%, from
the prior year, due to the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint
venture and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $341 million, an increase of $29 million, or 9%, from the third
quarter of 2008. Higher net revenue, reflecting the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction, was predominantly offset by a higher provision for credit
losses and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of $334 million, or 30%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $985 million, up by $248 million, or 34%,
driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Excluding Washington
Mutual, net interest income was flat compared with the prior year, as spread
compression on liability products and lower loan balances were offset by wider
loan spreads, a shift to higher-spread liability products and overall growth in
liability balances. Noninterest revenue was $474 million, an increase of $86
million, or 22%, reflecting higher lending- and deposit-related fees. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $771 million, an increase of $42 million,
or 6%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $232
million, an increase of $8 million, or 4%, from the prior quarter. Revenue from
Mid-Corporate Banking was $278 million, an increase of $42 million, or 18%, from
the prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $121 million, an increase
of $30 million, or 33%, from the prior year due to the impact of the Washington
Mutual transaction. 

The provision for credit losses was $355 million, compared with $126 million in
the prior year, reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment
across all business segments, particularly real estate-related segments. Net
charge-offs were $291 million (1.11% net charge-off rate), compared with $40
million (0.22% net charge-off rate) in the prior year and $181 million (0.67%
net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. The allowance for loan losses to
end-of-period loans retained was 3.01%, up from 2.30% in the prior year and
2.87% in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were $2.3 billion, up by $1.5
billion from the prior year and up by $191 million from the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $545 million, an increase of $59 million, or 12%, from
the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and
higher FDIC insurance premiums.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $302 million, a decrease of $104 million, or 26%, from the third
quarter of 2008. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue offset partially
by lower noninterest expense. Net income decreased by $77 million, or 20%, from
the prior quarter, reflecting a decline of seasonal activity in securities
lending and depositary receipts. 

Net revenue was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $165 million, or 8%, from the prior
year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $869 million, a decrease of
$138 million, or 14%. The decrease was driven by lower securities lending
balances, primarily as a result of declines in asset valuations and demand,
lower spreads and balances on liability products, and the effect of market
depreciation on certain custody assets. Treasury Services net revenue was $919
million, a decrease of $27 million, or 3%. The decrease reflected spread
compression on deposit products offset by higher trade revenue driven by wider
spreads, and higher card product volumes. TSS firmwide net revenue, which
includes net revenue recorded in other lines of business, was $2.5 billion, a
decrease of $149 million, or 6%, primarily due to declines in Worldwide
Securities Services. Treasury Services firmwide net revenue was $1.7 billion,
flat compared with the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $13 million, a decrease of $5 million from
the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $59 million, or 4%. The
decrease reflected lower headcount-related expense1, partially offset by higher
FDIC insurance premiums.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $430 million, an increase of $79 million, or 23%, from the third
quarter of 2008, as higher net revenue and lower noninterest expense were offset
partially by a higher provision for credit losses. 

Net revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of $124 million, or 6%, from the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of $100 million, or 6%,
due to gains on the firm`s seed capital investments and net inflows, largely
offset by the effect of lower market levels and decreased placement fees. Net
interest income was $404 million, up by $24 million, or 6%, from the prior year,
due to wider loan spreads and higher deposit balances, largely offset by
narrower deposit spreads and lower loan balances. 

Revenue from the Private Bank was $639 million, up 1%, from the prior year.
Revenue from Institutional was $534 million, up 10%. Revenue from Retail was
$471 million, up 18%. Revenue from Private Wealth Management was $339 million,
down 4%. Revenue from Bear Stearns Private Client Services was $102 million, up
10%. 

Assets under supervision were $1.7 trillion, an increase of $108 billion, or 7%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.3 trillion, an increase of
$106 billion, or 9%. The increases were due to inflows in liquidity, fixed
income and equity products, partially offset by the effect of lower market
levels and outflows in alternative products. Custody, brokerage, administration
and deposit balances were $411 billion, up by $2 billion, due to brokerage
inflows in the Private Bank, partially offset by the effect of lower market
levels on custody and brokerage balances. 

The provision for credit losses was $38 million, an increase of $18 million from
the prior year, reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, down by $11 million, or 1%, from the prior
year. The decrease was due to lower headcount-related expense1, offset by higher
performance-based compensation and higher FDIC insurance premiums.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see notes on page 12 for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $26,622 million, $25,623
million, and $14,737 million for the third quarter of 2009, second quarter of
2009 and third quarter of 2008, respectively. 

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $3.6 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion from the third quarter
of 2008. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, partially
offset by increases to both the provision for credit losses and noninterest
expense. 

Managed net revenue was $28.8 billion, an increase of $12.7 billion, or 79%,
from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $14.0 billion, up by $8.7 billion,
or 167%. The increase was driven by higher principal transactions, primarily
related to the absence of markdowns on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage
positions and strong trading results in the Investment Bank, as well as higher
investment portfolio trading income in Corporate. These results also benefited
from the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Net interest income was
$14.8 billion, up by $3.9 billion, or 36%, due to the impact of Washington
Mutual, wider loan spreads and higher investment portfolio net interest income. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $9.8 billion, up by $3.1 billion, or
47%, from the prior year. The consumer-managed provision for credit losses was
$9.0 billion, compared with $5.7 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher
net charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for credit losses in the home
lending and credit card loan portfolios. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were
$7.0 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in the prior year, resulting in managed
net charge-off rates of 6.29% and 3.39%, respectively. The wholesale provision
for credit losses was $779 million, compared with $962 million in the prior
year. The current-quarter provision reflected higher net charge-offs, partially
offset by a reduction in allowance in the Investment Bank. Wholesale net
charge-offs were $1.1 billion, compared with $52 million in the prior year,
resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.93% and 0.10%, respectively. The firm`s
nonperforming assets totaled $20.4 billion at September 30, 2009, up from the
prior-year level of $9.5 billion. 

Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion, up by $2.3 billion, or 21%, from the
prior year. The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction and higher performance-based compensation expense, partially offset
by lower headcount-related expense1.

1. Notes on financial measures:

a. In addition to analyzing the firm`s results on a reported basis, management
analyzes the firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a
managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm`s definition of
managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the
following adjustments. 

First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of
credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit
losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services
results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been
securitized and sold still remain on the balance sheet, and that the earnings on
the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on
retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of
managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial
performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded
and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and
capital, based on managed financial information. In addition, the same
underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on
the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the
sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing
customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards;
accordingly, the customer`s credit performance will affect both the securitized
loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes
managed-basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand
both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet
and the firm`s retained interests in securitized loans. 

Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each
of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax
credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the
comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The
corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income
tax expense. 

See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase`s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (third
quarter 2009) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase`s income statement from a
reported basis to a managed basis. 

b.The ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes
the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale;
purchased credit-impaired loans; the allowance for loan losses related to
purchased-credit impaired loans; and, loans from the Washington Mutual Master
Trust, which were consolidated on the firm's balance sheet at fair value during
second quarter of 2009. Additionally, Consumer Lending net charge-off rates
exclude purchased credit-impaired loans. The allowance related to the purchased
credit-impaired portfolio was $1.1 billion at September 30, 2009. 

c. Tier 1 Common Capital ("Tier 1 Common") is calculated, for all purposes, as
Tier 1 Capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust
preferred securities and qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries. 

d. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits, and other
noncompensation costs related to employees. 

e. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total
net revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into
consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate
the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective
competitors.

 (b) Effective January 1, 2009, the Firm implemented new FASB guidance for participating securities. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been revised as required.

 (c) The calculation of second quarter 2009 earnings per share includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital.

 (e) The calculation of second quarter 2009 net income applicable to common equity includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. Excluding this reduction the adjusted ROE and ROTCE were 6% and 10% for the second quarter 2009, respectively. The Firm views the adjusted ROE and ROTCE, non-GAAP financial measures, as meaningful because it increases the comparability to prior periods. 
 (f) Net income applicable to common equity divided by total average common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities. The Firm uses return on tangible common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of the Firm.

&lt;p&gt;Citing improved profit margins and a stabilizing IT spending environment, IBM revised its 2009 earnings estimates upward Thursday, even as the company's revenue dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue was US$23.6 billion for the company's third quarter, ended Sept. 30. That's down 7 percent year-over-year, but ahead of analyst expectations, according to those polled by Thomson Reuters. Analysts had expected revenue to be $23.4 billion, down 8 percent year-over-year, Thomson Reuters found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM says it is operating as a more profitable company -- earnings per share were up 18 percent at $2.40 per share this quarter -- but revenue in the company's enterprise product lines was down, reflecting the conservative IT spending patterns that have gone hand-in-hand with the global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardest hit was IBM's mainframe group, where revenue was down 26 percent. The company's Unix business was down 10 percent, and storage revenue dropped 13 percent. IBM's Intel-based System x servers were up 1 percent for the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is planning major revisions to its Unix and mainframe product lines next year, said Mark Loughridge, IBM's chief financial officer, during an earnings conference call Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things looked better with the company's Global Services and software lines of business. Global Services revenue dropped 7 percent, but the company continued to squeeze out profit-margin improvements there. With software, the drop was just 3 percent, most of which IBM attributed to fluctuations in international currency rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Software had a really terrific quarter," said Loughridge. He cited a 2 percent sales increase in the company's main middleware products such as WebSphere, Tivoli, Lotus and Rational product lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the company's server business was down, it did slow its rate of decline and posted "significant share gains," taking business from both Sun and Hewlett-Packard, Loughridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's Unix business has benefited from uncertainty over Oracle's planned acquisition of Sun Microsystems, wrote Sanford  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi in a report filed ahead of the earnings results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last quarter Sun's Unix revenue dropped 40 percent, year-over-year, and some of that loss may have led to market-share gains by IBM. Checks with Sun customers "point to continued customer uncertainty and hesitancy surrounding Sun, particularly in larger, direct sales," wrote Sacconaghi. He believes that IT spending is improving in the U.S. and stabilizing in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge agreed that the IT spending climate has improved over the past year. "As we look at the economic environment currently ... it's really stabilized," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM now thinks it will do better for the full year than previously expected. It revised its full-year 2009 earnings guidance upward $0.15 per share to $9.95 per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc and IBM rounded out a strong week of technology results, outstripping already high expectations and providing further evidence that a recovery is brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of bellwether chipmaker Intel Corp's robust report on Tuesday, the results from the Internet search leader and the technology services giant showed demand from both consumers and businesses is returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Corporate spending is very much starting to show some rebound," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management. "Outside the U.S., I think you would see technology spending is stabilizing in Europe as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel's results added more fuel to a tech sector rally that began earlier this year, when signs emerged that the worst of the recession could be over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual revenue growth is only being seen in a handful of tech companies -- Google is one -- but the top-line results from IBM, Google, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices all bested Wall Street estimates. For a graphic tracking these companies' results, click: here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While bottom-line results have been bolstered by mass cost-cutting, investors have been looking for signs of life on the revenue front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been complaining about tech companies that beat their estimates based on cost-cutting, but haven't really been able to beat their topline number," said Ted Parrish, co-portfolio manager at Henssler Equity Fund. "It's good to see one (IBM) that's finally done that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although IBM's shares fell as investors, expecting the company to raise its long-term guidance even further, locked in profits, IBM sounded an optimistic note as it forecast a return to revenue growth in the fourth-quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Google posted its strongest sequential revenue growth in more than a year as advertising spending began to bounce back. It handily topped analysts' estimates on and shares rose 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think a rising tide will lift all boats," said JMP Securities analyst Sameet Sinha. "Definitely, we hear from advertisers that they are starting to invest in the fourth quarter. E-commerce is doing really well and that is encouraging advertisers to spend online."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APPLE, MICROSOFT NEXT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week will provide a further snapshot of technology demand, as it brings quarterly reports from both Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall tech sector has been on a roll this year following a brutal slide in demand at the end of 2008 as the financial crisis spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some feared that expectations were simply too high for third-quarter earnings, and that good, but not stellar results would prompt a sell-off and snuff out a rally that has sent tech issues up around 60 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel helped quash some of those fears when it led off the week on Tuesday by blowing past Wall Street estimates. On Wednesday, IDC said global PC shipments rose a better-than-expected 2.3 percent in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, AMD also posted results ahead of Wall Street estimates, although its shares fell 5 percent on profit-taking in gains that followed Intel's report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everything is rosy in the technology world. Earlier Thursday, mobile phone giant Nokia Oyj surprised investors when reported it reported its worst ever result as it booked a big write-down at its networks unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, chipmakers Cypress Semiconductor Inc and Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc posted strong quarterly results, but the numbers failed to impress investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gabriel Madway, editing by Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

 NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) raised its
full-year outlook and reported higher-than-expected quarterly
profit on Thursday as its growing focus on higher-margin
software and services helped it cope with weak technology
spending.

 International Business Machines Corp still failed to
satisfy investors, whose expectations had risen along with a 24
percent rise in the shares over the past three months. A drop
in service contract numbers, an indication of future sales,
also worried Wall Street.

 "I think people had expected a bigger upside," said Kim
Caughey, an analyst with Fort Pitt Capital. "If you are someone
who follows technology closely, the third quarter isn't a
strong quarter -- so that they beat at all, I'm happy."

 Indeed, IBM reported third-quarter net profit rose to $3.2
billion, or $2.40 a share, from $2.8 billion, or $2.04 a share,
a year earlier. Analysts on average expected a profit of $2.38
per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

 Revenue fell 7 percent from a year earlier to $23.6
billion, but it rose 1 percent from the previous quarter and
was better than Wall Street's forecast of $23.4 billion.

 IBM forecast a return to revenue growth in the fourth
quarter and said it was ahead of pace to achieve its target
earnings of $10 to $11 per share in 2010.

 Total gross profit margin rose to 45.1 percent from 43.3
percent a year earlier.

 ONE CONCERN

 One concern among investors was that service contract
signings fell 7 percent $11.8 billion. Such signings are an
indicator of long-term sales.

 Despite that decline, Frost  Sullivan analyst Ronald Gruia
said, IBM's results were positive and investors were likely
taking profits.

 "Sometimes there are ups and downs," he said. "I think it's
mostly 'sell on the news'-type stuff."

 For its part, IBM said the decline in services reflected a
weak business environment, but conditions were stabilizing,
particularly in credit markets.

 "What we see more broadly I think is some stabilization in
the economic environment," Chief Financial Officer Mark
Loughridge told analysts on a conference call.

 "You remember last time at this point in time, we were
talking about -- questions like, do you have commercial paper
or do you have a financing business? We are certainly through
those kinds of questions."

 IBM has managed to escape the worst of the tech downturn of
the past year by shifting more of its sales from servers to
software and services in outsourcing, automation and technology
support -- areas that have remained relatively strong as
companies seek ways to cut costs.

 "Corporate spending is very much starting to show some
rebound," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment
officer at Fifth Third Asset Management.

 "As we look at the tech space, we think the general tone in
this reporting cycle and for the next several quarters will be
better than expected."

 IBM shares, which had risen on hopes of a recovery in
technology spending, fell 3.88 percent to $123.01 in extended
trading after closing at $127.98 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

 That was in contrast to a 3.1 percent gain in the shares of
Google Inc (GOOG.O), which also announced better-than-expected
third quarter profit and revenue on Thursday [ID:nN14269544].

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) vaunted trading operations helped the dominant Wall Street firm quadruple its earnings, but investment banking results were lackluster and its shares fell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, whose lavish compensation has drawn scrutiny, stayed on pace to hand out more than $20 billion in year-end bonuses. That would be equivalent to more than $630,000 per employee and could beat a record set for compensation in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a sign of weakness, Goldman's investment banking and asset management revenues were lower. The bank fell to No. 2, behind Morgan Stanley (MS.N), in merger and acquisition adviser rankings for deals announced globally through the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. It also dropped a spot to No. 7 in global capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman produced great numbers but apparently didn't live up to those heightened expectations," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook Investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their real earnings, the question is how repeatable are they," he said. "Trading gains come and go. They're genuine earnings at the time, but it's not like something you rely on quarter to quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading nearly quadrupled, helping propel overall revenue to a forecast beating $12.37 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the $5.99 billion in FICC revenue, fueled by credit products and mortgages, also lagged the second quarter and fell short of some high expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While it is difficult to call $6 bln in FICC trading a miss, we suspect the recent run-up in GS shares reflected expectations for a stronger trading revenue number," analyst Jeff Harte of Sandler O'Neill wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm posted third-quarter net income for common shareholders of $3.03 billion, or $5.25 a share, up from $845 million, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It easily beat analysts' average forecast of $4.24 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But one analyst noted the beat was helped by Goldman's decision to set aside less than usual for compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which has been under fire from some quarters over gold-plated pay so soon after taking government bailout funds, allocated 43 percent of net revenue in the third quarter to compensation and benefits, down from 49 percent in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stellar results by rival JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) on Wednesday may have prompted investors to raise the bar for Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's lift from fixed income -- its trading revenues in that area rose more than five-fold to $5 billion -- in particular led analysts and investors to expect a similar or larger jump at Goldman, which has a reputation as a more aggressive risk-taker than the commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares fell 2.0 percent to $188.45 in afternoon trading, underperforming the Amex Securities Broker dealer index .XBD, which was 1.2 percent lower. The shares are up nearly 124 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said results lagged behind the second quarter's record earnings in part because of the summer downturn in the mergers and acquisitions business. He said the calendar for fourth-quarter equity underwriting appeared robust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar, speaking on a conference call, declined to compare Goldman's performance with that of JPMorgan, saying it was always hard to compare two companies quarter over quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc (C.N), which also reported results on Thursday, posted a loss of 27 cents per share as it suffered $8 billion of credit losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's earnings included the firm's repurchase of $1.1 billion worth of warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury stemming from its participation in last year's banking bailout. Goldman recorded the purchase as a reduction to shareholder equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has paid back $10 billion in taxpayer bailouts it received from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, and the firm also benefited from other government programs, including the bailout of insurance giant American International Group Inc (AIG.N). Goldman said in March that it did nothing wrong when it accepted payments to close out trades with AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPENSATION POOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman set aside $5.4 billion for compensation during the quarter, raising the total to $16.8 billion so far this year. The firm has drawn fire from politicians and the public for setting aside so much for bonuses so soon after repaying a $10 billion taxpayer bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which has been working on burnishing its image, said it made a $200 million contribution to the Goldman Sachs Foundation, an education charity. That helped raise its non-compensation expenses 2 percent to $2.23 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar, in the conference call, was bombarded by questions from reporters about the firm's plans for doling out bonuses. He said Goldman would not make a decision on the matter until the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would prefer people were focused on the performance of the business," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRONG TRADING REVENUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net revenue in equities was up 78 percent to $2.78 billion, helped by a strong performance in derivatives and shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Principal Investments posted net revenue of $1.26 billion after a $453 million loss in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net revenue in investment banking and financial advisory fell during the quarter, reflecting the decline in mergers and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking net revenue was $899 million, down 31 percent from the third quarter of 2008. Results in financial advisory were $325 million, down 47 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net revenue in Asset Management and Securities Services was down 29 percent to $1.45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival Morgan Stanley is expected to report quarterly results next Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder, Paritosh Bansal and Elinor Comlay; Editing by John Wallace, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Google, IBM, AMD results above Street forecasts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Signs of life in consumer, corporate spending - analysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Apple, Microsoft results up next week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Some investors taking profits after strong tech rally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gabriel Madway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Google Inc (GOOG.O) and
IBM (IBM.N) rounded out a strong week of technology results,
outstripping already high expectations and providing further
evidence that a recovery is brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hot on the heels of bellwether chipmaker Intel Corp's
(INTC.O) robust report on Tuesday, the results from the
Internet search leader and the technology services giant showed
demand from both consumers and businesses is returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Corporate spending is very much starting to show some
rebound," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment
officer at Fifth Third Asset Management. "Outside the U.S., I
think you would see technology spending is stabilizing in
Europe as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel's results added more fuel to a tech sector rally that
began earlier this year, when signs emerged that the worst of
the recession could be over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actual revenue growth is only being seen in a handful of
tech companies -- Google is one -- but the top-line results
from IBM, Google, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.N) all
bested Wall Street estimates. For a graphic tracking these
companies' results, click:
here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While bottom-line results have been bolstered by mass
cost-cutting, investors have been looking for signs of life on
the revenue front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've been complaining about tech companies that beat
their estimates based on cost-cutting, but haven't really been
able to beat their topline number," said Ted Parrish,
co-portfolio manager at Henssler Equity Fund. "It's good to see
one (IBM) that's finally done that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although IBM's shares fell as investors, expecting the
company to raise its long-term guidance even further, locked in
profits, IBM sounded an optimistic note as it forecast a return
to revenue growth in the fourth-quarter. [ID:nN15266489]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, Google posted its strongest sequential
revenue growth in more than a year as advertising spending
began to bounce back. It handily topped analysts' estimates on
and shares rose 3 percent. [ID:nN14269544]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think a rising tide will lift all boats," said JMP
Securities analyst Sameet Sinha. "Definitely, we hear from
advertisers that they are starting to invest in the fourth
quarter. E-commerce is doing really well and that is
encouraging advertisers to spend online."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; APPLE, MICROSOFT NEXT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Next week will provide a further snapshot of technology
demand, as it brings quarterly reports from both Apple Inc
(AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overall tech sector has been on a roll this year
following a brutal slide in demand at the end of 2008 as the
financial crisis spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some feared that expectations were simply too high for
third-quarter earnings, and that good, but not stellar results
would prompt a sell-off and snuff out a rally that has sent
tech issues up around 60 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel helped quash some of those fears when it led off the
week on Tuesday by blowing past Wall Street estimates. On
Wednesday, IDC said global PC shipments rose a
better-than-expected 2.3 percent in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, AMD also posted results ahead of Wall Street
estimates, although its shares fell 5 percent on profit-taking
in gains that followed Intel's report. [ID:nN15198583]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, not everything is rosy in the technology world.
Earlier Thursday, mobile phone giant Nokia Oyj (NOK1V.HE)
surprised investors when reported it reported its worst ever
result as it booked a big write-down at its networks unit.
[ID:nLF596616]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, chipmakers Cypress Semiconductor Inc CY.N
and Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc FCS.N posted
strong quarterly results, but the numbers failed to impress
investors.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM raised its full-year outlook and reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as its growing focus on higher-margin software and services businesses helped it cope with weak technology spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp still failed to satisfy investors, whose expectations had built up along with a 24 percent rise in the shares. A drop in service contract numbers, an indication of future business, also worried Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think people had expected a bigger upside," said Kim Caughey, an analyst with Fort Pitt Capital. "If you are someone who follows technology closely, the third quarter isn't a strong quarter -- so that they beat at all, I'm happy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, IBM reported third-quarter net profit rose to $3.2 billion, or $2.40 a share, from $2.8 billion, or $2.04 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected a profit of $2.38 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 7 percent from a year earlier to $23.6 billion, although it rose 1 percent from the previous quarter and was better than Wall Street's forecast of $23.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM forecast a return to revenue growth in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been complaining about tech companies that beat their estimates based on cost-cutting, but haven't really been able to beat their topline number. It's good to see one that's finally done that," said Ted Parrish, co-portfolio manager at Henssler Equity Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One concern among investors is that service contract signings fell 7 percent $11.8 billion. Such signings are an indicator of long-term sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes there are ups and downs," Frost  Sullivan analyst Ronald Gruia said, but added that the overall results were still positive. "I think it's mostly 'sell on the news'-type stuff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has managed to escape the worst of the tech downturn of the past year by shifting more of its sales from servers to software and services in outsourcing, automation and technology support -- areas that have remained relatively strong as companies seek ways to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are optimistic about 2009 as we again raise our full-year expectations and we remain well ahead of pace for our 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 per share," said Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares, which had risen on hopes of a recovery in technology spending, fell 3.6 percent to $123.30 after closing at $127.98 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expected them to exceed expectations on both numbers. I also think you can interpret that the dynamics within the technology category are vastly improving. I think IT spending appears to be on the mend," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Gary Hill and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), the former investment bank known for aggressive risk taking, is facing a frontal assault on its traditional dominance of fixed income trading from an unlikely source: commercial bank JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In third-quarter earnings reports this week, Goldman Sachs said fixed income trading revenue fell from the second quarter, while JPMorgan said revenues at its equivalent unit climbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are feeding speculation that JPMorgan, the second largest U.S. bank by assets, could use its cheap deposit funding to challenge Goldman's investment banking dominance, as that bank faces higher funding costs in capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had already outmatched Goldman Sachs in league tables for global underwriting. But few analysts or investors had expected the bank to post a modest improvement in trading revenues while trading superstar Goldman reported a slip-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks as if JPMorgan now has a substantial advantage in the marketplace over its competitors and it's utilizing it," said Richard Bove, analyst with Rochdale Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's fixed income trading results slipped to $6 billion from $6.8 billion in the second quarter, while JPMorgan said on Wednesday that fixed income trading climbed slightly to $5.01 billion from $4.93 billion in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both banks benefited from an uptick in the value of securities they had written down a year earlier and it is possible that JPMorgan, typically more conservative, may have more harshly marked down securities that it has now marked up. Analysts said this is hard to assess accurately since the banks do not disclose exactly which securities' values have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLACK BOX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported a $400 million gain in the value of securities in its fixed income unit, compared to a $3.6 billion write-down in the same period a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also said on a call with analysts that it also saw improvements in securities' values, but Chief Financial Officer David Viniar did not give any details about fixed income. In the year-earlier quarter, Goldman had losses of $1.1 billion on residential and commercial mortgages and securities and credit products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's lift from fixed income in particular had led analysts and investors broadly to expect a similar or larger jump at Goldman -- and the former investment bank's shares slid 1.2 percent, in part reflecting these higher expectations, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to compare different banks' results, Viniar said when quizzed by reporters about JPMorgan's apparent third-quarter improvement compared to Goldman's slip in fixed income trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed income, which for Goldman also includes currency and commodities trading, is something of a black box for both banks. They may include different securities and businesses within the category and neither gives a clear breakdown of what the units include.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both banks are widely regarded as the best survivors of the financial crisis, although they have not escaped unscathed. JPMorgan has battled mounting losses on consumer loans and Goldman Sachs last fall converted to a bank holding company -- and trimmed its balance sheet as a result -- after Lehman Brothers failed and regulators worried about the survival of investment banks that relied on borrowing for funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the third-quarter results appear to show the gap is narrowing between former investment bank Goldman and commercial bank JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the move also helped boost quarterly earnings.

 By Steve Eder

 NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
opted to devote a smaller chunk of revenue to compensation in
the latest quarter in what may be a sop to critics angry about
a bonus bonanza so soon after the bank took billions in
government funds.

 But the move also helped boost quarterly earnings.
[ID:nN15288862] And Goldman Sachs employees need not lose any
sleep, because they are still on track to receive an average of
$630,000 each, rivaling their record bonus haul in 2007.

 Further, that $630,000 amount, which places the bank far
ahead of rivals, is based on Goldman's full workforce,
including assistants and other support staff.

 Goldman has been heavily criticized for setting aside so
much for its bonus pool so soon after the firm repaid $10
billion in taxpayer bailout funds. So far this year, Goldman
has set aside about $16.7 billion for bonuses, and looks well
on track to break the $20 billion mark.

 Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told reporters
on a conference call only that the bank was giving "a lot of
thought" to how employees would be compensated at year-end.

 Lawrence White, a professor at New York University's Stern
School of Business, said Goldman wishes everyone would simply
leave it alone -- but that will not happen as long as it
continues to stash away billions for bonuses.

 "But ten-digit numbers for the quarter, 11 digit numbers
for the year -- that has to attract attention," White said.
"There is a certain amount of tone deafness, a certain amount
of arrogance, and a certain amount of, 'Hey we are good and we
want to make sure we keep our employees happy.'"

 While Goldman typically devotes about half its net earnings
to pay and benefits, another robust quarter allowed Goldman to
drop the ratio of compensation to revenue to about 43 percent
while still setting aside $5.4 billion for pay.

 Analysts said the move padded quarterly earnings, which in
fact healthily beat analysts' forecasts.

 "This upside does not qualify as high on the 'quality'
scale," Roger Freeman, an analyst with Barclay's Capital, said
in a research note.

 DIVIDING THE POOL

 How the bonus pool will be divided is also a question for
Goldman.

 In the past, Goldman has concentrated its biggest bonus pay
at the top. Goldman's top 200 bonus recipients received a
combined $994.68 million in bonuses last year, an average of
about $5 million per employee, according to a report released
earlier this year by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.
The firm-wide average for total compensation was closer to
about $364,000.

 Wall Street recruiters and headhunters said earlier this
year that some of Goldman's star traders, especially those in
high-growth areas like currency, commodities and fixed income,
are in for the biggest payouts.

 Among them are David Heller, Harvey Schwartz, Edward Eisler
and Pablo Salame, all of whom lead units that oversee sales and
trading.

 In its final assessment, Goldman could also choose to
donate some of its bonus pool to charity, or direct employees
to do so.

 Goldman announced it had made a $200 million donation to
the Goldman Sachs Foundation, its not-for-profit charitable
arm. Viniar would not say whether that donation was part of a
larger good-will campaign and if the company would repeat it.

 Viniar insisted the company is keenly aware of the world
outside of Goldman, which continues to suffer from job losses

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Google Inc. reported quarterly earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations, while posting its strongest sequential revenue growth in more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarterly results from IBM also beat expectations, but more modestly, and the company once again raised its forecast for full-year earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHARLES LIEBERMAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ADVISORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google certainly crushed expectations. The earnings number was up almost 10 percent over the expectations. That's a big, big beat in this environment where people think earnings are going to do poorly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COLIN GILLIS, SENIOR ANALYST, BRIGANTINE ADVISORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They did great on every single metric. We think this is sustainable. This is the golden period when you have strength in CPCs as well as paid clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CPC metric was most exciting because it showed sequential growth, indicating that advertisers are paying more to reach consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google has no competition. Yahoo is withering on the vine and Bing is too tiny now. They will have competition once Microsoft has captured Yahoo shares. It will then have captured approximately 30 percent of the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROSS SANDLER, SENIOR INTERNET ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's pretty solid all around. This is one of the cleaner quarters they've had in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is upside pretty much across the board in terms of revenue -- U.S. (ad sales) beat our estimates, international (ad sales) significantly beat our estimates... and EPS beat our estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the stock is going to trade higher. The numbers are clearly going up on the back of this. The only thing making investors cautious is that (Google Chief Executive Eric) Schmidt mentioned investing heavily on our future. We think this is pretty standard for Google -- all in all a strong quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JASON HELFSTEIN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clicks were better quarter to quarter and the decline in CPCs was also better. That's what drove the upside in revenues. Currency was worse than people thought, but excluding that, U.S. revenues were better than forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the most efficient way for advertisers to advertise and with the economy likely getting better, Google is likely among the first to see it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAMEET SINHA, SENIOR ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The performance was really good both on revenue side and the expense side. Going forward, they have been (saying) that the worst of the recession is over and they will continue to invest in their business. So operating leverage will be muted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think a rising tide will lift all boats. Definitely, we hear from advertisers that they are starting to invest in the fourth quarter. E-commerce is doing really well and that is encouraging advertisers to spend online."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAXMI PORURI, ANALYST, PRIMARY GLOBAL RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google did very well considering people are still cautious. I don't think it signals a turnaround, but in an uncertain market people stick with what works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google has the best ROI in search and in an uncertain market people will go toward Google for advertising rather than something not proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With advertising at its core, Google is benefiting from higher bid pricing on its search. In the next two to three quarters, we'll continue to see strong fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the next 9 to 12 months, we might see an uptick in business for Yahoo/Microsoft, which may or may not impact Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIAN MARSHALL, ANALYST, BROADPOINT AMTECH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a disappointment to expectations. They were roughly in line with the topline as well as the bottom line. People were expecting more upside on the bottomline. Historically, IBM has done a good job of delivering some upside to EPS through aggressive financial engineering and we just didn't see that this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers are good on a relative basis -- disappointing to expectations, but IBM is obviously the world's largest enterprise infrastructure company out there, and is more like a tanker ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing smaller, more speedboat-type guys like NetApp, Brocade, EMC actually start to grow and have a little bit more margin leverage in the model than IBM right now, but I expect IBM will start hitting stride sometime in calendar year 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANDY MIEDLER, ANALYST, EDWARD JONES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The story is really how good the numbers are. Overall, these are very good results and IBM continues to execute flawlessly during the downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shares are down because investors might have expected a higher increase in guidance but over the long term IBM remains very well positioned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought they had good results. I think people had expected a bigger upside. There's a slight beat on revenues. If you are someone who follows technology closely, the third quarter isn't a strong quarter, so that they beat at all, I am happy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TED PARRISH, CO-PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HENSSLER EQUITY FUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers look good. The topline and bottomline beat and you really can't expect much more. We've been complaining about tech companies that beat their estimates based on cost-cutting, but haven't really been able to beat their topline number. It's good to see one that's finally done that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The raised outlook is good news. It truly shows how diverse the company's business is. I think international is going to help them a whole lot. I think there's still a thirst for IBM's high quality business services internationally and I think that shows up in the numbers. I expected the company to hit its numbers and they did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEITH WIRTZ, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FIFTH THIRD ASSET MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expected them to exceed expectations on both numbers. I also think you can interpret that the dynamics within the technology category are vastly improving. I think IT spending appears to be on the mend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Corporate spending is very much starting to show some rebound. Outside the US, I think you would see technology spending is stabilizing in Europe as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we look at the tech space, we think the general tone in this reporting cycle and for the next several quarters will be better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're doing a good job on structural expense management. As you saw in today's results, conditions in the industry are improving. They're seeing some topline growth finally. That's also translating into some margin expansion, better earnings per share than expected. Things are starting to show favorable trends and that's good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that we've moved beyond depression pricing in the stock market, as we move into 2010 companies like IBM we think will be looking to fill in product categories and gaps through MA. You're starting to see a lot of that take place already in 2009. Expect more of that next year - I wouldn't be surprised if IBM were a participant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Yinka Adegoke, Ellis Mnyandu, and Caroline Valetkevitch in New York, Clare Baldwin in San Francisco, and Sue Zeidler and Gina Keating in Los Angeles; Compiled by Paul Thomasch)&lt;/p&gt;

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Sangamo Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGMO) as the
Bull of the Day and Conmed (Nasdaq: CNMD) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC), JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Company (NYSE: JPM) and CSX Corp. (NYSE: CSX). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Sangamo Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGMO) uses a proprietary ZFP gene regulation
technology to discover and develop a new class of therapeutic candidates for
diabetic neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, cancer and immune diseases. 

We are optimistic about this novel technology. SB-509 has shown some positive
results for the treatment of moderate to severe DN. We are also optimistic about
other clinical programs. Further, we are impressed by the company's strategy to
monetize this ZFP technology. 

We maintain our Outperform rating on shares of Sangamo based on the platform
technology and the progress the company has made for both its clinical and
preclinical programs. Our target price is $10.00. 

Bear of the Day: 

Conmed (Nasdaq: CNMD) operates in highly competitive markets against competitors
that are much larger, technically competent and possess substantially more
assets. 

Additionally, many of these competitors offer a range of products not matched by
Conmed, which may make Conmed's offerings less attractive to surgeons, hospitals
and group purchasing organizations that are trying to reduce the number of
vendors they do business with. In the second quarter, earnings per share were 17
cents, compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents and the year-ago
earnings of 43 cents. 

We have an Underperform rating on Conmed with a target price of $18. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Intel Looking Stronger than Ever

Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) reported very strong earnings in the third quarter,
beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents. Revenue beat the consensus by
3.9%. 

Revenue of $9.4 billion was up 17.0% sequentially and down 8.1% year over year.
This was higher than management`s expectation of around $8.5 billion, or up 5.9%
sequentially. Management stated that this was the strongest third quarter
sequential growth the company has seen in 30 years. 

JPMorgan Beats, Profit Surges

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company`s (NYSE: JPM) third quarter earnings came in at 82
cents per share, substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49
cents. This compares favorably with 9 cents in the prior-year quarter. 

Better-than-expected results were primarily aided by continued strong
performance by the Investment Bank group. All the other segments except Consumer
Lending and Card Services also delivered solid results during the quarter.
However, a continuation of high levels of credit costs in Consumer Lending and
Card Services loan portfolios and an increased provision for credit losses were
the primary factors that negatively impacted the results. 

CSX Ahead of Expectations

CSX Corp. (NYSE: CSX) reported earnings from continuing operations of $293
million or 74 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents
per share. 

Earnings were down $380 million or 93 cents per share in the prior year period.
The decline was brought about by lower revenues, partially offset by reduced
expenses. 

Revenue for the period fell 23% to $2.3 billion due to significant declines in
both volume and fuel recovery. However, management said that core pricing
momentum has remained intact. CSX Corp. witnessed a 15% decline in volume during
the quarter, led by a decline in shipments of coal, cars, construction and
consumer goods.

</body></entry><entry author="Joseph A. Giannone" date="2009-10-15T20:37:57+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/ousivMolt/idUSTRE59E42Z20091015"><headline>EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Goldman fund star Carhart to launch firm</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) star hedge fund manager Mark Carhart, who departed early last year after the Global Alpha fund he co-managed had struggled, told Reuters on Thursday he is starting his own firm and trying to raise $1 billion for a new investment fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carhart, speaking on the sidelines of a conference, said he plans to launch in 2010 and is targeting large institutional investors. Ultimately, he hopes the unnamed firm will manage as much as $5 billion in the computer-driven investment strategies that offer some new twists in a field with thousands of funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to generate "alpha," the measure of a manager's skill in beating U.S. stock returns, he said, without following the same ups and downs as the market, or "beta."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most funds, Carhart said his new fund will identify opportunities to collect risk premiums, rather than market inefficiencies, with different returns than stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's meant to supplant a large portion of hedge funds which don't have as much alpha as they do a lot of embedded beta," Carhart said in the interview. "It is a new category, really: some call alternative beta, but "exotic beta" is the best way to describe it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund also may offer some other unique features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carhart is considering charging fees that reflect risk exposures and single out outperformance attributed to his investing skills. The firm will also pursue strategies clients like because they are easily traded and transparent, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "beta" portions of the fund, he said, will likely be delivered through separately managed accounts, which lets clients customize and have a clear view of what they own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN INCUBATOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carhart is the latest in a string of Goldman alumni to strike out on their own and one of a growing number of Wall Streeters launching firms in the wake of last year's meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry experts say that even the most talented managers are finding it difficult to raise the kind of big money routinely collected when markets boomed. Until investors recover, fund managers are finding $100 million is a typical starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working in Carhart's favor will be his Goldman pedigree. Eric Mindich spun out to create Eton Park Capital Management, which made a record $3.5 billion launch in 2004, while Dan Och left 10 years earlier to form Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZM.N), one of the largest hedge fund firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is nothing better on a would-be hedge fund manager's resume than the name Goldman Sachs," said Larry Smith, chairman and chief investment officer at Third Wave Investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After earning a PhD in finance from the University of Chicago, Carhart followed alumnus Cliff Asness to help build Goldman's quantitative investing business. Carhart took over when Asness left Goldman in 1998 to form AQR Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is whether investors focus on Carhart's track record, when Global Alpha routinely topped the charts, or on the losses realized in 2007 by computer-driven strategies he and partner Raymond Iwanowski managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Alpha, which managed $10 billion at the start of 2007, saw investors pull out $6 billion as the fund fell by more than a third. Computer models were caught off guard when the subprime crisis disrupted credit markets and triggered violent stock-price swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't have good spill-over models back them. We thought in terms of our own community, but we did not think about how other markets' behavior would effect our strategy," Carhart said. "We expanded the scope of our thinking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the damage was in the firm's equities funds, namely the Global Equity Opportunities fund that "almost defaulted," he said. Goldman and outside investors injected $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Alpha has rebounded this year, rising "mid-20s" percent, said Carhart, who still has money in the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carhart and Iwanowski left Goldman in early 2008. Carhart, who has a non-compete agreement in effect until April, declined to say if his long-time partner would also join the new firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since leaving Goldman, Carhart has enjoyed a rare breather in his career. He packed his family into an Airstream recreational vehicle to tour the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year, he will start working on setting up his new business, lining up lawyers, prime brokers, staff and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm taking a lot of calls from people who are interested, he added."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph Giannone and Svea Herbst; editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds action by Fitch Ratings)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 15 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service and
Fitch Ratings on Thursday both cut their ratings on drugmaker
Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), citing the company's higher leverage
resulting from its acquisition of U.S. rival Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, completed its
roughly $67 billion acquisition of Wyeth on Thursday after U.S.
and Canadian antitrust regulators cleared the deal. For
details, click on [ID:nN15309026]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition increases Pfizer's debt load to $39.5
billion, from $17.3 billion, raising its ratio of debt to
earnings, or leverage, to 1.8 times from 0.8 times, Fitch
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch cut its rating on Pfizer one notch to AA-minus, its
fourth highest investment grade, from AA. It raised Wyeth's
rating three notches to AA-minus, from A-minus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's downgraded Pfizer by two notches to A1, its
fifth-highest investment-grade rating, from Aa2. The rating
agency said it is still reviewing Wyeth's A3 long-term rating
and a decision will depend on Pfizer's treatment of Wyeth's
debt. A3 is the seventh-highest investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Wyeth acquisition provides Pfizer with increased scale
and diversity, an improved pharmaceutical pipeline and
significant synergy opportunities," Moody's said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, key financial measures, including the ratio of
debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, will initially erode, the rating agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liquidity will remain strong, with cash and short-term
investments expected to be greater than $30 billion,
supplemented by $7 billion in undrawn revolving credit
agreements and strong free cash flow, Moody's said.

&lt;p&gt;BELGRADE Oct 15 (Reuters) - Serbian and U.S. agents seized 2.8 tonnes of cocaine destined for European markets on Thursday, Tanjug news agency said. The joint operation was part of an international effort to crack down on the illegal drugs trade, Tanjug said, quoting a security services statement. It did not specify where the cocaine was seized. The value of the seized cocaine is estimated at 120 million euros, while it could reach 250 million euros if sold in streets, the statement said. U.S. anti-narcotics authorities say organised crime groups use Serbia as a transit point for cocaine from South America and heroin from Turkey for shipment into Western Europe. The Danube and Tisa Rivers enter landlocked Serbia from Hungary, the Sava flows in from Croatia, and the Danube runs on into Romania and Bulgaria.

 (Adds comment, background, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder and Paritosh Bansal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's
(GS.N) vaunted trading operations helped the dominant Wall
Street firm quadruple its earnings, but investment banking
results were lackluster and its shares fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, whose lavish compensation has drawn scrutiny,
stayed on pace to hand out more than $20 billion in year-end
bonuses. That would be equivalent to more than $630,000 per
employee and could beat a record set for compensation in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in a sign of weakness, Goldman's investment banking and
asset management revenues were lower. The bank fell to No. 2,
behind Morgan Stanley (MS.N), in merger and acquisition adviser
rankings for deals announced globally through the third
quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. It also dropped a spot
to No. 7 in global capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman produced great numbers but apparently didn't live
up to those heightened expectations," said Peter Jankovskis,
co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook Investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Their real earnings, the question is how repeatable are
they," he said. "Trading gains come and go. They're genuine
earnings at the time, but it's not like something you rely on
quarter to quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading
nearly quadrupled, helping propel overall revenue to a forecast
beating $12.37 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet the $5.99 billion in FICC revenue, fueled by credit
products and mortgages, also lagged the second quarter and fell
short of some high expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While it is difficult to call $6 bln in FICC trading a
miss, we suspect the recent run-up in GS shares reflected
expectations for a stronger trading revenue number," analyst
Jeff Harte of Sandler O'Neill wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based firm posted third-quarter net income for
common shareholders of $3.03 billion, or $5.25 a share, up from
$845 million, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It easily beat analysts' average forecast of $4.24 a share,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But one analyst noted the
beat was helped by Goldman's decision to set aside less than
usual for compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which has been under fire from some quarters over
gold-plated pay so soon after taking government bailout funds,
allocated 43 percent of net revenue in the third quarter to
compensation and benefits, down from 49 percent in the first
half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stellar results by rival JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) on
Wednesday may have prompted investors to raise the bar for
Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's lift from fixed income -- its trading revenues
in that area rose more than five-fold to $5 billion -- in
particular led analysts and investors to expect a similar or
larger jump at Goldman, which has a reputation as a more
aggressive risk-taker than the commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares fell 2.0 percent to $188.45 in afternoon
trading, underperforming the Amex Securities Broker dealer
index .XBD, which was 1.2 percent lower. The shares are up
nearly 124 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said
results lagged behind the second quarter's record earnings in
part because of the summer downturn in the mergers and
acquisitions business. He said the calendar for fourth-quarter
equity underwriting appeared robust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar, speaking on a conference call, declined to compare
Goldman's performance with that of JPMorgan, saying it was
always hard to compare two companies quarter over quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup Inc (C.N), which also reported results on
Thursday, posted a loss of 27 cents per share as it suffered $8
billion of credit losses. [ID:nN15291217]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's earnings included the firm's repurchase of $1.1
billion worth of warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury stemming
from its participation in last year's banking bailout. Goldman
recorded the purchase as a reduction to shareholder equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has paid back $10 billion in taxpayer bailouts it
received from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief
Program, and the firm also benefited from other government
programs, including the bailout of insurance giant American
International Group Inc (AIG.N). Goldman said in March that it
did nothing wrong when it accepted payments to close out trades
with AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COMPENSATION POOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman set aside $5.4 billion for compensation during the
quarter, raising the total to $16.8 billion so far this year.
The firm has drawn fire from politicians and the public for
setting aside so much for bonuses so soon after repaying a $10
billion taxpayer bailout. [ID:nN15300545]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which has been working on burnishing its image,
said it made a $200 million contribution to the Goldman Sachs
Foundation, an education charity. That helped raise its
non-compensation expenses 2 percent to $2.23 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar, in the conference call, was bombarded by questions
from reporters about the firm's plans for doling out bonuses.
He said Goldman would not make a decision on the matter until
the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would prefer people were focused on the performance of
the business," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STRONG TRADING REVENUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net revenue in equities was up 78 percent to $2.78 billion,
helped by a strong performance in derivatives and shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Principal Investments posted net revenue of $1.26 billion
after a $453 million loss in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net revenue in investment banking and financial advisory
fell during the quarter, reflecting the decline in mergers and
acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banking net revenue was $899 million, down 31
percent from the third quarter of 2008. Results in financial
advisory were $325 million, down 47 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net revenue in Asset Management and Securities Services was
down 29 percent to $1.45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rival Morgan Stanley is expected to report quarterly
results next Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) cut its commodity trading risks in the third quarter, even as oil hit year highs, a sign that Wall Street's top investment bank was more cautious than some rivals in chasing prices on a weak dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), the second largest U.S. bank, reported third-quarter results on Thursday that indicated its risk in commodities had gradually risen this year to approach levels last seen before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Goldman, the value at risk, or VaR, for commodities fell 47 percent from a year ago to $27 million. VaR typically refers to the maximum amount of money a bank is prepared lose in a day trading a particular market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly for Goldman, its commodities VaR fell 32 percent from second-quarter levels, even as U.S. crude oil hit a 2009 high of $75 a barrel in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This showed that Goldman -- one of Wall Street's most high-profile crude traders -- was probably less bullish about the prospects in commodities over the last quarter than JPMorgan, a fast-growing competitor in investment banking, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One could easily infer that from the numbers," said Michael Holland, president of Holland  Co in New York. "You could say Goldman are looking at the commodity markets and saying a number of commodities have come a very long way and it's probably time for them to be pulling back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil aside, copper, gold, sugar and cocoa have all posted sharp price gains this year -- partly due to signs of economic rebound and largely due to a weak dollar, which has hit 14-month lows. .DXY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like, for most people, the dollar is just a one-way trade now," Holland said. "Goldman probably feels differently as they have been around for too long, and been too successful in the commodities trade, to know there is anything such as a one-way trade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrooks Investments in Lisle, Illinois, agrees. "Their feeling is perhaps the dollar weakness is near to running its course and, when the dollar strengthens, the prices of commodities are likely to come down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's quarterly earnings nearly quadrupled to $3.03 billion, topping analysts expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the tradition on Wall Street, it did not break down its commodity earnings. But it did say the asset class, as well as currency trading, contributed less to net revenue than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also made fewer hirings for commodities during the third quarter than other investment banks, according to data gathered this week from employment headhunters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup (C.N), another Wall Street bank that reported quarterly results on Thursday [ID:nN15291217], hired four energy market specialists in the third quarter, compared with two by Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Walter Bagley)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), the second largest U.S. bank, reported
third-quarter results on Thursday that indicated its risk in
commodities had gradually risen this year to approach levels last
seen before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for Goldman, the value at risk, or VaR, for commodities
fell 47 percent from a year ago to $27 million. VaR typically
refers to the maximum amount of money a bank is prepared lose in a
day trading a particular market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More importantly for Goldman, its commodities VaR fell 32
percent from second-quarter levels, even as U.S. crude oil CLc1
hit a 2009 high of $75 a barrel in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This showed that Goldman -- one of Wall Street's most
high-profile crude traders -- was probably less bullish about the
prospects in commodities over the last quarter than JPMorgan, a
fast-growing competitor in investment banking, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One could easily infer that from the numbers," said Michael
Holland, president of Holland  Co in New York. "You could say
Goldman are looking at the commodity markets and saying a number
of commodities have come a very long way and it's probably time
for them to be pulling back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude oil aside, copper 0#HG:, gold 0#GC:, sugar 0#SB:
and cocoa 0#CC: have all posted sharp price gains this year --
partly due to signs of economic rebound and largely due to a weak
dollar, which has hit 14-month lows. .DXY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It looks like, for most people, the dollar is just a one-way
trade now," Holland said. "Goldman probably feels differently as
they have been around for too long, and been too successful in the
commodities trade, to know there is anything such as a one-way
trade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrooks
Investments in Lisle, Illinois, agrees. "Their feeling is perhaps
the dollar weakness is near to running its course and, when the
dollar strengthens, the prices of commodities are likely to come
down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's quarterly earnings nearly quadrupled to $3.03
billion, topping analysts expectations. [ID:nN15288862]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As per the tradition on Wall Street, it did not break down its
commodity earnings. But it did say the asset class, as well as
currency trading, contributed less to net revenue than a year
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also made fewer hirings for commodities during the
third quarter than other investment banks, according to data
gathered this week from employment headhunters. [ID:nN13393616]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup (C.N), another Wall Street bank that reported
quarterly results on Thursday [ID:nN15291217], hired four energy
market specialists in the third quarter, compared with two by
Goldman.

&lt;p&gt;   * Goldman sets aside less for bonuses but keeps record pace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Shift in bonus strategy boosted quarterly earnings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Firm still mum on how much it will pay at year-end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
opted to devote a smaller chunk of revenues to compensation in
the latest quarter in what may be a sop to critics angry about
a bonus bonanza so soon after the bank took billions in
government funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the move also helped boost its quarterly earnings. And
Goldman Sachs employees need not lose any sleep. They are still
on track to get an average of $630,000 each, rivaling their
record bonus haul in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that average number -- which puts the bank far ahead of
rivals -- is based on Goldman's full work force, including
assistants and other support staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has been heavily criticized for setting aside so
much for its bonus pool so soon after the firm repaid $10
billion in taxpayers bailouts. This year, Goldman has set aside
$16.8 billion for bonuses, and looks well on track to break the
$20 billion mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Chief Financial Office David Viniar, on a call with
reporters across the world, was peppered with questions about
how the firm would pay its employees at year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had little to say on the topic, repeating the refrain
that all compensation decisions would be made at the end of the
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are giving it a lot of thought," Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Goldman typically devotes about half of its net
earnings to pay and benefits, another robust quarter allowed
Goldman to drop the ratio of compensation to revenue to about
43 percent while still setting aside $5.4 billion for pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the move padded quarterly earnings, which in
fact healthily beat analysts' forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This upside does not qualify as high on the 'quality'
scale," Roger Freeman, an analyst with Barclay's Capital said
in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also announced it had made a $200 million donation
to the Goldman Sachs Foundation, its not-for-profit charitable
arm. Viniar would not say whether that donation was part of a
larger good-will campaign and if the company would repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Contrary to some recent press reports, there was also no
mention of a company-wide charity drive to address the firm's
image concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar insisted the company is keenly aware of the world
outside of Goldman, which continues to suffer from job losses
and home foreclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are very focused on what is going on in the world,"
Viniar said. "We are focused on the economic climate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said the firm was committed to paying for
performance -- performance he called "fantastic" in light of
the downturn of the larger economy and the near-collapse of the
financial sector last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Steve Eder; Editing by Richard Chang)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 15 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on
Thursday cut its ratings on drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) by two
notches because of higher leverage resulting from its
acquisition of U.S. rival Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, completed its
roughly $67 billion acquisition of Wyeth on Thursday after U.S.
and Canadian antitrust regulators cleared the deal. For details
click on [ID:nN15309026].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's downgraded Pfizer to A1, the fifth-highest
investment-grade rating, from Aa2. The rating agency said it is
still reviewing Wyeth's A3 long-term rating and a decision will
depend on Pfizer's treatment of Wyeth's debt. A3 is the
seventh-highest investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Wyeth acquisition provides Pfizer with increased scale
and diversity, an improved pharmaceutical pipeline and
significant synergy opportunities," Moody's said in a
statement. However, key financial measures, including the ratio
of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, will initially erode, the rating agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Liquidity will remain strong, with cash and short-term
investments expected to be greater than $30 billion,
supplemented by $7 billion in undrawn revolving credit
agreements and strong free cash flow, Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dena Aubin; Editing by Andrew Hay)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) dampened buoyant investor sentiment on Thursday with earnings that failed to meet high-flying expectations and reversed gains on major stock markets and pushing the dollar higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investor optimism was pumped up after the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI hit the psychologically important 10,000 level on Wednesday. The index was down 10 points, or 0.10 percent, to trade at 10,005 in mid-day trading Thursday, after the earnings anti-climax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based investment bank, set the tone with its quarterly earnings -- which nearly quadrupled and topped expectations. However, its shares fell on disappointment that so much of the profit came from trading gains that might not be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were all sorts of rumors flying around that the results were going to be even stronger than consensus, so the initial reaction is that they've slightly disappointed despite beating estimates significantly," said Rupert Armitage of Shore Capital Stock Brokers in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C.N) also reported better-than-expected results, but it was a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World stocks as measured by MSCI were down 0.13 points to 297.30 but remained close to 13-month highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's Nikkei closed up 1.8 percent and the FTSEurofirst 300 was up a smidgen, 0.1 percent, to 1017.26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, world equities remain in a sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Wednesday their monthly survey of fund managers had shown increasing bullishness but it had not reached the level yet that risked a sharp counter swing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fears of a double-dip have receded, while worries about inflation and monetary tightening are not imminent enough to prevent an October surge in risk appetite," Michael Hartnett, the bank's chief global equity strategist, said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless insurance unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest level since January, according to a government report on Thursday that hinted at stabilization in the labor market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another decline in jobless claims strongly suggest that the worst for employment conditions have now passed," said Tom Sowanick, co-president and chief investment officer at Omnivest Group LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOLLAR ENJOYS FLIGHT TO QUALITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not coincidentally, the dollar caught a slight bid on optimism the U.S. economy is recovering and the U.S. central bank may raise interest rates sooner than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greenback was up against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY at 75.553 from a previous session close of 75.551.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher U.S. interest rates would make U.S. assets more attractive to investors and increase demand for dollars to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro was down 0.07 percent at $1.4913 from a previous session close of $1.4924. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 1.36 percent at 90.64 from a previous session close of 89.420.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury debt prices were slightly lower, after a weaker-than-expected reading for a mid-Atlantic business activity index erased most losses prompted by better than expected U.S. economic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 4/32, with the yield at 3.436 percent, while the 2-year U.S. Treasury note was down 1/32, with the yield at 0.9353 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the longer end of the yield curve, the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 4/32, with the yield at 4.2806 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jeremy Gaunt and David Brett; editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) completed its roughly $67 billion acquisition of U.S. rival Wyeth WYE.N on Thursday, as the world's largest drugmaker gets even bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said
on Thursday it has recovered most of the data feared lost by
users of its Sidekick mobile phone, following a Microsoft
server computer failure.&lt;/p&gt;

looking to convince customers to use remote storage services to

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The United States mobile wireless market will drive the backhaul service and
associated equipment markets to the same good fortune as wireless carriers,
according to a new report from Visant Strategies. 

"All wireless carriers in the United States are continuing to ramp up their
networks with technologies that allow much greater capacity and the use of much
more capacity per user, mainly a result of meaningful wireless data applications
and devices, and this means much more backhaul capacity will be needed," said
report author Andy Fuertes of Visant Strategies. 

"Backhaul cost and capacity challenges exist in the middle and edge of the
wireless network as leased copper lines which backhaul most base stations today
are often deemed too costly for the exponential jump in backhaul capacity that
will be needed for 3.5G/4G," Fuertes said. 

"Fiber is not always available at the base station or at middle elements of the
wireless network, such as the RNC/BSC, so carriers are using more wireless
backhaul," said Larry Swasey of Visant Strategies. 

According to "US MOBILE BACKHAUL 2010: Continued Expansion 2009 to 2015 and the
Needs of the Middle Network," base stations with more than 24 Mbps of backhaul
capacity will grow by more than a factor of twenty from 2009 to 2015 while in
2015 the number of base stations with less than 12 Mbps of backhaul capacity
will be half of that today. Also, wireless backhaul links will nearly double by
2015 while wireline backhaul links will increase slightly through the same
period. 

The report quantifies through 2015 base station deployments, tower construction,
capital spending, subscribers and network evolution to 3.5G and 4G platforms.
Middle of the network backhaul bottlenecks are detailed while capacity per tower
and 3.5G/4G base station, MSC, BSC/RNC sites and collector point deployments are
given through 2015. Backhaul service revenues, average backhaul per month per
base station and backhaul lines by capacity per base station are given as are
backhaul lines by technology.

after quarterly results from Goldman Sachs Group  (GS.N) and
Citigroup Inc failed to live up to expectations of some
investors a day after major indexes rallied to yearly highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer prices rose marginally in September and the number
of workers filing new claims for jobless insurance hit a
nine-month low last week, more proof the economy was healing
after a protracted recession, but not enough to turn stocks.
[ID:nN15292883]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the earnings from Goldman and Citigroup came in
better than the analysts' forecasts, their results came a day
after much stronger-than-expected numbers from JPMorgan Chase 
Co (JPM.N) helped drive Dow industrials above 10,000, fanning
hopes that other banks would follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The blowout number that JPMorgan had yesterday ... raised
expectations," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment
officer at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. "Goldman
produced great numbers but apparently didn't live up to those
heightened expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs fell 1.5 percent, and Citigroup (C.N) dropped
4 percent, with the KBW Bank index .BKX falling 1.30 percent.
 For details please see [ID:nN15288862] [ID:nN15291217]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two important early regional gauges of business activity
gave a mixed picture of the prospects for an economic recovery.
Factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region grew less than
expected in October, conflicting with a much more robust
reading out of New York state earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 23.88
points, or 0.24 percent, to 9,991.98. The Standard  Poor's 500

Examiner`s conclusion that cocaine use contributed to Billy`s death. We found
this to be so upsetting that we asked for review by an independent medical
examiner. 

This review, conducted by Dr. William L. Manion, states that the autopsy results
do not support the conclusion that cocaine was a contributory cause of Billy`s
death. In fact, one of the few areas of agreement between the two reports is
that it was a "natural" death. Dr. Manion goes on to say that if cocaine had
been considered a significant contributing factor, the manner of death would be
classified as "accidental" and not "natural." 

Dr. Manion`s report also says: 

"&#8230;chronic cocaine use was not demonstrated by the autopsy findings of Mr.
William Mays. In addition, there is nothing in his medical, social or
professional history to suggest chronic cocaine use. Therefore, I do not believe
cocaine played a significant contributing factor in the death of Mr. Mays as the
autopsy specimens and findings are not consistent with the cardiac conditions
normally observed in a person chronically using cocaine." 

Dr. Manion, M.D., Ph.D, J.D., is consultant medical examiner for Burlington and
Ocean Counties, New Jersey and Chief of Pathology for Virtua Health in New
Jersey. He is board certified by the American Board of Pathology in both
Anatomic and Clinical Pathology and Forensic Pathology, and is a nationally
recognized and respected expert in the field of pathology. 

We believed at the time -- and believe even more now based on Dr. Manion`s
report -- that the conclusions drawn by the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner
were not supported by the findings of the autopsy, nor by Billy`s medical
history. And, although we cannot undo the damage that has already been done to
Billy`s reputation, we are hopeful that this information will assist in clearing
the name of a good husband, father and friend. 

This has been a very difficult period for our family and we appreciate the
continued support that Billy`s many fans have extended. We again thank these
fans and the members of the media who have respected our family`s privacy. We
are also grateful to Dr. Manion for his thoughtful and objective review of
Billy`s autopsy information and the medical literature to make sense of Billy`s
untimely death.

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman Sachs, Citigroup report results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * New York manufacturing gauge jumps in October&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Weekly jobless claims less than expected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * For up-to-the-minute market news, click [STXNEWS/US]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Updates economic data, analysts comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Edward Krudy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a
lower open on Thursday after quarterly results from Goldman
Sachs Group  (GS.N) and Citigroup Inc failed to live up to
expectations some investors had for financial sector shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the earnings from Goldman and Citigroup came in
better than the analysts' forecasts, their results came a day
after much stronger-than-expected numbers from JPMorgan Chase 
Co (JPM.N) drove stocks to new yearly highs and raised hopes
that other banks would follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan set a high bar, a bar that is tough to beat for
other banks," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer for
Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Goldman Sachs fell 2.2 percent before the bell to
$188.01 while Citigroup (C.N) dropped 2.6 percent to $4.87. For
details please see [ID:nN15288862] [ID:nN15291217]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 fell 5.50 points and were below fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 fell 37
points, and Nasdaq futures NDc1 lost 7.75 point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday the Dow industrials broke the psychologically
important 10,000-level for the first time since October 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Generally the market's got a pretty good rise, and for
some traders the expectation is to sell on the news no matter
how the numbers come out," said Steve Goldman, market
strategist for Weeden  Co in Greenwich, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Futures paired some of their losses after a gauge of
manufacturing in New York State jumped unexpectedly this month
to its highest in five years, and government data showed the
number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless insurance
unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest level since January.
[ID:nN14260021] [ID:nN15257434]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The markets are going to be focused on company revenue
today. The jobless number may cause markets to cut some of
their losses, but earnings will remain the focus today," said
Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist, Subodh Kumar 
Associates in Toronto.

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman Sachs results help dollar reclaim some losses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Dollar hit 14-month low vs forex basket&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Dovish U.S. FOMC minutes weigh on dollar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Catherine Bosley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The dollar recovered from
14-month lows on Thursday as stocks fell after more U.S. bank
earnings, but the greenback remained pressured on expectations
U.S. interest rates would remain low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) posted better-than-expected
quarterly results, with third quarter earnings per share of
$5.25 versus forecasts of $4.24. [nN15288862]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But European stocks pared gains as the results were weaker
than some in the market had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(Goldman has) taken U.S. stock futures lower and at the
moment provided a little of respite from the plethora of
dollar-selling interest," said Jeremy Stretch, currency
strategist at Rabobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's still the case that everything's about stocks, and
stocks expectations and risk appetite. Goldman's failing to beat
what were very, very lofty expectations has taken us back
somewhat in euro/dollar in the short term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stock index futures SPc1 fell further after Citigroup
Inc (C.N) reported a quarterly shareholder loss, but the results
did not greatly affect the foreign exchange market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up
0.12 percent at 75.643, after hitting a session high of 75.765.
It had fallen to a 14-month low of 75.211 .DXY earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EURO HITS 14-MONTH HIGH THEN SLIDES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The euro hit a day's low after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet repeated the euro was not created
to be a global reserve currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The euro EUR= fell as low as $1.4844 according to Reuters
data, down 0.4 percent on the day and retreating from a 14-month
high hit in earlier trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sterling pared some gains but was still broadly higher on
the day, prompted by short-covering after investors had boosted
short sterling positions that helped push the pound to a
five-month low earlier this week, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of England policymaker Paul Fisher told the Financial
Times he felt more confident the central bank's asset purchase
programme was working. [ID:nLE413216]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts said they expected further dollar weakness
after the latest minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve Open
Market Committee, showed that some policymakers called for
increasing asset purchases. [ID:nWEQ003473]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's obviously very low interest rates in the States and
there's no sign they're going any time soon, listening to the
Fed and their minutes last night," said Chris Turner, head of
foreign exchange strategy at ING in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today's very modes correction from new lows is nothing
serious for the dollar bear trend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon Derrick of Bank of New York Mellon said reports of
Asian central banks intervening to keep their currencies from
appreciating had not lifted the dollar, because the market
anticipated some of the dollars would be converted into euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong's central bank sold HK$1.5 billion ($200 million)
to keep the Hong Kong dollar within its trading band.
[ID:nHKG105478]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The greenback earlier fell to 14-month lows against the
higher-yielding Australian dollar and a 15-month trough versus
the New Zealand and Canada dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reserve Bank of Australia chief Glenn Stevens said local
interest rates would need to move towards a more normal setting
as economic recovery took hold, reinforcing the view rates would
be hiked for a second consecutive month in November.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Thursday reported that its quarterly profit nearly quadrupled from the most closely comparable quarter a year ago, beating expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman reported net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $3.028 billion, or $5.25 a share, compared with $810 million, or $1.81 a share, in last year's quarter ended August 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman changed to a conventional earnings reporting calendar this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former investment bank's shares were down 2.8 percent in premarket electronic trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARIFA SHEIKH-USMANI, EQUITY TRADER AT SPREADEX, SAINT ALBANS, BRITAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are better than expected but there was talk of them coming in at $6, so that's why they have sold off a bit after the figures. It's a good result but the market will be a touch disappointed because JPMorgan flew through expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEINZ-GERD SONNENSCHEIN, EQUITY STRATEGIST AT POSTBANK, BONN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At first sight, the numbers look really strong, not only regarding EPS, but also in light of the rate of return on equity. They have made money where it was expected, mainly in the investment banking business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RUPERT ARMITAGE, DIRECTOR AT SHORE CAPITAL STOCKBROKERS, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was all sorts of rumors flying around that the results were going to be even stronger than consensus, so the initial reaction is that they've slightly disappointed despite beating estimates significantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People were talking of earnings coming at $6 a share, while analysts forecast $4.25 and results came in a $5.25. They were still 25 percent out but they're rarely that far out. I think people have just been getting a little bit ahead of themselves based on the market performance over the last quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL HOLLAND, PRESIDENT OF HOLLAND  CO IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once again they have shown why they deserve their reputation as the top of the group, as the industry leader not only in performance, but outperforming expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most important was the revenue (line). That $12.3 billion is a big number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Goldman is saying is that they have seen improvements in several of their business, so I think even though the majority of their competitors don't perform the way they do, the improvement in the businesses is something one can look for in the coming reports of their competitors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio in New York, Harpreet Bhal and David Brett in London, and Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt )&lt;/p&gt;

______________ 

"Although the world continues to face serious economic challenges, we are seeing
improving conditions and evidence of stabilization, even growth, across a number
of sectors," said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our
client franchise businesses -- advisory, financing, market making and asset
management -- contribute to and benefit from the overall improvement in
conditions. Because the job market, and growth more generally, remain under
stress, we continue to be focused on actively helping our clients in order to
promote greater economic activity." 

Net Revenues

Investment Banking

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $899 million, 31% lower than the third
quarter of 2008 and 38% lower than the second quarter of 2009. 

Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $325 million, 47% lower than the third
quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide
completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm`s Underwriting
business were $574 million, 15% lower than the third quarter of 2008, due to
significantly lower net revenues in debt underwriting, partially offset by
higher net revenues in equity underwriting. The decrease in debt underwriting
primarily reflected a decline in net revenues from leveraged loans. The increase
in equity underwriting primarily reflected an increase in industry-wide initial
public offerings. The firm`s investment banking transaction backlog increased
significantly during the quarter. (5)

Trading and Principal Investments

Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $10.03 billion,
significantly higher than the third quarter of 2008 and 7% lower than a record
second quarter of 2009. 

Net revenues in FICC were $5.99 billion, significantly higher than the third
quarter of 2008. These results reflected strong performances in credit products
and mortgages, which were significantly higher compared with a difficult third
quarter of 2008. Net revenues in interest rate products were also strong and
significantly higher compared with the third quarter of 2008, while net revenues
in commodities and currencies were lower compared with the same prior year
period. During the quarter, FICC operated in an environment characterized by
solid client activity levels, tighter credit spreads and a general improvement
in asset values. 

Net revenues in Equities were $2.78 billion, 78% higher than the third quarter
of 2008. These results reflected strong net revenues in derivatives, which were
significantly higher than the third quarter of 2008, as well as a solid
performance in shares. In addition, net revenues in principal strategies
improved significantly compared with a difficult third quarter of 2008.
Commissions declined compared with the third quarter of 2008. During the
quarter, Equities operated in an environment generally characterized by a
significant increase in global equity prices, favorable market opportunities and
a decline in volatility levels. 

Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $1.26 billion for the third
quarter of 2009. These results included a gain of $977 million from corporate
principal investments, a gain of $344 million related to the firm`s investment
in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC)
and a loss of $66 million from real estate principal investments. 

Asset Management and Securities Services

Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.45 billion, 29%
lower than the third quarter of 2008 and 6% lower than the second quarter of
2009. 

Asset Management net revenues were $974 million, 14% lower than the third
quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in the composition
of assets managed. During the third quarter of 2009, assets under management
increased $29 billion to $848 billion, due to $39 billion of market
appreciation, primarily in equity and fixed income assets, partially offset by
$10 billion of net outflows. Net outflows primarily reflected outflows in money
market assets, partially offset by inflows in fixed income assets. 

Securities Services net revenues were $472 million, 48% lower than the third
quarter of 2008. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflected the impact of
lower customer balances compared with the third quarter of 2008. 

Expenses

Operating expenses were $7.58 billion, 49% higher than the third quarter of 2008
and 13% lower than the second quarter of 2009. 

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, estimated year-end
discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such
as payroll taxes, severance costs and benefits) were $5.35 billion, which was
higher than the third quarter of 2008, due to higher net revenues. The ratio of
compensation and benefits to net revenues was 43.3% for the third quarter of
2009 (compared with 48.3% for the second quarter of 2009), resulting in a ratio
of compensation and benefits to net revenues of 47.0% for the first nine months
of 2009. This ratio was 49.0% for the first six months of 2009 and 48.0% for the
first nine months of 2008. 

Non-Compensation Expenses

Non-compensation expenses were $2.23 billion, 2% higher than the third quarter
of 2008 and 7% higher than the second quarter of 2009. The increase compared
with the third quarter of 2008 reflected the impact of a $200 million charitable
contribution to The Goldman Sachs Foundation and $36 million of net provisions
for litigation and regulatory proceedings during the third quarter of 2009,
partially offset by the impact of lower transaction volumes in Equities. 

Provision for Taxes

The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2009 was 32.2%, up
slightly from 31.5% for the first half of 2009. 

Capital

As of September 25, 2009, total capital was $255.07 billion, consisting of
$65.35 billion in total shareholders` equity (common shareholders` equity of
$58.40 billion and preferred stock of $6.96 billion) and $189.72 billion in
unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $110.75 and
tangible book value per common share (4) was $101.39, an increase of 4% and 5%,
respectively, during the quarter. Book value and tangible book value per common
share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units
granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 527.3 million at
period end. 

On July 22, 2009, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.) repurchased in full
from the U.S. Treasury the warrant to purchase 12.2 million shares of common
stock that was issued to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the U.S. Treasury`s TARP
Capital Purchase Program. The purchase price paid by Group Inc. to the U.S.
Treasury for this warrant was $1.1 billion. This amount was recorded as a
reduction to shareholders` equity. Excluding this repurchase, book value and
tangible book value per common share (4) increased 6% and 7%, respectively,
during the quarter. 

Under the regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to bank holding
companies, the firm`s Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel I (3) was 14.5% as of
September 25, 2009, up from 13.8% as of June 26, 2009. The firm`s Tier 1 common
ratio (3) under Basel I was 11.6% as of September 25, 2009, up from 10.9% as of
June 26, 2009. The firm`s ratio of tangible common shareholders` equity (4) to
Basel I risk-weighted assets (3) was 13.1% as of September 25, 2009, up from
12.4% as of June 26, 2009. 

The firm also assesses its capital adequacy using an internal risk-based
methodology, which is generally consistent with Basel II. Under this
methodology, the firm`s Tier 1 capital ratio (3) was 16.0% as of September 25,
2009. 

Other Balance Sheet and Liquidity Metrics

* Total assets (6) were $882 billion as of September 25, 2009, down slightly
from June 26, 2009. 
* Level 3 assets (6) were approximately $50 billion as of September 25, 2009
(down from $54 billion as of June 26, 2009) and represented 5.7% of total
assets. 
* Average global core excess (7) liquidity was $167 billion for the third
quarter of 2009, down slightly from $171 billion for the second quarter of
2009.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead
represent only the firm`s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by
their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm`s control. It is
possible that the firm`s actual results and financial condition may differ,
possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition
indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the
risks and important factors that could affect the firm`s future results and
financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm`s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and
"Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm`s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended November 28, 2008. 

Certain of the information regarding the firm`s Tier 1 capital ratios,
risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and average global core
excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates; these estimates are
forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as
the firm completes its quarterly financial statements. 

Statements about the firm`s investment banking transaction backlog also may
constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk
that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be
completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually
earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those
currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the
terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case
of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general
economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities
markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the
securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the
securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse
development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a
required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that
could adversely affect the firm`s investment banking transactions, see "Risk
Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm`s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and "Management`s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm`s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.

 (1)    Annualized return on average common shareholders` equity (ROE) is computed by dividing annualized net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly common 
        shareholders` equity. The one-time preferred dividend of $426 million related to the repurchase of the firm`s TARP preferred stock (calculated as the difference between  
        the carrying value and the redemption value of the preferred stock) in the second quarter of 2009 was not annualized in the calculation of annualized net earnings        
        applicable to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 25, 2009 since it has no impact on other quarters in the year. The following table sets forth our   
        average common shareholders` equity:

 (3)    The Federal Reserve Board is the primary U.S. regulator of Group Inc., a bank holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act. As a    
        bank holding company, the firm is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The firm is reporting its Tier 1 capital ratio in 
        accordance with the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to bank holding companies, which are based on the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on       
        Banking Supervision (Basel I). The Tier 1 capital ratio equals Tier 1 capital divided by total risk-weighted assets. The Tier 1 common ratio equals Tier 1 capital less   
        preferred stock and junior subordinated debt issued to trusts, divided by total risk-weighted assets. The firm`s risk-weighted assets under Basel I were approximately    
        $409 billion as of September 25, 2009. The firm also assesses its capital adequacy using an internal risk-based methodology. Under this methodology, the calculation of   
        the Tier 1 capital ratio is generally consistent with the guidelines set out in the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital 
        Standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel II). The firm`s risk-weighted assets under this methodology were approximately $404 billion as of   
        September 25, 2009. These ratios represent preliminary estimates as of the date of this earnings release and may be revised in the firm`s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q   
        for the fiscal period ended September 25, 2009. For a further discussion of the firm's capital ratios, see "Equity Capital" in Part I, Item 2 "Management's Discussion and 
        Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended June 26, 2009.                         
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 (4)    Tangible common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Tangible book value per common  
        share is computed by dividing tangible common shareholders` equity by the number of common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with 
        no future service requirements. Management believes that tangible common shareholders` equity is meaningful because it is one of the measures that the firm and investors 
        use to assess capital adequacy. In addition, management believes that presenting the change in book value and tangible book value per common share excluding the one-time 
        impact of the repurchase of the firm`s TARP warrant provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison of these measures. The following table sets forth the reconciliation 
        of total shareholders' equity to tangible common shareholders' equity:

 (5)     The firm`s investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of the firm`s future net revenues from investment banking transactions where management believes 
         that future revenue realization is more likely than not.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (6)     This amount represents a preliminary estimate as of the date of this earnings release and may be revised in the firm`s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period 
         ended September 25, 2009.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (7)     The firm`s global core excess represents a pool of excess liquidity consisting of unencumbered, highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide same-day  
         liquidity, as well as overnight cash deposits. This liquidity is intended to allow the firm to meet immediate obligations without the need to sell other assets or depend 
         on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets in a difficult funding environment. This amount represents the average loan value (the estimated amount of cash that  
         would be advanced by counterparties against these securities), as well as overnight cash deposits, of the global core excess. For a further discussion of the firm's      
         global core excess liquidity pool, please see "Liquidity and Funding Risk" in Part I, Item 2 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  
         Operations" in the firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended June 26, 2009. This amount represents a preliminary estimate as of the date of this   
         earnings release and may be revised in the firm`s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended September 25, 2009.                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (8)     Unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are treated as a separate class of securities in calculating    
         earnings per common share. The firm adopted this methodology in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The impact to basic earnings per common share for the three and nine    
         months ended September 25, 2009, was a reduction of $0.02 and $0.04 per common share, respectively. Prior periods have not been restated due to immateriality.            
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (9)     Includes employees, consultants and temporary staff.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (10)    Compensation and benefits and non-compensation expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes are included in their respective line items in the  
         consolidated statements of earnings.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (11)    VaR is the potential loss in value of the firm`s trading positions due to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. The modeling  
         of the risk characteristics of the firm`s trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While management believes that these assumptions and     
         approximations are reasonable, there is no standard methodology for estimating VaR, and different assumptions and/or approximations could produce materially different VaR 
         estimates. For a further discussion of the calculation of VaR, see "Market Risk" in Part I, Item 2 "Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and       
         Results of Operations" in the firm`s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended June 26, 2009.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (12)    Equals the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly 
         correlated.

Assets under management do not include the firm`s investments in funds that it manages.    
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (14)    Represents investments included within the Principal Investments component of the firm`s Trading and Principal Investments segment.                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (15)    Includes interests of $4.35 billion as of September 25, 2009 held by investment funds managed by the firm. The fair value of the investment in the ordinary shares of

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft stepped up promotion of Bing in China with the launch of a Web services platform for mobile phones this week, a possible step toward challenging the dominance of Google and Baidu.com in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft portal, an effort to spur use of its services in a market crowded by local competitors, offers downloads of mobile clients for Bing and Windows Live Messenger, along with instructions on how to use Microsoft services, including Hotmail, from a mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing has not caught on in China and Microsoft has done little to promote it in the country. However, Bing, launched in June, has grown quickly in the U.S. and attracted about 9 percent of online searches there last month, according to Internet monitoring companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's online search market is dominated by local player Baidu, with Google in a distant second place. Baidu and Google together account for as much as 95 percent of online searches done in China, leaving Yahoo, a range of local search engines, and any new players like Bing to compete for the remaining slice of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bing mobile client lets users search for local information such as maps, restaurant locations and weather forecasts. Microsoft "will continue to strengthen and expand the service scope of its mobile Internet products," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing has strong potential but will face difficulty competing with Baidu and Google in the near term, said Ben Cavender, senior analyst at China Market Research Group in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Baidu and Google have well-established search services for free music downloads that keep Chinese users coming back, Microsoft so far has done little to localize Bing, Cavender said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing did not make a list of China's top 10 most-visited search engines in August, as posted on the Web site of local online traffic analyzer CR-Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to fix formatting)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Nikkei breaks resistance near 10,140&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Nikkei rose over 2 pct at one stage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Exporters, techs strong after Dow breaks above 10,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elaine Lies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock average rose
1.5 percent on Thursday, bolstered by exporters and tech shares
such as TDK Corp (6762.T) after robust U.S. company results and
retail sales data boosted the Dow over 10,000 for the first time
in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the market came off earlier intraday highs in afternoon
trade as the impact of the much better-than-expected results from
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and economic data wore thin ahead of
additional U.S. bank results on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was some substantial selling of Nikkei futures around
10,300, and this has weighed on the cash market as well," said
Hiroaki Osakabe, a fund manager at Chibagin Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This morning's energy may also have simply been the Nikkei
playing catch-up to the gains made by other Asian markets
yesterday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others said investors remained less than enthusiastic about
Japanese shares, despite U.S. retail sales data rising for the
second month and offering cautious optimism that spending would
support the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are signs that the market may not rise all that much
more today, particularly since foreign investors didn't seem to
be all that keen on Japanese shares in comparison to other Asian
share markets yesterday," said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a supervisor at
the investment advisory department of Okasan Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think there's still some concern about earnings."
The benchmark Nikkei .N225 rose 148.42 points to 10,210.29
but was off the day's high of 10,272.62 -- a rise of 2.1 percent
-- marked at the close of the morning session. The broader Topix
.TOPX was up 1 percent at 903.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nikkei surged through resistance that had developed
around 10,140 -- the level of its 25-day moving average -- and
market players said one key focus of the day would be whether it
manages to close above that level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average .DJI rose above 10,000 for
the first time in a year, to 10,015.86 for a gain of 1.5 percent.
Other U.S. indexes all rose more than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exporters climbed, with Sony up 3.4 percent to 2,595 yen,
Honda Motor Co (7267.T) gaining 1.6 percent to 2,805 yen and
Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) rising 1.4 percent to 3,620 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tech shares also advanced, with TDK Corp (6762.T) up 1.5
percent and industrial robot maker Fanuc (6954.T) up 2.2 percent
at 7,750 yen. Chip equipment maker Tokyo Electron (8035.T) edged
up 0.7 percent to 5,780 yen.
Banks were up but pared gains, with top lender Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group (8306.T) rising 1.2 percent to 491 yen and
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T) up a mere 0.6 percent to
3,290 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some in the market were doubtful about how long financial
shares would continue to benefit from JPMorgan's results, saying
that the prospect of a loan moratorium proposed by Banking
Minister Shizuka Kamei still hung over the sector.

&lt;p&gt;Executives from Intel Capital and IBM face insider trading charges after allegedly scheming to provide information that others used to reap millions of dollars in illegal profits, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC charged six individuals for conspiring to execute trade securities using confidential information from companies including Intel, Google and Advanced Micro Devices, the SEC said in a press release. Some of the non-public information shared between the individuals related to corporate earnings or takeover activity at companies, SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives charged included Robert Moffatt, senior vice president and executive in IBM's systems and technology group, and Rajiv Goel, who is Intel treasury's managing director of investments. The SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffatt and Goel allegedly provided insider information about companies including Sun Microsystems and Intel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other individuals charged include Raj Rajaratnam, a portfolio manager with hedge fund Galleon Group, who gained close to $25 million in illegal profits, according to the SEC. Rajaratnam is considered the 559th richest man in the world according to Forbes magazine. Others charged in the complaint include Anil Kumar, a director at McKinsey, and Danielle Chiesi and Mark Kurland of New Castle Funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Raj Rajaratnam is not a master of the universe, but rather a master of the rolodex," said Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's division of enforcement. "He cultivated a network of high-ranking corporate executives and insiders, and then tapped into this ring to obtain confidential details about quarterly earnings and takeover activity," Khuzami said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goel allegedly provided insider tips to Rajaratnam about certain Intel quarterly earnings and a pending joint venture concerning Clearwire, in which Intel has invested, the SEC said. Based on the insider information, Rajaratnam executed trades on Galleon's behalf. The tips netted Goel close to $250,000 in illicit profits after Rajaratnam executed trades for Goel's personal brokerage account based on confidential tips concerning Hilton and PeopleSupport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goel has been placed on administrative leave until the company looks into this matter, said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Intel has not been contacted by authorities about the charges, but will fully cooperate if and when contacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said IBM's Moffatt allegedly provided inside information about Sun Microsystems to New Castle Funds' Chiesi. The information was provided when IBM was considering acquiring Sun. Chiesi allegedly made trades on behalf of New Castle Funds based on the tips and netted about $1 million in profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM declined comment on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKinsey's Kumar allegedly tipped off Rajaratnam about pending transactions involving Advanced Micro Devices and two Abu Dhabi-based "sovereign entities," the SEC said in a release. Rajaratnam then made trades on Galleon's behalf based on the insider information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMD has had multiple transactions involving the Abu Dhabi government in recent years. In 2007, the Abu Dhabi government's Mubadala Development Company paid $622 million to acquire an 8.1 percent stake in AMD. Earlier this year, AMD spun off manufacturing assets to a separate company called GlobalFoundries in a joint venture with Advanced Technology Investment Company, an investment firm owned by the Abu Dhabi government. Abu Dhabi is an emirate in the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM disclosed the plans at a time when server sales among all vendors have taken a bruising during the economic downturn, and IBM is no exception. In a third quarter earnings call yesterday, said Mark Loughridge, IBM's chief financial officer, said that the company's third quarter mainframe revenue declined by 26% from the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Loughridge said IBM is optimistic about the hardware business in the near future in a climate of what he called a return to "general stability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Power7 chip will offer up to eight cores and increase support for virtualized environments, executives said. IBM has slowly be releasing specs for Power7, which it says will support 1,000 virtualized machines, almost four times the 254 supported by the dual core Power6 chip that was released in 2007. IBM's Power chips support AIX, Linux and the older System I computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM released its last mainframe, the z10 , in February, 2008, and typically releases a new mainframe every three years. If it keeps with that schedule, the new mainframe probably won't be shipping until late next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon Haff, an analyst at Illuminata Inc. in Nashua, N.H., said IBM's next mainframes may help users cut costs by allowing them to move some of the mainframe processing to IBM x86 systems. In a hybrid system, the mainframe may handle the service management and data storage with the x86 systems performing some of computational work, said Haff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has tried to cut user costs in the current mainframe line by using specialty processing engines, such the Linux IFL processor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to offload mainframe work to the x86 systems of multiple vendors is one of the reasons cited by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) trade group in its effort to trigger a new antitrust inquiry into IBM practices by the Department of Justice. The trade group claims that IBM is blocks third party vendors from offering such an offloading capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich Partridge, an analyst at Ideas International Inc. in Rye Brook, N.Y., said that with increases in throughput and processing power in the next mainframe, IBM will probably encourage users to replace servers with mainframes to cut back on data center sprawl. The argument for "more centralized computing infrastructure will play to the mainframe," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's planned hardware improvements come as Oracle Corp. outlines more of its plan to integrate Sun Microsystems Inc. once its deal to buy the struggling computer maker closes. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison went into overdrive about IBM at company's annual conference OpenWorld, vowing to vanquish IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM CTO Alan Ganek was sanguine about IBM's prospects in any head-to-head performance metric match up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oracle is a competitor and will always be a partner," said Ganek, of Ellison's attack, "but I don't see any change here I'm worried about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Loughridge noted that IBM's software's sales improved in the third quarter. He cited In particular a 2% increase in sales of the company's major middleware products, such as the WebSphere, Tivoli, Lotus and Rational product lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganek said in an interview that improvements in the WebSphere and other middleware lines generally are the result of automating businesses processes, so that a user's data can flow through the process end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - It isn't often that big blue gets a black eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acknowledged Thursday that one of the critical network vulnerabilities it patched earlier in the week was due to a programming error on its part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw, one of 34 patched Tuesday in a massive security update , was in the code for SMB 2 (Server Message Block 2), a Microsoft-made network file- and print-sharing protocol that ships with Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Look at the two array references to ValidateRoutines[] near the end," said Michael Howard, principal security program manager in Microsoft's security engineering and communications group, referring to a code snippet he showed in a post to the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) blog. "The array index to both is the wrong variable: pHeader-Command should be pWI-Command."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howard, who is probably best known for co-authoring Writing Secure Code , went on to say that the error was not only in new code, but a "bug of concern."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incorrect variable -- "pHeader" instead of "pWI" -- produced a vulnerability that Microsoft rated critical, its highest threat ranking. "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights," read the MS09-050 security bulletin released Tuesday. Attackers could trigger the bug by sending a rigged SMB packet to an unpatched PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he did in July when he admitted an extra "" character in a Microsoft code library created a widespread vulnerability in most company software -- and software crafted by third-party developers such as Sun, Cisco and Adobe -- Howard argued that the SMB 2 mistake was virtually impossible to catch without a line-by-line review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is only one current SDL requirement or recommendation that could potentially find this, and that is fuzz testing," said Howard. "The only other method that could find this kind of bug is very slow and painstaking code review. This code was peer-reviewed prior to check-in into Windows Vista; but the bug was missed. Humans are fallible, after all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuzzing -- subjecting software to a wide range of data input to see if, and where, it breaks -- did uncover the bug "very late in the Windows 7 development process," Howard said. Although the preview versions of Windows 7 that Microsoft handed out to the public -- both the beta from January 2009 and the release candidate posted in May -- included the bug, Microsoft caught it in time to patch the RTM, or release to manufacturing, final code that will officially ship next Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SMB 2 bug in question was not the one that Microsoft publicized last month in a security advisory. That vulnerability, which received attention because exploit code went public , also affected Windows 7 prior to the RTM build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howard also said that he thought Microsoft's SDL process has handled the "low-hanging bugs" in the company's code, leaving what he called "one-off bugs" that are difficult to detect using automated tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The majority of the bugs I see in Windows are one-off bugs that can't be found easily through static analysis or education, which leaves only manual code review, and for some bug classes, fuzz testing," he said. "But fuzz testing is hardly perfect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts this week urged Windows users to put the MS09-050 patches on a high-priority list, if only because exploit code for one of the three SMB 2 vulnerabilities was public knowledge. Microsoft echoed that in its monthly deployment recommendations .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's security updates, including MS09-050, can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Thursday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Raising Price Target on Apple

Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) sold 5.2 million iPhones in the June quarter,
representing a 626.0% unit growth over the year-ago quarter. In the current
quarter the company released Snow Leopard, the latest upgrade to Apple's OS X
operating system. In addition, Apple announced new upgrades to its iPod digital
media players. We continue to believe that Apple will outperform its peers given
its strong iPhone sales and new product launches. 

The company is currently benefiting from a positive mix shift to the
higher-margin iPhones and iPod business from its traditional MP3 players, as a
result of which management posted non-GAAP gross margin of 41.3% in the last
quarter. We expect the company to post higher margins as a result of higher
sales and the continued mix shift in the next several quarters. 

However, Apple faces significant competition in all areas of its business from
Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), Research In Motion
(Nasdaq: RIMM) and Palm (Nasdaq: PALM).

Goldman Beats Zacks Estimate

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.`s (NYSE: GS) third quarter 2009 (ended Sept. 25, 2009)
earnings of $5.25 per share were significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of $4.13. 

Results reflected strong performance in the trading operations, which offset the
decrease in investment banking division. The company also reported a drop in
expenses on a sequential basis. 

GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2009 was $3.0 billion or $5.25 per share
compared to $2.7 billion or $4.93 per share in the prior quarter (ended June 26,
2009) and $0.8 billion or $1.81 per share in the prior-year quarter (ended Aug.
29, 2009). 

ASML Reports Strong Quarter

ASML Holding N.V. (Nasdaq: ASML) was the first of the capital equipment
companies to report third quarter results. Judging from the 100.7% increase in
revenue to &#8364;555.3 million, we feel more optimistic about Applied Materials
(Nasdaq: AMAT), KLA Tencor (Nasdaq: KLAC), Lam Research (Nasdaq: LRCX) and Tokyo
Electron, the other big players in the space. 

Although the year-over-year decline of 20.3% indicates that sales are still
quite weak, performance is still significantly better than the 67.2% and 80.0%
year-over-year declines in the preceding two quarters. 

The strengthening markets are not so much a reflection of a recovery, according
to management, as they are a result of new product introductions, leading to
increased demand from memory and foundry customers in Asia.

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Standard  Poor's cut its
ratings on the world's largest drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N),
leaving only four U.S. nonfinancial companies with top ratings
from SP.

 Pfizer, which acquired Wyeth for roughly $67 billion on
Thursday, will take on $22.5 billion in new debt from its
former rival, SP said in a statement.

 That leaves Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N), Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Automatic Data Processing
Inc (ADP.O) as the only remaining companies with top ratings
from SP.

 SP cut Pfizer two notches to AA, its third highest
investment grade, from AAA. It upgraded its ratings on Wyeth
two notches to AA.

 "The addition of Wyeth's products to Pfizer's portfolio
better diversifies the company's revenue base and reduces its
reliance on best-seller Lipitor," SP said in a statement.

 But the lowered ratings reflect earnings challenges in
light of pending patent expirations in the troubled market, and
"significant additional borrowings needed to fund the
acquisition," SP said.

 Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, which cut
Pfizer on Thursday, already rated the company below their top
rating.

 Fitch downgraded Pfizer one notch to AA-minus from AA,
while Moody's cut the drugmaker two notches to A1 from Aa2. It
also raised Wyeth ratings three notches to AA-minus, from
A-minus.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has decided to grant a visa to a senior North Korean official for talks with U.S. scholars and probably also with a U.S. diplomat, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.

Mr. Goldman joined USIS in 2005 as the director of productivity, primarily
focused on implementing programs to improve the performance of the field
organization in the former Investigative Services Division (ISD) of USIS. Most
recently, as the director of strategy and corporate development, Mr. Goldman led
the USIS merger and acquisition program.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Investors expecting Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) new operating system to juice the company's shares or spur a recovery in technology spending are likely to be disappointed, even if users embrace the new software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful introduction of Windows 7 next week has largely been factored into Microsoft's share price, which jumped nearly 80 percent since March. Investors are now more wary of a sell-off than looking for further gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new operating system, arguably Microsoft's most important product launch since Windows 95 a decade ago, arrives as demand is growing to replace aging software and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hope it will energize a corporate spending cycle curtailed by the worst recession since the Great Depression, but most analysts agree that its effect on Microsoft and the broader technology sector will be more gradual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not expecting this huge wave in new revenue," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which holds Microsoft shares. "It's going to be more of a gentle drift upward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC sales are expected to rise 12.6 percent next year, according to research firm Gartner, but the strength of the next phase of computer buying is at the mercy of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's pent-up demand for a better operating system that will start unfolding next year," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at brokerage McAdams Wright Ragen. "But that is conditioned on what the economy does from here. If things get a lot worse, we shouldn't expect as big of an upgrade cycle as everyone is thinking about today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOTTOM-LINE IMPACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new operating system, which has been available in test format for months, has been praised by reviewers as a replacement for the unpopular Vista, launched almost three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system is more of an upgrade to Vista than an overhaul, and is expected to work on most PCs without a hitch. Computer and chip makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Dell DELL.O and Intel (INTC.O) have welcomed its release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even a flawless roll-out may not be enough to kick-start a new spending cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At best, Windows 7 may generate a modest bump in home demand and possibly some added demand among small businesses," said Gartner's research director George Shiffler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We aren't expecting most larger businesses, governments and educational institutions to express strong demand for the new operating system until late 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of Windows 7 on Microsoft's finances is not straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, many of Microsoft's corporate clients don't make one-time software purchases. They have long-term subscriptions called enterprise agreements that involve "software assurance," which means customers are entitled to the latest versions of systems or applications in the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, many companies have in effect already bought Windows 7, regardless of whether they install it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial effect of licensing the operating system to PC makers is also difficult to gauge. Microsoft closely guards what it charges, but it is no secret that prices have been under pressure as PC sales have waned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of cheap netbooks -- compact laptops chiefly for e-mail and web surfing -- means Microsoft will sell a growing proportion of the cheapest version of Windows 7 for PC makers to install.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for individual customers, Microsoft chief financial officer Christopher Liddell said last month that off-the-shelf sales of Vista contributed $200 million to $300 million to revenue in the months after launch, and he was expecting similar or greater for Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is tiny for a company that booked overall sales of $58 billion in the last fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLOUDY FINANCIALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results for the first quarter of Microsoft's current fiscal year are scheduled for next Friday, the day after the launch of Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street expects revenue to fall to $12.4 billion from $15 billion a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, while operating profit is also seen declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is partly due to more than $1 billion in revenue from sales of operating systems in the quarter being deferred, because Microsoft is guaranteeing a free upgrade to customers who recently bought Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, along with holiday sales, explains why analysts are expecting a surge in revenue to $17.1 billion for its fiscal second quarter, which ends in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this means that the financial effect of Windows 7 may not be clear for some time, said Michael Cherry, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, an independent consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If in six months we aren't seeing people willingly buying this system, then there's a problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gabriel Madway; Editing by Edwin Chan and Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story,"IBM boosts earnings estimate, but revenue drops," posted Thursday, incorrectly reported the company's full-year, earnings-per-share forecast. The correct number is $9.85. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12th paragraph has been corrected on the wire and now reads:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM now thinks it will do better for the full year than previously expected. It revised its full-year 2009 earnings guidance upward $0.15 per share to $9.85 per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
EuroGas, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: EUGS) (FRANKFURT: EUG) (XETRA: EUG) (HAMBURG:
EUG) (STUTTGART: EUG) today announced that it has entered into a loan and
option agreement with Mr. Walter Storm, Chairman of the Supervisory
Board, EurAsia Holding AG and Forstgarten International Holding GmbH, an
investment company owned by Dr. h.c. Stefan Kaltenbach, Vice Chairman,
EurAsia Holding AG (the investors). Mr. Storm and Dr. h.c. Kaltenbach
are, through their respective investment companies, the controlling
shareholders of EurAsia AG, an international privately held German
investment company concentrating on the natural resources sector.

    The investors, under the loan agreement, have forwarded EUR 680.000
(corresponding to approximately USD 1,000,000) to EuroGas. The loan is
repayable on October 1, 2010, and will carry an interest rate of 8%. These
funds will be used for working capital.

    The investors have been granted an option and a right of first refusal to
earn a 60% interest in all future EuroGas projects. Furthermore, the
parties intend to enter into a Master Financing Agreement, under which the
investors are to inject further funds into EuroGas or its operations
through a USD 7,000,000 convertible debenture. This agreement would enable
the investors to convert their debenture into restricted EuroGas common
stock at prices ranging from USD 0.25-USD 0.50 per share over the next 3
years (USD 0.25 per share in the first year; USD 0.35 in the second year;
and USD 0.50 in the third year). The investors and EuroGas have undertaken
to immediately commence the negotiation of the final terms of the
agreement, which is expected to be executed within the next few weeks.

    "I am delighted to welcome Walter Storm's and Dr. Kaltenbach's involvement
in EuroGas," said Wolfgang Rauball, Chairman, President and CEO, EuroGas.
"Walter has been a steadfast and loyal EuroGas shareholder for many years,
and has, along with Dr. Kaltenbach, the financial and management
capabilities to enable EuroGas to wrest the maximum shareholder value from
our rich asset portfolio."

    Mr. Walter Storm is a highly successful industrialist with international
resource and industrial holdings. He is also the founder and a major
indirect shareholder of EurAsia, which is the largest shareholder of
Osisko Mining Corp., a TSE-listed company with a current market valuation
in excess of CAD $2 billion. According to a June 2009 Study by UBS
Switzerland EurAsia owns 42 million shares of Osisko's common stock which
are currently valued at in excess of USD 330,000,000. Mr. Storm, through
EurAsia, was Osisko's major financial backer through its exploration and
development stages. The capital provided to Osisko by EurAsia enabled
Osisko's management team to build its market capitalization from USD 15
million to its current level of more than USD 2 billion in less than five
years. EurAsia's shareholders also own significant producing oil and gas
interests in Canada and Kazakhstan, as well as important global resource
sector related companies and assets. (http://eurasiaholding.com)

    Dr. h.c. Stefan Kaltenbach is the former CEO and shareholder of a leading
international manufacturer of medical equipment which has over 3,500
employees. Today, he is a private investor with extensive holdings in
international medical and resource industries, mainly through EurAsia.
Together with Walter Storm, he spearheaded the financing of Osisko in its
exploration and development stages.

&lt;p&gt;ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga.--(Business Wire)--
J. P. King Auction Company, the nation`s leading real estate auction company
specializing in high-value properties, is managing the real estate auction of an
oceanfront estate, ocean-view villas and beach-view lots on St. Simons Island.
The real estate auction will take place on-site, Saturday, October 24, at 2:00

"St. Simons Island provides the ultimate in coastal living," said Craig King,
president &amp; CEO of J. P. King Auction Company. "It is one of Georgia's renowned
Golden Isles and is well known as a resort community with top-tier golf courses,
tennis courts, shopping, art galleries and a variety of restaurants." 

St. Simons Island properties include the following:

* The crown jewel of St. Simons Island, the Idea House is an oceanfront estate
located in a gated community on the widest stretch of St. Simon`s beach. It
contains three bedrooms and three bathrooms that are situated on 80+/- feet of
beach frontage. The home was once designated as "Idea House" by Coastal Living.
The most spectacular home site in Georgia, its upper-level master suite is
designed with his-and-her baths and ocean views from the master suite. On the
main level of the Idea House, two guest suites surround a state-of-the art
kitchen and living area along with a wraparound deck that overlooks St. Simons
beach. Below the home, the property features a cabana with a spa. 
* Two ocean view Villas at Coast Cottages are selling absolute. The four-story
villas contain four bedrooms and 4.5 baths. The entry-level floor features a
dipping pool and parking garage while three bedrooms and three baths are on the

Each villa also features its own rooftop deck with expansive views of the
ocean.

located within the Villas at Coast Cottages development. They were originally
designed for two villas per lot or for a single family home. Additionally, two
prime ocean-view residential lots are located on Bruce Drive, which is the
prestigious East Beach area of St. Simons Island.

"We felt that the best way to market and sell these properties was through a
high-end quality auction house such as J. P. King Auction Company," said owner
Denval Hamby. "We are working on another project that is nearby and decided the
best way to move forward with these properties was by conducting an inventory
close-out sale."

&lt;p&gt;An add-on that Microsoft silently slipped into Mozilla's Firefox last February leaves that browser open to attack, Microsoft's security engineers acknowledged earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the 13 security bulletins Microsoft released Tuesday affects not only Internet Explorer (IE), but also Firefox, thanks to a Microsoft-made plug-in pushed to Firefox users eight months ago in an update delivered via Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the vulnerability is in an IE component, there is an attack vector for Firefox users as well," admitted Microsoft engineers in a post to the company's Security Research  Defense blog on Tuesday. "The reason is that .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 installs a 'Windows Presentation Foundation' plug-in in Firefox."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft engineers described the possible threat as a "browse-and-get-owned" situation that only requires attackers to lure Firefox users to a rigged Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous users and experts complained when Microsoft pushed the .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1) update to users last February, including Susan Bradley, a contributor to the popular Windows Secrets newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The .NET Framework Assistant [the name of the add-on slipped into Firefox] that results can be installed inside Firefox without your approval," Bradley noted in a Feb. 12 story. "Although it was first installed with Microsoft's Visual Studio development program, I've seen this .NET component added to Firefox as part of the .NET Family patch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was particularly galling to users was that once installed, the .NET add-on was virtually impossible to remove from Firefox. The usual "Disable" and "Uninstall" buttons in Firefox's add-on list were grayed out on all versions of Windows except Windows 7, leaving most users no alternative other than to root through the Windows registry, a potentially dangerous chore, since a misstep could cripple the PC. Several sites posted complicated directions on how to scrub the .NET add-on from Firefox, including Annoyances.org .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annoyances also said the threat to Firefox users is serious. "This update adds to Firefox one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities present in all versions of Internet Explorer: the ability for Web sites to easily and quietly install software on your PC," said the hints and tips site. "Since this design flaw is one of the reasons [why] you may have originally chosen to abandon IE in favor of a safer browser like Firefox, you may wish to remove this extension with all due haste."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the.NET plug-in switched on a Microsoft technology dubbed ClickOnce, which lets .NET apps automatically download and run inside other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reacted to criticism about the method it used to install the Firefox add-on by issuing another update in early May that made it possible to uninstall or disable the .NET Framework Assistant. It did not, however, apologize to Firefox users for slipping the add-on into their browsers without their explicit permission -- as is the case for other Firefox add-ons, or extensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, Microsoft did not revisit the origin of the .NET add-on, but simply told Firefox users that they should uninstall the component if they weren't able to deploy the patches provided in the MS09-054 update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, the vulnerability is "critical," and also can be exploited against users running any version of IE, including IE8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass das Unternehmen seine
Gesch&#228;ftsprozesse mit denen von Wyeth zusammengef&#252;hrt hat, nachdem die
Akquisition von Wyeth gestern ihren Abschluss fand. Wyeth ist damit offiziell
ein Unternehmen der Pfizer-Gruppe. Pfizer ist nun ein noch st&#228;rker
diversifiziertes Gesundheitsunternehmen: Mit Impfstoffen, synthetischen und
biologischen Wirkstoffen sowie Nahrungserg&#228;nzungsmitteln ist Pfizer k&#252;nftig in
den Bereichen Humanarzneimittel, Tiergesundheit und Consumer Healthcare auf den
M&#228;rkten der Industriel&#228;nder und in den aufstrebenden L&#228;ndern - den so genannten
Emerging Markets - vertreten. Das Unternehmen verf&#252;gt nun &#252;ber Arzneimittel auf
vielen wichtigen Therapiegebieten mit Wachstumspotenzial, &#252;ber eine robuste
Produktpipeline, &#252;ber Wissenschaftler und Produktionskapazit&#228;ten von Weltklasse
und zeigt weltweit starke Marktpr&#228;senz. 

Jeffrey B. Kindler, Chairman und CEO von Pfizer: &#8222;Unsere Mitarbeiter, die
Produktpipeline und das Potenzial des neuen, gest&#228;rkten Pfizer geh&#246;ren zu den
besten unserer Branche. Wir sind geradezu dazu verpflichtet, mit diesen St&#228;rken
bedeutende Ergebnisse zu erzielen - und zwar f&#252;r unsere Patienten, unsere
Kunden, f&#252;r die Standorte, an denen wir vertreten sind, und f&#252;r unsere
Anteilseigner. Unser Erfolg wird an unseren neuen Verpflich-tungen und an
unserem Engagement gemessen werden. Zu diesen Verpflichtungen geh&#246;rt es,
Lebensqualit&#228;t, Pr&#228;vention, Behandlung und Heilung von Krankheiten
voranzutreiben und so verschiedenste medizinische Bed&#252;rfnisse in aller Welt zu
befriedigen. Gleichzeitig optimieren wir unsere Gewinnentwicklung." 

Kindler f&#252;gt hinzu, dass sich die Unternehmensf&#252;hrung sehr freue, die
engagierten Mitarbeiter von Wyeth - unter denen sich viele erstklassige
Wissenschaftler und F&#252;hrungskr&#228;fte befinden - bei Pfizer willkommen hei&#223;en zu
d&#252;rfen. &#8222;Wir sind stolz darauf, dass unsere neuen und unsere alten Kollegen &#252;ber
das Know-how und die Erfahrung verf&#252;gen, die in allen Unternehmensbereichen von
essenzieller Bedeutung sind. Gleichzeitig teilen sie unsere Leidenschaft daf&#252;r,
Gesundheit und Lebensqualit&#228;t in jedem Lebensabschnitt zu verbessern", so
Kindler. 

Integration der Gesch&#228;ftsprozesse

Seit Ank&#252;ndigung der Akquisition im Januar haben Integrationsteams bei Pfizer
und Wyeth unerm&#252;dlich daran gearbeitet, dass das Tagesgesch&#228;ft nach Abschluss
der Transaktion in vollem Umfang weitergef&#252;hrt werden kann. Damit die
Zusammenf&#252;hrung beider Unternehmen reibungslos gelingt, will Pfizer auch die
Gesch&#228;ftsabl&#228;ufe strukturell verbessern. K&#252;nftig verfolgt Pfizer etwa im Bereich
Forschung und Entwicklung einen neuen Ansatz. Ausgew&#228;hlte F&#252;hrungskr&#228;fte wurden
bereits ernannt und &#252;ben mit Abschluss der Akquisition nun ihre jeweiligen
Funktionen aus. So kann Pfizer sofort von den Vorteilen profitieren, die der
Zusammenschluss mit Wyeth bietet. 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer bei Pfizer und Leiter der Integration,
sagt dazu: &#8222;Dass wir diese Transaktion in so kurzer Zeit abgeschlossen haben und
vom ersten Tag an voll einsatzf&#228;hig sind, ist das eindeutige Resultat des
Einsatzes, den die Integrationsteams beider Unternehmen gezeigt haben. Da
Kontinuit&#228;t des Tagegesch&#228;fts w&#228;hrend des gesamten Integrationsprozesses das
oberste Ziel war, k&#246;nnen unsere F&#252;hrungskr&#228;fte und Kollegen nun schnell auf
Pfizers solide finanzielle Basis, ein funktionierendes operatives Gesch&#228;ft und
ein breites Produktportfolio zur&#252;ckgreifen - und so unsere Leistung weiter
verbessern." 

Ein breites und diversifiziertes Produktportfolio

Pfizer verf&#252;gt jetzt weltweit &#252;ber ein breites und diversifiziertes
Produktportfolio und ist Marktf&#252;hrer auf nahezu allen wichtigen
Therapiegebieten. Das zusammengef&#252;hrte Unternehmen hat seine Kompetenzen in den
Bereichen Biopharmazeutika, Impfstoffe, Consumer Healthcare,
Nahrungserg&#228;nzungsmittel und Tierarzneimittel ausgebaut. Pfizer ist nun ideal
aufgestellt, um weiter zu wachsen und sowohl den bereinigten Jahresgewinn als
auch den bereinigten Gewinn je Aktie (adjusted diluted EPSi) kurz- und
langfristig zu steigern. Das Unternehmen rechnet damit, dass ab 2012 kein
einzelnes Medikament mehr als zehn Prozent zum Umsatz beitragen wird. 

Das zusammengef&#252;hrte Unternehmen verf&#252;gt &#252;ber eine robuste und weiter wachsende
biopharmazeutische Forschungspipeline mit vielversprechenden Substanzen zur
Behandlung von beispielsweise Alzheimer, Entz&#252;ndungskrankheiten, Schmerzen und
Krebs. Durch den Zusammenschluss hat Pfizer sein Innovationspotenzial weiter
ausgebaut: Das Unternehmen verf&#252;gt &#252;ber erstklassige Wissenschaftler, f&#252;hrende
Forschungseinrichtungen und Produktionsst&#228;tten sowie &#252;ber ein weltweites
Netzwerk an klinischen Entwicklungszentren. 

Eine flexible und auf die Patienten ausgerichtete globale Unternehmensstruktur

Pfizer verf&#252;gt &#252;ber ein einzigartiges und flexibles Gesch&#228;ftsmodell: In
einzelnen Gesch&#228;ftseinheiten f&#252;r Humanarzneimittel, Tiergesundheit, Consumer
Healthcare und Nahrungserg&#228;nzungsmittel lassen sich die Zielstrebigkeit und
Flexibilit&#228;t kleinerer Gesch&#228;ftseinheiten mit den M&#246;glichkeiten eines weltweit
agierenden Konzerns verbinden. Die neun weltweit agierenden Business Units von
Pfizer sind in zwei Gruppen organisiert: Biopharmaceutical Businesses und
Diversified Businesses. Dadurch k&#246;nnen die F&#252;hrungskr&#228;fte sowohl die
M&#246;glichkeiten als auch die Herausforderungen, die sich &#252;ber die
Gesch&#228;ftsbereiche hinweg ergeben beziehungsweise stellen, leichter erkennen und
die Unternehmenspriorit&#228;ten besser aufeinander abstimmen. Biopharmaceutical
Business ist unterteilt in die Gesch&#228;ftseinheiten Emerging Markets, Established
Products, Oncology, Primary Care und Specialty Care. Specialty Care umfasst
zudem die Impfstoffe. Zu den Diversified Businesses geh&#246;ren Animal Health,
Capsugel, Consumer Healthcare und Nutrition. 

Dar&#252;ber hinaus verf&#252;gt Pfizer &#252;ber zwei getrennte Forschungs- und
Entwicklungseinheiten. Dadurch werden die M&#246;glichkeiten optimiert, die sich dem
Unternehmen auf dem Gebiet der biopharmazeutischen Forschung bieten. Die
PharmaTherapeutics Research &amp; Development Group wird sich auf die Erforschung
von synthetischen Wirkstoffen (kleine Molek&#252;le) und die damit zusammen&#172;h&#228;ngenden
Aspekte konzentrieren, w&#228;hrend sich die BioTherapeutics Research &amp; Development
Group mit biologischen Wirkstoffen (gro&#223;en Molek&#252;len) - unter anderem mit
Impfstoffen - befasst. Die Forschungseinheiten werden von erstklassigen Chief
Scientific Officers geleitet. Diese sind direkt daf&#252;r verantwortlich, viel
versprechende Substanzen zu identifizieren und zu entwickeln und so die
Grundlage daf&#252;r zu schaffen, dass Arzneimittel-Kandidaten durch die Business
Units weiterentwickelt werden k&#246;nnen. 

Pfizer hat seine weltweite Pr&#228;senz deutlich gest&#228;rkt. Neben der starken Pr&#228;senz
in den USA, in Europa und in Asien zeigt das Unternehmen auch auf den Emerging
Markets in Afrika, China, Lateinamerika und im Nahen Osten eine verbesserte
Pr&#228;senz. 

Unternehmensf&#252;hrung

Als Erg&#228;nzung des Executive Leadership Teams hat Jeff Kindler das Executive
Compliance Committee ins Leben gerufen, dessen Vorsitz er &#252;bernehmen wird. Dem
Committee werden angeh&#246;ren: Doug Lankler, der als Chief Compliance Officer
direkt an Jeff Kindler berichtet; Hugh Donnelly als Chief Internal Auditor, der
sowohl dem Audit Committee des Board of Directors als auch Frank D`Amelio
Bericht erstattet; ferner Frank D`Amelio, Ian Read, Cavan Redmond und Amy
Schulman. 

&#8222;Pfizer wird deutlich von der Expertise und der weitreichenden gesch&#228;ftlichen
Erfahrung des Executive Leadership Teams profitieren", so Kindler. &#8222;Das
Executive Compliance Committee ist eine wichtige Erg&#228;nzung unserer
Compliance-Infrastruktur und soll gew&#228;hrleisten, dass unser Senior Leadership
unmittelbar an unseren fortw&#228;hrenden Bem&#252;hungen mitwirkt, das Gesch&#228;ftsgebaren
von Pfizer durch Compliance und Integrit&#228;t zu pr&#228;gen." 

Derzeit arbeitet Pfizer daran, Entscheidungen in Bezug auf Arbeitspl&#228;tze und
Standorte zu treffen und ist bestrebt, Entscheidungen schnell bekannt zu geben
und sozialvertr&#228;glich umzusetzen. Alle Entscheidungen zu Arbeitspl&#228;tzen und
Standorten sind abh&#228;ngig von Verhandlungen mit Arbeitnehmervertretungen und den
jeweiligen rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen. 

Finanzielle H&#246;hepunkte

Pfizer rechnet damit, dass sich die &#220;bernahme von Wyeth im zweiten vollen Jahr
nach Abschluss der Transaktion positiv auf den bereinigten Gewinn je Aktie
(adjusted diluted EPS1) auswirken wird. Es wird davon ausgegangen, dass die
Transaktion bis Ende 2012 Synergien in H&#246;he von sch&#228;tzungsweise vier Milliarden
US-Dollar bringen wird. Diese Synergieeffekte werden zus&#228;tzlich zu den
bereinigten j&#228;hrlichen Kosteneinsparungen in H&#246;he von sch&#228;tzungsweise zwei
Milliarden US-Dollar auftreten, die bis Ende 2011 unabh&#228;ngig von der
Wyeth-Akquisition im Vertrieb, in der Informationsverarbeitung, in der
Verwaltung, in Forschung und Entwicklung sowie in der Produktion erzielt werden
sollen. 

Pfizer: Gemeinsam f&#252;r eine ges&#252;ndere Welt

gef&#252;rchtetsten Erkrankungen unserer Zeit zu bek&#228;mpfen. Wir werden der
Verantwortung, die uns als weltweit f&#252;hrendem biopharmazeutischem Unternehmen

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--

ieri. Sia nei paesi industrializzati che in quelli emergenti, Pfizer offrir&#224; una
gamma di prodotti ancora pi&#249; diversificata: farmaci per uso umano e veterinario,
prodotti farmaceutici di largo consumo, vaccini, farmaci biologici, quelli
basati sulle molecole di piccole dimensioni e prodotti nutrizionali. La nuova
azienda mette a disposizione farmaci in numerose aree terapeutiche, pu&#242; vantare
una robusta pipeline e centri di ricerca e produzione di altissimo valore a
livello internazionale. 

"La nuova Pfizer &#232; oggi pi&#249; forte e potr&#224; avvalersi di personale, risorse,
pipeline e impianti produttivi tra i pi&#249; qualificati del settore", ha dichiarato
Jeffrey B. Kindler, Presidente e Amministratore delegato di Pfizer. "Abbiamo la
responsabilit&#224; di trasformare questi punti di forza in risultati apprezzabili
non solo per i nostri azionisti, ma anche per i pazienti, i clienti e le
comunit&#224; nelle quali operiamo. Misureremo il nostro successo sulla capacit&#224;
della nostra azienda di tenere fede ai suoi nuovi impegni, tra cui la promozione
del benessere, della prevenzione, delle terapie e delle cure, per soddisfare i
bisogni di salute a livello globale, ottimizzando nello stesso tempo la nostra
performance finanziaria. 

"Siamo lieti di dare il benvenuto ai nuovi colleghi provenienti da Wyeth, tra i
quali numerosi ricercatori e leader di grande valore", ha aggiunto il Presidente
Kindler. "Siamo orgogliosi che i nostri colleghi vecchi e nuovi abbiano le
competenze e l`esperienza indispensabili per portare avanti il nostro lavoro e
condividano il nostro impegno per migliorare la salute e il benessere in ogni
fase della vita." 

Avvio del processo di integrazione

Dopo l`annuncio dell`accordo di acquisizione diffuso lo scorso gennaio, i gruppi
di lavoro incaricati di realizzare l`integrazione tra Pfizer e Wyeth si sono
impegnati per assicurare l`immediata operativit&#224; della nuova azienda subito dopo
il perfezionamento della fusione. A questo scopo, Pfizer aveva precedentemente
annunciato la riorganizzazione delle attivit&#224; di ricerca e sviluppo, il
potenziamento della rete commerciale e la nomina di alcuni leader nelle
posizioni che sarebbero divenute operative con la conclusione dell`acquisizione.
Grazie a questo approccio Pfizer potr&#224; beneficiare immediatamente dei vantaggi
derivanti dall`integrazione con Wyeth. 

"La nostra capacit&#224; di portare a termine l`operazione con tanta rapidit&#224; e di
essere operativi gi&#224; a partire dal Day One &#232; la prova dell`impegno dei gruppi di
lavoro incaricati dalle due aziende di realizzare l`integrazione", ha dichiarato
il Chief Financial Officer di Pfizer Frank D`Amelio che guida l`integrazione.
"La continuit&#224; delle attivit&#224; aziendali &#232; stata la nostra priorit&#224; durante
l`intero processo di integrazione e fin da ora i nostri manager e colleghi
possono contare sulla solidit&#224; finanziaria, sull`efficienza operativa e
sull`ampia gamma di prodotti per continuare a migliorare la nostra performance."


Potenziamento e diversificazione del portafoglio

Ora Pfizer possiede un portafoglio ampio e diversificato di prodotti ed &#232; leader
di mercato in quasi tutte le pi&#249; importanti aree terapeutiche. La nuova azienda
nata dalla fusione ha rafforzato la capacit&#224; produttiva nei settori delle
biotecnologie, dei vaccini, dei farmaci di largo consumo, dei prodotti
nutrizionali e di quelli veterinari. Pfizer &#232; oggi nelle migliori condizioni per
ottenere un considerevole e stabile incremento dei ricavi e dell`utile per
azionei rettificato diluito, sia a breve che a lungo termine. Si prevede che nel
2012 nessun singolo farmaco produrr&#224; pi&#249; del dieci per cento dei ricavi della
nuova azienda nata dalla fusione. 

La nuova azienda ha a disposizione una ricca pipeline in campo biofarmaceutico,
in aree terapeutiche di grande importanza come il morbo di Alzheimer, le
neuroscienze, l`oncologia, il dolore, il diabete e le malattie infiammatorie. La
capacit&#224; d`innovazione della nostra azienda &#232; stata notevolmente potenziata
dalla collaborazione tra i migliori ricercatori delle due societ&#224;, dalla
disponibilit&#224; di capacit&#224; scientifiche e produttive di primo piano e dalla
nostra rete internazionale di centri che eseguono gli studi di fattibilit&#224; dei
progetti di sperimentazione clinica. 

Una struttura operativa internazionale flessibile e attenta alle esigenze del
paziente

Da ora in poi Pfizer operer&#224; attraverso Business Unit pi&#249; che mai attente alle
esigenze dei pazienti, coadiuvate da divisioni specializzate nella veterinaria,
nei farmaci di largo consumo e nei prodotti nutrizionali, che per rapidit&#224;
d`intervento e flessibilit&#224; non temono il confronto con le piccole aziende
specialistiche, potendo inoltre avvalersi delle risorse e delle dimensioni
tipiche di una societ&#224; internazionale. Le divisioni sono strutturate in due
gruppi al fine di consentire ai leader non solo di individuare le nuove
opportunit&#224; e di far fronte alle sfide che si presentano nelle Business Unit, ma
anche di definire con maggiore precisione le priorit&#224; dell`azienda. Le
Biopharmeceuticals Business units sono: Emerging Markets, Established Products,
Oncology, Primary Care e Specialty Care comprendente anche i vaccini. I
Diversified Businesses sono: Animal Health, Capsugel, Consumer HealthCare e
Nutrition. 

Pfizer dispone ora di due distinte divisioni di ricerca e sviluppo, che ci
consentono di cogliere nel modo migliore le nuove opportunit&#224; offerte dalla
ricerca biofarmaceutica: PharmaTherapeutics Research &amp; Development si dedicher&#224;
allo studio delle molecole di piccole dimensioni, mentre BioTherapeutics
Research &amp; Development si occuper&#224; delle ricerche sulle molecole di grandi
dimensioni, compresi i vaccini. Le singole unit&#224; appartenenti alle due divisioni
di ricerca sono guidate da Chief Scientific Officers di alto livello. who act as
single points of accountability for delivering positive proofs-of-concept for
Pfizer`s businesses to develop.

Cina e il Medio oriente.

1 Per "reddito rettificato" e "utile rettificato diluito per azione" si
intendono il reddito netto dichiarato di Pfizer Inc. e l`utile dichiarato
diluito per azione spettante agli azionisti ordinari di Pfizer Inc., escluse le
rettifiche contabili degli acquisti, i costi attinenti ad acquisizioni, le
operazioni cessate e alcune altre voci significative. Come illustrato nel
capitolo Adjusted Income (Reddito rettificato) della sezione intitolata
"Disamina e analisi della Direzione in materia di situazione finanziaria e
risultati di gestione" del Modulo 10-K compilato da Pfizer relativamente
all`esercizio finanziario chiuso al 31 dicembre 2008, per stabilire gli
obiettivi di performance dell`azienda e per misurarne i risultati complessivi la
direzione si basa sul reddito rettificato e su altri fattori. A nostro avviso la
pubblicazione dei risultati complessivi consentir&#224; agli azionisti di comprendere
meglio la performance dell`azienda. Il reddito rettificato e l`utile rettificato
diluito per azione non sono, e non devono essere considerati, elementi
sostitutivi dei criteri di misurazione del reddito netto e dell`utile per azione
diluito previsti dai GAAP (Principi contabili generalmente accettati)
statunitensi.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
A la suite de l`acquisition d&#233;finitive de Wyeth hier, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) a
annonc&#233; aujourd`hui avoir d&#233;j&#224; commenc&#233; &#224; op&#233;rer conjointement avec cette
soci&#233;t&#233;. Pfizer est d&#233;sormais une entreprise de sant&#233; plus diversifi&#233;e, mettant
&#224; disposition des produits de sant&#233; &#233;thique, de sant&#233; familiale, de sant&#233;
animale, y compris des vaccins, des produits de biotechnologie et des
m&#233;dicaments issus de la chimie ainsi que de la nutrition sur l`ensemble des
march&#233;s d&#233;velopp&#233;s et &#233;mergents. L`entreprise offre non seulement des
m&#233;dicaments dans de nombreux domaines th&#233;rapeutiques en croissance, mais aussi
un portefeuille de recherche particuli&#232;rement riche. Elle b&#233;n&#233;ficie
d`installations scientifiques et industrielles d`excellence et d`une pr&#233;sence
mondiale de premier plan. 

"Gr&#226;ce &#224; cette fusion, le nouveau Pfizer aura les meilleurs talents de
l`industrie et disposera d`un des tout premiers portefeuilles d`actifs et de
projets de recherche du secteur" a d&#233;clar&#233; Jeffrey B. Kindler,
pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de Pfizer. "Nous avons le devoir de transformer ces
atouts en r&#233;sultats tangibles pour les patients, les professionnels de sant&#233;,
les communaut&#233;s dans lesquelles nous op&#233;rons ainsi que pour nos actionnaires.
Nous mesurerons notre succ&#232;s au respect des nouveaux engagements de
l`entreprise, notamment am&#233;liorer le bien-&#234;tre, la pr&#233;vention, les traitements
et les soins pour r&#233;pondre aux diff&#233;rents besoins de sant&#233; dans le monde, tout
en maximisant nos performances financi&#232;res ". 

"Avec Wyeth, nous sommes heureux d`accueillir de nouveaux coll&#232;gues de talent au
sein de Pfizer, notamment de nombreux scientifiques et dirigeants de tr&#232;s grande
qualit&#233;" a ajout&#233; M. Kindler. "Nous sommes fiers de voir qu`ensemble nous avons
toutes les comp&#233;tences et l`exp&#233;rience essentielle pour tous les aspects de
notre activit&#233; et que nous partageons notre passion pour l`am&#233;lioration de la
sant&#233; et du bien-&#234;tre &#224; chaque &#233;tape de la vie." 

Int&#233;gration op&#233;rationnelle et niveau de pr&#233;paration

Depuis l`annonce de l`acquisition en janvier, les &#233;quipes charg&#233;es du processus
d`int&#233;gration au sein de Pfizer et de Wyeth ont travaill&#233; assid&#251;ment pour
s`assurer que la nouvelle soci&#233;t&#233; serait enti&#232;rement op&#233;rationnelle d&#232;s la
finalisation de la transaction. Dans ce cadre, Pfizer a d&#233;j&#224; annonc&#233; une
nouvelle approche en mati&#232;re de recherche et de d&#233;veloppement et a revu sa
structure commerciale. Pfizer a par ailleurs pr&#233;s&#233;lectionn&#233; des responsables de
haut niveau pour occuper des postes strat&#233;giques d&#232;s la finalisation de
l`acquisition. Gr&#226;ce &#224; cette pr&#233;paration, Pfizer pourra tirer imm&#233;diatement
parti des avantages offerts par l`acquisition de Wyeth. 

"Notre capacit&#233; &#224; finaliser cette transaction si rapidement et &#224; &#234;tre
op&#233;rationnels d&#232;s le "premier jour" t&#233;moigne du d&#233;vouement des &#233;quipes charg&#233;es
du processus d`int&#233;gration au sein des deux soci&#233;t&#233;s," a d&#233;clar&#233; Frank D`Amelio,
directeur financier de Pfizer, qui dirige le processus d`int&#233;gration. "Parce
qu`assurer la continuit&#233; de notre activit&#233; a constitu&#233; notre principal objectif
tout au long du processus d`int&#233;gration, nos responsables et nos coll&#232;gues sont
en mesure de tirer rapidement parti des atouts de Pfizer en terme de solidit&#233;
financi&#232;re, de rigueur op&#233;rationnelle et de gamme de produits pour continuer &#224;
am&#233;liorer nos performances." 

Un portefeuille renforc&#233; et diversifi&#233;

Pfizer dispose maintenant d`un portefeuille de produits large et diversifi&#233; au
niveau mondial, avec une position dominante dans presque tous les domaines
th&#233;rapeutiques cl&#233;s &#224; croissance rapide. La nouvelle soci&#233;t&#233; a renforc&#233; ses
capacit&#233;s dans le domaine de la biotechnologie, des vaccins, de la sant&#233;
familiale, de la nutrition et de la sant&#233; animale. Pfizer est bien positionn&#233;e
pour b&#233;n&#233;ficier d`une croissance stable et r&#233;guli&#232;re non seulement du chiffre
d`affaires mais aussi du b&#233;n&#233;fice dilu&#233; par action ajust&#233; sur le court terme et
le long terme. Il a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;vu qu`aucun m&#233;dicament ne repr&#233;sentera plus de 10%
des revenus de la nouvelle soci&#233;t&#233; en 2012. 

La nouvelle soci&#233;t&#233; dispose d`un portefeuille de projets de d&#233;veloppement
biopharmaceutique solide et en croissance afin d`aider les patients dans des
domaines critiques, notamment dans la maladie d`Alzheimer, l`oncologie, la
douleur, les neurosciences, le diab&#232;te et l`inflammation. L`association de
scientifiques de haut niveau issus des deux soci&#233;t&#233;s, la r&#233;union des
savoir-faire techniques et de production de classe mondiale ainsi que
l`existence d`un r&#233;seau global de centres de d&#233;veloppement clinique renforce
consid&#233;rablement la capacit&#233; d`innovation de Pfizer. 

Une structure op&#233;rationnelle mondiale flexible et orient&#233;e vers le patient

Pfizer op&#232;rera d&#233;sormais par l`interm&#233;diaire de ses divisions op&#233;rationnelles
orient&#233;es vers le patient tant dans le domaine des produits de sant&#233; &#233;thique ou
de la sant&#233; familiale qu`en sant&#233; animale et en nutrition. Cette organisation
permet d`associer la rapidit&#233;, la souplesse et l`esprit entrepreneurial des
petites entreprises aux atouts de taille et de ressource d`une organisation
mondiale. Ces divisions sont organis&#233;es en deux groupes pour permettre &#224; leurs
responsables d`identifier les opportunit&#233;s et de faire face aux d&#233;fis qui
existent dans l`ensemble des divisions op&#233;rationnelles, tout en s`inscrivant
dans les priorit&#233;s de l`entreprise. Les divisions du groupe Biopharmaceutiques
rassemblent March&#233;s Emergents, Produits Etablis, Oncologie, Soins Primaires et
Soins Sp&#233;cialis&#233;s, y compris les vaccins. Les divisions du groupe Activit&#233;s
Diversifi&#233;s incluent Sant&#233; Animale, Capsugel, Sant&#233; Familiale et Nutrition. 

Pfizer s`appuie aussi d&#233;sormais sur deux organisations de recherche et de
d&#233;veloppement distinctes afin de maximiser les nouvelles opportunit&#233;s dans le
domaine de la recherche biopharmaceutique. Le groupe PharmaTherapeutics Research
&amp; Development se concentre sur la d&#233;couverte de petites mol&#233;cules et des
technologies qui s`y rapportent. Le groupe BioTherapeutics Research &amp;
Development se concentre sur la recherche des bio-mol&#233;cules, y compris les
vaccins. Les divisions au sein de ces deux organisations de recherche sont
dirig&#233;es par des directeurs scientifiques de r&#233;putation mondiale qui ont la
responsabilit&#233; exclusive de fournir toutes les preuves de l`int&#233;r&#234;t du concept
qu`il appartiendra ensuite aux entit&#233;s commerciales de d&#233;velopper. 

Pfizer dispose aussi d&#233;sormais d`une pr&#233;sence mondiale fortement renforc&#233;e aux
Etats-Unis, en Europe, en Asie et en Am&#233;rique latine et renforce sa capacit&#233; &#224;
aider les patients sur les principaux march&#233;s &#233;mergents tels que la Chine et le
Moyen-Orient.

Donn&#233;es financi&#232;res essentielles

L`acquisition de Wyeth devrait &#234;tre relutive au b&#233;n&#233;fice dilu&#233; par action
ajust&#233;1 au cours de la deuxi&#232;me ann&#233;e compl&#232;te suivant la cl&#244;ture de la
transaction. La transaction devrait produire des synergies d`environ 4 milliards
de $ d`ici la fin 2012. Ces synergies, qui viendront s`ajouter aux &#233;conomies
annuelles nettes d`environ 2 milliards de $ que nous pr&#233;voyons de r&#233;aliser d`ici
&#224; la fin 2011, en dehors de l`acquisition de Wyeth, sont attendues dans le
domaine de la vente, des activit&#233;s administratives et d`informatique, de la R
et de la fabrication.

personnes et les animaux. Son portefeuille mondial diversifi&#233; de produits de
sant&#233; comprend des m&#233;dicaments biopharmaceutiques, des m&#233;dicaments &#224; base de
petites mol&#233;cules et des vaccins pour l`homme et les animaux, ainsi que des
produits nutritionnels et un grand nombre des produits de consommation parmi les
plus connus au monde. Chaque jour, les coll&#232;gues de Pfizer travaillent sur

Added Capabilities, Assets and Talent Advance Pfizer`s Mission to Apply Science
and Global Resources to Improve Health and Well Being at Every Stage of Life

---

Establishes and Expands Leadership in Human, Animal and Consumer Health

---

Strengthens Platform for Consistent and Stable Top-Line Earnings Growth


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today announced that it has combined operations with
Wyeth following the closing of the acquisition yesterday. Pfizer is now a more
diversified health care company, with product offerings in human, animal, and
consumer health, including vaccines, biologics, small molecules and nutrition
across the developed and emerging markets. It has medicines in numerous growing
therapeutic areas, a robust pipeline, premier scientific and manufacturing
capabilities and a leading global presence. 

"Pfizer`s newly strengthened company will have some of the best assets, people,
pipeline and capabilities in the industry," said Jeffrey B. Kindler, chairman
and chief executive officer of Pfizer. "We have a clear responsibility to turn
those strengths into meaningful results for patients, customers and the
communities we serve, as well as for our shareholders. We will measure our
success through our company`s new commitments, which include advancing wellness,
prevention, treatments and cures that serve the world`s diverse health needs,
while maximizing our financial performance. 

"We are pleased to welcome our talented new colleagues from Wyeth to Pfizer,
including many first-class scientists and business leaders," Mr. Kindler added.
"We are proud that our new and existing colleagues possess all of the highly
valuable skills and experience essential to every aspect of our business, and
share our passion for improving health and well-being at every stage of life." 

Operational Integration and Readiness

Since the acquisition agreement was announced in January, integration teams at
Pfizer and Wyeth have worked diligently to ensure that the combined company is
fully operational immediately upon the closing of the transaction. To further
advance these objectives, Pfizer previously announced a new approach to research
and development and an enhanced commercial operating structure, and named select
leaders to posts that became effective upon closing of the acquisition. As a
result of these actions, Pfizer will begin to capitalize on the benefits offered
by the combination with Wyeth starting immediately. 

"Our ability to close this transaction in such a timely manner and be
operational on `Day One` is a true testament to the dedication of the
integration teams at both companies," said Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank
D`Amelio, who is leading the integration. "Because business continuity was our
primary objective throughout the integration process, our leaders and colleagues
are in a position to quickly build on Pfizer`s solid financial foundation,
operational discipline and diverse product base to continue to improve our
performance." 

Strengthened and Diversified Portfolio

Pfizer now has a broad and diversified global product portfolio, with leadership
in virtually all key high-growth therapeutic areas. The combined company has
strengthened capabilities in biotechnology, vaccines, consumer healthcare,
nutrition and animal health. Pfizer is well positioned for consistent and stable
top-line and adjusted diluted EPSi growth over the short and long term. It is
expected that no drug will account for more than 10 percent of the combined
company`s revenue in 2012. 

The combined company has a robust and growing pipeline of biopharmaceutical
development projects to help patients in critical areas, including Alzheimer`s
disease, oncology, pain, neuroscience, diabetes and inflammation. The
combination of top scientists from both companies, as well as leading scientific
and manufacturing capabilities, and a global network of proof-of-concept
clinical development centers, has greatly enhanced the company`s ability to
innovate. 

Flexible, Patient-Centric Global Operating Structure

Pfizer will now operate through its patient-centric business units in human
health as well as through its animal health, consumer and nutrition businesses
that match the speed and agility of small, focused enterprises with the benefits
of a global organization`s scale and resources. These businesses are organized
into two groups to allow their leadership to identify opportunities and address
challenges that exist across the business units and better align corporate
priorities. The Biopharmaceuticals Business units are Emerging Markets,
Established Products, Oncology, Primary Care and Specialty Care, which includes
vaccines. The Diversified Businesses are Animal Health, Capsugel, Consumer
Healthcare and Nutrition. 

Pfizer also now has two distinct research and development organizations to
maximize new opportunities in biopharmaceutical research. The PharmaTherapeutics
Research &amp; Development group focuses on the discovery of small molecules and
related modalities, and the BioTherapeutics Research &amp; Development group focuses
on large-molecule research, including vaccines. The individual units within
these two research organizations are led by world-class Chief Scientific
Officers, who act as single points of accountability for delivering positive
proofs-of-concept for Pfizer`s businesses to develop. 

Pfizer also now has a significantly strengthened global footprint in the United
States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, and has an enhanced ability to help
patients in key emerging markets such as China and the Middle East. 

Leadership

Pfizer`s Executive Leadership Team, which represents a combination of Pfizer and
Wyeth leaders, includes:

* Jeffrey B. Kindler - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer 
* Frank D`Amelio - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Business
Operations 
* Mikael Dolsten - President, BioTherapeutics Research &amp; Development 
* Freda Lewis-Hall - Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer 
* Martin Mackay - President, PharmaTherapeutics Research &amp; Development 
* Mary McLeod - Senior Vice President, Human Resources 
* Ian Read - Group President, Worldwide Biopharmaceutical Businesses 
* Cavan Redmond - Group President, Diversified Businesses 
* Nat Ricciardi - President, Manufacturing 
* Bill Ringo - Senior Vice President, Business Development, Strategy &amp;
Innovation 
* Amy Schulman - Senior Vice President, General Counsel 
* Sally Susman - Senior Vice President, Chief Communications Officer

In addition to the Executive Leadership Team, Jeff Kindler has established the
Executive Compliance Committee, which he will chair. It will include Doug
Lankler, who as Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to Mr. Kindler, and
Chief Internal Auditor Hugh Donnelly, who reports both to the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors and to Frank D`Amelio. Also on the Executive Compliance
Committee will be Frank D`Amelio, Ian Read, Cavan Redmond and Amy Schulman. 

"Pfizer will benefit greatly from the expertise of the Executive Leadership
Team, and the diversity of experience it represents," Mr. Kindler said. "Our
creation of the Executive Compliance Committee will serve as an important
addition to our compliance infrastructure, and ensure the dedicated involvement
of our senior-most leaders in our continuing efforts to fully integrate
compliance and integrity into all that we do at Pfizer." 

Pfizer is now in the process of finalizing the decisions related to talent and
site matters and will work quickly to effectively implement those decisions.
Talent and site decisions are subject to works council and/or union
consultations and other legal requirements, as applicable. 

Financial Highlights

The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Pfizer`s adjusted diluted
earnings per share1 in the second full year after closing. The transaction is
anticipated to yield synergies of approximately $4 billion by the end of 2012.
These synergies, which are in addition to the approximately $2 billion in net
annual cost savings that we plan to achieve by the end of 2011 apart from the
Wyeth acquisition, are expected in selling, informational and administrative
functions, research and development, and manufacturing. 

Pfizer Inc: Working together for a healthier world

At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to improve health and
well-being at every stage of life. We strive to set the standard for quality,
safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacturing of medicines
for people and animals. Our diversified global health care portfolio includes
human and animal biologic and small molecule medicines and vaccines, as well as
nutritional products and many of the world`s best-known consumer products. Every
day, Pfizer colleagues work across developed and emerging markets to advance
wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared
diseases of our time. Consistent with our responsibility as the world`s leading
biopharmaceutical company, we also collaborate with health care providers,
governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable,
affordable health care around the world. For more than 150 years, Pfizer has
worked to make a difference for all who rely on us. To learn more about our
commitments, please visit us at www.pfizer.com

Wyeth is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. The merger of local Wyeth
and Pfizer entities may be pending in various jurisdictions and integration is
subject to completion of various local legal and regulatory obligations.

outside the U.S. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign
countries, direct-to-consumer advertising and interactions with healthcare
professionals, and the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could
be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on the cost differences and
minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and
restricts access to innovative medicines; the impact of the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003; legislation or
regulatory action in markets outside the U.S. affecting pharmaceutical product
pricing, reimbursement or access; contingencies related to actual or alleged

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Oct 16 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola (KO.N) said on Friday
that it has opened a 600 million yuan ($88 million) bottling
plant in China, its largest single investment in still beverage
production in the country, to meet growing demand from Chinese
consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's biggest soft drinks maker said in a statement
that still beverages accounted for 30 percent of Coca-Cola
China's business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plant, based in the central industrial city of Wuhan, is
Coca-Cola's 39th in China and the third it has opened this year
in China, the world's second-largest beverage producer in the
world after the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola has committed to investing $2 billion in China over
the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are dedicated to providing Chinese consumers with a
diversified portfolio of high-quality drinks and we will continue
to invest in the full spectrum of the beverage business", said
Doug Jackson, president of Coca-Cola China, in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Cola-Cola launched a Minute Maid "Pulpy
Milky" fruit dairy product in China, its first dairy beverage
offering in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In June, the company said it would establish a still-beverage
production base in Sanshui, Guangdong. The facility is scheduled
to start operating in 2010. With the completion of the Sanshui
operation, Coca-Cola's total investment in China's still-beverage
market would reach 2.8 billion yuan, according to the company.

and manufacturing capabilities, and a global network of proof-of-concept
clinical development centers, has greatly enhanced the company`s ability to
innovate. 

Flexible, Patient-Centric Global Operating Structure

Pfizer will now operate through its patient-centric business units in human
health as well as through its animal health, consumer and nutrition businesses
that match the speed and agility of small, focused enterprises with the benefits
of a global organization`s scale and resources. These businesses are organized
into two groups to allow their leadership to identify opportunities and address
challenges that exist across the business units and better align corporate
priorities. The Biopharmaceuticals Business units are Emerging Markets,
Established Products, Oncology, Primary Care and Specialty Care, which includes
vaccines. The Diversified Businesses are Animal Health, Capsugel, Consumer
Healthcare and Nutrition. 

Pfizer also now has two distinct research and development organizations to
maximize new opportunities in biopharmaceutical research. The PharmaTherapeutics
Research &amp; Development group focuses on the discovery of small molecules and
related modalities, and the BioTherapeutics Research &amp; Development group focuses
on large-molecule research, including vaccines. The individual units within
these two research organizations are led by world-class Chief Scientific
Officers, who act as single points of accountability for delivering positive
proofs-of-concept for Pfizer`s businesses to develop. 

Pfizer also now has a significantly strengthened global footprint in the United
States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, and has an enhanced ability to help
patients in key emerging markets such as China and the Middle East.

Financial Highlights

The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Pfizer`s adjusted diluted
earnings per share1 in the second full year after closing. The transaction is
anticipated to yield synergies of approximately $4 billion by the end of 2012.
These synergies, which are in addition to the approximately $2 billion in net
annual cost savings that we plan to achieve by the end of 2011 apart from the
Wyeth acquisition, are expected in selling, informational and administrative
functions, research and development, and manufacturing.

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla developers have blocked a Firefox plugin that was quietly pushed out by Microsoft, saying that it presents a security risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shipped the Firefox add-on as part of a .Net software update last February, causing outrage among some Firefox users, who complained that the software was sneaked onto their systems without their knowledge or approval and was extremely difficult to remove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft warned that Firefox users who have not applied a recent Internet Explorer patch were vulnerable to a "browse-and-get-owned attack" because of a bug in the Microsoft .Net Framework Assistant add-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All that is needed is for a user to be lured to a malicious website," Microsoft said. Triggering this vulnerability involves the use of a malicious XBAP (XAML Browser Application).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flaw is a nasty one, but users who have installed the MS09-054 IE update, released Tuesday are protected from this attack, "regardless of the attack vector," Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect users who may not have installed Microsoft's patch, Mozilla is automatically blocking two add-ons: the Microsoft .Net Framework Assistant and a related plugin called the Windows Presentation Foundation. The open-source browser started blocking the software late Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of the difficulties some users have had entirely removing the add-on, and because of the severity of the risk it represents if not disabled, we contacted Microsoft today to indicate that we were looking to disable the extension and plugin for all users via our blocklisting mechanism," wrote Mozilla Vice President of Engineering Mike Shaver in a blog posting. "Microsoft agreed with the plan, and we put the blocklist entry live immediately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buggy plugins are a growing problem, as cyber criminals have increasingly leveraged flaws in products such as Adobe Flash Player and QuickTime to launch browser-based attacks. Earlier this week, Mozilla launched a Plugin Check site where Firefox users can see if their plugins are up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Oral JAK inhibitor meets primary goals at several doses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Tops placebo in ACR20 rate and remission rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * In combo with methotrexate, tops methotrexate alone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - An experimental rheumatoid
arthritis drug being developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) was
effective as a stand-alone and in combination with a standard
treatment for the disease, according to final analysis of data
from a pair of mid-stage studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug, CP-690,550, belongs to a new class of medicines
known as oral JAK inhibitors being tested for their impact on
enzymes that affect signaling of proteins involved in
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers tested several doses of the Pfizer drug in
24-week, Phase II studies, with some proving highly effective
in providing relief from rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and near
remission of disease activity, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think this is going to be a very significant, dramatic
addition to the armamentarium," Dr. Roy Fleischmann, clinical
professor of medicine at University of Texas Southwest Medical
Center in Dallas and lead investigator in the monotherapy
study, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The JAK inhibitor is considered to be one of the most
promising drugs in Pfizer's developmental pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People should be extremely excited about it. It's an oral
drug, not injectable, so it's easy to take, and it should be
cheaper than the biologics," said Fleischmann, who will present
data next week at an American College of Rheumatology
scientific meeting in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current widely used treatments for rheumatoid arthritis
include expensive biotech medicines such as Humira from  
Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and Amgen Inc's (AMGN.O) Enbrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the monotherapy study of 384 patients with active
rheumatoid arthritis who had not responded to other
anti-rheumatic drugs, those who received the 5 milligram, 10 mg
or 15 mg doses of the Pfizer drug twice daily had significantly
better response rates at 24 weeks than those who received a
placebo. The 1 mg and 3 mg doses did not achieve statistical
significance compared with the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, patients taking the three higher doses had
statistically significant DAS 28 remission rates, meaning the
disease was no longer active or reduced to near remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The primary goal was the ACR20 response rate, or at least a
20 percent reduction in disease activity and symptoms, such as
tender and swollen joints and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 15 mg, 66.7 percent of patients achieved ACR20, while
65.6 percent hit the mark at 10 mg and 51 percent on the 5 mg
dose. That compared with 25.4 percent who received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DAS28 remission rate was 21.1 percent at 15 mg, 21.3
percent at 10 mg, 14.6 percent at 5 mg and 13.7 percent at 3mg
-- all statistically significant compared with a mere 1.8
percent remission rate in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The monotherapy study clearly shows that CP-690,550 is
effective certainly versus a placebo, and in the combination
study, it's effective as well," said Fleischmann. "It appears
that no matter how you use it, it's effective," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second 24-week study involving 507 patients with active
rheumatoid arthritis tested the same five doses of CP-690,550
twice daily and a 20 mg dose once daily in combination with the
commonly used rheumatoid arthritis treatment methotrexate
versus methotrexate alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients in the 3 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg plus groups
all had statistically significantly higher ACR20 rates than
those on methotrexate alone. The 15 mg patients had the highest
ACR20 rate at 58.7 percent compared with 34.8 percent in the
methotrexate alone group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 5 mg group missed statistical significance with 47.9
percent achieving ACR20, though Fleischmann said it was a very
near miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has moved the 5 mg and 10 mg doses into larger Phase
III studies it hopes will confirm the Phase II results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the 15 mg dose was highly effective, there were more
serious adverse events with the higher dose, Fleischmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Pfizer drug does tend to raise the levels of bad LDL
cholesterol, but Fleischmann said that is easily managed with
statin drugs, such as Pfizer's Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fleischmann said he hopes Pfizer will conduct direct
comparison trials between the JAK inhibitor and a widely used
biotech medicine, such as Humira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If it's equivalent it's a home run, if it's better it's a
grand slam," he said.

Final Phase 2 Analyses Presented at the American College of Rheumatology/
Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ACR/ARHP) Annual Scientific
Meeting
PHILADELPHIA--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today that 24-week data from two clinical studies of the
oral JAK inhibitor, CP-690,550, confirmed statistically significant ACR20
response and DAS28 remission rates for several doses versus placebo when given
alone or in combination with methotrexate for patients with active rheumatoid
arthritis (RA). The findings, which were presented this week at the 2009
ACR/ARHP Annual Scientific Meeting in Philadelphia, represent the final analyses
from two Phase 2 trials evaluating the effect of CP-690,550 over 24 weeks. 

"These data suggest that CP-690,550 could represent a promising advance for
patients with rheumatoid arthritis," said Michael Berelowitz, MD, senior vice
president Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer Specialty Care.
"Our Phase 3 program is currently underway with enrollment progressing as
planned, and we are hopeful that data from these trials will validate the Phase
2 results." 

Efficacy as Monotherapy at 24 weeks

Data presented from a six-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2B study
(Study A3921035), which evaluated 384 patients with active RA who had not
responded to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), showed that
patients treated with 5, 10 and 15 mg twice-daily doses of CP-690,550 dosed
without background methotrexate experienced statistically significant ACR
response rates and DAS28 remission rates at week 24 as compared to placebo.
These results were consistent with the previously reported primary analysis of
ACR response at week 12.

 24-Week efficacy results are as follows:

All patients were randomized to either placebo or one of the studied doses of
CP-690,550. This study also included adalimumab (40 mg subcutaneously every
other week) as an active control in the first 12 weeks of the study. 

Efficacy in Combination with Methotrexate at 24 weeks

Data from a second six-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study
(Study A3921025) evaluating 507 patients whose RA was active despite ongoing
treatment with methotrexate demonstrated that patients treated with 3, 10 and 15
mg twice-daily and 20 mg once-daily doses of CP-690,550 in addition to stable
background methotrexate experienced statistically significant ACR response rates
and DAS28 remission rates at week 24 as compared to placebo. These results were
consistent with previously reported primary analysis of ACR response at week
12.

 24 week efficacy results are as follows:

This study evaluated CP-690,550 doses of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 mg twice daily and
20 mg once daily. All patients were maintained on their stable background of
methotrexate and randomized to either addition of placebo or one of the studied
doses of CP-690,550. 

In both studies, the most commonly-reported treatment-emergent adverse events
were urinary tract infections, headache, and diarrhea. Most adverse events were
mild or moderate in severity. Serious adverse events and adverse events leading
to discontinuation were infrequent. Dose-dependent decreases in mean neutrophil
counts and increases in mean LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol were consistent
with what has been observed in previous studies of CP-690,550 in RA. For
patients dosed on background methotrexate, transaminase increases were also
consistent with what had been reported in interim analyses in previous studies
of CP-690,550 in RA. 

All studies were sponsored by Pfizer Inc. 

ORAL Trials: Advancing Clinical Research for RA

The Phase 3 program, which is known as the ORAL (Oral CP-690,550 Rheumatoid

About CP-690,550

CP-690,550 is an oral, selective, potent inhibitor of the JAK family of enzymes.
In cell-based assays, CP-690,550 has been shown to inhibit JAK-3 and JAK-1 with
functional selectivity over JAK-2. By inhibiting these enzymes, which affect the
signaling of multiple cytokines (proteins released by cells to communicate with
other cells) that are involved in a broad spectrum of inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases, treatment with CP-690,550 may lead to clinically meaningful
improvement for patients. 

CP-690,550 is also being evaluated as a potential treatment for psoriasis,
Crohn`s disease, ulcerative colitis and solid organ transplant.

&lt;p&gt;Discovery in highly prospective Gorgon area supports company`s long-term plans
for natural gas development
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced an additional natural gas
discovery in the Greater Gorgon area`s Carnarvon Basin, Australia`s premier
offshore hydrocarbon zone. 

The Achilles-1 exploration well, located approximately 100 miles (160
kilometers) off the coast of northwest Australia, was drilled to a total depth
of 14,800 feet (4,500 meters) and encountered approximately 325 feet (100
meters) of net gas pay. 

"This discovery is located in a highly prospective area where Chevron is the
leading leaseholder, and it adds to our recent exploration successes," said
George Kirkland, Chevron`s executive vice president, Global Upstream and Gas.
"The discovery will also build on the supply that underpins the projected
40-year life of the Gorgon project." 

Jim Blackwell, president of Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production,
said that offshore northwest Australia remains one of the company`s focus areas
for global exploration. 

"As we expand our Australia natural gas business, additional discoveries in the
most prospective areas in the region will be expected to be tied into facilities
already under construction or being planned," said Blackwell. 

The Achilles-1 well is located in the WA-374-P permit area in the Greater Gorgon
area. Chevron Australia is the operator of WA-374-P with 50 percent interest,
while Shell Development (Australia) and ExxonMobil Australia each hold 25
percent. Chevron is currently spudding an additional exploration well (Satyr-1)
in the permit area. 

In August 2009, Chevron announced natural gas discoveries of 375 feet (115
meters) of net gas pay at the Clio-2 well and 110 feet (34 meters) of net gas
pay at the Kentish Knock-1 well, located offshore Western Australia. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and

petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides

&lt;p&gt;Kirstie Kelly for Disney`s Fairy Tale Weddings Celebrates Disney`s Newest
Princess On The Runway At Bridal Week In New York
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Disney Consumer Products (DCP) and renowned couture designer Kirstie Kelly are
launching an exquisite gown inspired by Princess Tiana, Disney`s newest princess
in more than ten years and the first African American Disney Princess character
from the highly anticipated animated musical film, The Princess and the Frog.
The Tiana gown will take its place in the phenomenally successful Kirstie Kelly
for Disney`s Fairy Tale Weddings line as the signature piece of an all new
collection of bridal gowns. The new collection also includes the Snow White
Diamond Edition gown, all new "Maidens" for bridesmaids, "Blossoms" for flower
girls and a new line of fine jewelry with renowned jeweler Mouawad, each
inspired by a Disney Princess character.

Princess Tiana`s determination, natural beauty, and universal appeal shine
through in this sensual gown. From the Kirstie Kelly for Disney`s Fairy Tale
Weddings collection. The sheath-style gown has an ivory hue with a hand beaded
rouched bodice of silk chiffon; a cascading pleated silk skirt and a waterfall
train. And the introduction of the Snow White Diamond Edition gown takes place
in tandem with the Blu-ray Disc debut of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - one
of the most requested Disney home entertainment releases of all time. The Snow
White gown incorporates handmade flowers, fine beaded details and silk organza
with a sleek yet romantic take on the sultry fit and flare shape. 

"The Princess Tiana gown is a very special part of the Disney Princess
collection," said Kelly. "When I look at this gown I see a modern woman that is
very comfortable with her own identity. The gown is designed for a bride with a
modern sensibility and effortlessly exudes both romance and sultry flair." 

Presented by Walt Disney Animation Studios, the musical The Princess and the
Frog is an animated comedy set in the great city of New Orleans. A modern twist
on a classic tale, the film features a girl named Tiana who dreams of owning her
own restaurant, a frog prince who desperately wants to be human again, and a
fateful kiss that leads them both on a hilarious adventure through the mystical
bayous of Louisiana. The Princess and the Frog marks the return to hand-drawn
animation from the revered team of John Musker and Ron Clements, with music by
Oscar&#174;-winning composer Randy Newman. Featuring the voice talents of Anika Noni
Rose, Terrence Howard, John Goodman, Keith David, Jim Cummings, Jennifer Lewis
and Oprah Winfrey, the film opens Nov. 25, 2009, in Los Angeles and New York and
hits theaters nationwide on Dec. 11. 

The Kirstie Kelly for Disney by Mouwad collection is a delicately crafted
showcase of Disney Princess-inspired diamond and platinum engagement rings and
wedding bands. The collection evokes the spirit of each Disney Princess with
exquisite details and intricate design. Subtle references to the personalities
of each princess can be seen throughout the collection such as pave and
millgrain borders, suggestive of Cinderella`s ethereal grace and charm, or
baguettes and clean lines for Ariel, symbolic of an art deco influence and her
bold individuality. Jasmine`s ring exudes the rich exotic patterns found in
ancient mosaics and dazzles with a bohemian chic aesthetic. Sleeping
Beauty/Aurora`s princess cut ring conveys an elegant yet romantic sensibility,
and for Belle the use of rose cut stones and delicate pave mounting convey her
modern yet sophisticated femininity. Hinting at a vintage feel, the Kirstie
Kelly for Disney by Mouawad collection embodies the modern woman.

&lt;p&gt;Amidst hailing the company's launch Monday of its SharePoint 2010 collaboration platform, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said the IT industry can help propel economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, appearing at the SharePoint Conference 2009 in Las Vegas, noted he has had to talk about the economy a lot lately but did not want to do that today. Instead, he stressed IT as an economic booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ In dual announcements today, Microsoft detailed the feature-complete SharePoint upgrade and said it will offer a second beta of Visual Studio 2010. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to remind you of one thing and one thing alone: That at the end of the day, the only thing that's going to enable growth and prosperity is advances in productivity and innovation, and the IT industry is going to propel a lot of that," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[During] the next five, the next 10 years, the challenge to transform the world through technology is as great today as any time certainly since I've been at Microsoft, which is almost 30 years now," said Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world is moving from PCs staring at a datacenter or the Internet to information being available on multiple devices ranging from phones to PCs and television sets, with the enterprise, datacenter, and Internet uniting in cloud computing, said Ballmer. "That's a major transformation," he said. There will be new interfaces such as vice and natural language interfaces, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint, Ballmer said, "is one of my favorite products at Microsoft" and is at the center of innovation at the company, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of what people want to do is about sharing information, finding information, getting insight out of information," and acting on information, Ballmer said, announcing the availability of the public beta of SharePoint 2010 technology. SharePoint Server 2010 is due next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer and other Microsoft officials appearing onstage cited capabilities in the 2010 platform including a new UI, business intelligence and intentions to make SharePoint accessible from multiple browsers and phones. &#160;It can be used in applications such as payroll management, executive dashboards and citizen management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to see SharePoint as the ultimate Swiss Army knife, the thing does wikis to workflow, blogs to business intelligence, really the whole gamut of tools for people to collaborate on the Web," said Jeff Teper, Microsoft corporate vice president for SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010 also features integration with the Visual Studio 2010 software development platform, governance capabilities, and a simpler upgrade procedure via the Visual Upgrade function. Microsoft also offers its cloud version of SharePoint, called SharePoint Online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft with the 2010 version of SharePoint appears to have listened to feedback concerning the 2007 release of the product, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, said conference attendee Gregory Romaniuk, browser technology team lead with the Alberta Teachers Association in Edmonton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like things are moving in the right direction for integration with various Web browsers and client and server things," Romaniuk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping things up to date has been an issue with the 2007 product, he said. "From what they said, I think they're going to try to simplify that," said Romaniuk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010 products include:&lt;/p&gt;

SharePoint Foundation, with base- level SharePoint platform capabilities

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM placed senior executive Robert Moffat on leave of absence after he was arrested in the largest ever hedge fund insider-trading scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moffat, senior vice president and head of International Business Machines Corp.'s systems and technology group, was charged with passing on insider information to a hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had worked for IBM since 1978 and was one of several executives who analysts said could have been a possible heir to IBM Chief Executive Sam Palmisano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In view of a U.S. federal investigation into his personal activities, Mr. Moffat has been placed on temporarily leave of absence and is no longer serving as an officer of IBM," said company spokesman Edward Barbini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat is accused of passing on information about IBM ahead of the company's quarterly results, as well as those of Sun Microsystems while IBM was looking at its books for a possible acquisition. The FBI said Moffat was one of the IBM executives conducting due diligence on Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also been charged with giving insider information on Advanced Micro Devices Inc, obtained through IBM's business negotiations with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat, released on bail, is pleading innocent, according to his lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's neither any evidence or claim that he profited in connection with the trades referenced in the complaint," the attorney, Kerry Lawrence, told Reuters. "He did not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM named Rodney Adkins as acting head of the systems and technology group. Adkins will also oversee development and manufacturing, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insider trading scandal centers on Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam. Executives at leading chipmaker Intel Corp and management consulting firm McKinsey  Co. were also implicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The involvement of a top executive at one the bluest of blue-chip firms has shocked analysts, although some noted IBM was not without problems. The U.S. Justice Department has recently begun investigating allegations that it abused its dominance in the mainframe servers market to squeeze rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares finished up 1.17 percent at $123.06 on Monday. They had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday after the company announced quarterly results that beat most expectations but disappointed investors who were looking for stronger contract signings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Derek Caney and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo are touting a brief letter that an advertising association sent to the U.S. Department of Justice supporting the search deal proposed by the companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe that Yahoo and Microsoft's proposal to combine their technologies and search platforms is good for advertisers, marketing services agencies, Website publishers and consumers," according to the letter, which was signed by four ad executives as well as Nancy Hill, president and CEO of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says that a healthy, competitive market for search and search advertising is crucial to the Internet's future, since most Web sites depend on online advertising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As leading members of the advertising and marketing services industry, we urge the Department of Justice to bring its antitrust review to a speedy conclusion. This proposal enhances competition, and should be allowed to take effect as soon as possible," the letter reads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Hill, Maurice Levy, chairman and CEO of Publicis Groupe; Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP; Michael I. Roth, chairman and CEO of Interpublic Group of Companies; and John Wren, president and CEO of Omnicom Group also signed the letter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Microsoft first revealed that the U.S. Department of Justice had begun seeking information for an antitrust review of the search deal with Yahoo. Under the agreement, announced in July, Bing would power Yahoo search and Yahoo would sell premium search advertising services for both companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal was nearly a year and a half in the making, during which time Yahoo rebuffed outright acquisition offers from Microsoft. There has not been much strong opposition to the final agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Yahoo said it welcomed the broad support of the deal and is hopeful it will close in early 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stated goal of the deal is to offer stronger search competition to Google, the market leader with around 70 percent market share. Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo would have around 30 percent market share. &lt;/p&gt;

executives who analysts said could have been a possible heir to
IBM Chief Executive Sam Palmisano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In view of a U.S. federal investigation into his personal
activities, Mr. Moffat has been placed on temporarily leave of
absence and is no longer serving as an officer of IBM," said
company spokesman Edward Barbini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moffat is accused of passing on information about IBM ahead
of the company's quarterly results, as well as those of Sun
Microsystems JAVA.O while IBM was looking at its books for a
possible acquisition. The FBI said Moffat was one of the IBM
executives conducting due diligence on Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has also been charged with giving insider information on
Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.N), obtained through IBM's
business negotiations with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moffat, released on bail, is pleading innocent, according
to his lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's neither any evidence or claim that he profited in
connection with the trades referenced in the complaint," the
attorney, Kerry Lawrence, told Reuters. "He did not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM named Rodney Adkins as acting head of the systems and
technology group. Adkins will also oversee development and
manufacturing, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The insider trading scandal centers on Galleon Group
founder Raj Rajaratnam. Executives at leading chipmaker Intel
Corp (INTC.O) and management consulting firm McKinsey  Co.
were also implicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The involvement of a top executive at one the bluest of
blue-chip firms has shocked analysts, although some noted IBM
was not without problems. The U.S. Justice Department has
recently begun investigating allegations that it abused its
dominance in the mainframe servers market to squeeze rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares finished up 1.17 percent at $123.06 on Monday.
They had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday after the company
announced quarterly results that beat most expectations but
disappointed investors who were looking for stronger contract
signings.

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has unblocked one of the two Microsoft-made add-ons that put Firefox users at risk from attack and will probably unblock the second in the next 48 hours, the company's head of engineering said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've unblocked the .NET Framework Assistant," said Mike Shaver, Mozilla's vice president of engineering, on Monday morning. Shaver was referring to one of the two Microsoft components that Mozilla automatically disabled late Friday after deciding it needed to protect Firefox users from a critical vulnerability Microsoft disclosed, and patched, last week. "We got confirmation from Microsoft over the weekend that the add-on wasn't a[n attack] vector for the vulnerability in question," said Shaver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Friday, Mozilla added .Net Framework Assistant and the accompanying Windows Presentation Foundation plug-in to its rarely-used blocking list , which then threw up a warning to users notifying them that the pair was being barred from Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has also pushed out a change that will let users running Firefox 3.5 override the block, added Shaver. That change came out of discussions with enterprise Firefox users who said that they needed the two components to run their .NET-based software within the browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The block of Windows Presentation Foundation will likely be lifted in the next two days. "Microsoft is watching the patch deployment numbers, and sharing them with us," said Shaver. "At some point, we'll take the [Windows Presentation Foundation] plug-in off the blocker. I expect that to happen in the next 48 hours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft's security team acknowledged that its software -- which had been silently installed in Firefox as far back as February 2009 -- contained a critical vulnerability that could be used by hackers to hijack Windows PCs through Firefox . The vulnerability also affected all versions of Internet Explorer (IE), including IE8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the MS09-054 bulletin, which provided details on the vulnerability, said nothing about Firefox. Later last Tuesday, Microsoft expanded on MS09-054 in a blog post, and confirmed that Firefox users were in danger .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft maintained that Firefox users who applied the patches would be safe from attack, but Mozilla felt that was not enough. Friday, Shaver cited the severity of the vulnerability and the difficulty some users have had in removing Microsoft's software as Mozilla's reasons for engaging the blocking list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing the Microsoft add-on and plug-in have been a contentious issue since Microsoft first slipped them into Firefox without users' permission last February as part of the .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1) update, which was delivered via Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users were also furious that the software was impossible to uninstall without editing the Windows registry. Later, Microsoft issued a follow-on update that made it possible to uninstall the components without a registry edit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaver denied that there was miscommunication between Microsoft and Mozilla, and instead characterized it as a "lack of clarity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to be in better communication," he promised, "especially about things like the version number of the [affected] plug-in." One of the problems Mozilla had last week was determining what -- .NET Framework Assistant or Windows Presentation Foundation, or both -- was vulnerable, and specifically what versions were at risk to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was an unusual case of using the blocker," Shaver said. "Version information was not available to us at first, and since [the software] was installed by many users, many of them were unaware they even had it, and the add-on and plug-in were difficult to uninstall, we thought it best to block them, at least for a time. Microsoft agreed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has used its add-on/plug-in blocking tool only nine times, including last week's incident, since it first deployed it in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, Firefox will include built-in tools that check whether components have been added by third-party software, then disable the add-on or plug-in by default and notify the user and allow him or her to enable the component(s). That kind of check, if it had existed earlier this year, would have kept the Microsoft software from being installed without Firefox users noticing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're big believers in informed user choice," said Shaver. "So we're going to improve notifications to users when plug-ins are installed. We do that with add-ons in Firefox now, which checks for those added since the last time you ran the browser. We will do the same thing for plug-ins, likely in Firefox 3.7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That version of Firefox, the second of two minor upgrades scheduled for the next six months, is currently slated to ship in March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Version 3.0, Firefox has notified users when any new add-ons, called "extensions" by Mozilla, have been installed since the last time the browser was launched. That notification, however, is "poor," acknowledged Shaver, since it simply highlights the new add-ons in a window and most importantly, does so after the add-on has already been installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan now is to make those notifications clearer, and also to warn about system-installed items before they're running, Shaver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're also building our plug-in check into the product for Firefox 3.6," added Shaver, referring to the outdated plug-in campaign that Mozilla kicked off last month, and bolstered last week when it launched a plug-in checking service . Firefox 3.6 will warn users of outdated third-party plug-ins, like Adobe's Flash or Apple 's QuickTime, when the browser reaches a site that calls upon such software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've learned a lot from this," concluded Shaver. "We're not trying to get into an adversarial model, but this was more visible than most [blocks in the past] because of the size of the company involved and the history of the plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would call the communication between us and Microsoft 'greatly clarified' as of now," Shaver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed Veteran Litigator Obtains Victory in Major Public Water Supply
Environmental Claim
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Greenberg Glusker today announced that Firm Partner Robert S. Chapman served as
lead trial counsel on the New York City trial team that today obtained a $104.7
million compensatory damage award against Exxon Mobil Corporation. The federal
jury found the oil company responsible for poisoning the City`s groundwater and
drinking water supply with the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether
(MTBE). 

The case, brought by the City of New York, was the first MTBE litigation in the
country to go to trial and result in a verdict. According to the financial news
agency Bloomberg, the City of New York`s verdict is the 13th largest jury
verdict in the nation in 2009. 

"Today, we achieved justice for the environment and improved safety for the
people of New York," said Chapman. He told Bloomberg that his argument to the
jury came down to these simple questions, "Can Exxon pollute the city`s
groundwater and get away with it? Can Exxon put MTBE into the city`s groundwater
and have a license to pollute?" 

During the 11-week trial, Chapman served as counsel along with attorney Victor
Sher of Sher Leff, LLP, a San Francisco law firm that specializes in water
quality cases, with overcall case oversight by Susan Amron of the New York City
Law Department. 

Chapman is a preeminent litigator and trial advocate with an extensive track
record of prevailing in high-profile, contentious matters. He has litigated
entertainment cases in both trial and appellate courts for more than 30 years.
He obtained a number of multi-million dollar trial court awards, including an
$80 million jury verdict, which is the largest ever obtained against a motion
picture studio. His litigation skills transferred readily to the high-stakes,
New York venue and contributed to the significant courtroom victory for cities
and water utilities. 

In the action, the City of New York accused Exxon Mobil, the biggest U.S. oil
company, of contaminating drinking water wells in the borough of Queens. It sued
for the costs of removing MTBE from the water supply. Thirty-three oil companies
previously settled similar contamination claims with New York. Exxon Mobil was
the lone holdout defendant. According to the City`s press release, "The jury
found Exxon liable for product liability for failure to warn people about the
dangerous nature of its product as well as trespass, public nuisance, and
negligence."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. plans to bolster SharePoint's Internet capabilities in the hopes of penetrating a Web content management market that it has, so far, been largely locked out of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also creating two new versions of SharePoint 2010 aimed at Webmasters. These new offerings -- one, an on-premises server for small to medium-sized companies, the other, a Web version hosted in Microsoft's data centers -- will cost half the price of existing versions, according to Kirk Hoenigsberger, general manager of SharePoint. He declined to release exact prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, companies using either of these Web-oriented versions of SharePoint won't need to buy Client Access Licenses (CALs) for internal employees who manage or update SharePoint-based Web sites, said Hoenigsberger. The cost of SharePoint's CALs tends to greatly outweigh the cost of the SharePoint server license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildly popular inside the corporate firewall for sharing files and for internal portals, SharePoint has made little headway as a back-end technology for Web sites or extranets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an IDC survey in July of 262 American corporate IT users, just 8% of respondents said they were using SharePoint for their Web sites, compared to 36% using it for internal portals and 51% using it for collaborative team sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slashing the price of SharePoint for the Web was an imperative, said Alan Pelz-Sharpe, an analyst with CMS Watch. Using SharePoint today for Web sites tends to be "shockingly expensive," he said. "The pricing was nuts. We've had customers tell us that they could have gone and bought Documentum for the price of [using SharePoint for the Web]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other problems, according to IDC analyst Melissa Webster: poor positioning of SharePoint for the Web, the fact that many Web sites are based on Java rather than Microsoft's .Net technology, and the number of small vendors offering cheap or free apps with capabilities that SharePoint can't match out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pelz-Sharpe is more succinct. "As a Web solution? It's pretty poor," he said. "SharePoint 2007 is a document management system that you can expose to the Web. It's not something we would recommend to a client."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sites use SharePoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, there are a number of Web sites already running today on SharePoint, some of them quite attractive and even flashy: HawaiianAir.com, Ferrari.com, Volvocars.com, the Chicago tourism site, ChooseChicago.com, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TopSharePoint.com has almost 600 examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, said Michael Sampson, a New Zealand-based consultant and former analyst with Ferris Research, is that companies like Ferrari have "obviously spent carloads of money in order to make it [Ferrari.com] not look like SharePoint at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is its lack of native compliance with W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). To ensure that SharePoint Web sites can work with software used by blind or visually-impaired visitors, said Sampson, requires "spending more money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koenigsbauer admits that getting SharePoint 2007-based sites to comply with WCAG required users to buy "partner-led" solutions. However, "in SharePoint 2010, we are doing a much better job and now fully support WCAG." He added that SharePoint 2010 also has "full XHTML compliance" to ensure Web pages don't break or look different under different Web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010 also includes multi-lingual support, which Koenigsberger said will let companies localize Web sites without extensive recoding. And SharePoint 2010 will include built-in support for rich media such as video, audio and Silverlight 3 in order to help make SharePoint Web sites more attractive and interactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverlight 2010 will also make it easier for users to edit Web content in Microsoft Word, and have those changes updated with the formatting retained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Microsoft is readying FAST Search for Internet Business to power Web site search. FAST is already used to power a number of Web sites such as BestBuy.com, Dell.com, NewYorkTimes.com and others. Some customers are already using FAST with SharePoint today, said Koenigsberger, though he declined to offer up specific names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for SharePoint 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pelz-Sharpe likes SharePoint 2010's new Web features. "There are a lot of improvements, I will give them credit there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He doesn't think SharePoint will make much headway against high-end Web content management systems such as Interwoven, Vignette and Day, though, he quickly added, "in fairness, Microsoft is not trying to go after that market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, SharePoint's target will be non-Web-centric companies, many of whom have let their Web sites or extranets languish since the dot-com crash, according to Koenigsberger. "A lot of these sites are still strictly HTML, not personalized, dynamic or even database-driven," he said. "We see a big move starting to happen now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sid Probstein, CTO of search and analytics firm, Attivio Inc., and a former technology executve at FAST, said that SharePoint faces formidable competition from the many open-source and SaaS tools such as Plone and Joomla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SharePoint might now make sense for a Microsoft shop, but there are so many free alternatives," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koenigsberger argued that the headache of maintaining various, non-integrated apps is ultimately more costly than SharePoint. "People get frustrated when they have so many point solutions that don't talk to each other," he said. "So we think the TCO [Total Cost of Ownership] value proposition is there for SharePoint."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Advertiser group says Yahoo, Microsoft deal positive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Letter signed by 4 global advertising holding companies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 19 (Reuters) - A major advertising group
wrote a letter to the Justice Department on Monday in support
of Microsoft's and Yahoo's plan to work together to challenge
dominant search engine Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The American Association of Advertising Agencies, in a
letter dated Monday and posted on its web site, said it was
pleased with plans for the 10-year deal in which Microsoft's
(MSFT.O) new Bing search engine would power queries on Yahoo's
(YHOO.O) sites. In return, Microsoft is to pay Yahoo 88 percent
of revenue from advertisements generated from those sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The goal of the plan is to challenge Google (GOOG.O), which
has about 77 percent of the global Internet search market,
according to industry tracker comScore's figures for July.
Yahoo comes a distant second with 8 percent and Microsoft
fourth with 3 percent, behind China's Baidu (BIDU.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that Yahoo! and Microsoft's proposal to combine
their technologies and search platforms is good for
advertisers, marketing services agencies, website publishers
and consumers," the advertising group said in a letter signed
by Chief Executive Officer Nancy Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As leading members of the advertising and marketing
services industry, we urge the Department of Justice to bring
its antitrust review to a speedy conclusion. This proposal
enhances competition, and should be allowed to take effect as
soon as possible," wrote Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The letter also was signed by the heads of the four big
global advertising holding companies: the Publicis Groupe
(PUBP.PA), WPP (WPP.L), Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG.N)
and Omnicom Group (OMC.N).

&lt;p&gt;Icagen Describes Progress in Its Collaboration With Pfizer to Identify Selective
Sodium Channel Inhibitors

RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Oct. 19, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Icagen, Inc.
(Nasdaq:ICGN) today announced that data related to its collaboration with Pfizer
focused on certain sodium channels for the treatment of pain and related
conditions were presented in two poster presentations at the Neuroscience 2009
Annual Meeting sponsored by the Society for Neuroscience ("SFN") in Chicago,
Illinois.

Icagen and Pfizer jointly presented data demonstrating progress in identifying
subtype-selective modulators of the sodium channel Nav1.8. This channel is one
of three sodium channel pain targets that form the basis of the collaboration.
There are extensive preclinical data demonstrating a role for Nav1.8 in
modulating pain. However, to date only limited examples of subtype-selective
small molecule modulators of Nav1.8 have been described. In collaboration with
Pfizer, Icagen presented pharmacokinetic and efficacy data for two novel
modulators of this target. These orally bioavailable, use-dependent compounds
have excellent in vitro profiles, impact nerve firing, are efficacious in models
of inflammatory and neuropathic pain and have acceptable pharmacokinetic and
drug-like properties. Overall these data provide further evidence for the
feasibility of identifying selective Nav1.8 compounds as potential novel
therapeutic agents for the treatment of pain.

"While sodium channel blockers have been used to treat pain for many years,
currently available agents are not subtype-selective and therefore are limited
by serious side effects," noted Douglas Krafte, Ph.D., VP Biology and
Pharmacology at Icagen. "In collaboration with Pfizer, compounds which
selectively inhibit one particular subtype of voltage-gated sodium channels,
Nav1.8, have been characterized. By blocking only one subtype of these channels
it should be possible to identify compounds which demonstrate efficacy in pain
with an improved side effect profile as compared with existing therapies. We
look forward to continuing this research program with Pfizer as we seek to
identify novel clinical compounds for the treatment of pain and related
disorders."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will offer the second beta of its upcoming Visual Studio 2010 software development platform and the accompanying .Net Framework 4 programming platform on Monday and unveil consolidated packaging options for the toolset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beta package will be available to MSDN subscribers on Monday and to everyone else on Wednesday. The official launch of Visual Studio 2010 and .Net Framework 4 is set for March 22, 2010, with the technology expected to ship around that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Microsoft is looking to move legacy users of the Visual SourceSafe version control system to the newer Team Foundation Server. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Visual Studio 2010, Microsoft is enabling it to be used with platforms such as the upcoming Windows 7 OS a well as with the Windows Azure cloud platform. Team capabilities for application lifecycle management also are critical. Multi-monitor support is featured as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second beta adds capabilities for developing applications for the company's SharePoint collaboration platform. Visual Studio features for SharePoint include the ability to build a new SharePoint project and build and deploy SharePoint Web site and the applications behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All that happens within Visual Studio," said Dave Mendlen, Microsoft senior director of developer marketing. Microsoft on Monday also will roll out the 2010 version of SharePoint at its SharePoint Conference in Las Vegas, at which time company CEO Steve Ballmer also will announce the new beta release of Visual Studio 2010 and .Net Framework 4, Mendlen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.Net Framework 4 beta 2 also features SharePoint capabilities and reduces the size of the framework itself by 80 percent, Mendlen said. "The end users, the customers of these applications, will have to download a dramatically smaller runtime," resulting in an improved installation process and less time waiting to get an application running, said Mendlen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint capabilities in Visual Studio 2010 should help boost SharePoint, an analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SharePoint has grown like wildfire, but development of SharePoint applications has not been as easy because of the lack of tooling within Visual Studio," said Mike Gualtieri. senior analyst at Forrester. "Visual Studio 2010 includes tools for SharePoint development that will make it much more easy for developers to create and deploy SharePoint applications. Now Visual Studio developers can target SharePoint as a platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no plans for a third beta of Visual Studio 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Monday, Microsoft will elaborate on how its Visual Studio platform is being reduced from nine different packaging options to just three primary options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The feedback that we've heard from our customers was [nine options] was too complicated," said Mendlen. "There were too many packages to choose from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three primary packages, featuring MSDN subscriptions, include:&lt;/p&gt;

Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate with MSDN, featuring the full suite of tools including ALM products. Testing and architecture tools also are featured. It carries a price tag of $11,924 for a new customer and $3,841 for a current customer renewing with Microsoft.
Visual Studio 2010 Premium with MSDN, featuring the Visual Studio toolset but lacking some architecture capabilities of the Ultimate edition. Some of Microsoft's ALM suite is included. Premium costs $5,469 for new users and $2,299 for customers seeking renewals.
Visual Studio 2010 Professional with MSDN, for basic development tasks. It includes the core version of Visual Studio. It costs $1,199 for a new user and $799 for a renewal.&lt;p&gt;Users also can purchase Visual Studio 2010 Professional minus a MSDN subscription for $799.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also is looking to encourage MSDN subscriptions. New benefits of MSDN include unlimited access to Visual Studio Team Foundation Server upon release, the ability to develop on the Windows Azure cloud computing platform and complementary e-learning of as much as 40 hours per year per subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Developers] can build applications inside of Azure at no cost to them," said Mendlen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The inclusion of hours for the Azure platform is very smart," Gualtieri said. "Cloud computing is a given and will become deployment approach of choice in the next few years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSDN customers also will be moved to a higher level of Visual Studio than what they are paying for today, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft to offer second beta for Visual Studio 2010," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will detail its planned SharePoint Server 2010 business collaboration platform for the enterprise and Web on Monday, emphasizing Internet, developer, and video capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010 is feature-complete and will be offered in a beta release in November along with the Office 2010 applications suite. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer will discuss the upcoming SharePoint release in a keynote presentation at the Microsoft SharePoint Conference 2009 in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld's J. Peter Bruzzese got an early look at SharePoint Server 2010. Check out his report. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the biggest release we have done to date," said Jeff Teper, corporate vice president for SharePoint at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to be generally available the first half of next year, the 2010 version of the platform will make it easier to run Internet sites. A lower priced version will be offered for small and medium-sized businesses. Exact pricing&#160;of that&#160; version&#160;has not yet been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also is extending its SharePoint Online hosting service. SharePoint Online has been focused on internally facing collaboration within a single enterprise. "Now, you can expose [a business] &#160;on the Internet," Teper said. The external-facing sites can be used for capabilities such as e-commerce, marketing or communications about government services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can run the SharePoint Server 2010 server themselves, or Microsoft can host it on SharePoint Online. "You choose server or service. You run it or we run it," said Teper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint Server 2010 is going into beta alongside Office 2010 to enable easier collaboration using the two products. "You have Office on the desktop and SharePoint on the server," Teper said. "We've designed as a family to work together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featured in SharePoint Server 2010 is the ability to save videos onto SharePoint. While it will be simpler to deploy videos through Microsoft's Silverlight browser plug-in technology, users also can run them in the rival Adobe Flash format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editing of Web pages will be enhanced through use of the Microsoft Office ribbon, supporting capabilities such as dragging and dropping of video.&#160; Users also can design workflows that include approval processes, such as having a press release approved by marketing before it goes to an Internet site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts were impressed with social capabilities for SharePoint Server 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Folks [have been] hesitant to deploy SharePoint as the Facebook for the enterprise, but I think there's going to be a lot of organizations that will seriously consider that," with the 2010 release offering capabilities such as communities and better support for blogs and wikis, said analyst Rob Koplowitz, of Forrester. Integration between Office 2010 and SharePoint Server 2010 is what boosts social computing in the release, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release also will "have much better application tools and lifecycle management," said analyst John Rymer, also of Forrester. &#160;It also features improved operational management features and a better integration framework than the predecessor Microsoft Office SharePoint Server release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fourth, Microsoft is finally providing offline support," said Rymer, referring to the SharePoint Workspace 2010 part of the product. SharePoint Workspace "allows people to take SharePoint lists and forms offline, work on them, and re-sync the revised data with the server," Rymer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint Server 2010 will boost developer capabilities for building and extending customized SharePoint Web sites, via tools, APIs and runtimes, with the planned Visual Studio 2010 development platform playing a critical role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visual Studio will make it much easier to build sophisticated SharePoint applications," such as a customer-tracking site or a human resources or employee services application, Teper said. Visual Studio 2010 will make it easier to debug and deploy applications on SharePoint. It also will feature wizards to generate SharePoint application components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather than writing 100 lines of code to generate a part on a page in SharePoint, you'd like to tell Visual Studio to just generate that code for you," Teper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An advanced application packaging model in SharePoint Server 2010 is supported in Visual Studio 2010, Teper said. Applications can be deployed as a group and changed independently. While Visual Studio 2010 is not required for building SharePoint applications, it will make it much easier to do so, Teper explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's reliance on Visual Studio is a change of direction for SharePoint, according to Koplowitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The development environment, which has been really a SharePoint environment, although it's a &#160;powerful development environment, it was out of step with the standard Microsoft development tools," Koplowitz said. "Now, it becomes more native .Net [for] programmers and aligned Visual Studio. I think there will be a lot more custom development on the platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also featured in SharePoint and accessible via Visual Studio are APIs for REST and Atom. These APIS enable easier integration with data such as weather data on the Internet. Users also can use REST and Atom to build application mashups. SOAP already has been supported in SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APIs also are featured for Silverlight and Microsoft LINQ (Language Integrated Query).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another feature in SharePoint Server 2010 is a "solution sandbox" for securing code similar to the sandbox concept in Java. "It's a way for people to run their custom code on SharePoint and protect it from other things and vice versa," said Teper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody will live in their own sandbox," he said. Previously, developers needed an administrator's assistance to isolate code in SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint Server 2010 also will feature a new release of SharePoint Designer, enabling non-developers to build simple SharePoint applications without writing code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft to detail feature-complete SharePoint upgrade," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM placed senior executive Robert Moffat on leave of absence after he was arrested in the largest ever hedge fund insider-trading scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moffat, senior vice president and head of International Business Machines Corp.'s systems and technology group, is being charged with passing on insider information to a hedge fund. He had been working for IBM since 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In view of a U.S. federal investigation into his personal activities, Mr. Moffat has been placed on temporarily leave of absence and is no longer serving as an officer of IBM," said company spokesman Edward Barbini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat is accused of passing on information on IBM itself ahead of the company's quarterly results, as well as those of Sun Microsystems while IBM was looking at its books for a possible acquisition. The FBI said Moffat was one of the IBM executives conducting due diligence on Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also been charged with giving insider information on Advanced Micro Devices Inc, obtained through IBM's business negotiations with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM named Rodney Adkins as acting head of the systems and technology group. Adkins will also oversee development and manufacturing, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insider trading scandal centers around Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam. Executives at leading chipmaker Intel Corp and management consulting firm McKinsey  Co. were also implicated. (Reporting by Ritsuko Ando)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Jury finds company polluted NYC ground water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * City said Exxon ignored warnings on MTBE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Exxon shares up modestly
 (Adds background, company comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A federal jury in New York
City ruled Exxon Mobil Corp  (XOM.N) had polluted the city's
ground water and ordered the oil giant to pay $105 million in
damages, the city said in a statement on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The city contended Exxon knew that gasoline additive methyl
tertiary butyl ether would contaminate ground water if it
leaked from the underground storage tanks at its retail
stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon ignored warnings from its own scientists and
engineers not to use MTBE in areas of the country that relied
on ground water for drinking water, the city said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MTBE is an oxygenate that is added to gasoline to increase
its octane level and reduce air pollution, but it has largely
been phased out of the U.S. fuel supply because of the dangers
to ground water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $105 million verdict represents less than 3 percent of
Exxon's second-quarter profit of $3.95 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), BP Plc (BP.L), Chevron Corp
(CVX.N), Citgo Petroleum Corp, Hess Corp (HES.N) and Sunoco Inc
SUN.N have previously settled claims against them for a total
of $15 million, the city said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Irving, Texas-based Exxon said it was disappointed with the
decision and would consider its legal options. The company said
during the trial that its service stations were not the cause
of the contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not believe we should be required to compensate the
City of New York for someone else's contamination," company
spokesman Kevin Allexon said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon Mobil rose 1.1 percent, or 82 cents, to
$73.94 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoon.

&lt;p&gt;Addition of Fort Dodge Animal Health Products Diversifies and Enhances Pfizer`s
Already Robust U.S. Portfolio
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
A new Pfizer Animal Health was unveiled last week as Pfizer's acquisition of
Wyeth, including its subsidiary Fort Dodge Animal Health, was completed. Pfizer
Animal Health is now the world`s leader in the discovery, development,
manufacture and sales of veterinary vaccines and medicines for livestock and
companion animals. 

The acquisition of many of Fort Dodge`s U.S. products allows Pfizer Animal
Health to greatly diversify its U.S. portfolio, as well as broaden its offering
in all animal health segments. Pfizer Animal Health now offers an enhanced
portfolio in beef, dairy, and companion animals, as well as a redefined product
line for swine, equine and poultry. 

"We`re extremely proud to offer our customers even more best-in-class and
innovative products," said Clint Lewis, president of U.S. Operations for Pfizer

what is already a robust U.S. portfolio and will enhance our leading position in
the animal health marketplace."

As the leader for beef and dairy animal health solutions, Pfizer will further
enhance its position with the addition of FACTREL&#174; (gonadorelin hydrochloride)

products complement the current U.S. cattle portfolio that includes DRAXXIN&#174;
(tulathromycin), DECTOMAX&#174;, EXCEDE&#174; (ceftiofur crystalline free acid), EXCENEL&#174;
(ceftiofur hydrochloride), BOVI-SHIELD &#174; GOLD, LUTALYSE&#174; (dinoprost
tromethamine), ORBESEAL&#174;, and SPECTRAMAST&#174; (ceftiofur hydrochloride). Pfizer
Animal Genetics also continues to explore opportunities to apply genomics
technology to livestock health and management solutions. 

For the swine market, Pfizer Animal Health will offer a comprehensive range of
solutions and services to strengthen its offering with the full line of SUVAXYN&#174;
brands, including SUVAXYN PCV-2 vaccine for circovirus. This addition rounds out
an already broad product line that includes RESPISURE&#174;, FLUSURE&#174;, DRAXXIN&#174;, and
EXCEDE&#174;. 

Already the world leader of in ovo technology, Pfizer Poultry Health will
strengthen its position in the poultry industry with the addition of a broad
range of poultry vaccines including POULVAC&#174; and MATERNAVAC&#174; IBD-Reo, a leading
broiler-breeder vaccine. 

Equine

Joining an already industry-leading equine franchise that includes such
established and well-respected brands as STRONGID&#174; (pyrantel pamoate),
DORMOSEDAN&#174; (detomidine hydrochloride), and HYLARTIN&#174; (sodium hyaluronate) are
Fort Dodge`s WEST NILE INNOVATOR &#174;,FLU VAC INNOVATOR &#174; and QUEST&#174;(moxidectin)
and QUEST PLUS&#174; (moxidectin/praziquantel). 

Companion Animals

Top vaccine LYMEVAX&#174; complements the current VANGUARD&#174; canine vaccine line, and
several anesthetic products help round out the small animal portfolio. They join
current innovative offerings that include REVOLUTION&#174; (selamectin), CERENIA
(maropitant citrate), CONVENIA&#174; (cefovecin sodium), RIMADYL&#174; (carprofen) and
SLENTROL&#174; (dirlotapide). 

Pfizer Animal Health also announced today that all current U.S. pricing, product
distribution, programs and policies for Pfizer Animal Health products, including
the acquired Fort Dodge products, will remain in place through 2009. 

"Pfizer Animal Health is passionate about working hand-in-hand with our
customers and partners to transform the care, health and well-being of animals,"
Mr. Lewis said. "We continue to envision a future where animal health care
providers, veterinarians and livestock producers look to Pfizer first to help
them to run their practice or operation productively and profitably. With our
newly expanded portfolio, value-added services and high-caliber talent, Pfizer
is more focused than ever on providing relevant solutions to their animal care
needs," Mr. Lewis said.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Oct 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SpringCM announced today that it has released the newest version of its
Cloud Connector for SharePoint. With SpringCM's unique Cloud-based ECM
Platform, the SpringCM Cloud Connector for SharePoint enables
organizations to extend and enhance Microsoft Office SharePoint Server
2007 and the upcoming release of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 portals
and collaboration spaces with rich content management functionality for
applications both inside and outside their firewall.

    Corefino, Inc., a provider of outsourced online accounting and finance
solutions based in Sunnyvale, CA, is an early user of the SpringCM Cloud
Connector for SharePoint. Among the applications that Corefino supports on
SpringCM is a sophisticated invoice processing capability in which
customer invoices are faxed directly into the SpringCM repository using
integrated fax management capability; data is automatically extracted
using optical character recognition and SpringCM workflow automatically
posts the payment data to the customer ERP system using SpringCM's
integration features. As part of the process, customers receive
SharePoint task requests generated by SpringCM and then view and approve
invoice payments through Corefino's portal, yet the complete process is
automated and managed by SpringCM.

    According to Karen Watts, CEO at Corefino, "The SpringCM integration with
SharePoint allows us to support our customer requirements much quicker and
at a lower cost by leveraging the SpringCM platform combined with our
SharePoint-based InfoReady customer portal. This significantly improves
our operational efficiency. It's a great example of how Corefino is able
to leverage our partnerships and technology for our customers."

    The SpringCM Cloud Connector for SharePoint provides robust integration
with SharePoint products and technologies, whether hosted or installed
on-premise, and over 20 advanced ECM capabilities spanning imaging, OCR,
enterprise-class document management, workflow, view and markup, fax and
email management, e-signature, records management and more, all available
in a SaaS model for a low monthly fee. Based on extensive customer
feedback, SpringCM has enhanced its Cloud Connector for SharePoint with
important capabilities including:


--  Single sign-on and integrated security model to simplify
    administration and ensure that content is managed with consistent security
    across processes.
--  Ability to browse and search SpringCM accounts and folder structures
    from within SharePoint Server 2010 and SharePoint Server 2007.
--  Ability to view documents and edit SpringCM metadata from SharePoint
    Server 2010 and SharePoint Server 2007, thereby allowing casual users to
    participate in sophisticated document processes.
--  Capability to edit documents stored in SpringCM using the Client
    integration capabilities of SharePoint Server 2010 and SharePoint Server
    2007, enabling easy document revision control with full audit trails.
--  Ability for SpringCM based workflows to pull from or insert documents
    into SharePoint Server 2010 and SharePoint Server 2007 libraries, enabling
    automated movement of documents between the two systems for records
    management, publishing and other processes.
--  Ability to set SharePoint Server 2010 and SharePoint Server 2007 tasks

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 


Attention: Technology writers and editors

What:      Mimosa Systems expert and Microsoft MVP to present a session
           titled, "Records and Storage Management with SharePoint 2010"

Who:       Presented by Martin Tuip, Senior Technical Product Marketing
           Manager, Mimosa Systems, author of www.archiving101.com, and
           nine-time Microsoft MVP for Exchange Server

When:      October 21, 2009 at 9:00 - 10:15 a.m.

Where:     Microsoft SharePoint Conference 2009
           (Surf 2 Conference Room)
           Mandalay Bay Convention Center
           Las Vegas, NV

    
Members of the media are invited to attend the Microsoft SharePoint
Conference 2009 breakout session titled, "Records and Storage Management
with SharePoint 2010" to learn about the differences between a records
archive and SharePoint 2010 in-place records and the benefits of archiving
and eDiscovery leveraging unified data capture.

    "Prior to Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, records were managed by
creating a Records Center site to serve as an archive, then copying
documents to the archive when they became records," said Tuip. "Whether a
document was a record or not was determined by whether it lived in the
records archive or elsewhere. With SharePoint Server 2010, you will now be
able to manage records in an archive, or you can manage records in the
same document repository as active documents."

    During the session, Tuip will discuss the Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010
in-place approach. With this approach when a document has been declared as
a record, the record remains in place, but Microsoft SharePoint Server
2010 now manages it as a record. This process will be compared with a
SharePoint records archive and its ability to support eDiscovery
processes through unified data capture.

    Martin Tuip has more than a decade of IT experience. He started out his IT
career in system administration, but has focused mostly on archiving and
compliance products. He is the webmaster of a few resource sites for
Exchange and SharePoint and as well is the owner of some of the world's
largest user communities for these products and writes on one of the few
archiving software dedicated blogs at www.archiving101.com. Martin is a
published author, a nine-time Microsoft MVP for Exchange Server. He
currently works as the Senior Technical Product Marketing Manager for
Mimosa Systems.

    Editorial Opportunities

    Company executives and leading email archiving experts are also available
during the conference to discuss technology and trends in SharePoint
archiving, eDiscovery, regulatory compliance, business continuity, and
storage optimization.

    Mimosa will be demonstrating the Mimosa NearPoint for SharePoint archiving

people but has not been singled out for criticism like its
longtime rival.

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has now unblocked a Microsoft add-on thought to pose a danger due to a software vulnerability, but a second add-on remains blocked, the organization said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has confirmed that the .NET Framework Assistant add-on can't be used as a "mechanism" for exploiting a vulnerability in Internet Explorer (IE), wrote Mike Shaver, Mozilla's vice president of engineering, on Sunday. The add-on enables what's called "ClickOnce" support, a Microsoft technology for application deployment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is updating its list of blocked add-ons, and it should be re-enabled for those users who had it enabled in the first place, Shaver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla blocked the Framework Assistant last Friday. Earlier in the week, Microsoft warned that Firefox users were vulnerable to an attack because of a problem in the add-on if users had not applied the MS09-054 IE patch. Mozilla consulted Microsoft before implementing the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still blocked is the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) add-on, but Mozilla is working on an alternative for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're hard at work on improving the experience for (especially enterprise) users who wish to override the blocking of the WPF plugin before we remove it from the blocklist, and I'm working on a post to clarify the events of the past few days," Shaver wrote. "We (especially I) appreciate your patience and support as we work to keep our users safe and comfortable with all the tools at our disposal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft landed in hot water earlier this year when it pushed out the Framework Assistant add-on as part of a service pack for its .Net application framework. Users complained since they couldn't uninstall the plugin using the normal Firefox menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft later released an update allowing users to remove the add-on through Firefox rather than fiddling with the Windows registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Products Leverage Microsoft SharePoint Server Products and Technologies to
Deliver Enterprise-Wide Process- and Case-Management Solutions
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT CONFERENCE

Global 360 today announced its Process and Case Management solutions are the
first enterprise-wide solutions to enable both strategic process and document
management applications on Microsoft SharePoint Server products and
technologies. These infinitely scalable Global360 solutions accelerate the
development, deployment and adoption of SharePoint Server enterprise-wide. This
allows organizations to further leverage SharePoint Server for more strategic
applications, thus improving Return on Investment (ROI) for their existing
SharePoint Server investment. 

With more than 100 million user licenses worldwide, SharePoint Server has become
the de facto standard to support project team collaboration, basic document
sharing and common portal functions. The Global 360 solutions enable the next
big step as companies can now leverage the SharePoint Server platform for more
strategic processes. 

These Global 360 solutions preserve organizations` SharePoint Server investment
and provide users with the following advantages:

* Enterprise class process management. Now there is a robust, scalable way to
handle process volume as the numbers of processes grow. 
* Graphical, intuitive process and application design. Global 360 delivers
unique views of the information that is most valuable to each type of user. 
* Case management capabilities. Case management supports ad-hoc, collaborative
processes and references multiple documents that live in SharePoint Server. 
* Extended tracking and reporting on the process. Now historical or real-time
activities can be tracked and analyzed for near real-time process-based
reporting and participant labor statistics. 
* Scalability for high volume and/or multiple workflow - SharePoint Server will
now handle workflow for high-volume processes or running multiple processes.

Process360 and SharePoint Server

Documents like claims submissions, job applicant submissions, customer
correspondence and new customer applications are still widespread in most
business processes. Many organizations are storing these documents in SharePoint
Server libraries where Word, Excel and other document types can be uploaded and
shared with co-workers. Global 360`s Process360 extends the SharePoint Server
platform by allowing organizations to build out process and document management
applications utilizing SharePoint Server-based documents. 

Once the document is in the SharePoint Server repository, users can easily start
business processes, or as the document enters the SharePoint Server repository,
Global 360 can automatically kick off the process based on characteristics of
the document. Global 360 supports complex, parallel processes that may include
thousands of process steps such as review, edit, approve, reject, rendezvous and
split, and also apply complex process business rules, where appropriate, to
increase automated processing and eliminate manually intensive steps. 

Global 360`s Process360 solution also leverages SharePoint Server to deliver a
powerful persona-based user experience. This user experience, known as
viewPoint, uses a robust library of SharePoint Server Web parts. The growing
library of 22 Web parts provides common process and document management tasks
delivered as a ready-to-use end-user application experience that is
unprecedented in the market, and unusual in most SharePoint Server
implementations. Primarily focused on the participants and managers in a
process, viewPoint provides SharePoint Server surfaced tasks such as case list
allocation, task list search, KPI matrix and more. 

For Managers, viewPoint delivers simple, easily digested dashboards and reports
through the SharePoint Server Portal. These dashboards and reports provide all
the information and real-time reporting necessary to make smart business
decisions, without having to filter out technical or extraneous information. 

By extending SharePoint Server`s portal capabilities, viewPoint accelerates
time-to-deployment while reducing the costs associated with complex BPM user
applications, aiding in quicker user adoption. 

Case360 and SharePoint Server

Case360 enables Case Management, a style of BPM that deals with unpredictable
business processes that would be nearly impossible to capture in a traditional
process model without compromising the integrity of the process. These processes
are typically very ad-hoc or unstructured in nature, are generally document- and
data-intensive, include tasks created and assigned "on the fly," and rely
heavily on human judgment. Global 360 provides Case Management on top of the
SharePoint Server repository, allowing rapid deployment of process and document
management applications that support this type of unstructured and ad-hoc
processing. 

Examples of processes well-suited to Case Management include Dispute Resolution,
Medical Claims Appeals, Life Insurance New Business and Underwriting, Customer
Service and Correspondence, Health Benefits, as well as various Judicial and
Legal applications. 

According to David Mitchell, president and CEO of Global 360, "The wide adoption
of Microsoft SharePoint Server is a key leverage point for global enterprises to
dramatically improve strategic processes - the lifeblood of a business. Often
these processes are manual and paper intensive, or reside on monolithic legacy
applications that are not intuitive to users or productive in nature." 

Added Mitchell, "As organizations begin using SharePoint Server enterprise-wide
for strategic processes, it will evolve from a collaboration tool into a window
into business performance. Management gains access to more information to
understand how the organization is performing - are we meeting Service Level
Agreement or Key Performance Indicator goals, for example? Too often, this
performance information isn`t readily available, and managers must make
decisions without the supporting process performance data to assist in the
decision making process. Global 360 applications have the ability to change
that, and do it quickly." 

Global 360`s Process and Case Management products will fully support Microsoft
SharePoint Server 2010 and Microsoft Office Visio 2010 when they release next
year.

&lt;p&gt;$13,000 in Harris Teeter Gift Cards Serve as Incentives to Increase Recycling
RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Everyone knows recycling is good for the environment. And now, thanks to
Coca-Cola, it can be good for your wallet, as well. If you live in Raleigh, and
you recycle the right way, you can win a $50 Harris Teeter gift card! 

North Carolina-based Coca-Cola Consolidated, the City of Raleigh, Harris Teeter
and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources today
announced a new partnership designed to increase recycling throughout the city.
`Recycle and Win` is a public/private initiative designed to educate residents
on the correct ways to recycle. 

The program will kick off Tuesday, November 3 and run for six months. The City
is sending an educational mailer from Coca-Cola to all single-family households
in Raleigh. The mailer features the Do`s and Don`ts of recycling, along with an
opportunity to win a $50 Harris Teeter gift card simply for recycling and making
sure you are recycling the right way! The educational mailer contains a sticker,
which residents should place on their green recycling bins in order to win. 

"The beauty of this program is its simplicity," said Fred Battle, Executive
Director of Raleigh`s Solid Waste Department. "All residents have to do is place
the weather-resistant sticker provided by Coca-Cola on their recycling bin,
place the recycling bin with the sticker facing the street, and recycle
materials properly. If the Coca-Cola Recycling Prize Patrol spots their
stickered bin, they could win a $50 Harris Teeter gift card." 

Raleigh Mayor Charles Meeker said, "This is an exciting partnership that can
really make a difference in reducing the amount of waste material going to the
landfill. As our community continues to grow, we need innovative solutions such
as the Recycle and Win program to promote environmental sustainability. This
helps save the environment as well as tax dollars." 

"Initiatives like `Recycle and Win` are very important to our efforts to grow
the state`s recycling economy and to create jobs related to the recovery of
materials," said Scott Mouw, State Recycling Director with North Carolina`s
Division of Pollution Prevention and Environmental Assistance. "We are excited
to see this program develop and want to recognize Coca-Cola, Harris Teeter and
the City of Raleigh for their leadership." 

"Coca-Cola is proud to sponsor this exciting initiative," said Lauren Steele,
Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated. "We
want to make recycling a rewarding experience, and what better way to encourage
people to recycle than by giving them an opportunity to be a winner! This fits
well with the Coca-Cola Live Positively platform." Steele, a long-time proponent
of recycling, says Recycle and Win will make Raleigh`s already excellent
curbside recycling program even better. "With so many people moving to Raleigh
over the last decade, it`s important to educate new residents and remind all the
others how to recycle properly," he said. 

The Coca-Cola Prize Patrol will be visiting Raleigh neighborhoods starting in
early November and plans to award (10) $50 Harris Teeter Gift Cards per week for
a total of 260 prizes throughout the six-month program. 

"Programs like `Recycle and Win` are instrumental in building positive recycling
habits, and are just a part of our efforts to promote recycling," said Rod
Antolock, Executive Vice President of Operations and Merchandising for Harris
Teeter. "We recently installed recycling bins designed for bottles and cans in
the lobbies of each of our stores. These bins are in addition to the plastic and
paper bag recycling bins currently at each Harris Teeter location. Now, if a
customer enjoys a bottle or canned beverage during a shopping trip, we encourage
them to take advantage of our new in-store recycling program." 

Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated is the second largest Coca-Cola Bottler in
the United States. The Company is a leader in the manufacturing, marketing and
distribution of soft drinks.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft last week patched nine vulnerabilities, five marked "critical," in Windows 7, a move that will require users upgrading to the new operating system starting Thursday to download a security update to keep their PCs secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patches were the first for Windows 7's final build, dubbed RTM for "release to manufacturing," that has been in some customers' hands, primarily enterprises with volume licensing agreements, since August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7's patch count, however, was significantly less than either Windows Vista's, its immediate predecessor, or that of Windows XP, the eight-year-old operating system installed on the majority of systems worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis by Computerworld of the massive Oct. 13 security update -- the largest by Microsoft since it started patching on a regular monthly schedule six year ago -- showed that Windows 7 was affected by nine of the 34 vulnerabilities, or 26% of the total. Its count of critical bugs -- the most serious as marked by Microsoft -- was five out of a possible 21, or 24%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Vista, meanwhile, was impacted by 19 of the 34 vulnerabilities, or 56% of the total, with 11 pegged critical, or 52% of the possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows XP was affected by the most vulnerabilities of all: 24 out of 34, or 71% of the total. Of the two-dozen bugs that needed patching in Windows XP, 18 were tagged as critical, or 86% of the total critical count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tallies indicated that, at least this month, Windows 7 was afflicted with about half as many vulnerabilities as was Vista, and about a third as many as was Windows XP. Its critical bug count followed the same pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those flaws that did affect Windows 7 were probably due to recycled code, said security experts. "The Windows 7 vulnerabilities are coming from its legacy code base," said Jason Miller, the security and data team manager for patch management vendor Shavlik Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, none of the vulnerabilities patched last week were Windows 7-only flaws. Of the five security bulletins that affected the new OS, all five also impacted Vista and XP, and all but one had to be patched in the even-older Windows 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of vulnerabilities in old code isn't new. Just months after Vista's launch, security researchers took Microsoft to task for overlooking a vulnerability in Windows' animated cursor in the brand-new operating system, even though was closely linked to a bug Microsoft had patched more than two years before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has promoted Windows 7 as safer and more secure than its predecessor, something it did two three years ago when it touted Vista as better than XP. But everything is relative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Microsoft's top expert on designing software with security in mind -- a process Microsoft calls Security Development Lifecycle, or SDL -- has admitted that it is virtually impossible to catch some kinds of bugs without tedious line-by-line review of the code, something even Microsoft is hard-pressed to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bright side for Microsoft, three of the five critical vulnerabilities assigned to Windows 7 are in Internet Explorer 8 (IE8), the browser that ships with the new OS. The remaining two are in older editions of the .NET Framework and Silverlight, the .NET-based cross-browser, cross-platform media standard Microsoft's pushing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 was also unaffected by the eight vulnerabilities in GDI+ (Graphics Device Interface), which was put at the top of the to-patch list by most experts. Windows XP users had to apply six of the eight GDI+ fixes, while Vista users had to deploy just one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean researchers and hackers won't uncover flaws in Windows 7, perhaps an increasing number as time goes on. "Unless Microsoft can make a brand-new operating system, bad things will continue to happen," said Miller of Shavlik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users already running Windows 7 can update now, but users who upgrade to Windows 7 starting this week will need to run Windows Update to obtain the patches after they've installed the new operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moffat, senior vice president and head of International Business Machines Corp.'s systems and technology group, is being charged with passing on insider information to a hedge fund. He had been working for IBM since 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In view of a U.S. federal investigation into his personal activities, Mr. Moffat has been placed on temporarily leave of absence and is no longer serving as an officer of IBM," said company spokesman Edward Barbini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat is accused of passing on information on IBM itself ahead of the company's quarterly results, as well as those of Sun Microsystems while IBM was looking at its books for a possible acquisition. The FBI said Moffat was one of the IBM executives conducting due diligence on Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also been charged with giving insider information on Advanced Micro Devices Inc, obtained through IBM's business negotiations with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM named Rodney Adkins as acting head of the systems and technology group.

&lt;p&gt;Company Works Directly with Microsoft for Six Months to Ensure Products Maximize
New OS Features Including Multi-Touch Technology
LAKE FOREST, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Getac, a leading innovator and manufacturer of rugged computers that meet the
demands of field-based applications, announced today that its complete line of
rugged notebook computers and tablet PCs are fully compatible with Microsoft's
long-awaited Windows 7 Operating System. Getac engineers spent more than six
months with Microsoft developers to ensure its product line would maximize all
the features, functions, and performance of Windows 7, right out of the box. In
addition, Windows 7 will enhance Getac's newly-introduced Resistive Multi-Touch
technology with an entire library of identified gestures for keyboard-free PC
operation, even with industrial gloves. 

Certified by Microsoft, Getac`s Resistive Multi-Touch technology supports
Windows 7 operating system, by using a series of single touch, dual touch,
"flick," and application gestures so users of Getac products can quickly and
easily perform numerous on-screen tasks such as move, copy, delete, zoom, and
rotate by simply touching the screen and performing the task desired with their
fingers. Unlike commonly used capacitive multi-touch technology, resistive
multi-touch technology can perform these actions, and many others while wearing
protective gloves, making it ideal for industrial and field professionals who
work with dangerous chemicals or perform their job in extreme weather
conditions. Even with gloves, the sensitivity and accuracy of the multi-touch
screen is extremely high. The screen features 2048x2048 resolution, 100 points
per second report rate, and less than 35ms response time. 

"Working closely with Microsoft, we were able to voice the needs of our
customers to ensure that our resistive Multi-touch function works hand-in-hand
with their Windows 7 operating system. We have seen the excitement over the
launch of Windows 7 increase exponentially and are excited to be a part of it
right from the start," said Jim Rimay, President of Getac Inc. "In addition, we
continue to advance our technology with the introduction of the Getac V100, the
industrial`s first rugged laptop with resistive multi-touch panel. We will soon
enable this feature to our full product line." 

To catch the shifting trend to Windows 7 operating systems, Getac rugged
products including 9213, A790, M230, V100, and B300 will be Windows 7 compatible
beginning on the Operating System's availability date of October 22, 2009. 

The new Microsoft operating system Windows 7 incorporates hundreds of
improvements designed to maximize the overall performance of Getac's line of
rugged Notebook PCs and Tablet PCs. It offers easy access to WiFi networks,
reduced battery consumption, faster startup and shutdown times, and a faster and
more responsive 64-bit driver. Numerous features included in Windows 7 will
enhance the overall performance of Getac products. In short, Windows 7 is
responsive, reliable, and runs smoothly, and will allow field workers to work
smarter, faster and more efficiently.

&lt;p&gt;Addresses Shortcomings of User Account Control to Effectively Eliminate Admin
Rights Enterprise-Wide; Advances Privileged Access Lifecycle Management for New
Operating System
AGOURA HILLS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
BeyondTrust, the leading provider of Privileged Access Lifecycle Management
solutions, today announced BeyondTrust Privilege Manager support for Microsoft`s
new Windows 7 operating system. BeyondTrust Privilege Manager will immediately
address the least privilege management shortcomings of Windows 7 to make it even
easier for enterprises to eliminate administrator rights for end-users, and
transparently grant administrative privileges to applications that require them.


"Privilege Manager was easily the smartest thing we implemented last year. It
has enabled us to remove administrator rights from all users across our multiple
offices, virtually eliminate malware on our network and address compliance
requirements," said Ned Cahill, director of IT at Schnabel Engineering. "We plan
to deploy Windows 7 as we purchase new hardware, and it`s reassuring to know
that BeyondTrust will help us secure desktops running the new operating system
and continue to ensure that users will be able to run the applications they need
without administrator rights or UAC prompts." 

Available for general release on October 22, Windows 7 brings little relief for
enterprises seeking to deploy end-users as standard users, i.e., users without
administrator rights. In response to feedback that users were forced to respond
to too many prompts in Windows Vista, the new operating system introduces a new
approach to User Account Control (UAC), providing a four-position "slider"
feature to control how often UAC pop-ups occur. While these changes to Windows
7`s UAC benefit the home user market, enterprises must recognize that the new
slider feature can only be applied to users logged in as administrators and may
increase security risks. Further, Windows 7 introduces no new features to solve
the application compatibility issues experienced by standard users in previous
versions of the operating system. 

"The most secure configuration option for enterprises that deploy Windows 7
remains running end-users as standard users, with administrator rights removed,"
said Eric Voskuil, CTO, BeyondTrust. "However, accomplishing this task will
continue to present challenges to organizations as they deploy Windows 7.
BeyondTrust Privilege Manager will enable these organizations to efficiently and
effectively eliminate administrative rights throughout the enterprise without
impacting the ability of users to perform their jobs." 

Eliminating administrator rights is one of the most effective ways for
enterprises to meet compliance mandates and reduce vulnerability to attacks by
spyware, malware and malicious users. BeyondTrust Privilege Manager will enable
organizations to remove administrator rights in Windows 7 - as well as Windows
2000, XP, Vista, Server 2003, Server 2008 and 64-bit platforms - and allow
end-users to run all approved applications, processes and ActiveX controls. 

Privilege Manager is implemented as a Group Policy extension. Organizations
running Windows 7 can simply specify the privileges necessary for an
application. These privileges will be added to the application process when it
is launched, enabling end-users without administrative privileges to run all
authorized applications. Privilege Manager will reduce support costs and provide
great flexibility for maintaining standardized desktop configurations, such as
those recently specified in the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC)
mandate. 

BeyondTrust Privilege Manager is a key component of BeyondTrust`s suite of
Privileged Access Lifecycle Management (PALM) solutions. BeyondTrust`s PALM
solutions protect sensitive and confidential data from internal and external
threats through management of privilege delegation, user access control, and
privileged passwords. PALM enables organizations to more easily comply with
regulatory requirements by maintaining stricter access control policies and
providing an audit trail of user activity. With BeyondTrust, organizations can
simplify enterprise-wide policy enforcement across even the most complex,
heterogeneous environments in locations around the world. 

Current BeyondTrust Privilege Manager 4.5 users will automatically benefit from
Windows 7 support. All other BeyondTrust Privilege Manager customers may upgrade
as part of their upgrade assurance program. 

About BeyondTrust

Founded in 1985, BeyondTrust is the only provider of Privileged Access Lifecycle
Management (PALM) solutions for heterogeneous IT environments. The BeyondTrust
suite of products reduces the risks associated with insider sabotage and theft
of proprietary data, while documenting accountability to support increasing
demands of regulatory compliance required across many industries. 

PALM is a technology architecture framework consisting of four continual stages
running under a centralized automated platform: access to privileged resources,
control of privileged resources, monitoring of actions taken on privileged
resources, and remediation to revert changes made on privileged IT resources to
a known good state.

on BeyondTrust to secure their enterprises. BeyondTrust customers include eight

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
InDorse Technologies today announced it has received strong global
interest from the reseller community for its award-winning InDorse
SPIDR(TM) for Microsoft SharePoint users. Resellers are excited about
SPIDR's ability to quickly introduce a new value-added service to clients
-- bringing better information management, control of SharePoint
deployments and assisting file migrations. SPIDR helps prevent
information sprawl that increases risk from unstructured information, by
embedding the appropriate security policies into all files, protecting
digital assets and enforcing PCI, GLBA, HIPAA, and other compliance
mandates.

    Recently selected by Network World magazine for its prestigious 11
Security Companies to Watch for 2009 and named Best Product for Content
Filtering by Network Products Guide, the industry's leading publication
on information technologies and solutions, SPIDR has now garnered the
attention of global resellers.

    "As the United Kingdom's Number 1 SharePoint Partner, ICS has used our
experience to bring together the very best of SharePoint products and
applications in the market under one roof. InDorse's SPIDR offers us a
unique value-added SharePoint solution that discovers, tags and protects
all information -- including images and video," said Martin Neale,
managing director at ICS, Basingstoke, England.

    ICS will be showcasing SPIDR at its SharePoint Showcase, November 11th,
9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (GMT), ICS Campus Basingstoke, England. Interested
parties may sign up at:
http://www.ics.net/sharepoint-seminars.aspx?seminar=SS#SS

    InDorse SPIDR(TM) improves Microsoft SharePoint in the following ways:


--  Allows an organization to manage the files through contextually-based
    groups, or classifications, as opposed to applying a single policy by site,
    folder or file, as is the limitation with SharePoint servers;
--  Indexes the document content and metadata to categorize and classify
    the risk.  Then automatically decides and applies the correct access and
    usage policy rights for the user upon requesting files from SharePoint
    libraries;
--  Embeds a digital tag to apply the security policies, (including
    specific rules for determining who can access the files and what they can do
    with it) -- without users having to buy DLP software for end user devices;
--  Provides complete history of the document lifecycle including who has
    used it and which documents spawned which new ones.
    

    
Once files are under SPIDR management, InDorse creates an active and
embedded audit trail for all file handling, while making the information
available via InDorse's context and content-driven tagging system, to
report and monitor such characteristics as:


--  Who downloaded a file;
--  What they downloaded;
--  When the file was downloaded;
--  Where the file came from and what computer it went to;
--  How the file was manipulated, e.g., changed, re-filed to a different
    server under a new name, printed etc.
    

    
Mathew Hutchings, president, Dolomite Enterprises, the local leader
for business computer care and management in the Las Vegas area, said,
"Microsoft SharePoint is one of the best ways for a company to get a
needed application up and running quickly and efficiently -- especially
for collaboration. However, as SharePoint scales up, there are limitations
inherent regarding its capability to implement context-based risk
management as well as identify the type of files, where they exist, who
in the organization has been accessing the files, and exactly when the
files have been viewed and downloaded. We are excited about bringing
InDorse Technologies new offering to help strengthen our customers'
document security."

    Dolomite, a division of MAIS Systems Inc, will be exhibiting the
award-winning SPIDR offering at Santa Fe Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas on
October 21st, 2009. Parties interested in more information or who wish to
attend may contact Dolomite at 1-866-575-3690 or by emailing Dan Stock at

&lt;p&gt;  SAN CARLOS, CA, Oct 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Mark Logic(R) Corporation, a leading provider of software for information
applications, today announced the availability of MarkLogic Toolkit for
PowerPoint(R). This new offering provides customers with a free and
seamless way to integrate Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 with MarkLogic
Server. In addition to MarkLogic Toolkit for Word(R), MarkLogic Toolkit
for Excel(R), and MarkLogic Connector for SharePoint(R) released earlier
this year, MarkLogic Toolkit for PowerPoint expands Mark Logic's support
for Microsoft Office 2007. Organizations can enhance the functionality of
Microsoft Office products and quickly build unique information
applications utilizing the native document format, Office Open XML
(OOXML). To view a guided video demo of Toolkit for PowerPoint, please
visit here.

    "With the release of MarkLogic Toolkit for PowerPoint, our customers can
now take advantage of the powerful storage, search, analysis, and delivery
capabilities of Mark Logic Server from within all their favorite Microsoft
Office applications," said Jas Sandhu, interoperability vendor alliance
manager, Microsoft. "Mark Logic is an example of a trusted Microsoft
partner that is extending the utility of Office products for managing
information and meeting our customers' unique business needs."

    "A big challenge for information intensive organizations is the ability to
find and re-use content created by employees, as content is scattered and
'locked up' inside of various document formats," said Marc Strohlein,
chief agility officer, Outsell, Inc. "By adding PowerPoint presentations
to the mix of content that can be stored in a central repository, and
readily combined with content from spreadsheets and other documents to
create new presentations, Mark Logic's latest Office integration toolkit
is a significant step forward in solving these problems."

    Distributed under an open source model, MarkLogic Toolkit for PowerPoint
empowers organizations to unlock additional value from information stored
in PowerPoint. Toolkit for PowerPoint includes three components: an XQuery
library specifically designed to ingest and manipulate OOXML; an add-in
that allows users to embed information applications directly into
PowerPoint; and a sample application that allows customers to get started
right away. Toolkit for PowerPoint benefits include:


--  Search and Reuse - MarkLogic Toolkit for PowerPoint enables users to
    quickly find existing presentations stored in their repository.  With
    functionality for text and tag search, users can easily insert existing
    slides into new presentations and dynamically assemble content from within
    the PowerPoint interface.

--  Accelerate Application Development - MarkLogic Toolkit for PowerPoint
    makes it possible for organizations to build enterprise-wide presentation
    sharing infrastructures.  Customers can develop custom interfaces using
    standards such as HTML and JavaScript, and leverage sample applications to
    get started immediately.

--  Leverage XML - MarkLogic Toolkit for PowerPoint allows customers to
    run granular searches across text and structure in OOXML, enrich PowerPoint
    presentations with custom tags, and deliver information to multiple
    channels.
    

    
"Ever since Microsoft opened up its document formats using XML,
customers have been looking to enable dynamic delivery of their enterprise
information using SharePoint and Office desktop tools," said Jason
Monberg, vice president of product management, Mark Logic Corporation.
"Whether you work in a highly-regulated industry that must drive
operational documentation or a large consulting firm preparing a response
to an RFP, this new breed of applications will enhance the way users
discover and distribute information."

Final Phase 2 Analyses Presented at the American College of Rheumatology/
Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ACR/ARHP) Annual Scientific
Meeting
PHILADELPHIA--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced today that 24-week data from two clinical studies of the
oral JAK inhibitor, CP-690,550, confirmed statistically significant ACR20
response and DAS28 remission rates for several doses versus placebo when given
alone or in combination with methotrexate for patients with active rheumatoid
arthritis (RA). The findings, which were presented this week at the 2009
ACR/ARHP Annual Scientific Meeting in Philadelphia, represent the final analyses
from two Phase 2 trials evaluating the effect of CP-690,550 over 24 weeks. 

"These data suggest that CP-690,550 could represent a promising advance for
patients with rheumatoid arthritis," said Michael Berelowitz, MD, senior vice
president Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for Pfizer Specialty Care.
"Our Phase 3 program is currently underway with enrollment progressing as
planned, and we are hopeful that data from these trials will validate the Phase
2 results." 

Efficacy as Monotherapy at 24 weeks

Data presented from a six-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2B study
(Study A3921035), which evaluated 384 patients with active RA who had not
responded to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), showed that
patients treated with 5, 10 and 15 mg twice-daily doses of CP-690,550 dosed
without background methotrexate experienced statistically significant ACR
response rates and DAS28 remission rates at week 24 as compared to placebo.
These results were consistent with the previously reported primary analysis of
ACR response at week 12.

 24-Week efficacy results are as follows:

All patients were randomized to either placebo or one of the studied doses of
CP-690,550. This study also included adalimumab (40 mg subcutaneously every
other week) as an active control in the first 12 weeks of the study. 

Efficacy in Combination with Methotrexate at 24 weeks

Data from a second six-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study
(Study A3921025) evaluating 507 patients whose RA was active despite ongoing
treatment with methotrexate demonstrated that patients treated with 3, 10 and 15
mg twice-daily and 20 mg once-daily doses of CP-690,550 in addition to stable
background methotrexate experienced statistically significant ACR response rates
and DAS28 remission rates at week 24 as compared to placebo. These results were
consistent with previously reported primary analysis of ACR response at week
12.

 24 week efficacy results are as follows:

This study evaluated CP-690,550 doses of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 mg twice daily and
20 mg once daily. All patients were maintained on their stable background of
methotrexate and randomized to either addition of placebo or one of the studied
doses of CP-690,550. 

In both studies, the most commonly-reported treatment-emergent adverse events
were urinary tract infections, headache, and diarrhea. Most adverse events were
mild or moderate in severity. Serious adverse events and adverse events leading
to discontinuation were infrequent. Dose-dependent decreases in mean neutrophil
counts and increases in mean LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol were consistent
with what has been observed in previous studies of CP-690,550 in RA. For
patients dosed on background methotrexate, transaminase increases were also
consistent with what had been reported in interim analyses in previous studies
of CP-690,550 in RA. 

All studies were sponsored by Pfizer Inc. 

ORAL Trials: Advancing Clinical Research for RA

The Phase 3 program, which is known as the ORAL (Oral CP-690,550 Rheumatoid
Arthritis Phase 3 TriaLs) Program, consists of six Phase 3 studies at more than
350 locations in 35 countries worldwide (www.ORALtrials.com.) 

About CP-690,550

CP-690,550 is an oral, selective, potent inhibitor of the JAK family of enzymes.
In cell-based assays, CP-690,550 has been shown to inhibit JAK-3 and JAK-1 with
functional selectivity over JAK-2. By inhibiting these enzymes, which affect the
signaling of multiple cytokines (proteins released by cells to communicate with
other cells) that are involved in a broad spectrum of inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases, treatment with CP-690,550 may lead to clinically meaningful
improvement for patients. 

CP-690,550 is also being evaluated as a potential treatment for psoriasis,
Crohn`s disease, ulcerative colitis and solid organ transplant.

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla late Friday blocked the Microsoft-made software that had put Firefox users at risk from attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-part Microsoft component -- an add-on dubbed ".NET Framework Assistant" and a plug-in named "Windows Presentation Foundation" -- have been blocked by Mozilla as a precautionary measure, said Mike Shaver, the company's head of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of the difficulties some users have had entirely removing the add-on, and because of the severity of the risk it represents if not disabled, we contacted Microsoft today to indicate that we were looking to disable the extension and plug-in for all users via our blocklisting mechanism," Shaver said in an announcement posted Friday night to the company's security blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla maintains an add-on/plug-in blocking list that automatically bars risky software from being used by Firefox. The open-source company first used the blocker in 2007. Mozilla has used the tool only nine times, including Friday's blocking of the Microsoft add-on and plug-in. In May 2008, for example, Mozilla added a Vietnamese language pack for Firefox to the blocking list when the pack was found to contain a worm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Shaver, Microsoft gave Mozilla the go-ahead to block the .Net Framework Assistant and the Windows Presentation Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft's security team acknowledged that its software -- which had been silently installed in Firefox as far back as February 2009 -- contained a critical vulnerability that could be used by hackers to hijack Windows PCs. The same vulnerability also affected all versions of Internet Explorer (IE), including the newest version, IE8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft maintained that users who applied the patches it issued last week as part of a record-setting security update would protect Firefox users from attack. However, the MS09-054 bulletin, which provided details on the vulnerability, said nothing about Firefox. Later last Tuesday, Microsoft expanded on MS09-054 in a blog post by security engineers , and confirmed that Firefox was affected because of the add-on and plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla, however, clearly felt that that was not enough, and took the unusual step of blocking the Microsoft add-on and plug-in. Multiple Computerworld staffers have confirmed that Firefox is now blocking the Microsoft software. "These add-ons have a high risk of causing stability or security problems and have been blocked, but a restart is required to disable them completely," the Firefox warning message reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of the .Net Framework Assistant and Windows Presentation Foundation software is tangled and contentious. Firefox users complained last February, and then again in May, when they found out that Microsoft had pushed the components to their browser as part of the .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1) update, which was delivered via Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users were furious that the software was installed without their approval. To add salt to the wound, the components were impossible to uninstall without editing the Windows registry, a chore most users avoid because any misstep could cripple the PC. Later, Microsoft issued a follow-on update that made it possible to uninstall or disable the components without a registry edit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has been aggressively pursuing risky add-ons and plug-ins of late. Last month, it warned Firefox users running outdated versions of Adobe's Flash Player to upgrade, then last week added a more thorough plug-in checking service to its arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next edition of the browser, Firefox 3.6, will warn users when they visit a Web site that relies on one or more outdated plug-ins. A beta of Firefox 3.6 is set to launch Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM is promising a single tool for customers to manage all of their physical and virtual servers, including mainframes, Unix boxes and x86 machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a lofty goal -- and it's not clear when IBM will be able to deliver on it. Big Blue on Tuesday issued a press release about its new VMControl product line, claiming that this software "gives businesses for the first time a single point of control across multiple types of IT systems and virtualization technologies [including] UNIX/Linux, mainframe, x86 and storage systems and networks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a close reading reveals that the enterprise edition of VMControl will initially work only with a limited set of proprietary IBM technology -- namely IBM's Power Systems servers running AIX operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VMControl enterprise edition for Power servers won't be available until December, so it's likely that IBM will not deliver a truly heterogeneous management tool until 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this week's announcement can still be seen as a preview a technology that solves an important problem, says IT analyst Joe Clabby of Clabby Analytics. As businesses embrace virtualization, they are likely to use multiple hypervisors and on different types of platforms, from x86 to the mainframe, he says. This will cause enterprises to create separate infrastructures that don't communicate well with each other, and require different skills to manage, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses need a "manager" for their multiple hypervisors, Clabby says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you kept installing all of these different hypervisor products on your x86 and then a different management scheme on your Power systems and a different one on your mainframe and a different one on your Itanium systems ... you're going to end up with a whole bunch of different stacks," Clabby says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM first unveiled VMControl in July, making the "express" and "standard" versions of the software available for download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The express edition announced in July does work with a wide range of systems, including IBM mainframes and Power servers as well as x86 servers regardless of vendor. The express version lets customers create, delete, edit and relocate virtual machines, but lacks more advanced functionality found in the higher-end versions of VMControl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard edition adds the ability to manage virtual appliances, or specific workloads that are encapsulated within a virtual machine and include the operating system, applications, patching and configuration. VMControl makes this capability available for mainframe and Power servers only. To gain this feature for IBM's x86 servers, customers can buy Tivoli Provisioning Manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enterprise edition of VMControl, the only new version announced this week, adds ""system pool management," which IBM says is important in building private clouds. VMControl Enterprise Edition pricing will start at $2,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VMControl allows combinations of physical and virtual IBM servers to be managed as a single entity," according to IBM's announcement. "This approach -- known as system pooling -- expands the benefits of virtualization by helping corporate data centers simplify complex management functions and better share and prioritize use of critical resources such as processing power, memory and storage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, IBM's pooling system will let customers combine all their servers and treat them as a single resource pool, and dynamically send workloads to the processors best able to handle them, Clabby says. But since the Enterprise edition is only available on Power systems initially, this capability will be limited until IBM expands it to other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this week's announcement, "they're sort of teaching the market what's coming," Clabby says of IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM distinguished engineer Jim Porell said it's not yet clear when the standard and enterprise editions of VMControl will work with non-IBM servers. But he said IBM is committed to reducing the number of management tools customers need to handle their virtual resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look at the whole environment becoming hybrid," he says. "The whole point is to reduce the number of control points in a business, to work effectively across a variety of hypervisor managers and break down the barriers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Business intelligence vendor Teradata Corp. is unfazed by Oracle Corp.'s and IBM Corp.'s recent saber rattling, saying the vendors' respective technologies remain fundamentally unsuited for high-performance analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle announced version 2 of its Exadata data warehousing appliance last month, with CEO Larry Ellison reportedly saying that Oracle is installing the faster, cheaper Sun Microsystems-based appliance "within the Teradata installed base."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darryl McDonald, chief marketing officer for Teradata, which is hosting its annual PARTNERs conference in Washington this week, claimed that Oracle's alleged customer wins have been mostly confined to "uncontested" situations, such as customers running the Oracle database on Hewlett-Packard servers that are being switched or upgraded to the Exadata appliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There hasn't been a whole lot of head-to-head. In the few times we have competed, we've had a very high win rate," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason, McDonald said, is that the Oracle database was built for transaction processing, not analytics. Real application clusters (RACs), intended to enable Oracle database to scale out, remain a Band-aid solution, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oracle tries to throw a lot of hardware and CPUs at the problem, but it's fundamentally still a transactional database," McDonald said, meaning it has "I/O problems and resource contention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM earlier this month announced a data warehousing bundle involving its DB2 database software running on top of its Power servers in conjunction with the new pureScale clustering feature for faster, larger grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever IBM's marketing may say, DB2 still has "very similar" problems as Oracle, McDonald said, due to its heritage in online transaction processing (OLTP). These are problems not faced by Teradata's massively parallel platform (MPP), he said, and evidenced by customers operating data warehouses with more than a petabyte of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald said there are several new members of Teradata's elite club of "Petabyte Power Players," which he declined to name, as well as double the 35 customers with data warehouses in the 100 TB-plus range it had last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the co-opetition between IBM, Oracle and Teradata may be heating up, Teradata isn't worried that it will result in a falling out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many Fortune 500 firms are dependent upon us for mission-critical apps. I don't foresee how Oracle or IBM would not want to continue to certify and port their products onto Teradata," McDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teradata also faces competition from a fleet of startups and smaller companies offering specialized data warehousing appliances, often sporting extremely low prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Koehler, CEO of Teradata since its spinoff in fall 2007 and the senior vice president for the division since 2003 under NCR Corp., said Teradata can match those firms on price-per-terabyte with appliances such as its Extreme Data Appliance 1550, which today sells for about $15,000 per TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he decried the overemphasis on this metric, which he said fails to capture real-world performance problems, such as the number of concurrent users or queries companies can run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teradata opened its annual conference Monday by announcing that it is bringing its data warehousing technology to private corporate clouds as well as public ones, such as Amazon.com Inc.'s EC2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the move, Teradata remains ambivalent about the cloud. Like another on-premises player, Microsoft, which has crafted a " software plus services" strategy, Teradata argues that its move is simply to broaden its offerings, rather than to push customers in a direction they don't want to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it's going to be a number of years before the Fortune 1000 leverage public clouds in a big way," McDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

or 97 cents a share, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it earned 45 cents a share from continuing
operations. It had spun off its homebuilding and finance arm
earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total revenue for the quarter dropped 10 percent to $278.3
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 28 cents a
share, before items, on revenue of $222.8 million, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said costs at its No. 7 mine fell to $62.48 a
ton compared to $94.82 a ton in the prior-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The coal miner said it expects to sell about 1.6 million to
1.7 million tons of metallurgical coal, or coking coal, in the
fourth-quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fourth-quarter coking coal production is expected to range
between 1.4 million and 1.5 million tons, with production costs
expected to average $65 to $70 per ton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company rose 2 percent to $67 in trading
after the bell. They closed at $65.87 Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 20 (Reuters) - Bumper payouts to bankers should
be seen as part of a longer term investment in London's economy,
the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International (GS.N) told a
debate on ethics at St Paul's Cathedral on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Defending lavish bonuses expected at the U.S. investment
bank, Brian Griffiths said he was not "ashamed" of his bank's
compensation package, which has inflamed the bonuses debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The British public should "tolerate the inequality as a way
to achieve greater prosperity for all" Griffiths said at the
public meeting examining what role morality should play in the
marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman last week reignited the row over excessive
compensation after setting aside $5.4 billion (3.3 billion
pounds) for pay in the third quarter alone. It is on course to
pay out $20 billion this year, infuriating critics so soon after
repaying $10 billion in taxpayer bailout funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Griffiths said that if bonuses were capped the industry's
highest fliers would leave London's financial services sector
for other countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I believe that we should be thinking about the medium term
common good, not the short term common good... we should not,
therefore, be ashamed of offering compensation in an
internationally competitive market which ensures the bank
businesses here and employs British people," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said Goldman only rewarded those who showed a
commitment to company values and not simply to whoever brings in
the most profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The comments by Griffiths follow Credit Suisse's (CSGN.VX)
announcement on Tuesday that it would make executives wait three
to four years for their bonuses, as a way of limiting excessive
risk taking. [ID:nN20433456]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also at the St Paul's debate, the chair of Britain's
financial regulator said such new policies do not necessarily
guarantee protection against risky behaviour, if banks believe
their own "propaganda".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This will make some difference, but I don't think we should
imagine this [restriction of bonuses] a magic panacea or silver
bullet," said Financial Services Authority Chairman Adair
Turner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you have irrational exuberance, even people who are
paid in a deferred fashion with clawback believe their own
propaganda," Turner said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If people believe their own propaganda they will believe
that that future deferred equity is there -- even if it isn't at
the moment. So -- yes we can make some difference -- but we have
no panacea in this regulation approach," Turner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month leading G20 countries agreed compensation
reforms, including subjecting awards to clawback and deferral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays (BARC.L) and HSBC (HSBA.L) are due to give trading
updates next month, although decisions on bonuses will not be
made until full-year results in February and early March.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

U.S. Bank Failures Reach 99 in `09

The failure of San Joaquin Bank represents another impact on the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation`s (FDIC) fund for protecting customer accounts as it has
been appointed receiver for the bank. The bank failure is expected to cost the
deposit insurance fund an estimated $103 million. 

The FDIC insures deposits at 8,195 institutions with roughly $13.5 trillion in
assets. When a bank fails, it reimburses customers for deposits of up to
$250,000 per account. The outbreak of financial institution failures has
significantly stretched the regulator`s deposit insurance fund. At June 30,
2009, the fund corpus fell to $10.4 billion, the lowest since 1993, from $13.0
billion in the prior quarter. 

Ontario, California-based Citizens Business Bank, a subsidiary of CVB Financial
(Nasdaq: CVBF), will assume all of the deposits of San Joaquin Bank. So there
will be no losses to any depositor. 

In order to replenish the declining fund, the FDIC board recently proposed that
the U.S. banks should pay fees for three years in advance. Also, the regulators
are considering requesting the healthy banks to bail out the government as soon
as it is necessary to replenish the deposit insurance fund, which has slipped to
0.22% of insured deposits, below the mandated minimum of 1.15%. 

In the second quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 416 from 305 in the first quarter. This is the highest
since the savings and loan crisis in 1994. Increasing loan losses on commercial
real estate are expected to cause hundreds more bank failures in the next few
years. The FDIC anticipates the bank failures to cost about $70 billion over the
next five years. 

The failure of Washington Mutual last year was the largest in the U.S. history.
It was acquired by JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major acquirers of
failed institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB), U.S.
Bancorp (NYSE: USB), Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq: ZION) and several others.

&lt;p&gt;  TAMPA, FL, Oct 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT), a leading U.S. producer and exporter of
premium hard coking coal for the global steel industry, today reported
income from continuing operations of $24.4 million, or $0.45 per diluted
share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2009, compared to $71.3 million,
or $1.26 per diluted share in the third quarter 2008. Results are up
significantly versus second quarter 2009, when income from continuing
operations was $11.3 million.

    "Our third quarter performance illustrates the strong demand for our high
quality coking coal," said Company Chief Executive Officer Victor P.
Patrick. "We continue to see improving market conditions for our product
and we are on track to achieve sales of approximately 3.5 million tons in
the second half. This performance supports our plan to produce and sell
approximately 8 million tons in 2010, with the startup of the Mine No. 7
East longwall in early January 2010."

    Third Quarter 2009 Financial &amp; Operating Results from Continuing
Operations

    Net sales and revenues for the third quarter 2009 totaled $278.3 million,
compared to $308.8 million in the prior-year period. Operating income
totaled $42.4 million for the quarter, down $67.2 million versus the
prior-year period. Both revenues and operating income were lower, driven
by significantly lower coke sales as well as lower realized prices for
coking coal compared to the previous year's all-time highs.

    Net sales and revenues and operating income were up $109.2 million and
$20.9 million, respectively, versus the second quarter 2009. The
sequential improvements were driven by strong customer demand resulting
in 0.8 million tons of additional coking coal sales in the current
period, facilitated by improvements in loading rates at the Port of
Mobile. In addition, volumes included approximately 79,000 tons of
carryover tonnage from the prior contract year priced in excess of $315
per metric ton.

    Underground Mining

    Coking coal sales volumes were 1.9 million tons in the third quarter, a
record for quarterly sales volumes, at an average selling price of $121.66
per short ton FOB Port, versus 1.4 million tons at an average price of
$161.92 in the prior-year period. On a year-to-date basis, coking coal
sales volumes totaled 4.7 million tons, up slightly versus the first nine
months of 2008, despite declines in global steel production.

    Total coking coal production in the quarter was 1.5 million tons versus
1.2 million tons in the prior-year period. Coking coal production at Mine
No. 4 totaled 0.7 million tons in the third quarter, slightly lower than
in the prior year. Mine No. 7 produced 0.8 million tons in the third
quarter, 0.3 million tons more than in the third quarter last year. This
is the result of improved longwall performance at the No. 7 Mine in the
current-year period, as well as lower volumes in the prior-year period
due to a longwall move at that mine.

    Average mine production costs for the period were $60.60 per ton. At No.
4, production costs were $58.27 per ton, an increase of $7.41 per ton
over the prior year, as a result of lower volumes, along with higher
labor and depreciation costs. Production costs at No. 7 were $62.48 per
ton compared to $94.82 per ton in the prior-year period, a result of the
increase in production volume, partially offset by higher labor and
depreciation costs.

    The natural gas business sold 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas, slightly less
than in the prior year, at an average price of $3.29 per thousand cubic
feet in the third quarter 2009 compared to an average price of $8.69 per
thousand cubic feet in the prior-year period.

    Surface Mining

    The surface mining segment reported net sales and revenues of $25.2
million in the third quarter 2009, compared to $18.9 million in the
prior-year period, driven primarily by a 28.8 percent increase in average
selling prices for steam and industrial coal in the current period. Sales
volumes were also higher in the current period primarily resulting from
the acquisition of Taft Coal Sales &amp; Associates, Inc. ("Taft") in
September 2008. Operating income in the third quarter 2009 was $6.8
million, compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter 2008, primarily
driven by the higher average contract prices for steam and industrial
coal and higher sales volumes.

    Steam and industrial coal sales were 302,000 tons during the third quarter
compared to sales of 283,000 tons in the prior-year period. Production
totaled 359,000 tons in the third quarter versus prior-year production of
268,000 tons, primarily from the inclusion of a full quarter of Taft's
production in the current period compared to only one month in the prior
year.

    Walter Coke

    Walter Coke generated net sales and revenues of $23.3 million in the third
quarter 2009, compared to $53.7 million in the prior-year period. Walter
Coke returned to near break-even in the third quarter 2009 on
strengthening demand for metallurgical coke.

    Third quarter 2009 metallurgical coke sales were 38,478 tons at an average
price of $361.95 per ton. In the prior year, Walter Coke sold 101,077 tons
at $397.20 per ton. Declines in revenue and operating income in the
current period reflect lower shipments resulting from lower domestic
steel capacity utilization versus the prior year.

    Corporate and Other

    Interest expense totaled $4.8 million in the quarter, down $0.7 million
versus the prior-year period. Interest expense in the quarter was lower
due to the Company's repayment of its revolving credit facility balance
earlier this year and lower interest rates on outstanding debt.

    At Sept. 30, 2009, the Company had available liquidity of $322.9 million,
including cash of $87.8 million and $235.1 million available under its
credit facility. Total net debt outstanding at Sept. 30, 2009 was $95.0
million compared to $147.2 million at June 30, 2009.

    Business Outlook

    Walter Energy's business outlook for the remainder of 2009 includes
the
following:


Coking Coal Sales(1)                     Q3-2009 A       Q4-2009 E
-------------------                      ---------       ---------

Average Operating Margin(2) Per Ton      $23.91          $27 - $33

Steam &amp; Industrial Coal Sales(3)         Q3-2009 A       Q4-2009 E
-------------------------------          ---------       ---------
Tons Sold (short tons)                   302,000         300,000 - 330,000
Average Operating Margin(2) Per Ton      $17.38          $12 - $17

Coke Sales                               Q3-2009 A       Q4-2009 E
----------                               ---------       ---------
Tons Sold                                38,478          78,000 - 86,000
Average Operating Margin (Loss)(2)
 Per Ton                                 $(5.71)         $19 - $24

Quarter-to-quarter variability in timing, availability and pricing of
shipments may result in significant shifts in income between quarters.

(1) Includes the underground mining operation at Jim Walter Resources;
    excludes the coal bed methane operation
(2) Operating margin is defined as operating income (Earnings Before
    Interest &amp; Taxes) from each business shown
(3) Includes the surface mining operations; excludes income from
    royalties and miscellaneous land sales reported in the surface mining
    segment

    
The Company expects to ship 126,000 tons of hard coking coal at
2008-2009 carryover pricing of approximately $315 per metric ton in the
fourth quarter 2009.

    Coking coal production is expected to be between 1.4 and 1.5 million tons
in the fourth quarter, with production costs expected to average between
$65 and $70 per ton.

    "We expect continued improvement in market conditions for the remainder of
2009," said Patrick. "Moving into 2010, we are seeing increasing demand
for premium mid- and low-vol coals from our key product destinations, as
well as Asia, with port constraints in Australia continuing to make
high-quality coking coals a scarce resource."

    The Company recently finalized its long-range mining plan and expects to
produce approximately 8.0 million tons of premium hard coking coal in
2010, highlighted by incremental production from the Company's Mine No. 7
East expansion. The Company added that it expects to increase coking coal
production capacity to between 8.5 and 9.0 million tons in 2011 and
between 9.0 and 9.5 million tons in 2012.

    Walter Coke is expecting improved sales and a return to profitability in
the fourth quarter 2009, driven primarily by increased orders from the
domestic steel industry.

    Capital expenditures were $14.9 million in the third quarter, totaling
$67.3 million for the year. The Company expects full-year capital
expenditures of approximately $85 million.

in reportable segments from Natural Resources to Underground Mining and
Surface Mining and to exclude Kodiak, which is reported as discontinued
operations. Underground Mining includes the Company's deep underground
metallurgical coal operations from the No. 4 and No. 7 mines, and its
natural gas operations.  Surface Mining includes the operations of
Tuscaloosa Resources, Inc., Taft Coal Sales &amp; Associates and Walter

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
The shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) have attracted some heavy options
trading this afternoon following the firm's lackluster earnings report. While
the firm benefited from strong sales in countries such as China and India,
third-quarter earnings were flat and revenue declined as the beverage giant
continued to be hurt by fluctuations in global currencies. For the third
quarter, the company's profit was flat from a year earlier at $1.89 billion, or
81 cents a share, while sales dropped 4% to $8.04 billion. Analysts had
predicted a profit of 81 cents per share on revenue of $8.11 billion. 

In the options pits this afternoon, the security has seen brisk trading on both
the call and the put sides. The November 52.50 put has been the most active,
with more than 6,800 contracts changing hands on open interest of 7,926
contracts. At 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, five large blocks totaling 1,500
contracts changed hands at an ask price of $0.75, indicating that they were
purchased, at a total cost of $112,500. The blocks were marked "spread," leading
me to believe that there was another half to this trade.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) reported higher third-quarter profit as aggressive cost-cutting offset a negative foreign exchange impact and declining sales of drugs, including those facing competition from cheaper generics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite slow growth of some newer drugs and declines for many of its established medicines, sales were still better-than-expected and lower costs and job cuts allowed Pfizer to top Wall Street estimates for the quarter, sending its shares up as much as 2.4 percent before paring gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest drugmaker, which got much bigger last week with completion of a $67.3 billion acquisition of Wyeth, posted a net profit of $2.88 billion, or 43 cents per share in its last pre-merger quarter, compared with a profit of $2.28 billion, or 34 cents per share, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, Pfizer earned 51 cents per share, exceeding analysts' average expectations by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales declined 3 percent to $11.6 billion, but that also topped analysts' estimates of $11.41 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The quarter was very good," said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan. "Revenues were higher than expected. They beat the earnings number by 3 cents despite a 31.8 percent tax rate, which reflects the repatriation of cash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's bought Wyeth to help soften the 2011 blow from the loss of U.S. patent protection on the cholesterol drug Lipitor -- the world's biggest-selling prescription medicine -- by adding Wyeth's lucrative vaccines and biologic medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor's worldwide sales for the third quarter declined 9 percent to $2.9 billion. They were down 12 percent in the United States, amid competition from cheap generic versions of rival cholesterol-lowering drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer updated its full year forecast to include Wyeth sales and operations following the October 15 closing of the acquisition -- its third mega-deal in the last nine years after swallowing up Warner-Lambert in 2000 and Pharmacia in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company now expects revenue of $49 billion to $50 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.00 to $2.05 per share, up from its pre-Wyeth view of $1.30 to $1.45 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think people are optimistic about the opportunities for earnings and cash flow over the next couple of years primarily as a function of the Wyeth acquisition," Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler told analysts on a conference call that the Wyeth integration process began immediately and that the company will move quickly both with further job cuts and to retain top Wyeth talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the integration process, the company said it intends to announce decisions on research and development sites in the next 30 to 60 days and on manufacturing plant strategy in the next three to six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wyeth has done a very nice job of positioning themselves very well for where opportunities in the industry will be, not just for where the opportunities are," Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amilio said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said its results were helped by a reduction in workforce of about 1,100 jobs in the quarter and 6,500 since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6,500 job cuts were part of a 15 percent total workforce reduction Pfizer is planning, D'Amilio said, adding that he expects the process to be completed by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of the timing is driven by local country laws. In countries where we can go fast, we will go fast because we don't want a lot of uncertainty," D'Amilio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted research and development costs declined 8 percent to $1.6 billion, while adjusted selling, informational and administration expenses were down 6 percent to $3.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall it was a decent quarter, driven by cost cutting," Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue was hurt by about 5 percent due to foreign currency exchange rates, partly related to the strength of the dollar a year ago. That was somewhat offset by a 2 percent increase due to an adjustment in the year-ago quarter for product returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent interview Pfizer identified the cancer drug Sutent, the pain medicine Lyrica and the smoking cessation drug Chantix as important future growth drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lyrica sales were only up 5 percent to $708 million, while Sutent sales grew 9 percent to $246 million. Chantix, which has been beset by reports of psychiatric problems, fell 15 percent to $155 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its flagship Lipitor, other older medicines were also in decline with the blood pressure drug Norvasc down 13 percent to $488 million, the pain drug Celebrex down 4 percent to $602 million and erectile dysfunction treatment Viagra off 8 percent to $466 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, Ryan noted, "It was unbelievable how close everything came in relative to what people expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares were up 2 cents at $18.00 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, well off an earlier high of $18.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Derek Caney, Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

earnings and cash flow over the next couple of years primarily
as a function of the Wyeth acquisition," Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler told analysts on a conference call
that the Wyeth integration process began immediately and that
the company will move quickly both with further job cuts and to
retain top Wyeth talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the integration process, the company said it
intends to announce decisions on research and development sites
in the next 30 to 60 days and on manufacturing plant strategy
in the next three to six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Wyeth has done a very nice job of positioning themselves
very well for where opportunities in the industry will be, not
just for where the opportunities are," Chief Financial Officer
Frank D'Amilio said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said its results were helped by a reduction in
workforce of about 1,100 jobs in the quarter and 6,500 since
the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 6,500 job cuts were part of a 15 percent total
workforce reduction Pfizer is planning, D'Amilio said, adding
that he expects the process to be completed by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Part of the timing is driven by local country laws. In
countries where we can go fast, we will go fast because we
don't want a lot of uncertainty," D'Amilio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adjusted research and development costs declined 8 percent
to $1.6 billion, while adjusted selling, informational and
administration expenses were down 6 percent to $3.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Overall it was a decent quarter, driven by cost cutting,"
Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue was hurt by about 5 percent due to foreign currency
exchange rates, partly related to the strength of the dollar a
year ago. That was somewhat offset by a 2 percent increase due
to an adjustment in the year-ago quarter for product returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a recent interview Pfizer identified the cancer drug
Sutent, the pain medicine Lyrica and the smoking cessation drug
Chantix as important future growth drivers.[nN16351246]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Lyrica sales were only up 5 percent to $708 million,
while Sutent sales grew 9 percent to $246 million. Chantix,
which has been beset by reports of psychiatric problems, fell
15 percent to $155 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to its flagship Lipitor, other older medicines
were also in decline with the blood pressure drug Norvasc down
13 percent to $488 million, the pain drug Celebrex down 4
percent to $602 million and erectile dysfunction treatment
Viagra off 8 percent to $466 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, Ryan noted, "It was unbelievable how close
everything came in relative to what people expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares were up 2 cents at $18.00 in afternoon trade on the
New York Stock Exchange, well off an earlier high of $18.42.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar, and said a weak economy would keep consumers under pressure next year, sending shares down 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest soft drink maker echoed comments made earlier this month by rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), which also posted disappointing revenue and cautioned that it did not expect a major revival of spending in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect the consumer to continue facing economic uncertainties into 2010 and for consumer sentiment to recover slowly," Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said. He added, however, that the company remains on track to achieve its long-term growth expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's net income was $1.90 billion, or 81 cents per share, in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding a charge, Coca-Cola earned 82 cents per share. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting 81 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net operating revenue fell 4 percent to $8.04 billion, hurt by a 6 percentage point hit from the stronger U.S. dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales. That missed analysts' average estimate of $8.11 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall sales by volume rose 2 percent, after rising 4 percent in the second quarter and 2 percent in the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's growth in developing markets like India and China -- where quarterly volume soared 37 percent and 15 percent, respectively -- is helping it weather a slowdown in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter volume rose 7 percent in Latin America, 6 percent in the Pacific region and 2 percent in the company's Eurasia and Africa segment. Volume fell 2 percent in Europe and 4 percent in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North American decline, driven by a 5 percent drop in carbonated drinks, was steeper than Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that the decline was the steepest North America has seen in three years, Swartzberg said it was likely the cause for the 2.7 percent drop in shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N), the largest U.S. bottler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke blamed the shift of July 4th holiday sales from the third quarter last year to the second quarter this year, price competition, especially for sports drinks, and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toon Van Beeck, senior industry analyst with research firm IBISWorld, said consumers have been trading down to private label drinks in some categories to try to save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall volume of carbonated drinks, such as Coca-Cola and Sprite, rose 1 percent in the quarter, while noncarbonated drinks, such as vitaminwater and Dasani water, rose 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPETITION HEATS UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's rivalry with PepsiCo took a new turn this summer when the No. 2 soft drink maker said it would acquire its two largest bottlers in a $7.8 billion deal that led analysts to wonder if Coke might eventually have to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo also announced a procurement deal with brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) that allows the beverage makers to save money by buying certain goods and services together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Kent told reporters on Tuesday he was "all open and for cooperation" with other companies on back-office functions like information systems, warehousing and freight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding Mexico's FEMSA (FMSAUBD.MX), the brewer of Dos Equis beer and a bottler of Coke drinks which is in talks to sell its beer business, Kent said he would support whatever decision the company makes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the family which owns the beer business feels that it is time for them to become part of a bigger system, and it's good for them, then it's good for us," Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's a pure beer play," Kent added, implying that the bottling business, Coca-Cola Femsa (KOFL.MX), would not be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala praised Coke for recently resuming its share buyback plan, strong performance in emerging markets and improving relationship with its largest bottler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That said, we prefer PepsiCo shares, which are currently trading at a 2 multiple point discount versus Coca-Cola," Gajrawala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares fell 89 cents to $53.90.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/072e38/the_blurring_bound) has
announced the addition of the "The Blurring Boundaries between Smartphones and
Feature Phones" report to their offering. 

In terms of product definition, the largest difference between Smartphones and
feature phones is that the former features an embedded open OS while the latter
does not. Based on these industry-wide definitions, in the past there were
significant differences between the two product types in specifications and
market segmentation. However, since early 2009, following the increasing number
of companies investing in these products and the growing intensity of market
competition, the diversification of products has led to a trend whereby
consumers' perception of boundaries between Smartphones and feature phones is
becoming more blurred. This report analyzes this trend from the perspectives of
prices, software applications and vendors' product strategies, and examines the
impact of this trend on the overall mobile phone industry. 

List of Topics

* Traditional distinction between Smartphones and feature phones in the mobile
phone industry 
* Blurring boundaries between Smartphones and feature phones from three
different perspectives: prices, software applications and vendors' product
strategies 
* Price analysis includes overall price developments of Smartphones and feature
phones in 2008 and 2009 and detailed price trends within these respective
product segments 
* Software application analysis includes Qualcomm's BREW MP and Microsoft's
OneApp, as well as worldwide Smartphone OS market share in the period 2007-2009 
* Product strategy analysis include Nokia, Samsung, and LG

Adobe, Apple, Dell, Foxconn, Google, HTC, Lenovo, LG, Mediatek, Microsoft,

&lt;p&gt; * Two companies to put up $500 million each in new fund&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * May invest in state-backed distressed assets &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * To invest in consumer products, manufacturing, services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Recasts, adds quotes from source, detail)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By John Bowker and Olga Popova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOSCOW, Oct 20 (Reuters) - One of Russia's richest men and
U.S. bank JP Morgan (JPM.N) are creating a $1 billion fund to
invest in Russian companies and may attempt to take distressed
assets off the hands of state banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Billionaire Vladimir Potanin's Interros group -- a 25
percent stakeholder in mining group Norilsk Nickel (GMKN.MM) --
and JP Morgan fund One Equity Partners said in a joint statement
on Tuesday they would put $500 million each into the venture --
the first significant Russia-focused fund since the start of the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies said the fund would invest in the consumer
goods, manufacturing and services sectors, but a source close to
Interros said it would avoid the country's flagship industries
of mining and oil  gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source added that the fund may try to bring some state
controlled firms back into private ownership, with debt
financing on the agenda as well as growth capital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The talk is ... about a possibility to lift part of the
company credit burden from the state banks' shoulders ... There
is an agreement that JP Morgan bank will help us secure debt
financing," the source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Interros source added that $300 million would be about
the maximum spent on a single transaction, and that some
projects were already in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EXCITING TIME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment plan comes after a stock market rally in
which the MICEX index  has soared from around the 550
points level in January to nearly 1,370 as investors bet the
worst of the financial crisis is behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is an exciting time to invest in Russia alongside an
experienced ... partner," said Michael Gregory O'Hara, a senior
partner at One Equity Partners, adding the fund would provide
growth capital and equity as well as debt relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian equity funds have seen returns of 100 percent in the
year-to-date, according to data from Thomson Reuters fund
research firm Lipper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sulev Raik, a fund manager at SEB Russia based in Estonia,
said Russia would continue to be an attractive market for
investors as long as it remained part of a diversified
portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even after the huge rally, Russia looks fundamentally still
OK. It is still a very good market for stock pickers," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Potanin said last month his Interros group would invest $2
billion in projects related to the 2014 Winter Olympics in the
Black Sea resort town of Sochi.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will launch the public beta of Office 2010 next month, company CEO Steve Ballmer said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a keynote that kicked off Microsoft's SharePoint Conference 2009 in Las Vegas, Ballmer announced that the public beta of Office 2010 will be made available in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pressed for details, a Microsoft spokeswoman said the company did not have a specific timeline beyond Ballmer's pinning the beta to next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, Microsoft has offered a preview of its next desktop suite only to a relatively small group of testers. It has also opened the online edition , Office Web Apps, to a similar preview. Office Web Apps includes lightweight versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint and will be made available to millions free of charge in the first half of next year, the only timetable Microsoft has set for Office 2010's ship date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone will be eligible to test drive the Office 2010 beta, said Microsoft today. However, the company declined to answer questions about whether the number of copies of the beta will be limited -- as it tried to do with the Windows 7 beta earlier this year -- or be available only for a limited time, as was the Windows 7 release candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last summer, Microsoft said that it expected to distribute millions of copies of the Office 2010 public beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Microsoft said that it would not offer users the chance to test Office 2010, as it had done with other editions, including Office 2007. The company quickly backtracked , saying that it had simply given "the wrong impression" about its plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also unknown is whether Microsoft will charge users to download the beta, a tactic it used with the second beta of Office 2007, when it let customers try out the suite from within their browsers for free, but charged them $1.50 to download the preview. The latter move, Microsoft said in July 2006, was because "the beta 2 downloads have exceeded our goals," prompting it to "implement a cost-recovery measure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may use a new technology, called Click-To-Run, that debuted in July with the Technical Preview, to deliver the beta of Office 2010. Click-To-Run "streams" pieces of the suite to users who begin a download, letting them start using the suite within minutes. While users work with the suite, the remainder of the code is downloaded in the background. Two weeks ago, Microsoft said it would use Click-To-Run to offer a limited-time trial of Office 2010 when the final bits ship next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will also offer an advertising-supported version of Office 2010 to computer makers, who will install it on their new PCs as an alternative to the retired Microsoft Works. Dubbed Office Starter 2010, it will include scaled-back editions of Word 2010 and Excel 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An after-market "key," purchased either on a card at electronics retailers or online from Microsoft, will unlock the appropriate for-a-fee version, so that no additional software need be downloaded. Customers will be able to upgrade from Starter to Office 2010 Home  Student, Home  Business or Professional. Microsoft has not yet announced prices for Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer made the Office 2010 beta announcement at the same time he revealed some of the features of the upcoming enterprise SharePoint 2010 software. He said that a public beta of SharePoint 2010 would also be available to the public next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
SplendidCRM Software, Inc., a pioneering provider of Microsoft-centric Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) solutions for open-source use, has entered the
cloud with its release of SplendidCRM 4.0 Community Edition. This release has
been specifically updated to run in Microsoft's Windows Azure Platform
(http://www.microsoft.com/azure/). SplendidCRM can be installed to run just the
database in SQL Azure, with the web application running locally, or to run the
database in SQL Azure and the web application in Windows Azure. With this new
capability our customers will be able to minimize the cost while maximizing the
reliability of their customer data. A live Azure demo is available at
http://splendidcrm.cloudapp.net. 

SplendidCRM continues to evolve with the incorporation of the Silverlight 3
Toolkit to replace the previous flash-based and hand-made charts. "We continue
to pioneer the use of XAML-only graphics as a means to promote rapid application
development", noted Paul Rony, President and Founder of SplendidCRM.
"Implementation of a dashlets model will allow each user to customize their home
page experience with the new Silverlight charts." 

"In addition, the SplendidCRM query engine has been optimized to handle millions
of records using our custom paging system. This custom paging also allows
SplendidCRM to be very bandwidth efficient, which is especially important in the
SQL Azure environment because of the bandwidth related charges." 

"Responding to customer requests, we also added the ability to search for
duplicate records and to easily merge those duplicates into a single record."
SplendidCRM has been tested on all the variations of Windows 7, Windows Server
2008 R2, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows XP.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
GDF SUEZ Energy Resources NA, the retail energy business of GDF SUEZ Energy
North America and the largest electricity provider for Coca-Cola Enterprises
(CCE), will be a Gold Level sponsor of the C5 Coca-Cola Golf Classic at the East
Lake Golf Club in Atlanta on October 25-26. The event will benefit the C5 Youth
Foundation, a leadership development program for high-potential young people
living in risk-filled environments. 

"We are grateful for the support of GDF SUEZ, both as a supplier and as a
supporter of the C5 Youth Foundation," said Jeff Cohen, Executive Director, C5
Youth Foundation of Georgia. "The C5 Coca-Cola Golf Classic will help 1,300
teens from eighth to twelfth grades achieve their full potential, for the
betterment of themselves, their families, and their communities, and we value
GDF SUEZ`s role in making this event a success."

high-potential teens from risk-filled environments. C5 inspires young people to
be character-driven, community-focused, challenge-ready, college-bound, and
committed to a better future. While the C5`s concept and model was developed by
the Coca-Cola system, the C5 Youth Foundation programs are now independently
incorporated 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. Since the first C5 Coca-Cola
Golf Classic in 2006, the event has generated nearly $900,000 for C5 programs
across the country. GDF SUEZ Energy Resources also was a sponsor of the C5
Coca-Cola Golf Classic in McKinney, Texas, in August. 

"GDF SUEZ supports a number of programs that benefit children and teens
throughout the country, so sponsorship of the C5 Coca-Cola Golf Classic is a
perfect fit for us," said Bob Wilson, president and CEO, GDF SUEZ Energy
Resources. "As a company, we continuously seek out ways to connect with our
customers on multiple levels, and sponsoring events like this one allows us to
support Coca-Cola Enterprises in its charitable endeavors."

of Coca-Cola products, selling approximately 80 percent of The Coca-Cola
Company`s bottle and can volume in North America. CCE is the sole licensed

&lt;p&gt;FREEPORT, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
The Honorable Judge W. Howard LaPorte, Walton County Circuit Court Judge, has
denied a request by Walton County to throw out Jolly Bay LLC`s lawsuit seeking
millions of dollars in monetary damages and attorneys` fees for violation of its
constitutional rights in connection with the Board of County Commissioners'
denial of its project in September 2008. The Board denied the project based on
an un-adopted standard made up by Walton County after receiving public
opposition to the project. The County had argued that, as a matter of law, Jolly
Bay was precluded from asserting federal due process and takings claims against
the county. The denial of the county`s motion allows the lawsuit to move
forward. If successful, the county, and its taxpayers, will have to pay Jolly
Bay`s damages and attorneys` fees, which are well in excess of the county`s $1
million in insurance coverage. 

This key decision against Walton County comes on the heels of the First District
Court of Appeal in Tallahassee, Florida, deciding to hear Jolly Bay`s appeal of
the Circuit Court`s denial of another lawsuit that was filed to reverse the
Board of County Commissioners' denial of the project. Oral argument is scheduled
before a three-judge panel on November 17, 2009. 

Jolly Bay`s property is located &#189; mile from the northeast 331 bridge landing off
Jolly Bay Road. The proposed project included an upscale recreational vehicle
park, a bed &amp; breakfast, a 73-unit condominium, a boat docking facility and
commercial spaces. Setting this project apart from other local projects, the
plans had the project situated on 17 acres of a 60-acre tract of land in order
to preserve 43 acres of natural beauty, and to ensure the integrity of, and
compatibility with the surrounding area. 

"Jolly Bay worked closely with the planning department staff over a two-year
period to design the project to meet all Walton County Comprehensive Plan and
Land Development Code requirements before submitting its application. The plan
met all requirements and received a unanimous vote in favor by the Planning
Commission, only to have Commissioner Scott Brannon make a surprise motion to
deny the project after a motion to approve and a second and substantial
discussion on the conditions of approval," stated Ronald Weaver of Stearns
Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff &amp; Sitterson, P.A., attorneys specializing in
land use litigation and Bert Harris claims. 

Weaver explained, "This is not the first time that Walton County has been sued
for making up the rules as it goes along and applying un-adopted standards." In
the 2001 Inlet Beach Capital case, the Circuit Court reversed the Walton County
Board of County Commissioners' denial of a project and told Walton County that
it cannot base the denial of projects on its own un-adopted subjective
interpretations of its land use regulations because landowners must have notice
of the conditions that they must meet in order to improve their property. "This
time, however, in light of the court`s denial of the county`s motion to dismiss
the federal due process and takings claims, the county`s actions in repeating
the same error and applying un-adopted standards may cost the taxpayers millions
of dollars. Federal protections are available where, as in this case, the local
government crosses the line - especially a line that it has been previously
warned about," Weaver added.

&lt;p&gt;New Service Provides Monitoring and Management for Office Communications Server;
Azaleos Launches Free Educational Seminar Series on OCS
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Azaleos&#174; Corporation, the managed messaging and collaboration services company,
today announced that it has expanded its market leading managed services for
Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint with a new offering that covers Microsoft
Office Communications Server (OCS). This new service rounds out Azaleos`
offerings for the entire Microsoft Unified Communications application server
stack. The new OCS service from Azaleos provides 24X7X365 real-time management
for customers that want to or have deployed Microsoft`s all-in-one platform for
instant messaging (IM), internet voice calling (VoIP), and web/video
conferencing. In order to accelerate the transition to unified communications
and maximize the payback provided by OCS, Azaleos is offering migration services
to help organizations plan and set-up OCS. 

To improve employee productivity and efficiency, OCS enables organizations to
integrate their voice and data networks, and key communication and collaboration
technologies (IM/presence, voice calling, and web/video conferencing). However,
the complexity created by interconnecting these technologies and the expertise
required to manage them may exceed the in-house capabilities of most
organizations. Furthermore, since all of these critical infrastructure services
are handled by OCS, service quality degradation and/or downtime can potentially
cut-off a company from the outside world. The Azaleos managed service for OCS
provides round the clock monitoring and management of all the elements within
OCS by experts in two network operations centers (NOC), who can diagnose and
troubleshoot problems before they can impact end-users. 

"Unified communications, and specifically Office Communications Server, are very
appealing to organizations of all sizes for their ability to streamline business
processes. Unfortunately, there`s a lot of confusion among enterprises about how
to define unified communications, how to use it, and where to start with respect
to strategic IT planning," said Michael Osterman, Principal of Osterman
Research. "Our research shows that enterprises spend an average of $73 per user
per month managing unified communications systems. A comprehensive monitoring
and management service, like the new Azaleos offering, can add significant value
by reducing the costs and internal IT resources needed to deploy and keep Office
Communications Server running smoothly." 

Worry Free Management for the Entire OCS Stack

To help companies take advantage of the business productivity boosting
capabilities of OCS, the Azaleos managed OCS service provides monitoring and
management of the IM/presence, web and video conferencing, and intra-enterprise
VoIP functions within Microsoft`s real-time unified communications platform.
Management for Exchange e-mail is available as a separately billed service.
Azaleos experts in its East and West NOCs continuously monitor over 1,500 data
points per minute focusing on both the availability and service quality of the
above mentioned OCS services to detect, diagnose, and repair problems before
customers even know they exist. 

In addition to its patented ViewX monitoring technology, Azaleos has developed
some key new innovations for its OCS service designed to deliver a static-free
UC experience for end-users. These include:

* Expanded SQL Server monitoring capabilities that enhance storage performance
for OCS, as well as complementary Azaleos managed services for BlackBerry
Enterprise Server and SharePoint
* Azaleos F5 Local Traffic Manager (LTM) monitoring, which provides full end to
end management of network load balancing, a key component for maintaining a
robust enterprise OCS architecture as well as high performance for Exchange 2010
systems 
* Synthetic OCS client functionality for continuous testing and proactive
monitoring of communications services (IM, voice, video and conferencing)
quality and response time between end user nodes within an organization

Free OCS Educational Seminar Series

In conjunction with the launch of its managed OCS service, Azaleos today
announced a series of free on-location seminars and webinars to help IT and
business decision makers understand the benefits, challenges, and pitfalls to
avoid when deploying OCS. The seminars and webinars will be led by Azaleos
experts with deep knowledge on managing OCS and its individual elements
including IM/presence, web/video conferencing, and VoIP. For a complete list of
dates, times, and locations please visit
http://www.azaleos.com/insight/events.aspx. 

"Microsoft Office Communications Server brings together a powerful set of
communication and collaboration capabilities on a single IP network, which can
boost productivity in a big way but also introduces significant new layers of
complexity for IT departments," said Scott Gode, vice president of marketing and
product management for Azaleos. "The Azaleos OCS service is designed to
eliminate the management challenges - both from an availability and service
quality standpoint - associated with this real-time communications platform, so
organizations that lack IT expertise, resources or prefer to outsource this
workload, can still deploy OCS." 

Full Suite of Exchange Services

Azaleos offers the most complete and reliable set of remotely managed services
for Exchange (including Exchange 2010) based messaging, SharePoint Server, and
BlackBerry Enterprise Server. The company is the only service provider offering
on-premise remotely managed Exchange services, as well as third party datacenter
and hybrid hosting options. In addition to the new OCS service, Azaleos` full
complement of add-on services includes:

* Filtering Services, cloud-based e-mail anti-virus/anti-spam 
* Archive Services, e-mail archiving and storage for Exchange server 
* Mobile Services, turnkey management and monitoring for the BlackBerry
Enterprise Server
* Continuity Services, e-mail business continuity and disaster recovery
* Active Directory Services, remote monitoring and management of Active
Directory
* SharePoint Services, remote monitoring and management of SharePoint

Availability and Pricing

The Azaleos remotely managed Office Communications Server service is available
immediately. Pricing starts at $5 per user/month. 

About Azaleos

Azaleos Corporation provides the benefits of hosted e-mail, collaboration, and
unified communications services for organizations that can`t or won`t allow
their data to reside outside the datacenter. Azaleos` 24X7 remotely managed
services for Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, Office Communications Server,
Active Directory, and BlackBerry Enterprise Server keep information on-premise
and under IT control, while uptime, maintenance, and support is handled by
experts in its network operations centers. Hundreds of companies from Fortune
500 to mid-market enterprises rely on Azaleos and its patented ViewX technology
to manage their collaboration infrastructures and address issues before users
ever know they exist. Azaleos is a Microsoft Gold Certified partner, and one of
Microsoft`s top 35 NSI partners in the US. For more information visit

&lt;p&gt;Adds New Voltaire Vantage 8500 10 Gigabit Ethernet Switch to Dynamic
Infrastructure Portfolio
BILLERICA, Mass. &amp; RA&#8217;ANANA, Israel--(Business Wire)--
Voltaire Ltd. (NASDAQ: VOLT), a leading provider of scale-out data center
fabrics, today announced that Voltaire and IBM are expanding their strategic
partnership whereby IBM is now selling Voltaire`s new 10 Gigabit Ethernet
switches with IBM`s integrated System Cluster 1350 portfolio of products. 

The addition of Voltaire`s scale-out Ethernet switches to IBM`s data center
networking portfolio provides customers who are designing next generation,
virtualized data centers and cloud environments, a complete solution that
delivers efficiency, scalability and performance, at significantly reduced
costs. 

"Our inclusion of Voltaire`s 10 Gigabit Ethernet switches in our Dynamic
Infrastructure portfolio for System x is part of IBM`s ongoing strategy to give
our customers more flexibility and choice of innovative networking solutions to
address the growing demands on their IT environments," said Alex Yost, vice
president, IBM Systems &amp; Technology Group. "Expanding our partnership with
Voltaire into Ethernet networking will help support IBM`s data center networking
initiatives with a solution that offers customers the performance, efficiency
and scalability they need to get the utmost value out of their scale-out and
virtualized environments." 

Available today, the Voltaire Vantage 8500 switch is a 10 Gigabit Ethernet,
high-density Layer 2 core switch that addresses the key networking requirements
of virtualized, scale-out data centers. The Vantage 8500 features less than 1
microsecond latency, low 10 watts per port power consumption at low per port
costs delivering unmatched scalability with the lowest solution cost, power
consumption, and latency on the market. The switch has a unique capability to
enable simplified, flat, scale-out fabrics. By clustering up to twelve Vantage
8500 switches together, a customer can expand their data center to many
thousands of servers while preserving the same efficiency and price-per-port,
without degrading the performance or latency like traditional hierarchical
network designs. 

"IBM`s decision to offer Voltaire`s new Ethernet switches is a testament to the
unique value these products bring to scale-out, virtualized data centers," said
Ronnie Kenneth, CEO and Chairman, Voltaire. "We are very pleased to continue to
grow our partnership with IBM to include Voltaire Ethernet alongside our market
leading InfiniBand switching platforms." 

Expanded Partnership

IBM has offered Voltaire InfiniBand switches and software as part of its HPC and
data center portfolios since 2004. Together, IBM and Voltaire solutions are
driving the high-performance data centers of some of the world`s largest
companies, as well as the world`s most powerful supercomputer, Roadrunner, at
Los Alamos National Laboratory. 

In June 2009, IBM added Voltaire`s 40 Gb/s InfiniBand switch module for IBM
BladeCenter to its HPC and enterprise solutions portfolio. Custom designed by
Voltaire for IBM, the switch accelerates performance of applications running on
BladeCenter. 

Today`s announcement marks the expansion of the partnership to include
Voltaire`s Ethernet-based switches, in addition to Voltaire`s 20 and 40 Gb/s
InfiniBand platforms in the IBM System Cluster 1350 integrated portfolio. 

Beginning today, IBM is also offering Voltaire`s recently introduced Grid
Director 4700, a 40 Gb/s QDR InfiniBand director switch. The switch features 324
ports of 40 Gb/s InfiniBand connectivity, with the option to double capacity to
648 ports using Voltaire`s HyperScale fabric boards. Its unique stackable
architecture enables customers to build larger configurations into the hundreds
and thousands of nodes, with lower latency and greater simplicity than
alternative solutions. 

More information about the Voltaire Vantage 8500 is available at
www.voltaire.com/Vantage_8500 and additional information about the Voltaire Grid
Director 4700 is available at www.voltaire.com/GridDirector4700.

&lt;p&gt; * IBM to sell Voltaire's 10 gigabit ethernet switches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Voltaire to address combined market of $2 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Company to disclose agreements with other OEMs soon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tova Cohen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TEL AVIV, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Voltaire Ltd VOLT.O, a maker
of server and storage switches and software, is expanding its
strategic partnership with IBM (IBM.N) into a new market it
believes will significantly boost revenue starting in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM will sell Voltaire's new 10 gigabit ethernet switches
with its servers, storage and networking equipment used in
high-density, large data centres, Voltaire said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM is the first original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to
carry Voltaire's new product and the company said the agreement
was an important milestone in its launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's too early for us to share figures on sales but
this will definitely have an impact on 2010," Asaf Somekh,
Voltaire vice president of marketing, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Israel-based Voltaire's traditional switching platforms
called InfiniBand offer 20 and 40 gigabit power for high-end
users such as fast financial trading platforms, a market the
company estimates at $500 million a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its 10 gigabit architecture is targeted at more mainstream
customers scaling out data centres rather than buying and
deploying high-end servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're moving from a market that was a few hundreds of
millions of dollars a year to a market of around $2 billion
combined," Somekh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has offered Voltaire's InfiniBand switches and software
since 2004, which are used in data centres of some of the
world's largest companies, as well as the most powerful
supercomputer, Roadrunner, at Los Alamos National Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We focused on the InfiniBand market which was a great
initial niche and we've established ourselves within the
portfolios of OEMs and now we're entering a much larger space,"
Somekh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; InfiniBand created a foothold in the financial industry,
with installations in several exchanges, most of the large banks
and in many hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ethernet product will open up new enterprise markets,
Somekh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Voltaire expects to announce new partnership agreements very
soon. While Somekh would not name the OEMs it expects to close
deals with, in the past it has partnered with Hewlett-Packard
(HPQ.N) and Sun Microsystems JAVA.O in addition to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Voltaire's biggest competitor, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O),
has started to offer a unified computer solution, which has
aliented long-term partners like IBM and HP, Somekh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Suddenly Cisco is competing on the server business and that
created a huge opportunity for us and other networking vendors,"
he said. "There is a huge amount of business HP and IBM are
generating for Cisco and we believe we are in a position to take
a nice chunk of this."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal jury in New York City ruled Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) had polluted the city's ground water and ordered the oil giant to pay $105 million in damages, the city said in a statement on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city contended Exxon knew that gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether would contaminate ground water if it leaked from the underground storage tanks at its retail stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon ignored warnings from its own scientists and engineers not to use MTBE in areas of the country that relied on ground water for drinking water, the city said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MTBE is an oxygenate that is added to gasoline to increase its octane level and reduce air pollution, but it has largely been phased out of the U.S. fuel supply because of the dangers to ground water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $105 million verdict represents less than 3 percent of Exxon's second-quarter profit of $3.95 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), BP Plc (BP.L), Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Citgo Petroleum Corp, Hess Corp (HES.N) and Sunoco Inc SUN.N have previously settled claims against them for a total of $15 million, the city said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irving, Texas-based Exxon said it was disappointed with the decision and would consider its legal options. The company said during the trial that its service stations were not the cause of the contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not believe we should be required to compensate the City of New York for someone else's contamination," company spokesman Kevin Allexon said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon Mobil rose 1.1 percent, or 82 cents, to $73.94 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily; Editing by Richard Chang and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

Globally, we gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink

invest in our business, all while generating tremendous cash flow. The
fundamentals of our business remain strong and our franchise system is

uncertainties into 2010 and for consumer sentiment to recover slowly, we believe
more than ever that we have the right strategies being executed, the right
leadership team in place and have taken the right actions this year to drive
continued growth and to make the most of the abundant opportunities before us." 

"This is a dynamic time in the history and evolution of our Company," said Mr.
Kent. "With our 2020 Vision, we have a clear Coca-Cola system vision for the
future of our business, and we are applying that vision in our strategic
planning, system alignment and focused execution. Each day we work diligently to
make our Company stronger for the future and to ensure that we continue driving
long-term sustainable results, while delivering the beverages that consumers

increase in concentrate sales offset by a double-digit negative impact from
currencies and negative pricing and mix. Reported operating income increased 2
percent in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating income increased
13 percent due to the increase in concentrate sales and tight expense
management. 
* In Eurasia and Africa, sparkling beverages increased 1 percent and still
beverages increased 7 percent in the quarter. The growth in unit case volume was
led by a 37 percent increase in India, which cycled an 18 percent increase in

quarter with the East and Central Region growing 11 percent, cycling 7 percent
growth in the prior year, and the North and West Region growing 5 percent,

nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. India gained volume and value share
across most categories including sparkling, still and juice and juice drinks.

Europe

positive pricing and mix. Reported operating income decreased 3 percent in the
quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating income increased 7 percent
benefiting from tight expense management. 
* Unit case volume growth in Northwest Europe was offset by weakness in Spain
and Eastern Europe due to significant macroeconomic challenges in those regions.

ready-to-drink beverages and gained value share across all key countries.

* Our Latin America Group continued to deliver strong unit case volume growth
with 7 percent growth in the quarter, cycling 8 percent growth in the prior year
quarter. Year-to-date unit case volume increased 6 percent, cycling 8 percent
growth in the prior year period. Net revenues for the quarter decreased 3
percent, primarily due to a double-digit negative impact from currencies,
partially offset by a 6 percent increase in concentrate sales and a double-digit
positive impact from pricing and mix. Reported operating income was even with
the prior year quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating income increased
18 percent primarily reflecting the higher concentrate sales and positive
pricing and mix partially offset by continued investment in key marketing and
business initiatives. 
* Strong unit case volume growth in the quarter was led by a 9 percent increase
in Mexico, a 3 percent increase in Brazil and an 11 percent increase in our
Latin Center Region. 
* Latin America delivered growth across the portfolio with sparkling beverages
increasing 4 percent and still beverages increasing 21 percent in the quarter.
Notably, brand Coca-Cola and Trademark Coca-Cola both grew 5 percent in the
quarter. 
* In the quarter, the Latin America Group gained volume and value share in both
the sparkling and still categories.

North America

* Our North America Group`s unit case volume declined 4 percent in the quarter
primarily due to the shift of the July 4th holiday volume from the third quarter
into the second quarter, an aggressive competitive pricing environment within
still beverages and the continuing difficult macroeconomic environment.
Year-to-date unit case volume decreased 2 percent. Net revenues for the quarter
decreased 2 percent, reflecting a 1 percent positive impact from pricing and mix
offset by a 3 percent decrease in concentrate sales. Reported operating income
increased 10 percent in the quarter primarily reflecting lower cost of goods
sold attributable to lower commodity costs and the benefits of our ongoing
productivity initiatives. 
* Unit case volume for sparkling beverages declined 5 percent in the quarter as
we cycle the industry-leading bottler pricing taken in the latter part of 2008;
however, brand health scores continued to improve. Importantly, Coca-Cola Zero
delivered double-digit unit case volume growth in the quarter, achieving 14
consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. 
* Still beverage unit case volume was even in the quarter. Still volume in our
Foodservice and Hospitality business continued to grow, driven by innovation and
new segmented customer offerings in our tea portfolio. 
* In the quarter, North America gained significant value share in nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink beverages for the fourth consecutive quarter. Still beverages
gained volume share for the ninth consecutive quarter and gained value share for
the fourth consecutive quarter, led by strong performance in our Foodservice and
Hospitality business and Trademark Simply. Trademark Simply continued to perform
strongly with new flavor innovations and expanded availability, contributing to
share gains in the juice and juice drinks category.

Pacific

* Our Pacific Group delivered unit case volume growth of 6 percent in the
quarter, cycling 7 percent growth in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date unit
case volume growth increased 5 percent, cycling 7 percent growth in the prior
year period. Net revenues for the quarter decreased 1 percent, reflecting a mid
single-digit positive impact from currencies and a 3 percent increase in
concentrate sales offset by negative country and channel mix. Reported operating
income decreased 10 percent in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral
operating income decreased 17 percent primarily reflecting negative country and
channel mix partially offset by higher concentrate sales. 
* Pacific delivered unit case volume growth across the portfolio with sparkling
beverages increasing 5 percent and still beverages increasing 8 percent in the
quarter. Importantly, Trademark Coca-Cola grew 4 percent in the quarter. 
* In China, unit case volume grew 15 percent in the quarter driven by
double-digit growth in Trademark Sprite and Minute Maid, as well as mid
single-digit growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, contributing to volume and value
share gains across sparkling and still beverages. 
* In Japan, unit case volume growth declined 4 percent in the quarter reflecting
the weak economy and unfavorable weather. However, our business in Japan
continued to outperform the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry, resulting in
the sixth consecutive quarter of share gains. Importantly, Georgia Coffee unit
case volume increased 1 percent in the quarter driven by the introduction of
additional low-calorie options and our new "Welcome to Georgia" campaign.

Bottling Investments

* Our Bottling Investments Group`s unit case volume increased 4 percent in the
quarter, primarily driven by strong growth in China, India and the Philippines,
partially offset by the impact of the Pakistan bottler divestiture in the prior
year. Net revenues for the quarter decreased 4 percent, primarily reflecting the
increase in unit case volume offset by a negative currency impact and the impact
of the divestiture in the prior year. Reported operating income increased 26
percent in the quarter while comparable currency neutral operating income
increased 56 percent, primarily driven by favorable commodity costs and tight
expense management.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Net operating revenues for the quarter decreased 4 percent, driven by a 6
percent negative currency impact and a 1 percent negative impact from a
structural change offset by a 2 percent increase in concentrate sales and a 1
percent positive impact from pricing and mix. The structural change relates to
the divestiture of a portion of our ownership interest in the Pakistan bottler
in 2008, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Excluding the impact of this
divestiture, our comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 5 percent
year-to-date, in line with our long-term growth target. 

Cost of goods sold decreased 3 percent in the quarter. This decrease is
primarily driven by the 2 percent increase in concentrate sales offset by a 3
percent impact from currencies and a 1 percent impact from the structural change
related to our bottling investments. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7 percent in the quarter
primarily driven by a 6 percent currency impact. In addition, the decrease was
partly attributable to our more effective management of general and
administrative expenses, the structural change related to bottling investments
and a net decrease in incentive compensation expense partially offset by an
increase in pension costs. 

Reported and comparable operating income decreased 2 percent in the quarter.
Items impacting comparability reduced operating income by $48 million in 2009
and by $47 million in 2008 and were primarily related to restructuring charges
and costs related to global productivity initiatives. Comparable currency
neutral operating income increased 9 percent in the quarter, exceeding our
long-term growth target. Currency negatively impacted comparable operating
income by 11 percent in the quarter. After considering current spot rates, the
anticipated benefits of our hedging coverage and the cycling of prior year
exchange rates, we expect currencies to have a low to mid single-digit positive
impact on operating income in the fourth quarter of 2009. 

For the third quarter of 2009, our reported earnings per share were $0.81, even
with the third quarter of 2008. Reported earnings per share for the third
quarter of 2009 and 2008 included a net charge of $0.01 and $0.02 per share,
respectively, primarily due to restructuring charges and costs related to global
productivity initiatives. The 2008 net charge also included a gain on the sale
of a portion of our investment in the Pakistan bottler. After considering the
items impacting comparability, earnings per share in the quarter were $0.82, a
decrease of 1 percent versus the third quarter of 2008. Earnings per share
continue to be negatively impacted by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar
versus other currencies around the world. 

Cash from operations was $6.3 billion year-to-date compared with $5.7 billion in
the prior year period, an increase of 11 percent. This increase was driven by an
improvement in working capital versus the prior year. In the third quarter, we
repurchased $241 million of our stock, and we intend to repurchase up to $1
billion of stock by year end. 

Effective Tax Rate

The Company`s estimated effective tax rate reflects, among other items, our best
estimates for 2009 operating results and foreign currency exchange rates. If
actual results are different than these estimates, the underlying effective tax
rate could change. 

As discussed in the second quarter earnings release, we had previously estimated
that the underlying effective tax rate on operations would be approximately 23.5
percent for the full year. We now anticipate that the underlying effective tax
rate on operations for the full year 2009 will be approximately 23.0 percent. We
are required to record income tax expense for the first nine months of the year
based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full year. To bring the
effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2009 in line with the current
estimated full year underlying effective tax rate, we recorded income tax
expense at an underlying effective tax rate of approximately 22.0 percent in the
third quarter. 

Our estimated underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of
significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when they occur,
are separately recognized in the appropriate period. The reported effective tax
rate for the quarter was 21.4 percent. 

Items Impacting Prior Year Results

Third quarter 2008 results included a net charge of $0.02 per share primarily
due to restructuring charges and costs related to global productivity
initiatives partially offset by a gain on the sale of a portion of our
investment in the Pakistan bottler. 

Second quarter 2008 results included a net charge of $0.40 per share primarily
related to charges recorded by our equity method investees, restructuring
charges and asset write-downs. 

First quarter 2008 results included a net charge of $0.03 per share primarily
related to restructuring charges and asset write-downs.

period to those of the prior year comparable period. 
* All references to unit case volume percentage changes are computed based on
average daily sales for all periods presented. 
* 2009 year-to-date results are positively impacted by five additional selling
days, which will be offset by six fewer selling days in the fourth quarter. 
* Our long-term growth targets as referenced in this release are on a comparable
currency neutral basis and exclude structural changes.

 (2)               Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended October 2, 2009, were reduced by approximately $2 million for Europe, $2 million for North America, $1 million for Pacific, $18 million for Bottling Investments and $25 million for Corporate, primarily due to the Company`s ongoing productivity initiatives and restructuring costs.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (3)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended October 2, 2009, was reduced by approximately $5 million for Bottling Investments and $1 million for Corporate, primarily attributable to the Company`s proportionate share of restructuring charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees.                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (4)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended October 2, 2009, was increased by approximately $10 million for Corporate due to realized gains on the sale of equity securities that were classified as available-for-sale.

 (7)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended September 26, 2008, was reduced by approximately $3 million for Bottling Investments, primarily attributable to the Company`s proportionate share of restructuring charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 (8)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended September 26, 2008, was increased by approximately $16 million for Corporate due to a gain on the sale of 49 percent of our interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Pakistan Ltd.

 (2)               Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes for the nine months ended October 2, 2009, were reduced by approximately $3 million Eurasia and Africa, $3 million for Europe, $15 million for North America, $1 million for Pacific, $109 million for Bottling Investments and $81 million for Corporate, primarily as a result of restructuring costs, the Company`s ongoing productivity initiatives and asset impairments.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (3)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the nine months ended October 2, 2009, was reduced by approximately $66 million for Bottling Investments and $2 million for Corporate, primarily attributable to the Company`s proportionate share of asset impairment and restructuring charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (4)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the nine months ended October 2, 2009, was reduced by approximately $27 million for Corporate due to an other-than-temporary impairment of a cost method investment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (5)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the nine months ended October 2, 2009, was increased by approximately $10 million for Corporate due to realized gains on the sale of equity securities that were classified as available-for-sale. In 2008, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment related to these investments.

 (7)               Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes for the nine months ended September 26, 2008, were reduced by approximately $1 million for Latin America, $12 million for North America, $25 million for Bottling Investments and $204 million for Corporate, primarily attributable to restructuring costs, contract termination fees, asset impairments and productivity initiatives.                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (8)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the nine months ended September 26, 2008, was reduced by approximately $1.1 billion for Bottling Investments, primarily as a result of our proportionate share of an impairment charge recorded by Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. ("CCE").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (9)               Income (loss) before income taxes for the nine months ended September 26, 2008, was increased by approximately $118 million for Bottling Investments and Corporate, primarily due to the gain on the sale of Refrigerantes Minas Gerais Ltda. ("Remil"), a bottler in Brazil, to Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Coca-Cola FEMSA").

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because 
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability.  Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended October 2, 2009 and September 26, 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition 
 to, and not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because 
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability.  Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the nine months ended October 2, 2009 and September 26, 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition 
 to, and not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because 
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended October 2, 2009 and September 26, 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition 
 to, and not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because 
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the nine months ended October 2, 2009 and September 26, 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition 
 to, and not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for third-quarter 2009.
Revenues were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 3% compared with $12.0 billion in the
year-ago quarter. Revenues for third-quarter 2009 compared with the year-ago
quarter were unfavorably impacted by approximately $610 million, or 5%, due to
foreign exchange and were favorably impacted by $217 million, or 2%, due to a
one-time adjustment in the year-ago period for prior years` liabilities for
product returns. For third-quarter 2009, U.S. revenues were $4.8 billion, a
decrease of 2% compared with the year-ago quarter. International revenues were
$6.8 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the prior-year quarter, and
reflected 5% operational growth and a 9% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
U.S. revenues represented 41% of the total, while international revenues
represented 59% of the total, both comparable with the year-ago quarter. 

For the first nine months of 2009, revenues were $33.5 billion, a decrease of 7%
compared with $36.0 billion in the same period in 2008. Foreign exchange
unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $2.3 billion or 6%. U.S. revenues
were $14.3 billion, a decrease of 6% compared with the first nine months of
2008. International revenues were $19.2 billion, a decrease of 8% compared with
the same period last year, and reflected 3% operational growth and an 11%
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 43% of the
total compared with 42% in the year-ago period, and international revenues
represented 57% of the total compared with 58% of the total of the first nine
months of 2008. 

Business Revenues

Effective January 1, 2009, Pfizer expanded its operating model within the
Pharmaceutical business to include five customer-focused units, in addition to
its Animal Health business. During third-quarter 2009, the Specialty Care,
Emerging Markets and Oncology Pharmaceutical units and Animal Health generated
revenue growth on a constant currency basis. The Primary Care unit was flat on a
constant currency basis while the Established Products unit, which manages a
portfolio of products that have generally lost patent protection or marketing
exclusivity and that have an expected decline in revenues at this stage in their
lifecycle, declined 9% on a constant currency basis.

* Calculation not meaningful 

Primary Care revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $5.5 billion, a decline of 4%
compared with $5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operationally, Primary Care
revenues were flat, as the strong international performance of Lyrica and
Lipitor was offset primarily by lower Lipitor revenues in the U.S. Operational
performance was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Specialty Care revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, an increase of
3% compared with $1.5 billion in the same period last year. Operational growth
of 6%, largely driven by the solid performance of Rebif and Revatio, was
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Oncology revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $371 million, a decrease of 5%
compared with $389 million in the prior-year quarter. Operational growth of 2%,
primarily due to the strong performance of Sutent, was partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of the loss of exclusivity of Camptosar in Europe in July
2009. The operational growth was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange. 

Established Products revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a
decline of 12% compared with $1.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, comprised of
a 9% operational decline and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Emerging Markets revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a decrease
of 4% compared with $1.7 billion in third-quarter 2008. These results included
revenue from both established products and patent-protected products sold in
emerging markets. Operational growth of 9%, largely attributable to strong
growth in high-priority countries, notably China and India, was more than offset
by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Animal Health revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $678 million, a decline of 4%
compared with $708 million in the year-ago quarter. Operational growth of 2%,
primarily driven by the solid performance in emerging markets and for certain
new products worldwide, was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange. 

Reported Net Income(1)and Reported Diluted EPS(1)

For third-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(1) of $2.9 billion, an
increase of 26% compared with $2.3 billion in the prior-year quarter, and
reported diluted EPS(1) of $0.43, an increase of 26% compared with $0.34 in the
prior-year quarter. Results for third-quarter 2009 compared with the same period
in 2008 were favorably impacted by the non-recurrence of the after-tax charge of
$640 million resulting from agreements to resolve certain litigation involving
the Company`s non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medicines in the
year-ago quarter, lower costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and
savings generated from those initiatives. These factors were partially offset by
the decrease in revenues, unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, higher
interest expense as a result of the issuance of notes to partially finance the
Wyeth acquisition as well as an increase in the effective tax rate on reported
results to approximately 28% in third-quarter 2009 from approximately 17% in
third-quarter 2008. This increase in the effective tax rate on reported results
was primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business
decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. 

For the first nine months of 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(1) of $7.9
billion, and reported diluted EPS(1) of $1.16, both comparable with the first
nine months of 2008. These results were impacted by the aforementioned factors
as well as costs incurred to prepare for the Wyeth acquisition and lower
in-process research and development charges. The increase in the effective tax
rate on reported results to approximately 27% in the first nine months of 2009
from approximately 14% in the first nine months of 2008 was primarily due to the
increased tax cost as discussed above. Additionally, the 2008 effective tax rate
was positively impacted by favorable income tax adjustments. 

Adjusted Income(2) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2)

Third-quarter 2009 adjusted income(2) was $3.5 billion, a decrease of 17%
compared with $4.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(2)
was $0.51, a decrease of 18% compared with $0.62 in the year-ago quarter. For
the first nine months of 2009, adjusted income(2) was $10.4 billion, a decrease
of 13% compared with $12.0 billion in the first nine months of 2008, and
adjusted diluted EPS(2) was $1.54, a decrease of 13% compared with $1.77 in the
year-ago period. Both adjusted income(2) and adjusted diluted EPS(2) were
negatively impacted by lower revenues and by an increase in the effective tax
rate on adjusted income(2) to approximately 32% in third-quarter 2009 from
approximately 22% in third-quarter 2008, and to approximately 30% in the first
nine months of 2009 from approximately 21% in the first nine months of 2008.
These increases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to the increased
tax cost associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the
Wyeth acquisition. In addition, the effective tax rate for the first nine months
of 2008 was positively impacted by a favorable income tax adjustment. These
factors were partially offset by savings from various cost-reduction initiatives
across all aspects of the business, which decreased adjusted total costs(10) by
approximately $210 million in third-quarter 2009 and $950 million in the first
nine months of 2009. 

In third-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales(2) as a percentage of revenues was
15.4% compared with 14.5% in third-quarter 2008. This increase primarily
reflects the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was partially offset by
the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives. Excluding the impact of
foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales(2) as a percentage of revenues was
14.3% in third-quarter 2009. 

Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI) expenses(2) were $3.2
billion in third-quarter 2009, a decrease of 6% compared with $3.4 billion in
the prior-year quarter. The decrease was attributable to the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange,
which reduced third-quarter 2009 adjusted SI expenses(2) by $126 million
compared with the year-ago quarter. 

Adjusted research and development (R) expenses(2) were $1.6 billion in
third-quarter 2009, a decrease of 8% compared with $1.8 billion in the
prior-year period. The decrease was due to the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange,
which reduced third-quarter 2009 adjusted R expenses(2) by $36 million
compared with the year-ago quarter. 

Overall, operational improvements resulting from cost-reduction initiatives
decreased adjusted total costs(10) by approximately $210 million, or 3%, in
third-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period, and foreign exchange
decreased adjusted total costs(10) by approximately $120 million, or 2%, in
third-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period. The operational
improvements were driven partially by the reduction in workforce to
approximately 75,400 at the end of third-quarter 2009, a decline of 1,100
compared with the end of the second-quarter 2009, and a decline of 11,200 since
the beginning of 2008, as well as manufacturing and research and development
site exits. In fourth-quarter 2009, a portion of the operational cost reductions
achieved in the first nine months of 2009 is expected to be invested in
high-growth opportunities. 

Executive Commentary

"We are pleased with our results this quarter and in our ability to once again
deliver solid operational performance in an environment that continues to be
challenging. Excluding foreign exchange, our five Pharmaceutical units and
Animal Health business continued to perform well enabling us to continue to meet
our commitments," stated Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

Kindler continued, "The completion of the Wyeth acquisition represents a
significant milestone in the transformation of Pfizer. We are beginning to
implement our integration plan in order to quickly maximize the value of our
expanded and more diversified global product portfolio in key high-growth areas.
With customer-centric businesses, supported by research organizations, Pfizer is
now well positioned to deliver greater value to patients and shareholders." 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "During the first nine months
of 2009, we have continued to deliver on our 2009 financial commitments and our
longer-term cost-reduction target. Completion of both the Wyeth acquisition and
associated integration plans is a testament to the hard work and dedication of
talented colleagues throughout the organization. Looking ahead, we anticipate
that our broad portfolio of products and increased investment in high-growth
opportunities will better position us to generate consistent earnings growth and
continue to deliver on our commitments."

 (1)     "Reported Net Income" is defined as net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. "Reported Diluted EPS" is    
         defined as reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.                         
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (2)     "Adjusted income" and its components and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are defined as reported net income(1) and its components and reported diluted EPS(1) 
         excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted SI        
         expenses and Adjusted R expenses are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. As       
         described under Adjusted Income in the Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the fiscal 
         quarter ended June 28, 2009, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We     
         believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. Reconciliations of third-quarter 2009 and 2008 and first nine-months 2009 
         and 2008 adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS to reported net income(1) and its components and reported diluted EPS(1), as well as reconciliations 
         of full-year 2009 adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance to full-year 2009 reported net income(1) and reported diluted EPS(1) guidance, are provided in the    
         materials accompanying this report. The adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S.   
         GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS.

         managed by the Established Products(6) business unit.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (6)     The Established Products business unit generally includes revenues from human pharmaceutical products that have lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity in certain 
         countries and/or regions. In certain situations, products may be transferred to this unit before losing patent protection or marketing exclusivity in order to maximize   
         their value. This unit also excludes revenues generated in emerging markets(7). Examples of products in this business unit include, but are not limited to, Norvasc,      
         Relpax, Medrol and Arthrotec.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (7)     The Emerging Markets business unit includes revenues from all human pharmaceutical products sold in emerging markets, including, but not limited to, Asia (excluding      
         Japan), Latin America, Middle East, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and Turkey.

 (10)    Represents the total of Adjusted Cost of Sales(2), Adjusted SI expenses(2) and Adjusted R expenses(2).                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (11)    Current exchange rates approximate rates at the time of the third-quarter 2009 earnings press release (October 2009).                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (12)    The financial guidance includes projected results of operations for Wyeth, in accordance with Pfizer's international and domestic year-ends. Therefore, the guidance      
         includes approximately one-and-a-half months of the fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of Wyeth`s international operations and approximately two-and-a-half      
         months of the fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of Wyeth`s U.S. operations. This guidance does not assume the completion of any other business-development      
         transactions, including divestitures not completed as of September 27, 2009, and excludes the potential effects of litigation-related matters not substantially resolved  
         as of September 27, 2009.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                     
         In addition, the reported financial guidance includes estimated amounts that are dependent upon certain valuations and other studies of the assets acquired and           
         liabilities assumed from Wyeth that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. Accordingly, the      
         estimated purchase accounting impacts are preliminary and may not be indicative of actual amounts that will be recorded as additional information becomes available and as 
         additional analyses are performed. Differences between the preliminary estimates reflected in this reported guidance and the final acquisition accounting will likely     
         occur and could have a material impact on this guidance. The reported financial guidance also reflects certain costs incurred in connection with the Wyeth acquisition    
         since the announcement of the agreement to acquire Wyeth on January 26, 2009 through the acquisition close date including, but not limited to, pre-integration,           
         transaction and financing costs. Due to the recent timing of the acquisition close, the 2009 reported guidance does not reflect an estimate for any restructuring or      
         integration charges expected to be incurred in connection with the acquisition of Wyeth. The Company will include an estimate for acquisition-related restructuring and   
         integration costs in its full-year 2010 reported financial guidance in conjunction with its fourth-quarter 2009 earnings release in January 2010.

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for third-quarter 2009.
Revenues were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 3% compared with $12.0 billion in the
year-ago quarter. Revenues for third-quarter 2009 compared with the year-ago
quarter were unfavorably impacted by approximately $610 million, or 5%, due to
foreign exchange and were favorably impacted by $217 million, or 2%, due to a
one-time adjustment in the year-ago period for prior years` liabilities for
product returns. For third-quarter 2009, U.S. revenues were $4.8 billion, a
decrease of 2% compared with the year-ago quarter. International revenues were
$6.8 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the prior-year quarter, and
reflected 5% operational growth and a 9% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
U.S. revenues represented 41% of the total, while international revenues
represented 59% of the total, both comparable with the year-ago quarter. 

For the first nine months of 2009, revenues were $33.5 billion, a decrease of 7%
compared with $36.0 billion in the same period in 2008. Foreign exchange
unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $2.3 billion or 6%. U.S. revenues
were $14.3 billion, a decrease of 6% compared with the first nine months of
2008. International revenues were $19.2 billion, a decrease of 8% compared with
the same period last year, and reflected 3% operational growth and an 11%
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 43% of the
total compared with 42% in the year-ago period, and international revenues
represented 57% of the total compared with 58% of the total of the first nine
months of 2008. 

Business Revenues

Effective January 1, 2009, Pfizer expanded its operating model within the
Pharmaceutical business to include five customer-focused units, in addition to
its Animal Health business. During third-quarter 2009, the Specialty Care,
Emerging Markets and Oncology Pharmaceutical units and Animal Health generated
revenue growth on a constant currency basis. The Primary Care unit was flat on a
constant currency basis while the Established Products unit, which manages a
portfolio of products that have generally lost patent protection or marketing
exclusivity and that have an expected decline in revenues at this stage in their
lifecycle, declined 9% on a constant currency basis.

* Calculation not meaningful 

Primary Care revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $5.5 billion, a decline of 4%
compared with $5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operationally, Primary Care
revenues were flat, as the strong international performance of Lyrica and
Lipitor was offset primarily by lower Lipitor revenues in the U.S. Operational
performance was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Specialty Care revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, an increase of
3% compared with $1.5 billion in the same period last year. Operational growth
of 6%, largely driven by the solid performance of Rebif and Revatio, was
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Oncology revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $371 million, a decrease of 5%
compared with $389 million in the prior-year quarter. Operational growth of 2%,
primarily due to the strong performance of Sutent, was partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of the loss of exclusivity of Camptosar in Europe in July
2009. The operational growth was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange. 

Established Products revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a
decline of 12% compared with $1.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, comprised of
a 9% operational decline and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Emerging Markets revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a decrease
of 4% compared with $1.7 billion in third-quarter 2008. These results included
revenue from both established products and patent-protected products sold in
emerging markets. Operational growth of 9%, largely attributable to strong
growth in high-priority countries, notably China and India, was more than offset
by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Animal Health revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $678 million, a decline of 4%
compared with $708 million in the year-ago quarter. Operational growth of 2%,
primarily driven by the solid performance in emerging markets and for certain
new products worldwide, was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange. 

Reported Net Income(1)and Reported Diluted EPS(1)

For third-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(1) of $2.9 billion, an
increase of 26% compared with $2.3 billion in the prior-year quarter, and
reported diluted EPS(1) of $0.43, an increase of 26% compared with $0.34 in the
prior-year quarter. Results for third-quarter 2009 compared with the same period
in 2008 were favorably impacted by the non-recurrence of the after-tax charge of
$640 million resulting from agreements to resolve certain litigation involving
the Company`s non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medicines in the
year-ago quarter, lower costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and
savings generated from those initiatives. These factors were partially offset by
the decrease in revenues, unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, higher
interest expense as a result of the issuance of notes to partially finance the
Wyeth acquisition as well as an increase in the effective tax rate on reported
results to approximately 28% in third-quarter 2009 from approximately 17% in
third-quarter 2008. This increase in the effective tax rate on reported results
was primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business
decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. 

For the first nine months of 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(1) of $7.9
billion, and reported diluted EPS(1) of $1.16, both comparable with the first
nine months of 2008. These results were impacted by the aforementioned factors
as well as costs incurred to prepare for the Wyeth acquisition and lower
in-process research and development charges. The increase in the effective tax
rate on reported results to approximately 27% in the first nine months of 2009
from approximately 14% in the first nine months of 2008 was primarily due to the
increased tax cost as discussed above. Additionally, the 2008 effective tax rate
was positively impacted by favorable income tax adjustments. 

Adjusted Income(2) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2)

Third-quarter 2009 adjusted income(2) was $3.5 billion, a decrease of 17%
compared with $4.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(2)
was $0.51, a decrease of 18% compared with $0.62 in the year-ago quarter. For
the first nine months of 2009, adjusted income(2) was $10.4 billion, a decrease
of 13% compared with $12.0 billion in the first nine months of 2008, and
adjusted diluted EPS(2) was $1.54, a decrease of 13% compared with $1.77 in the
year-ago period. Both adjusted income(2) and adjusted diluted EPS(2) were
negatively impacted by lower revenues and by an increase in the effective tax
rate on adjusted income(2) to approximately 32% in third-quarter 2009 from
approximately 22% in third-quarter 2008, and to approximately 30% in the first
nine months of 2009 from approximately 21% in the first nine months of 2008.
These increases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to the increased
tax cost associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the
Wyeth acquisition. In addition, the effective tax rate for the first nine months
of 2008 was positively impacted by a favorable income tax adjustment. These
factors were partially offset by savings from various cost-reduction initiatives
across all aspects of the business, which decreased adjusted total costs(10) by
approximately $210 million in third-quarter 2009 and $950 million in the first
nine months of 2009. 

In third-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales(2) as a percentage of revenues was
15.4% compared with 14.5% in third-quarter 2008. This increase primarily
reflects the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was partially offset by
the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives. Excluding the impact of
foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales(2) as a percentage of revenues was
14.3% in third-quarter 2009. 

Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI) expenses(2) were $3.2
billion in third-quarter 2009, a decrease of 6% compared with $3.4 billion in
the prior-year quarter. The decrease was attributable to the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange,
which reduced third-quarter 2009 adjusted SI expenses(2) by $126 million
compared with the year-ago quarter. 

Adjusted research and development (R) expenses(2) were $1.6 billion in
third-quarter 2009, a decrease of 8% compared with $1.8 billion in the
prior-year period. The decrease was due to the favorable impact of
cost-reduction initiatives as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange,
which reduced third-quarter 2009 adjusted R expenses(2) by $36 million
compared with the year-ago quarter. 

Overall, operational improvements resulting from cost-reduction initiatives
decreased adjusted total costs(10) by approximately $210 million, or 3%, in
third-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period, and foreign exchange
decreased adjusted total costs(10) by approximately $120 million, or 2%, in
third-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period. The operational
improvements were driven partially by the reduction in workforce to
approximately 75,400 at the end of third-quarter 2009, a decline of 1,100
compared with the end of the second-quarter 2009, and a decline of 11,200 since
the beginning of 2008, as well as manufacturing and research and development
site exits. In fourth-quarter 2009, a portion of the operational cost reductions
achieved in the first nine months of 2009 is expected to be invested in
high-growth opportunities. 

Executive Commentary

"We are pleased with our results this quarter and in our ability to once again
deliver solid operational performance in an environment that continues to be
challenging. Excluding foreign exchange, our five Pharmaceutical units and
Animal Health business continued to perform well enabling us to continue to meet
our commitments," stated Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

Kindler continued, "The completion of the Wyeth acquisition represents a
significant milestone in the transformation of Pfizer. We are beginning to
implement our integration plan in order to quickly maximize the value of our
expanded and more diversified global product portfolio in key high-growth areas.
With customer-centric businesses, supported by research organizations, Pfizer is
now well positioned to deliver greater value to patients and shareholders." 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "During the first nine months

                                2009 Guidance(12)                    
 Reported Revenues              $49.0 to $50.0 billion               
                                (previously $45.0 to $46.0 billion)  
 Reported Diluted EPS(1)        $1.45 to $1.50                       
                                (previously $1.30 to $1.45)

                                (previously $1.90 to $2.00)

 (1)     "Reported Net Income" is defined as net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. "Reported Diluted EPS" is    
         defined as reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.                         
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (2)     "Adjusted income" and its components and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are defined as reported net income(1) and its components and reported diluted EPS(1) 
         excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted SI        
         expenses and Adjusted R expenses are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. As       
         described under Adjusted Income in the Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the fiscal 
         quarter ended June 28, 2009, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We     
         believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. Reconciliations of third-quarter 2009 and 2008 and first nine-months 2009 
         and 2008 adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS to reported net income(1) and its components and reported diluted EPS(1), as well as reconciliations 
         of full-year 2009 adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance to full-year 2009 reported net income(1) and reported diluted EPS(1) guidance, are provided in the    
         materials accompanying this report. The adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S.   
         GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS.

 (6)     The Established Products business unit generally includes revenues from human pharmaceutical products that have lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity in certain 
         countries and/or regions. In certain situations, products may be transferred to this unit before losing patent protection or marketing exclusivity in order to maximize   
         their value. This unit also excludes revenues generated in emerging markets(7). Examples of products in this business unit include, but are not limited to, Norvasc,      
         Relpax, Medrol and Arthrotec.

 (10)    Represents the total of Adjusted Cost of Sales(2), Adjusted SI expenses(2) and Adjusted R expenses(2).                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (11)    Current exchange rates approximate rates at the time of the third-quarter 2009 earnings press release (October 2009).                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                     
 (12)    The financial guidance includes projected results of operations for Wyeth, in accordance with Pfizer's international and domestic year-ends. Therefore, the guidance      
         includes approximately one-and-a-half months of the fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of Wyeth`s international operations and approximately two-and-a-half      
         months of the fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of Wyeth`s U.S. operations. This guidance does not assume the completion of any other business-development      
         transactions, including divestitures not completed as of September 27, 2009, and excludes the potential effects of litigation-related matters not substantially resolved  
         as of September 27, 2009.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                     
         In addition, the reported financial guidance includes estimated amounts that are dependent upon certain valuations and other studies of the assets acquired and           
         liabilities assumed from Wyeth that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. Accordingly, the      
         estimated purchase accounting impacts are preliminary and may not be indicative of actual amounts that will be recorded as additional information becomes available and as 
         additional analyses are performed. Differences between the preliminary estimates reflected in this reported guidance and the final acquisition accounting will likely     
         occur and could have a material impact on this guidance. The reported financial guidance also reflects certain costs incurred in connection with the Wyeth acquisition    
         since the announcement of the agreement to acquire Wyeth on January 26, 2009 through the acquisition close date including, but not limited to, pre-integration,           
         transaction and financing costs. Due to the recent timing of the acquisition close, the 2009 reported guidance does not reflect an estimate for any restructuring or      
         integration charges expected to be incurred in connection with the acquisition of Wyeth. The Company will include an estimate for acquisition-related restructuring and   
         integration costs in its full-year 2010 reported financial guidance in conjunction with its fourth-quarter 2009 earnings release in January 2010.

 1.    The above financial statements present the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008. Subsidiaries operating outside the United  
       States are included for the three-month and nine-month periods ended August 23, 2009 and August 24, 2008. The results of operations of Wyeth, which we acquired on October 
       15, 2009, are not included in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 27, 2009.                                                                            
 2.    The financial results for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 27, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results which could ultimately be achieved 
       for the current year.                                                                                                                                                     
 3.    On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of a new accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that provides guidance for the       
       accounting, reporting and disclosure of noncontrolling interests, previously referred to as minority interests. The adoption of these provisions resulted in              
       reclassifications of prior-period amounts to conform to the third-quarter and nine-month 2009 presentations, primarily related to the presentation of noncontrolling      
       interests.                                                                                                                                                                
 4.    Included in Restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs are transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other costs, directly related to our        
       acquisition of Wyeth of $19 million for the three-month period ended September 27, 2009 and $572 million for the nine-month period ended September 27, 2009.              
 5.    In the first nine months of 2009, we recorded $20 million of Acquisition-related in-process research and development charges (IPR) due to the resolution of a           
       contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX. In the first nine months of 2008, we expensed $567 million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of   
       Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX, Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and two smaller acquisitions related to Animal Health. As a result of adopting the  
       provisions of a new accounting standard for business combinations issued by the FASB, beginning January 1, 2009, IPR related to acquisitions after adoption will be     
       recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets. We made no acquisitions in the first nine months of 2009.                               
 6.    Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute our products is included  
       in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that are  
       associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales, Selling,informational and administrative expenses or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.   
 7.    Other (income)/deductions - net for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 28, 2008 includes litigation-related charges of approximately $900 million     
       associated with the resolution of certain litigation involving our non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medicines.                                                        
 8.    Provision for taxes on income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 27, 2009 includes a tax benefit of approximately $174 million related to the     
       final resolution of a previously disclosed agreement-in-principle with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle investigations of past promotional practices and certain  
       other matters. This resulted in the receipt of information that raised our assessment of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position. The    
       nine-month period ended September 28, 2008 includes tax benefits of approximately $305 million related to favorable tax settlements and of approximately $426 million     
       related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies (Esperion Therapeutics Inc.), both recorded in the second quarter of 2008.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1. Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the
euro, UK pound, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, unfavorably impacted our
revenues by approximately $610 million, or 5%, in third-quarter 2009, compared
to the same period in 2008, and by approximately $2.3 billion, or 6%, in the
first nine months of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. 

2. Change in Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales decreased 16% in the third quarter of 2009, compared to
the same period in 2008, and decreased 23% in first nine months of 2009,
compared to the same period in 2008. The decreases primarily reflect the savings
impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower related implementation costs,
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $23 million for the third quarter of 2009, $144
million for the first nine months of 2009, $172 million for the third quarter of
2008, and $520 million for the first nine months of 2008. 

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.3 percentage
points to 15.4% in third-quarter 2009, reflecting the favorable impact of our
cost-reduction initiatives and lower related implementation costs, partially
offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, compared to third-quarter
2008. 

3. Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses, Research &amp;
Development (R) Expenses and In-Process R Charges (IPR)

Reported SI expenses decreased 7% in the third quarter of 2009, compared to
the same period in 2008, and decreased 13% in first nine months of 2009,
compared to the same period in 2008. The decreases reflect savings associated
with our cost-reduction initiatives, lower related implementation costs, and the
favorable impact of foreign exchange. In addition, the first nine months of 2009
included certain insurance recoveries related to legal defense costs. 

Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $51 million for third-quarter 2009, $182 million
for the first nine months of 2009, $95 million for third-quarter 2008, and $270
million for the first nine months of 2008. 

Reported R expenses, excluding IPR, decreased 13% in the third quarter of
2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and 11% in the first nine months of
2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The decreases were primarily due to
the realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, lower
related implementation costs, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The
nine-month 2009 decrease was partially offset by a $150 million milestone
payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb in first-quarter 2009 in connection with the
collaboration on apixaban. 

Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $5 million for third-quarter 2009, $78 million for
the first nine months of 2009, $108 million for third-quarter 2008, and $348
million for the first nine months of 2008. 

IPR charges of $20 million for the first nine months of 2009 relate to the
resolution of a contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX. IPR
charges of $567 million for the first nine months of 2008 primarily relate to
the acquisitions of Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX, Coley
Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and two smaller acquisitions related to Animal
Health. As a result of adopting the provisions of a new accounting standard for
business combinations issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
beginning January 1, 2009, IPR related to acquisitions after adoption will be
recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived intangible
assets. We made no acquisitions in the first nine months of 2009.

 (a)    Net interest expense was $198 million in third-quarter 2009 compared to net interest income of $186 million in the same period in 2008. The change is due primarily to net 
        interest expense recorded in third-quarter 2009 associated with our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on March 24, 2009 and $10.5 billion of senior     
        unsecured notes on June 3, 2009, primarily related to the acquisition of Wyeth. In addition, lower interest rates, partially offset by higher cash balances, contributed  
        to the increased net interest expense compared to the year-ago quarter.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (b)    In third-quarter 2008, we recorded litigation-related charges of approximately $900 million associated with the resolution of certain litigation involving our non        
        -steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medicines.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                  


5. Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income for third-quarter 2009 was 27.5%compared to 17.0%
in the third quarter of 2008, and in the first nine months of 2009 was 27.3%
compared to 13.8% in the first nine months of 2008. The higher tax rates for the
third quarter and first nine months of 2009 are primarily due to the increased
tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the
Wyeth acquisition and the change in geographic mix of expenses incurred to
execute our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by a tax benefit of
$174 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to the final
resolution of a previously disclosed agreement-in-principle with the U.S.
Department of Justice to settle investigations of past promotional practices and
certain other matters. This resulted in the receipt of information that raised
our assessment of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our
tax position. The higher tax rates were also partially offset by the decrease in
IPR charges, which generally are not deductible for tax purposes. The lower
tax rate in the first nine months of 2008 reflects tax benefits of $305 million
related to favorable tax settlements for multiple tax years and $426 million
related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies, which were both
recorded in the second quarter of 2008. 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 31.8% in third quarter 2009,
29.9% in the first nine months of 2009, 22.3% in third-quarter 2008, and 21.4%
in the first nine months of 2008. The higher tax rates on adjusted income(1) in
2009 are primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain
business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. The lower tax rate
in the first nine months of 2008 reflects $305 million in tax benefits related
to the resolution of tax issues noted above.

 (a)    Guidance in the table above includes projected results of operations for Wyeth, in accordance with Pfizer`s international and domestic year-ends. Therefore, the guidance 
        includes approximately one-and-a-half months of the fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of Wyeth`s international operations and approximately two-and-a-half      
        months of the fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of Wyeth`s U.S. operations. This guidance does not assume the completion of any other business-development      
        transactions, including divestitures, not completed as of September 27, 2009, and excludes the potential effects of litigation-related matters not substantially resolved 
        as of September 27, 2009.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 (b)    Includes estimated amounts that are dependent upon certain valuations and other studies of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Wyeth that have yet to        
        commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. Accordingly, the estimated purchase accounting impacts are preliminary 
        and may not be indicative of actual amounts that will be recorded as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. Differences       
        between the preliminary estimates reflected in this guidance and the final acquisition accounting will likely occur and could have a material impact on the guidance      
        presented above.                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 (c)    Includes restructuring and implementation costs incurred for Pfizer legacy cost reduction initiatives through the closing date of the Wyeth acquisition. Does not reflect 
        an estimate for subsequent restructuring and implementation costs associated with Pfizer legacy cost reduction initiatives. The Company will include an estimate for      
        acquisition-related restructuring and integration costs in its full-year 2010 financial guidance in conjunction with its fourth-quarter 2009 earnings release in January  
        2010.                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 (d)    Includes certain costs incurred in connection with the Wyeth acquisition since the announcement of the agreement to acquire Wyeth on January 26, 2009 through the         
        acquisition close date including, but not limited to, pre-integration, transaction and financing costs. Due to the recent timing of the acquisition close, the 2009

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration Provides Enterprise Class Key Management with Host-based
Encryption that Eliminates Previous Cost, Implementation, and Interoperability
Barriers
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Emulex Corporation (NYSE:ELX) today announced that it is collaborating with IBM
to deliver a host-based encryption solution based on the Emulex Secure Host Bus
Adapter (HBA) technology and IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager. This solution
will change the way enterprises secure data by providing a cost-effective,
easy-to-use solution that protects data outside the server, no matter where it
goes, for data in-flight on the network and for data at-rest on disk arrays.
Emulex will be previewing this solution at the RSA Conference Europe this week. 

"Enterprise key management is an essential feature that security-conscious
companies demand. Emulex and IBM are taking this to the next step by
collaborating on the newly developed Key Management Interoperability Protocol
(KMIP)," said Steve Daheb, chief marketing officer and senior vice president of
business development, Emulex. "With this combined solution, IT managers will
have a seamless standards-based encryption solution that will enable them to
achieve maximum enterprise-wide data center protection, without impacting server
performance, delivering better security at a cost point well below other data
encryption approaches." 

The powerful combination of Emulex Secure HBA technology, the first host-based
encryption security solution that offloads encryption processing onto the HBA to
protect data in flight and at rest, and IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager, an
enterprise-class key management application that centralizes and strengthens the
key management process, delivering the first storage solution that moves
encryption as close to where the data is used as possible, delivering the
encryption solution that customers need to address the numerous compliance and
regulatory requirements that impact the business. 

"IBM is committed to bringing solutions to market with partners, such as Emulex,
that help our customers improve service, reduce costs and better manage risk and
compliance issues," said Venkat Raghavan, director of security, risk and
compliance, IBM security software. "By combining market leading IBM Tivoli Key
Lifecycle Manager with Emulex`s host-based encryption solution, customers can
minimize the risk of loss or breach of sensitive information and facilitate easy
compliance management of regulatory standards that are becoming increasingly
stringent. This is a powerful, standards-based step for providing security for
both virtualized and cloud environments." 

Implementing a host-based encryption security solution improves the data
center`s security stance and minimizes the window of data vulnerability, because
data is protected where it`s created, in the host. With Emulex Secure HBAs,
companies benefit from cost-effective, enterprise class security, buying
expensive appliances that don`t scale or adding unneeded complexity. Emulex
Secure HBAs enable end-users to move away from CPU (Central Processing Unit)
intensive host-based encryption software that may either hobble their servers or
inhibit the deployment of virtualized servers. 

Emulex Secure HBA technology leverages field-proven, virtualization-tuned,
high-performance Fibre Channel Storage Area Network (SAN) connectivity, allowing
customers to extend their existing investments in infrastructure, management,
training and processes. Emulex is previewing this ground-breaking, enterprise
class security solution at the RSA Conference Europe 2009 this week in London at
the Hilton London Metropole in its booth B6.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has reached collaboration agreements with Twitter and Facebook to get their members' public status updates and messages indexed and presented in useful ways on the Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president of Microsoft's Online Audience Business, made the announcement on stage at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership with Twitter has it working with Microsoft to optimize how Bing crawls and indexes "tweets." Microsoft in turn will apply search algorithms to the Twitter messages, so that Bing users will not only be able to see a real-time feed of "tweets" but also rank them by how relevant they are to their query, Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a big deal we've been working on for a long time," Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rank "tweets" by relevance, a feature Microsoft calls "Best Match," Bing will take into consideration a number of factors, such as who are the authors of the messages based on a "social relevance" score Bing will assign to them, Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing will also evaluate the message's quality, noticing, for example, if it contains a link to an online article or Web page. It will also take into consideration how popular the message is by calculating how many times it has been "re-tweeted" by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing links to Twitter messages, Bing will extract the URLs of the pages that the messages are making reference to, so that users can go directly to that source of the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When providing links to "tweets" that contain a shortened URL, Bing will put in parenthesis the main Web domain of the link, so that users know, before clicking, whether it's a reputable site and thus avoid landing in a malicious phishing or malware-laden site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing will also display a tag cloud of the most popular Twitter topics, so that users can click on and dive deeper into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twitter deal is nonexclusive, and hours later rival Google announced its own agreement with Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the past few years, an entirely new type of data has emerged -- real-time updates like those on Twitter have appeared not only as a way for people to communicate their thoughts and feelings, but also as an interesting source of data about what is happening right now in regard to a particular topic," wrote Marissa Mayer, Google's vice president of search products and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that our search results and user experience will greatly benefit from the inclusion of this up-to-the-minute data, and we look forward to having a product that showcases how tweets can make search better in the coming months," her blog post reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it seems Bing is for now ahead of Google with an optimized search experience for Twitter that is already live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Google remains by far the most popular search engine, Microsoft is making a big push to improve its position in this market, starting with Bing's launch in May and the broad search deal with Yahoo, which is awaiting regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its core microblogging and social-networking features, Twitter has emerged as a repository of real-time testimonies on whatever is on people's minds, such as news stories of global importance, celebrity gossip and hot-button issues. As such, being able to capture, analyze and make sense of Twitter's stream of posts is seen as an important new area in the world of search engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're super happy with the Twitter partnership," said Qi Lu, president of Microsoft's Online Services Division, who was also on stage being interviewed by conference moderator Tim O'Reilly. Lu declined to disclose financial details of the deal. He also said he wasn't sure on its duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Mehdi nor Lu said much about the Facebook arrangement, other than to indicate that it will be similar in nature to Twitter's but that it will be implemented at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see what shape the Facebook agreement takes, considering that Facebook allows individual members to make only basic profile information available via search engine results. Facebook has indicated it may let members make their profiles open to anyone on the Web, including their status updates, but that hasn't happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, on the other hand, is a much more open service and most of its users make public their "tweets," messages that can't be longer than 140 characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook expects its deal with Bing to become active early next year, a Facebook spokeswoman said via e-mail. Before Bing can make Facebook status updates searchable, Facebook has to first roll out to all users its new Publisher Privacy Control system, which is now being tested with a small group of users, the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As you may recall, the new Publisher Privacy Control enables users to define who can see the content they publish on a per-post basis. For example, they may want to make some posts available to everyone, while restricting others to their friends and family," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Facebook have an existing partnership through which Microsoft provides Web search and search ads to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

We believe he violated the law," Arturo Corrales, a lead negotiator for Micheletti, said. The team said they had heard nothing from Zelaya's camp in 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelaya angered Honduras' business leaders by moving the country closer to Venezuela's socialist president, Hugo Chavez. Micheletti's government accused Chavez and Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega of fomenting violence in Honduras with inflammatory rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Honduran police announced further restrictions on protests, saying they must be authorized by the government 24 hours in advance with a request detailing the people in charge and the time and route the march will take, in an effort to quell near daily rallies in favor of Zelaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Deborah Charles and Anthony Boadle in Washington and Adriana Barrera, Ines Guzman and Gustavo Palencia in Tegucigalpa; Writing by Mica Rosenberg)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM's lawyers have a busy winter ahead of them as Big Blue attempts to fight off antitrust accusations related to its mainframe business and an IBM employee faces allegations of insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest tech crime stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice has issued formal requests for information related to a complaint lodged by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) about IBM's actions in the mainframe market, as the IDG News Service reported Oct. 8. In a separate incident, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week charged IBM executive Robert Moffat with insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat, the head of IBM's Systems and Technology Group, was placed on a leave of absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Blue will suffer a blow to its reputation, but ultimately survive these legal problems, says Bob Djurdjevic, a longtime industry analyst who founded Annex Research in 1978, and was an IBM employee for eight years performing technical, sales and management functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there's any company that's always been a model of pristine behavior, being above it all, it was IBM," Djurdjevic says. "I don't think it will have an effect on IBM's business because it has deep talent. However, it is a black eye to IBM's reputation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Djurdjevic writes that IBM is dealing with "triple trouble," referring to the two legal incidents and a beating taken by IBM stock. Out of the three, the insider trading allegation "probably hurt the most," he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the IDG News Service, "Moffat allegedly provided insider information when IBM was considering acquiring Sun Microsystems to Danielle Chiesi, a portfolio manager at New York-based New Castle Funds. Chiesi allegedly made trades on behalf of New Castle Funds based on the tips and generated about $1 million in illegal profits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Djurdjevic notes that "accused doesn't mean convicted," but he writes about what seems to be a negative shift in IBM culture. Oct. 16 may go down as a "Black Friday" in IBM history, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When this writer worked for IBM in the 1970s, we had to be holier than thou," he writes. "No disparaging of competition. No special deals. Selling only at list prices. &#8230; Being lily white and pure as mountain spring water was ingrained as part of the Big Blue culture. No longer. Not after what Bob Moffat, senior IBM vice president in charge of all of company's hardware, has been accused of doing -- passing proprietary company information to his Wall Street co-conspirators for personal gains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for IBM's mainframe problem, the company is accused of refusing to issue licenses for its z/OS mainframe operating system to competitors. The CCIA trade group says this alleged tactic is limiting competition and preventing mainframe customers from finding less expensive alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT analyst Joe Clabby criticizes the CCIA complaint in an article titled "Mainframe Monopoly?" for a weekly newsletter issued by the Pund-IT research firm. One could argue that IBM does have a monopoly, owning more than 90% market share in the mainframe world, Clabby writes. But a mainframe is a type of server, and "mainframes represent only .03% of the server market by volume," he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if IBM has a monopoly, that doesn't automatically make the company guilty of anti-competitive behavior, Clabby continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, the biggest question on the table is whether other vendors should have a right to deploy z/OS on other platforms," Clabby writes. "If allowed to do so, competing vendors could undermine IBM's mainframe pricing structure by delivering lower-cost alternatives to mainframe hardware. And, to us, that would be unfair."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice has not commented on the complaint, so it's difficult to tell when it will be resolved. The Moffat case could be tied up in the court system for months or years, as is typical with large criminal investigations. Moffat was one of six people charged with insider trading, a group that included an Intel executive, and there could be more arrests coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM continued on its usual path this week, announcing software for management of virtual servers and a desktop package to compete against Microsoft's Windows 7. Whether Big Blue's legal troubles bring any long-lasting harm to the company remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

Ab heute k&#246;nnen die Verbraucher die endg&#252;ltigen drei Reisenden w&#228;hlen, die 206
L&#228;nder besuchen werden, in denen Coca-Cola verkauft wird
ATLANTA, USA--(Business Wire)--
Zahllose Menschen haben sich schon einmal ein Jahr frei genommen, um zu reisen,
aber niemand ist bisher zu einer Reise wie dieser aufgebrochen - 206 L&#228;nder,
eine Strecke von 150.000 Meilen (241.400 km) in nur 365 Tagen. 

Von Aruba bis Zimbabwe und fast jede Nation dazwischen - ein Team bestehend aus
drei jungen Menschen wird den Versuch antreten, 206 L&#228;nder, in denen Coca-Cola
verkauft wird, zu besuchen, um herauszufinden, was die Menschen gl&#252;cklich macht,
und um dieses Gl&#252;ck und diesen Enthusiasmus mit dem Rest der Welt zu teilen. 

Unter dem Titel &#8218;Expedition 206` wird dieses das ganze Jahr 2010 dauernde
Abenteuer die Open-Happiness-Kampagne von Coca-Cola zum Leben erwecken, w&#228;hrend
die Reisenden Menschen aus verschiedenen Kulturen besuchen, ihre Erfahrungen
dokumentieren und w&#228;hrend der gesamten Reise ihre Geschichten des Gl&#252;cks

Auch die Menschen online werden rund um die Welt an jedem Schritt der Reise eine
entscheidende Rolle spielen. Dies beginnt mit der M&#246;glichkeit, das Team
auszuw&#228;hlen, das sie auf die Expedition schicken m&#246;chten. Nach aufwendiger Suche

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Google Inc secured separate agreements to access real-time content from Web phenomenon Twitter, intensifying their battle for a search market that Google dominates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, and Microsoft's 5-month-old Bing, each announced deals to access Twitter's store of public data in real time on Wednesday, in the latest sign of escalating competition between the two search engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-expected deals are expected to ramp up the efficacy and lure of search results, by allowing users to scan real-time Tweets: 140-character stream-of-consciousness messages that Twitter hosts on its popular website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The back-to-back announcements underscored how real-time data in search results is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground in the search arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled its deal with Twitter and provided an on-stage demonstration of the newly-launched product at the Web 2.0 conference in San Francisco Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours later, Google announced on its company blog its own agreement, promising that Twitter messages, or Tweets, would be incorporated into search results "in the coming months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies would not disclose financial terms. Microsoft also announced a deal to include content from social network Facebook on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the timing of twin announcements, Google Vice President of Search Products Marissa Mayer told Reuters deals between fast-growing companies like Google and Twitter take a long time to come together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not something that happens on the scale of hours, it's something that happens on the scale of months," she said. Google's addition of Twitter data will fill a "critical gap."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whenever there's new data that's emerging, and growing as fast as we're seeing with Twitter, it's really about making sure that we have the content so we can search for it and find it for our users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, the 3-year-old Web start-up that has become an Internet sensation popularized by celebrities and government, attracts tens of millions of visitors every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, it received a $100 million round of financing that valued the company at $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Twitter has yet to generate significant revenue from its free service, though it has mentioned advertising and premium features as potential ways to make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AN INTERNET PHENOMENON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi Lu, president of online services at Microsoft, said data from Twitter could provide "signals" about which content on the Web is most popular and most relevant to search queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can use those to augment today's search experience," Lu told a San Francisco Internet conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Wednesday, Twitter search results will be accessible on a special section of Bing as a beta, or test product. Microsoft plans to present the most popular Tweets of the moment, while allowing Web surfers to view Twitter messages that contain links to other Web content. Microsoft will filter out spam and other extraneous data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said data from Facebook would be available in Bing at an unspecified later date. The Facebook deal encompasses only messages that its 300 million-plus users have flagged as viewable to the public, a practice that is relatively new and not as widespread on the social network, where users typically send messages to groups of friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook Chief Operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said no money changed hands in the deal between Facebook and Microsoft, during a separate presentation at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As searchers are looking for more and more real-time Web results, we think this partnership will help Bing to improve its user experience," said JP Morgan analyst Imran Khan in a note to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also inked a deal this year to entwine its search efforts with Yahoo's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's chief technology officer, Ari Balogh, told reporters that, generally speaking, any data Microsoft's search engine has access to also would be accessible to Yahoo under the terms of their partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has been testing the limited inclusion of Twitter messages within search results to certain users, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All content on the Web is relevant to search," Balogh said. He thought people would not want to go to three or four sites to access different types of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Richard Chang and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

it's something that happens on the scale of months," she said.
Google's addition of Twitter data will fill a "critical gap."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whenever there's new data that's emerging, and growing as
fast as we're seeing with Twitter, it's really about making
sure that we have the content so we can search for it and find
it for our users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twitter, the 3-year-old Web start-up that has become an
Internet sensation popularized by celebrities and government,
attracts tens of millions of visitors every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, it received a $100 million round of financing
that valued the company at $1 billion, according to people
familiar with the matter. Twitter has yet to generate
significant revenue from its free service, though it has
mentioned advertising and premium features as potential ways to
make money. [ID:nN25512246]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AN INTERNET PHENOMENON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Qi Lu, president of online services at Microsoft, said data
from Twitter could provide "signals" about which content on the
Web is most popular and most relevant to search queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You can use those to augment today's search experience,"
Lu told a San Francisco Internet conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From Wednesday, Twitter search results will be accessible
on a special section of Bing as a beta, or test product.
Microsoft plans to present the most popular Tweets of the
moment, while allowing Web surfers to view Twitter messages
that contain links to other Web content. Microsoft will filter
out spam and other extraneous data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said data from Facebook would be available in
Bing at an unspecified later date. The Facebook deal
encompasses only messages that its 300 million-plus users have
flagged as viewable to the public, a practice that is
relatively new and not as widespread on the social network,
where users typically send messages to groups of friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook Chief Operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said no
money changed hands in the deal between Facebook and Microsoft,
during a separate presentation at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As searchers are looking for more and more real-time Web
results, we think this partnership will help Bing to improve
its user experience," said JP Morgan analyst Imran Khan in a
note to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also inked a deal this year to entwine its search
efforts with Yahoo's (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo's chief technology officer, Ari Balogh, told
reporters that, generally speaking, any data Microsoft's search
engine has access to also would be accessible to Yahoo under
the terms of their partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo has been testing the limited inclusion of Twitter
messages within search results to certain users, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All content on the Web is relevant to search," Balogh
said. He thought people would not want to go to three or four
sites to access different types of data.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft this week rolled out the red carpet for the upcoming SharePoint 2010 collaboration platform. This release offers tight integration with the Visual Studio 2010 platform and a host of other functions such as offline support. SharePoint Server 2010 goes into a beta release next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's Microsoft SharePoint 2009 conference in Las Vegas sold out, attracting 7,400 persons. During the conference, InfoWorld editor at large Paul Krill talked with Jeff Teper, Microsoft corporate vice president of SharePoint Server, about the new release and its relationship to the open source movement, as well as other aspects of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Also on InfoWorld: At the conference, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer offered his perspectives on SharePoint and IT as a driver of economic recovery. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: You mentioned SharePoint as a Swiss Army Knife for IT. Would you elaborate on that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Teper: In the past you had to buy a separate product for document management and Web publishing and portals and search and blogs and wikis, and SharePoint 2007 brought all those capabilities together in a single product. I think that's something no other vendor has done. And SharePoint 2010, we added a lot of depth to each of those capabilities. I don't think there's anybody else out there that's got a single product with, say, wikis and business intelligence portals in the same offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Do you really think there's nothing out there that competes with SharePoint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: We get compared to everything from Facebook to SAP. But at the same time, we do think there is no single offering in the market that is anywhere near as broad as SharePoint, that we bring more capabilities together in an integrated Web solution than anybody else by far. I think that's a fair statement. That's different than saying  we have everything that all the other guys have combined. I think we have the most of anything by far, but we don't have everything everybody else has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: How does SharePoint compete with something like open source when it seems like everybody's talking about open source, even Microsoft to a degree? Is Microsoft concerned about somebody coming up with an open source answer to SharePoint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: That's part of the success of SharePoint. People will target it from different sides, so there are going to be some open source solutions. The ones that are out there tend to cover a small percentage of what we do, just like how OpenOffice tried to compete with Office. It's a validation of the success. I don't think there's anything out there in the open source world that's competitive to SharePoint from an all-out perspective, but I would expect a lot of activity from that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: What open source products would compete?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: A lot of them are toolkits for building Web sites, which are sort of lower level than SharePoint. A few years ago, there were some things called Plone and Zope that were open source Web publishing systems, but those have sort of gone by the wayside. Basically, the things that come closest have been PHP toolkits for building Web sites, but they really don't do as much as we do for the full set of publishing and collaboration tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Is there any chance of Microsoft open sourcing anything in SharePoint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: No. What we've done is actually foster a community on top. So if you go to CodePlex, I think there's 800 or 900 open source projects out there in the industry building on top of SharePoint, which we think is great. We're not huge fans of, say, the security model of SharePoint being open sourced or the Web publishing model. It's sort of like where Office and Windows and so forth are. We think the business model where we invest sort of $1 billion in Ramp;D and monetize that as a good business model, but that all the value add around it, we definitely think there's a role for open source. And we're fostering this CodePlex community that's got upward of 1,000 apps already built on SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Now these are open source applications that function with SharePoint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: Yes. [Examples include] different kinds of Web Parts [widgets] that get stock quotes or the weather, administration tools that help clean up your sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: What are the advantages to using SharePoint over other technologies for e-commerce or a Web site?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: First and foremost, it saves people money. Kraft.com is running their Web site, actually a lot of Web sites on SharePoint and they saved $2 million in doing that. So the biggest thing is people are focused on saving money right now, and then the second is the ease of use. Businesspeople want to get their content out to their commerce site faster than they do today. SharePoint makes that easier than traditional homegrown Web publishing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: How does Kraft know they're saving $2 million?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: They looked at the cost that they were spending to build, license, and maintain their various existing sites and compared that to what they are spending on SharePoint and added up the difference. It's not hard if you've got 10 different systems and you look at them and say, "Wow, I've written 10 different systems, tons of custom code, I'm going to move them all to SharePoint and write some code," but not as much to look at the software savings and the development savings and have it add up to be that amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Are there any capabilities for developing SharePoint applications using PHP, IronRuby, or IronPython?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: Not so much directly, but what we've tried to do is, through things like Web services and REST and Atom, expose standard protocols for SharePoint so that you could build apps in front of it on Windows Server. So if you wanted to write something in IronPython and Windows Server, you could, but also, just on any system, if somebody's got a Linux PHP-based Web site, they're going to be able to call SharePoint via REST or SOAP or any other of the mechanisms we have. Part of the approach has been to open up SharePoint data for any back end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: What if I wanted to develop a major e-commerce site with SharePoint. Would I be limited with PHP or IronRuby or IronPython?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: No. Think of it as all the APIs are the same. It's just within Visual Studio we give you the wizards, the things that generate code for you. You'd have to write that code yourself in PHP, so there's no limit. It's just that we give you the better development tools in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: What's the price of SharePoint 2010?&#160; Is that determined yet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: It's not announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: But it's been determined?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: It's been determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Is it going to be higher than the 2007 version of SharePoint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: I would not characterize [it as] that. For the most part, no. We announced today that there will be a version for the Internet that's actually going [to have] a much lower price point today. What we announced today is a new SharePoint for Internet Sites [standard edition] that's priced lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: SharePoint 2010 is limited to 64-bit systems, which means you can only use it on which Windows platforms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: We run on Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2, and we need to be running on a 64-bit operating system and 64-bit hardware, Intel or AMD 64-bit chips. Anything Intel or AMD has made for servers in the last couple of years is all 64-bit, so it's really not an issue except for the customers who are looking to use sort of four- or five-year-old hardware that may be 32-bit only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: What kind of access are you looking at for SharePoint as far as SharePoint access from phones?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: We have had a tuned experience for mobile browsers, which lets you see people, documents, do searches, view office documents on a mobile browser regardless of the platform. And then there's some extra work we're doing on Windows Mobile to let that work in a disconnected way. So if you want to take your SharePoint documents onto the device and, say, you don't have connectivity. You're sitting on the plane in airplane mode and you want to look at that PowerPoint presentation, you can do that on Windows Mobile. But the primary thing we've done this round is broad mobile browser support, so if you're on a BlackBerry, etc., with a mobile browser, you'll be able to view your SharePoint content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: There was a mention of additional browser support. Is that just referring to mobile or is there more for desktop browsers also?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: [We will support] Firefox, Safari and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Do you support those now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: In SharePoint 2010 we do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: What about in SharePoint 2007?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: With more caveats, yes in 2007. There's a list of features that work better in Internet Explorer in 2007, and in 2010 that list is basically gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: There was some mention of limitations on the Macintosh as far as SharePoint. Can you tell me what those are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: There's sort of two things on the Mac. One is accessing SharePoint in a Safari browser, which we now do in a richer way. The second is Office on Windows, [which] as you can imagine, has some capabilities Office on the Mac doesn't, including just making it easy to open and save documents to a SharePoint site directly from the Office client. A while ago, the Mac Office team released an update so that Mac Office can open and save documents to SharePoint as well. That's not new for SharePoint 2010, but it was something that didn't exist when we released SharePoint 2007 three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Are there any security issues with running SharePoint Online, the cloud version of SharePoint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: No. If anything, I think because we're very rigorous about the approach to security and companies are going to find we're going to have a better lockdown security plan than they can often afford to do themselves in their own IT department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: What's the link between the Windows Azure cloud platform and SharePoint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: That both of them run in Microsoft's cloud, as part of Microsoft Online. There'll be some interesting places where SharePoint takes advantage of some Azure technology. You might want to build an app in Azure and connect it to SharePoint as a front end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Wouldn't you just redeploy SharePoint onto Azure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: We'll go into details on that later next year. But directionally, yes, there'll be some Azure services that SharePoint builds on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Are there any features you wanted to get in SharePoint 2010 that didn't get in there that might get in in a future version?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: I think the list of things we got in is long enough that we have a hard time getting people to digest it. But we're not done. We've got more to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Microsoft is promising it's not going to be difficult to upgrade to SharePoint 2010. You mentioned that Visual Upgrade tool for upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: Obviously, the simplest upgrade we could do is [if] you didn't even notice it got upgraded, and so that was the design point. And then let people turn on their new features as they're ready. So that's the goal. A big part of the beta process is to have people -- imagine the 7,000 people here going home, getting the beta in November, trying it out with upgrade, and telling us whether it worked or not. And we'll address that feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfoWorld: Now if a customer wanted to know three or four reasons why he would want to move to the 2010 version if the 2007 version is working fine for them, what would you tell them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teper: It's a long list, so let me get it down to two or three. [One is] ease of use. You think about people collaborating all day long on the Web, the usability is just much better: the [Office] ribbon, the AJAX work, the Office integration, taking it offline. The second thing is the developer features. SharePoint turns into a really robust development platform this round with Visual Studio support and the sandbox. People who were building apps on SharePoint are now a lot more excited; it'll be much easier to do than on 2007. And then gosh, the third area is sort of pick your favorite feature: social networking, BI. I think the new My Sites [capability], for example, so you can track what's going on inside your company, all your colleagues, your interests, your expertise sort of flowing around the organization. I think that's a pretty mainstream thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of [My Sites] as a sort of Facebook for your company inside the firewall. It's actually existed [in SharePoint] since 2003, but we added so many more capabilities to it that it's going to feel like a major upgrade to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft SharePoint VP hails 'Swiss Army Knife' software platform," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian telecommunications company GVT GVTT3.SA hired the local investment banking units of Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to help it respond to takeover attempts by two global rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both banks would act as consultants to the Curitiba, Brazil-based company in the unsolicited bid by Telefonica (TEF.MC) and "other rival offerings or transactions," GVT said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal of this is to advise the board of directors in this process to maximize shareholder value," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GVT said in September it was approached by French media giant Vivendi (VIV.PA) for a possible combination. Telefonica launched an unsolicited $3.7 billion takeover bid for GVT, outmatching Vivendi's proposed $3 billion offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies see GVT as a perfect fit to capture high-usage and high-margin customers in Brazil, Latin America's largest telecommunications market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GVT rose 0.5 percent to 49.50 reais on Wednesday. The shares have almost doubled this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Web 2.0 Conference, San Francisco--Microsoft confirmed today that it has integrated Twitter tweets and Facebook status updates into its Bing search results. After a morning of speculation triggered by several blog posts predicting the news, Qi Lu, president of Microsoft's online services division, confirmed that the search deal had in fact taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's VP of Microsoft's online audience business group, Yusuf Mehdi, took the stage here to "demonstrate" the answer in what he called Bing "Wave 2".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to get access to all the public Twitter information in real time," Mehdi said, underscoring the breadth and implication of the deal. As for the Facebook deal: "The other deal we have done will come with all the publically available data on Facebook, and services from that will come at a later date."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the brief product demo, Mehdi showed a basic search in Bing for the name of a celebrity. Bing uses a set of algorhythms to bring you the most popular, relevant and useful tweets on the subject. The search results display the most recent tweets about the celebrity, as well as the most re-tweeted tweets. If there is a link contained in the tweet, Bing helpfully shows you the full URL of the place that link will take you--before you click it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehdi also demonstrated that you can now view entire Twitter feeds from inside Bing--no need to bounce over to Twitter. Bing also now features a tag cloud demonstrating the up-to-the-minute hottest topics on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While none of the companies involved in today's news would comment very much on the terms of the deals, the New York Times reports that Microsoft paid Twitter for the right to integrate tweets into Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Lu also confirmed that Microsoft's deal with Twitter is non-exclusive. That's important because Google has reportedly also been in talks with Twitter about integrating tweets; so such a deal can and may still happen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the Bing/Twitter development so far by visiting www.bing.com/twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/174050&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has reached collaboration agreements with Twitter and Facebook to get their members' public status updates and messages indexed and presented in useful ways on the Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president of Microsoft's Online Audience Business, made the announcement on stage at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership with Twitter has it working with Microsoft to optimize how Bing crawls and indexes "tweets." Microsoft in turn will apply search algorithms to the Twitter messages, so that Bing users will not only be able to see a real-time feed of "tweets" but also rank them by how relevant they are to their query, Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a big deal we've been working on for a long time," Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rank "tweets" by relevance, a feature Microsoft calls "Best Match," Bing will take into consideration a number of factors, such as who are the authors of the messages based on a "social relevance" score Bing will assign to them, Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing will also evaluate the message's quality, noticing, for example, if it contains a link to an online article or Web page. It will also take into consideration how popular the message is by calculating how many times it has been "re-tweeted" by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing links to Twitter messages, Bing will extract the URLs of the pages that the messages are making reference to, so that users can go directly to that source of the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When providing links to "tweets" that contain a shortened URL, Bing will put in parenthesis the main Web domain of the link, so that users know, before clicking, whether it's a reputable site and thus avoid landing in a malicious phishing or malware-laden site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing will also display a tag cloud of the most popular Twitter topics, so that users can click on and dive deeper into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twitter deal is nonexclusive, so Twitter can strike similar agreements with other search engines. However, for now, Bing is ahead of Google with an optimized search experience for Twitter that is already live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Google remains by far the most popular search engine, Microsoft is making a big push to improve its position in this market, starting with Bing's launch in May and the broad search deal with Yahoo, which is awaiting regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its core microblogging and social networking features, Twitter has emerged as a repository of real-time testimonies on whatever is on people's minds, such as news stories of global importance, celebrity gossip and hot-button issues. As such, being able to capture, analyze and make sense of Twitter's stream of posts is seen as an important new area in the world of search engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're super happy with the Twitter partnership," said Qi Lu, president of Microsoft's Online Services Division, who was also on stage being interviewed by conference moderator Tim O'Reilly. Lu declined to disclose financial details of the deal. He also said he wasn't sure on its duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Mehdi nor Lu said much about the Facebook arrangement, other than to indicate that it will be similar in nature to Twitter's but that it will be implemented at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see what shape the Facebook agreement takes, considering that Facebook allows individual members to make only basic profile information available via search engine results. Facebook has indicated it may let members make their profiles open to anyone on the Web, including their status updates, but that hasn't happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, on the other hand, is a much more open service and most of its users make public their "tweets," messages that can't be longer than 140 characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Facebook have an existing partnership through which Microsoft provides Web search and search ads to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Google Inc have sealed separate agreements to access real-time content from Web phenomenon Twitter, intensifying their battle for a search market that Google now dominates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft's 5-month-old Bing search engine, which hopes to take on the current leader, both won access to Twitter's store of public data in real time, executives at the two companies said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-expected deals are expected to ramp up the efficacy and lure of search results, by allowing users to scan real-time Tweets: 140-character stream-of-consciousness messages that Twitter hosts on its vastly popular website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft appeared to one-up its rival Google, which controls 65 percent of the search market, with a deal also to include content from social networking site Facebook, one of the Internet's most visited addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deals -- which were non-exclusive -- were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the past few years, an entirely new type of data has emerged -- real-time updates like those on Twitter," said Marissa Mayer, Google's vice president of search products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have reached an agreement with Twitter to include their updates in our search results. We believe that our search results and user experience will greatly benefit from the inclusion of this up-to-the-minute data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, the 3-year-old Web start-up that has become an Internet sensation popularized by celebrities and government, attracts tens of millions of visitors every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi Lu, president of online services at Microsoft, said data from Twitter could provide "signals" about which content on the Web is most popular and most relevant to search queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can use those to augment today's search experience," Lu told a San Francisco Internet conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AN INTERNET PHENOMENON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Wednesday, Twitter search results will be accessible on a special section of Bing as a beta, or test product.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO Oct 21 (Reuters) - Brazilian telecommunications
company GVT GVTT3.SA hired the local investment banking
units of Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to
help it respond to takeover attempts by two global rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Both banks would act as consultants to the Curitiba,
Brazil-based company in the unsolicited bid by Telefonica
(TEF.MC) and "other rival offerings or transactions," GVT said
in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The goal of this is to advise the board of directors in
this process to maximize shareholder value," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GVT said in September it was approached by French media
giant Vivendi (VIV.PA) for a possible combination. Telefonica
launched an unsolicited $3.7 billion takeover bid for GVT,
outmatching Vivendi's proposed $3 billion offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both companies see GVT as a perfect fit to capture
high-usage and high-margin customers in Brazil, Latin America's
largest telecommunications market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GVT rose 0.5 percent to 49.50 reais on Wednesday. The
shares have almost doubled this year.

&lt;p&gt;Rumors are swirling that Microsoft will announce search deals with Twitter and Facebook today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few news outlets, such as the Business Insider and All Things Digital reported today that the deals will be announced soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefan Weitz, a product planning director at Microsoft, declined comment during his keynote address at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Things Digital reported that Microsoft is going to announce separate and non-exclusive deals with Twitter and Facebook. Microsoft, it reported, will integrate the social networks' real-time status update feeds into Bing's search service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi Lu, head of Microsoft's online services division, could be announcing the deal during another Web 2.0 Summit keynote later today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, reports surfaced that both Google and Microsoft have been wooing Twitter to ink a deal with the microblogging site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most noteworthy thing to come out of Microsoft product planning director Stefan Weitz's keynote at the Web 2.0 Summit this morning was what he didn't talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While conference officials had been touting Microsoft's plan to preview Bing for Mobile during the presentation, Weitz opened his speech by disclosing that he wouldn't be talking about the upcoming iteration of the Bing search engine for mobile devices. And for the most part, he kept his word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only at the end of the presentation did Weitz turn to mobile technologies and about a future when a video camera inside a mobile phone could be used to scan stores, buildings or famous places and get pertinent information. For instance, he said that one could one day wave a mobile phone in front of Pete's Coffee shop and immediately get a rating for the coffee. Then the user can use the device to compare that rating to one for the coffee sold in his hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mobile has tremendous legs and it's very exciting," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting off his presentation, though, Weitz talked about issues surrounding the building of a new search engine, or decision engine as Microsoft likes to call Bing , in a market dominated by rival and search behemoth Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a competitor in place. They're pretty good. They have good share. When you're the number three player, how do you break through?" said Weitz. "When a competitor has a lot of mind share ... people don't necessarily think they need another [search engine], how are we going to get any traction?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled its Bing search tool in June in the hopes of giving Google some competition . And Bing, which replaced the unpopular Microsoft Live Search engine, has already shown some strength, grabbing enough market share to to sit in third place behind Yahoo in second. Google owns more than 60% of the market, according to multiple researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts generally say that while Bing isn't keeping Google executives up at night, it is giving them something to think about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite facing the daunting and expensive challenge of going up against Google, Weitz told attendees that Microsoft was drawn to the business by a constantly steady increase in Internet searches. Between February 2008 and February 2009 the search business grew by 8%, according to Weitz. He said the rate of growth is impressive considering that search is second only to e-mail in online activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weitz said that Microsoft engineers focused on the results of a survey he said found that only 65% of people said are satisfied with the results of their searches. "What is causing a third of people to be really unsatisfied with search today?" he asked. Weitz didn't identify who undertook the survey or how many people were polled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The actual success rate for people doing these queries is actually quite low," said Weitz. "When you stop and think through the things that you do that aren't answered by a single result, there is a lot of ping pong of search. People do a search, get to the results page, click on a link, realize it's not the link they wanted and then go back. Twenty-five percent of clicks lead to a 'back' click."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weitz said in moving ahead, the Bing team is focusing on augmenting results with more information and more visual results. Just last month, Microsoft gave Bing a beta version of Visual Search, which is designed to let users search through galleries of images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of headroom in search," he added. "When we know you're looking for an artist or a city, how can we augment that information that we can crawl across the web? How can we give you better answers?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The de facto Honduran government stood firm on Wednesday against letting ousted President Manuel Zelaya back to power, even as Washington froze visas to add pressure on leaders of a June coup to back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roberto Micheletti's caretaker government also imposed restrictions on street protests, which are mainly pro-Zelaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We obviously believe that (Zelaya's return) is not possible. We believe he violated the law," Arturo Corrales, a lead negotiator for Micheletti, said as the latest round of talks sputtered to a halt over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exiled Zelaya has been holed up at the Brazilian Embassy since sneaking back into Honduras last month. Overnight, the caretaker government sent the army to play loud rock music, military band tunes, church bells and recordings of pig grunts over loudspeakers outside the embassy, a Reuters photographer inside the embassy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Organization of American States, which convened the latest talks between Zelaya and Micheletti's camps, condemned the actions -- sparking a swift rebuke from Micheletti's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very worried about the situation at the Brazilian Embassy," OAS head Jose Miguel Insulza said in Washington. "The problem is hostile gestures, loud noises at night, provocations ... we will continue denouncing this treatment," Insulza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micheletti's government -- whose response to Zelaya setting up a base in the Brazilian Embassy was to surround it with soldiers and threaten to arrest Zelaya if he goes outside -- called Insulza's comments an "inappropriate intervention" in the negotiation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crisis in Honduras has become a headache for President Barack Obama, who had pledged better relations with Latin America. Regional governments worry he is not doing enough to pressure Micheletti, who took power after the Supreme Court ordered Zelaya's ouster, saying he violated the constitution by seeking support for re-election. Zelaya denies the charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Honduran police announced restrictions on protests, saying they must be authorized by the government 24 hours in advance with a request detailing the people in charge and the time and route the march will take, in an effort to quell near daily rallies in favor of Zelaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department has suspended the visas of senior figures that backed the coup, spokesman Charles Luoma-Overstreet said on Wednesday. It marked the second time Washington pulled diplomatic and tourist visas over the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This action is a reflection of the seriousness and urgency with which the U.S. government takes the need for the de facto regime to reach an agreement with President Zelaya to restore the democratic order," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human rights groups accuse the de facto rulers of major abuses, including deaths, and say an election scheduled for November 29 will not be legitimate after Micheletti slapped temporary curbs on media freedoms and protests last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Deborah Charles and Anthony Boadle in Washington and Adriana Barrera, Ines Guzman and Gustavo Palencia in Tegucigalpa; Writing by Mica Rosenberg)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In the course of routine surveillance, Fitch Ratings upgrades the rating on the
Florida Community Services Corporation of Walton County, Florida (FCSC)
outstanding $38.3 million of water and sewer revenue bonds to 'A+' from 'A'. The
Rating Outlook is Stable. 

The upgrade to 'A+' reflects an improvement in FCSC's financial metrics. Over
the last few years FCSC's liquidity position has increased substantially, both
because of strong operations as well as certain land sales. While draws on
reserves to fund the capital improvement program (CIP) over the near future are
expected, FCSC's liquidity position should remain solid. 

The 'A+' rating is based on the FCSC's strong liquidity, solid debt service
coverage, and sound legal provisions. Also considered in the rating are the
moderate capital needs for a growing system and relatively limited economy,
which includes a strong tourism and retiree component. Despite significant
growth pressures leading up to the housing bubble, FCSC has performed well. With
growth pressures moderating, the prospect for continued steady financial
performance is enhanced. 

FCSC is a non-profit, single-purpose entity that owns, operates and leases back
its assets to Walton County (the county). FCSC is essentially the sole provider
of water and sewer services to the southern portion of the county serving and an
estimated 50,000 people. Customer growth has averaged 6% for water and 8.7% for
sewer over the last five years. However, more recent growth rates for fiscal
2008 and 2009 were only 1% for both water and sewer customers. 

Bonds are secured by a pledged of the trust estate, which includes net revenues
and impact fees of the system. Debt service coverage and liquidity levels are
strong. Debt service coverage from pledged revenues including impact fees has
exceeded 3.5 times (x) coverage for the last three fiscal years and 2.5x
coverage without impact fees. Coverage is projected to remain strong despite the
decline in impact fees. Liquidity levels, which exceeded four years cash on hand
for fiscal 2009, are anticipated to decline moderately over the next few years
to support the current CIP but should continue to be strong. FCSC also maintains
large balances in restricted reserves related to the renewal and replacement
fund and impact fees fund; these restricted balances will fund the bulk of the
CIP. 

FCSC's moderate $31.5 million CIP reflects the ongoing needs of the system
caused by the growth of the service area. Major projects consist of a new
wholesale pipeline, a storage tank and a wastewater expansion project. The
pipeline will provide redundancy service to existing customers and additional
wholesale service to water customers in Destin and the South Walton Utility.
Current system capacity provides sufficient room for moderate growth, with both
water and sewer systems operating at 50% capacity. Debt levels are projected to
remain moderate even as FCSC continues with its pay-as-you-go financing of the
CIP but should ultimately decline over time; no additional debt currently is
forecasted. Both residential water and sewer rates have experienced modest
increases in recent years between 2%-3%, with the exception of fiscal 2009 in
which rates were held constant. FCSC is projecting 3% rate increases annually,
which should continue to provide solid coverage while maintaining an adequate
level of affordability. 

Walton County is located on the panhandle of Florida's Gulf coast. The service
area is located in southern part of the county, which is economically driven
from tourism and retirees. Unemployment levels remain below both state and
national averages and have not shown volatility to typical seasonal tourism
based economies. Wealth levels are on par with the state and nation.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, Oct 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Further distinguishing itself from its competitors, N-able
Technologies(R), the global leader in remote monitoring and management
software for managed service providers (MSPs) and IT departments, today
announced its new N-central(R) 7.0 technology offers full support for the
highly anticipated Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 7 operating system and Windows
Server 2008 R2.

    Available worldwide in December 2009, N-able's N-central 7.0 managed
services software, which includes new enterprise-class endpoint security
capabilities and an industry-first hybrid licensing model that features
free licenses, is fully compatible with Microsoft's new Windows 7
operating system. In addition, N-central 7.0 supports Windows Server 2008
R2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Internet Explorer 8.0 and
Firefox 3.5.

    Rob Bissett, director of product management for N-able, says the
interoperability of N-central 7.0 and Windows 7 is seamless and has been
extremely well received by N-able partners currently running N-central 7.0
in a limited field trial production environment.

    "We received great feedback about N-central 7.0 at our recent Partner
Summit in Arizona and the fact that it is Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2
ready is big news to our partners and prospects, especially those who are
on the cutting edge of technology innovations and eager to migrate their
own businesses -- as well as their clients' infrastructure -- to Windows
7," says Bissett.

    David Geffeney, vice president of operations for The IT Utility Company,
an N-able MSP partner that has been beta-testing N-central 7.0 for several
weeks now, says he is very pleased with the new feature set and excited
about the Windows 7 support.

    "Clearly N-central 7.0's compatibility with Windows 7 stands out immensely
and is one of the primary reasons we see so much value in the new managed
services toolset available from N-able," says Geffeney, whose company is
based in Irvine, California. "We're very impressed with the overall
simplicity, functionality and performance of N-central 7.0 and are eager
to take it mainstream."

&lt;p&gt;   * Says sales are outpacing 2008 highs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says getting additional orders from customers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says to start longwall mining in December&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Antonita Madonna Devotta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Walter Energy Inc (WLT.N)
said its year-to-date sales volumes are exceeding the record
levels reached in 2008, and demand for steelmaking coal has
shown no signs of reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The coal miner expects to supply about 6.4 million tons of
hard coking coal in 2009 compared with 5.8 million tons sold in
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In short we returned to a situation where our sales are
limited not by customer demand, but by our production and
inventory," Chief Executive Victor Patrick said on a conference
call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter, which posted a strong third-quarter profit, expects
to sell about 1.6 million to 1.7 million tons of coking coal in
the fourth-quarter, whereas production may range between 1.4
million and 1.5 million tons only. [ID:nBNG527363]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it expects to begin longwall mining in one
of its mines by mid-December and will likely hit full capacity
by January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Longwall mining is a form of underground coal mining where
a 250 to 400 meters long wall of coal is mined in a single
slice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is pretty clear that business is obviously getting
better for Walter... they are in a dramatically different
situation than they were in about 3 to 6 months ago," analyst
Daniel Mannes of Avondale Partners LLC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, Walter had closed its loss-making home
building and finance subsidiary to focus on natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company's comments were bullish. This is a situation
where the expectations were quite high...When you look at the
performance of the stock, I think that bears it out," the
analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company, which were down 2 percent in early
trade, are trading flat at $65.56 Wednesday afternoon on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has revoked the visas of more Hondurans to pressure the de facto government to end a three-month political crisis, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Visas of coup supporters revoked * Honduran army blasts Brazilian Embassy with loud music (Updates with details from Brazilian Embassy) WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The United States has revoked the visas of more Hondurans to pressure the facto government to end a three-month political crisis, a U.S. official said on Wednesday. The Honduran government is in talks to resolve the impasse created by a June 28 military coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya, who has returned to Honduras and taken refuge in the Brazilian Embassy. State Department spokesman Charles Luoma-Overstreet said the department had canceled visas for a number of Hondurans who are members and/or supporters of the de facto regime. This action is a reflection of the seriousness and urgency with which the U.S. government takes the need for the de facto regime to reach an agreement with President Zelaya to restore the democratic order, Luoma-Overstreet said.

Later revocations included tourist visas for others linked to the de facto government. Luoma-Overstreet would not say how many visas were canceled in the latest round on Monday. Talks to resolve the crisis in Honduras have sputtered with both sides stuck on the question of whether Zelaya can return to the presidency before a November election. Honduras is President Barack Obama's biggest challenge in Latin America and some critics say the United States is not doing enough. Human rights groups accuse the de facto rulers of major abuses, including deaths, and say a free and fair election would be impossible unless Zelaya is reinstated first. Zelaya, a logging magnate who became an ally of leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez while in office, has been camped out with his family and supporters at the Brazilian Embassy since sneaking back into the country last month. The army blasted the embassy with loud recordings of rock music, army marching tunes, pig grunts and church bells for six hours beginning shortly after midnight on Wednesday, said a Reuters witness inside the compound. (There is) worry about the increase in hostilities toward the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa which have intensified in recent days particularly during the night, said a statement from the head of the Organization of American States. Zelaya is calling on the OAS to condemn de facto leader Roberto Micheletti, who was installed by Congress after the coup, accusing him of deliberately obstructing the negotiations.

&lt;p&gt;  VISALIA, CALIFORNIA, Oct 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
This week, The Firkin &amp; Hound full service restaurant modeled after a
traditional neighbourhood English pub-is excited to announce the
reopening of its doors in Visalia. Former guests and those new to the pub
now have a new place to gather, raise a glass and "cheers" as The Firkin
&amp; Hound officially taps its first kegs, fires up the grill and opens its
doors to the community. 

    As a casual and comfortable neighbourhood establishment, The Firkin &amp;
Hound will serve an extensive lunch and dinner menu, a brunch menu on
weekends and a late night menu for Visalia's night-owls. The Hound will
also offer different specials daily, with set menu fare ranging from
traditional English pub dishes like Fish 'n' Chips, Cottage Pie and
Bangers, Beans &amp; Mash to signature items like the Firkin Angus Burger,
Jameson Salmon and Homemade Mac &amp; Cheese with Ham. When guests arrive at
the Hound however, they will not only be tempted by the traditional pub
fare but pint lovers will also enjoy sampling one of the 14 assorted
brews on tap. 

    The Firkin and Hound owner, Jim Phalan, decided to re-open the pub's
doors after being offered the opportunity to take over the once-popular
location. "Everyone I spoke with that used to frequent the Hound when it
first opened agreed-the pub was a great spot to have a quick lunch, enjoy
dinner with family or just to watch a game and have some beers with
friends. People enjoyed the fun decor and friendliness of the servers and
bartenders. With the addition of a patio, a pool table in "The Pound",
changes in the kitchen and a re-emphasis that the Hound is a traditional
English pub serving good food and good Firkin pints, I think the public
will really enjoy the re-opening of this local hot spot!"

    The kitchen changes to which Phalan refers is the hiring of Jose
Guevara-former executive chef of a Cheesecake Factory and Daily Grill
locations. Guevara brings his 20 years of restaurant experience to The
Firkin &amp; Hound to manage all kitchen operations and to better the dining
experience for all guests. They can also expect to see some of Guevara's
delicious off-menu creations as daily specials in the coming weeks.

    The Firkin &amp; Hound is a proud supporter of the community, looking to
sponsor local aid organizations, charitable programs and neighbourhood
sports teams.

    About the Firkin Group of Pubs

    Founded by Stanley Adelson and Ian Fisher, the Firkin Group of Pubs is
North America's largest growing chain of neighbourhood English-style pubs
- a welcoming place to meet friends for a pint, some fine food and a good
time. The concept for the franchise is based on creating an inviting pub
environment for each unique location, as well as combining an individual
name (such as that of an animal) with Firkin; a nine-gallon wooden barrel
used for storing ale. Today there are 31 Firkin pubs in Canada and 16 in
the U.S. with more than 175 pubs in development across North America.

    The Firkin Group of Pubs is headquartered in Markham, Ontario, Canada.

&lt;p&gt;Kiva.org, Project Lead the Way and Other Nonprofits Offer Innovative Approaches
to Economic and Social Challenges
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced the California Partnership, an
initiative to invest in education and economic development in its home state.
Under the new initiative, Chevron will expand and deepen its partnerships with
nonprofits focused on supporting underserved communities, including
relationships with 18 new nonprofit partners providing programs for education,
entrepreneurs and job training. Additional partners will be introduced
throughout the remainder of 2009. 

"Communities in California are facing extraordinary challenges accessing the
resources they need to be successful during these turbulent economic times,"
said Matt Lonner, manager of Global Partnerships and Programs at Chevron.
"Innovative partnerships between private and nonprofit organizations are needed
to invest in opportunities and solutions. Chevron`s California Partnership is a
renewed commitment on the part of our company to work with the organizations
that can deliver the programs that our communities need, and invest in the
future of our home state." 

The California Partnership represents a $7 million enhancement to Chevron`s
community engagement investments in the state, bringing Chevron`s total
investments in 2009 to approximately $28 million. Nonprofit partners receiving
funds from the California Partnership have demonstrated innovative approaches
with proven track records for delivering economic and educational benefits to
those in need. 

Among the organizations that are part of Chevron`s California Partnership is
Project Lead the Way, the nation`s leading provider of science, technology,
education and mathematics (STEM) education programs for middle school and high
school students. Project Lead the Way provides students with a foundation and
proven path to college and career success in STEM fields. With Chevron`s
contributions, Project Lead the Way - which currently reaches nearly 350,000
students - will be able to expand existing programs or introduce new
opportunities in the Bay Area, the San Joaquin Valley and the Los Angeles Basin,
where Chevron`s major business is concentrated. 

"Advancing STEM education in California and creating more opportunities for
today`s students is key to maintaining competitiveness in the global economy,
but it also hits much closer to home," said John Lock, CEO of Project Lead the
Way. "The widening gap in science, technology, engineering and math knowledge in
today`s students can only be addressed with a focused effort to deliver an
expanded curriculum that will give young people the opportunity for prosperity
in the fields that will drive the future growth of this state. Chevron`s
understanding of the importance of STEM has made this a natural partnership." 

Chevron`s California Partnership will also be supporting Kiva.org, the world`s
first person-to-person micro-lending website that allows individuals to make
small loans to entrepreneurs online. Chevron is making a contribution to
Kiva.org to assist in funding the organization`s operations as they continue to
build their innovative microfinancing platform, which is already available to
California small businesses and entrepreneurs. 

"California small businesses and entrepreneurs are facing unprecedented
difficulty in obtaining necessary business funding in this economic slowdown,
which can be the key to job creation and overall economic growth for the state,"
said Premal Shah, president of Kiva.org. "Chevron`s support through the
California Partnership will help Kiva.org continue to spur growth in small
businesses, which represent more than 87 percent of all businesses in the U.S." 

Other nonprofits supported through the California Partnership include Teach for
America, which will target new programs for Richmond schools, and WE Invest,
which provides tools and resources that help women become more financially
self-sufficient. 

Chevron`s California Partnership extends beyond investments in nonprofit
organizations, and includes volunteerism and training in local communities
throughout the state. Volunteerism remains a core value at Chevron and employees
in California dedicate their time to serve communities through the Chevron
Humankind program. In 2008, Chevron employees volunteered more than 16,000 hours
of time to their communities, and in this year`s company volunteer week, 2,550
Chevron employees in California rallied to work on 225 projects with 90
nonprofits, totaling nearly 9,000 hours of service. Each year, Chevron also
offers the Chevron Management Institute, a one-week leadership and management
skill training course available to nonprofit organizations in local California
communities. 

Chevron announced the California Partnership at an event in San Francisco on
Wednesday morning. As part of the event, Chevron hosted a panel discussing
innovative approaches to public-private partnerships featuring Chevron nonprofit
partners Kiva.org, DonorsChoose.org, Project Lead the Way and Teach for America.
A video of the discussion will be available online at: www.chevron.com/CA.

&lt;p&gt;analystView 3.0 Extends Most Widely Used Modeling Tool with Major Features,
Including Simulation
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Process and Document Management solutions provider Global 360 today announced
analystView 3.0, providing business analysts with process modeling and
simulation functionality within Microsoft Visio 2010, the latest release of the
most commonly used and accepted modeling tool worldwide. With this announcement,
Global 360 is the only leading Microsoft BPMS provider offering both Visio
simulation and end-to-end process and document management. 

With over 15 million Visio users in 35 languages, and with several key features
of Visio 2007 being incorporated into Visio 2010, Visio is becoming even more
widely accepted as a process modeling tool. Global 360 is leveraging its
persona-based approach to allow Visio users to work in environments that are
already comfortable and familiar to them; by incorporating major simulation
functionality, analystView 3.0 is making an already widely used and well-known
solution even more powerful. 

For the business analyst, analystView 3.0 brings modeling and simulation to
Visio 2010 and uses Microsoft SharePoint 2010 to enable process improvement
collaboration with a broader audience. By leveraging Visio as the process
modeler, Global 360 is making Visio 2010 an integral part of the BPM process
life cycle. It is bringing BPMN support to business analysts, simplifying the
simulation process, and making Visio models and simulation results more
accessible to the entire BPM community through native SharePoint-based
collaboration. Global 360 can now take millions of desktop-bound Visio process
models and make them fully-functioning, automated process and document
management applications. 

"The Global 360 solution now allows business analysts to iteratively fine-tune
process models while improving a business process. By extending the powerful
features of Microsoft Visio 2010, the user has the capabilities to perform
multiple "what-ifs" to optimize the process for highest return on investment and
lowest total cost of ownership," said Chris Crane, Director, Visio, Microsoft. 

By taking advantage of Visio 2010`s deep process modeling capabilities and
Global 360`s comprehensive, integrated simulation capabilities, analystView 3.0
users can import any one of the millions of Visio 2010 models into the BPM
execution layer and seamlessly convert them into executable processes. Every
version of a process map or model can be posted for collaborative discussion. 

"Global 360 is proud to continue its support for Microsoft Visio as a business
analyst's modeling tool, while also extending it to provide process simulation
in Visio 2010," noted Global 360 president and CEO David Mitchell. "Whether
you`re a Visio user who wants more capabilities in modeling and simulation or a
user of proprietary modelers who wants to go mainstream with the most widely
used process modeling tool, Global 360`s support of Visio 2010 enhances our
Persona-based BPM strategy, and does so with the common, familiar Microsoft user
experience already in use in thousands of companies." 

analystView 3.0 will be generally available simultaneously with the release of
Microsoft Visio 2010. Once generally available, Microsoft will make the product
available on the Microsoft Visio Toolkit product launch site. analystView 3.0
will also be available as a stand-alone plug-in to Visio 2010 as well as part of
Global 360`s BPMS offering.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 21 (Reuters) - The United States has revoked the visas of more Hondurans to pressure the facto government to end a three-month political crisis, a U.S. official said on Wednesday. The Honduran government is in talks to resolve the impasse created by a June 28 military coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya, who has returned to Honduras and has taken refuge in the Brazilian Embassy. State Department spokesman Charles Luoma-Overstreet said the department had canceled visas for a number of Hondurans who are members and/or supporters of the de facto regime. This action is a reflection of the seriousness and urgency with which the U.S. government takes the need for the de facto regime to reach an agreement with President Zelaya to restore the democratic order, Luoma-Overstreet said. The United States, which has condemned Central America's first coup in more than a decade, revoked a number of diplomatic and official visas after Zelaya's ouster. Later revocations included tourist visas for others linked to the de facto government. Luoma-Overstreet would not say how many visas were canceled in the latest round on Monday. Talks to resolve the crisis in Honduras have sputtered with both sides stuck on the question of whether Zelaya can return to the presidency before a November election.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Caterpillar Inc
(CAT.N) the stock to "neutral" from "sell" and bumped up its
price target by $16 to $64, citing improved cost control by the
company and a stronger outlook for construction equipment
demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Recent macro data foreshadows potential for a sharper
construction recovery and CAT's cost control has clearly
improved, benefiting from aggressive first-quarter actions,"
analyst Jerry Revich said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revich also expects strong commodity outlook to drive
capital expenditure in the mining sector and sees a jump in
global construction equipment sales as investments in the
construction market increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Stifel Nicolaus downgraded the stock to "sell"
from "hold," saying profit will rise only with sales in 2010,
offering little operating leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Caterpillar closed at $59.61 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Countless people have taken a year off to travel, but nobody has ever embarked
on a trip quite like this before - 206 countries, covering 150,000 miles in just
365 days. 

From Aruba to Zimbabwe and nearly every nation in between, a team of three young
people will attempt to visit 206 countries where Coca-Cola is sold to seek out
what makes people happy and share their happiness and enthusiasm with the rest
of the world. 

Dubbed `Expedition 206`, the year-long adventure throughout 2010 will bring
Coca-Cola`s Open Happiness campaign to life as the travelers visit with people
from different cultures, document their experiences and share stories of
happiness throughout their journey. 

People online around the world will play a critical role every step of the way,
beginning with the opportunity to choose the team they want to see on the
expedition. After an extensive search, Coca-Cola has selected nine finalists,
but fans will make the final decision by visiting www.Expedition206.com through
Nov. 6, 2009, to vote for their favorite candidates. Fans can vote once each day
throughout the three-week voting period. 

Beginning in Madrid on Jan. 1, 2010, and culminating with a celebration at the
World of Coca-Cola museum in Atlanta on Dec. 31, 2010, the story of the
happiness ambassadors and their adventure will play out online with content for
fans to follow via the expedition`s online headquarters at
www.Expedition206.com, as well as on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr and
other social networking sites. 

Fans engaging with the Expedition 206 Web site and other interactive online
content will serve as virtual travel agents for the expedition team, giving
suggestions on where they go, what they do and who they visit in each market.
The expedition will make stops in cities big and small, visiting everyday people
and marquee global events, such as the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games in
Canada, the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, and the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai,
China. 

The diverse group of candidates includes finalists from the United States,
Canada, China, Mexico, Australia, Germany, Belgium and Denmark.

today the results of tracking tens of thousands of online conversations
around the subject of Microsoft Windows 7. In a look at online
discussions over the last week in ten widely used forums, 25 review sites,
and four of the largest social networks, iYogi found that application
compatibility and migration by far topped the list, followed by
discussions around features and performance.

    Top ten issues, along with examples of actual quotes from each
conversation topic include:


1.  Application compatibility, portability and migration
    "Do I need to re-install Microsoft Office when I upgrade to Windows 7?"

2.  New Features
    "Does Windows 7 have the functionality of XP and appearance of Vista?"
    and "What's new with the Windows 7 task bar?"

3.  Performance
    "Is Windows 7 faster that XP or Vista?"

4.  Getting ready for windows 7
    "Is my computer ready for Windows 7 and is it good for running games?"

5.  User interface
    "Does Windows 7 look and feel like Mac?"

6.  Windows 7 Networking
    "Can I connect with my second computer that runs XP and also share
    my printer?"

7.  Windows 7 hardware compatibility
    "Will I need to re-install software again for my camera and phone?"

8.  Windows 7 Installation, setup and deployment
    "How much time will it take me to install Windows 7?"

9.  Price
    "Will the price for Windows 7 drop in the future?"

10. Media center
    "Can I make videos and does 7 have movie maker like XP?"

    
iYogi's tracking of online topics reviewed discussions in


--  Forums such as MSDN, TechNet, Yahoo Answers, Yahoo Groups, Google
    Groups, Google blog search, laptop forum, and notebook forums
--  Review sites like Amazon, BestBuy, buzzilions, CNET reviews, epinions,
    laptop community, newegg, notebook review, and product wiki
--  Social networks including facebook, Linkedin, Myspace &amp; Twitter
    

    
Polls conducted by iYogi have indicated that nearly 70 percent of
users are not entirely comfortable that they will be able to easily move
their favorite applications over to the new Windows 7 platform, and
nearly half expect to need more tech support help in order to do so.

    In order to address these questions and concerns, iYogi has built a
comprehensive website at http://windows7.iyogi.net with details on
Windows 7 features, migration utilities and support options, along with a
step-by-step guide to application migration. iYogi has more than 90,000

&lt;p&gt;Year-Long Journey to Seek out What Makes People Happy Will Be Documented Online
with Video, Photos and Blog Posts at Expedition206.com

Beginning Today Consumer Votes Will Determine the Final Three Travelers Who Will
Visit 206 Countries Where Coca-Cola is Sold
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Countless people have taken a year off to travel, but nobody has ever embarked
on a trip quite like this before - 206 countries, covering 150,000 miles in just
365 days. 

From Aruba to Zimbabwe and nearly every nation in between, a team of three young
people will attempt to visit 206 countries where Coca-Cola is sold to seek out
what makes people happy and share their happiness and enthusiasm with the rest
of the world. 

Dubbed `Expedition 206`, the year-long adventure throughout 2010 will bring
Coca-Cola`s Open Happiness campaign to life as the travelers visit with people
from different cultures, document their experiences and share stories of
happiness throughout their journey. 

People online around the world will play a critical role every step of the way,
beginning with the opportunity to choose the team they want to see on the
expedition. After an extensive search, Coca-Cola has selected nine finalists,
but fans will make the final decision by visiting www.Expedition206.com through
Nov. 6, 2009, to vote for their favorite candidates. Fans can vote once each day
throughout the three-week voting period. 

"Coca-Cola, enjoyed by people in more than 200 countries, has always tried to
express a positive view of the world," said Shay Drohan, senior vice president
of sparkling beverages, The Coca-Cola Company. "Expedition 206 gives us an
opportunity to celebrate that optimism and happiness on a global scale in a very
personal way. Sharing stories about what makes people happy is a unique way we
are bringing our 'Open Happiness' campaign to life." 

Beginning in Madrid on Jan. 1, 2010, and culminating with a celebration at the
World of Coca-Cola museum in Atlanta on Dec. 31, 2010, the story of the
happiness ambassadors and their adventure will play out online with content for
fans to follow via the expedition`s online headquarters at
www.Expedition206.com, as well as on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr and
other social networking sites. 

"This mash-up of social media - online photo galleries, video clips, blogs,
microblogs, social networking - combined with an amazing journey, enthusiastic
travelers and a theme of happiness is a great way for us to connect with people
around the world," said Adam Brown, director, Office of Digital Communications
and Social Media, The Coca-Cola Company. "The global adoption of social media
has given us a way to deliver a year-long reality TV series without the TV." 

Fans engaging with the Expedition 206 Web site and other interactive online
content will serve as virtual travel agents for the expedition team, giving
suggestions on where they go, what they do and who they visit in each market.
The expedition will make stops in cities big and small, visiting everyday people
and marquee global events, such as the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games in
Canada, the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, and the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai,
China.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc (CIT.N), a large finance company trying to avoid bankruptcy, reached a tentative agreement with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) over a disputed payment on a $3 billion loan, Dow Jones Newswires reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An agreement over the $1 billion "make whole" payment could be made final within 24 hours, the news service said, citing one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIT had no immediate comment. Goldman did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman would be entitled to the $1 billion payment under the $3 billion rescue package it provided in June 2008, six months before the U.S. government invested $2.33 billion in CIT through the Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIT lends close to 1 million small- and mid-sized companies. If it went bankrupt, the case would be one of the five largest U.S. bankruptcies, based on reported assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A settlement could help the New York-based company as it conducts a large debt exchange in an effort to avoid bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the corporate raider Carl Icahn offered to underwrite a $6 billion loan to CIT, saying he was the company's largest creditor and could offer better terms than other lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIT shares closed Thursday unchanged at $1.12 on the New York Stock Exchange. They rose to $1.20 after-hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Steve Eder)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google cofounder and President of Technology Sergey Brin made a surprise appearance at the Web 2.0 Summit on Thursday, answering a variety of questions on hot-button issues affecting the search company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewed on stage by conference chairman John Battelle, Brin lamented Yahoo's decision to enter into a search outsourcing deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's a shame Yahoo plans to abdicate that area because they were doing interesting things," Brin said about the deal, which calls for Yahoo to turn off its back-end search crawling and indexing systems and instead use Microsoft's Bing to power its search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brin declined to say whether he thinks government regulators should or shouldn't approve the Yahoo-Microsoft deal, but he complimented Yahoo on what he called interesting innovations in search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since announcing the deal, Yahoo executives have gone to great lengths to say the company will remain a player in search by continuing to innovate at the user interface level, competing even against Bing for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked for his opinion on Bing, which Microsoft launched in May, Brin said he has used it, just like he uses all search engines, and that it also has interesting features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bing has reminded us that search is a very competitive market," Brin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big disappointment for him has been Google's delay in releasing a Mac OS version of its Chrome browser. "This delay is something many of us suffer through," Brin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mac OS version isn't even at a beta-test level yet, but rather at a much earlier stage of development, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brin reiterated his surprise at the acrimonious controversy that has surrounded the company's Book Search service since Google started scanning and digitizing millions of books from library collections without always obtaining permission from copyright owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google hammered out a settlement a year ago with U.S. authors and publishers, who sued it for copyright infringement in 2005, but the settlement came under heavy criticism and is being reworked, particularly because the U.S. Department of Justice recommended it be rejected by the judge overseeing the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm surprised at the level of resistance," Brin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he remains optimistic that the revised settlement, which is still in the works, will be approved and that Google will be able to proceed with its plan to make tens of millions of books available online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brin also said he takes exception to criticism from the publishing industry that Google has unfairly profited from the content of newspapers and magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pin the blame on Google for the publishing industry's problems is unfair, he said. How people consume content is changing across the board, a shift that isn't due to Google but to a larger technology evolution, he asserted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't agree with their conclusion but I hear their pain," Brin said, adding that it's important for major publications to remain financially healthy and to have sustainable business models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about Google's deal with Twitter to crawl and index its messages, Brin had little to add, but made a point of complimenting Twitter CEO Evan Williams. Williams also created Blogger, which helped launch the blogging revolution and was acquired by Google. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To see him go out and succeed even more dramatically a second time" reaffirms the impact tech entrepreneurs can have, Brin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams is also part of a network of Google "alumni," which makes it easier for Google to strike deals with the companies they go to and which fosters more trust between Google and those companies, Brin said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched Windows 7 on Thursday, its most important release in more than a decade, aiming to win back customers disappointed by Vista and strengthen its grip on the PC market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which powers more than 90 percent of personal computers, has received good reviews for the new operating system, which it hopes will grab back the impetus in new technology from rivals Apple Inc and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They met expectations but that was pretty much it," said Michael Gartenberg, a long-time Microsoft analyst at market research firm Interpret after a launch event in New York. "They showed off some very cool things, but now they have to keep the momentum going."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system -- which is faster, less cluttered and has new touch-screen features -- comes almost three years after the launch of Vista, whose complexity frustrated many home users and turned off business customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of Windows -- which accounts for more than half of Microsoft's profit -- is crucial for Chief Executive Steve Ballmer to revive the company's image as the world's most important software company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 7 is a chance for us to let the PC be not only more interesting but just simpler and faster for the many, many hundreds of millions of people who use them," Ballmer told Reuters Television in an interview on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW HARDWARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer and other executives demonstrated at the event a range of new devices showing off Windows 7, from ultra-slim laptops to large touch-screen computers, highlighting a new Kindle book-reading application from Amazon.com Inc and live-streaming CBS television shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowds lined up overnight to see the new software and check out the latest PCs at the first branded Microsoft store, which opened on Thursday in Scottsdale, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is charging $199.99 for the Home Premium version of Windows 7, or $119.99 for users seeking to upgrade from older versions of the operating system -- well below comparable prices for Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also has a range of offers in conjunction with retailer Best Buy Co Inc and PC makers such as Dell Inc and Acer Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. holiday season will soon reveal whether consumer PC sales get a kick from Windows 7, but success with corporations -- the key to Microsoft's financial power -- will not be clear until next year, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 sales will not immediately impact the bottom line of Microsoft, which is expected to post a lower quarterly profit on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares closed up 1 cent at $26.59 on Nasdaq. They are up 79 percent since early March. (For a graphic showing major Windows releases and Microsoft's share price, click here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHARES UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global PC sales rose 2.3 percent in the third quarter compared with a year ago, according to research firm IDC, after two quarters of declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market-watchers are betting on further recovery of computer sales next year, as the economy improves and businesses replace old machines, but opinion is divided on how strong the impact of Windows 7 will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the chance to encourage corporations to update their computers, to get families to upgrade or put in a second or third computer," Ballmer told Reuters TV. "I am optimistic, but we have the economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That won't necessarily happen, said Brendan Barnicle at Pacific Crest Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's going to be really interesting is whether this spurs a hardware replacement cycle or it's just a Windows replacement cycle," said Barnicle, who estimates that more than 820 million PCs across the world run Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Additional reporting by Jim Finkle, Wojtek Dabrowski, Bobbi Rebell and Gabriel Madway; Editing by Tiffany Wu, Richard Chang and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sales rise 5.5 percent driven by pay TV&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Net hit by increase in income taxes
 (Adds details on cable, satellite operations)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Oct 22 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa
posted a slight decline in third-quarter net profit on Thursday,
hit by higher income taxes, but revenue rose 5.5 percent boosted
by its pay television units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX), known around the world
for its tear-jerking soap operas, earned 2.014 billion pesos
($149 million) in the July-September period, down 2.6 percent
from the year-ago quarter and a tad below market expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quarterly revenue rose to 13.150 billion pesos from 12.459
billion pesos in the same period a year ago, helped by its cable
units Cablevision (CABLECPO.MX) and Cablemas as well as its
satellite TV subsidiary SKY. Analysts polled by Reuters were
expecting revenue of 13.015 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SKY direct-to-home sales rose 9.2 percent in the third
quarter, reflecting the success of a new, cheaper programming
package aimed at countering the advance of rival Dish Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dish, which hopes to end this year with a one million
subscriber base, has dented Televisa's expansion rate in
pay-television services, prompting the media giant to rethink
its marketing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cable quarterly sales rose 10.6 percent on the back of
triple-play packages that bundle television, telephone and
Internet services for a low price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Core broadcast television sales fell nearly 2 percent due to
an unfavorable comparison with the year-ago results, when
Televisa reported extraordinary income from the Summer 2008
Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa shares fell 1.32 percent to close at 52.45 pesos on
Thursday before earnings results were disclosed.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today launched a promotion that discounts Windows 7 upgrades as much as 58% when customers also buy a new Windows 7 PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which was available Thursday from the likes of Amazon.com and Staples, applies when consumers purchase a new computer equipped with Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staples, for instance, will sell a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade for $49.99, a 58% savings compared to the $119.99 list price, when buyers also purchase a new Windows 7 PC. Amazon, on the other hand, dropped the price of Home Premium Upgrade to $59.95, a savings of $60, or 50%. Under the promotion, Amazon also cut the price of Professional Upgrade to $115.99, an $85 savings (42% off) and Ultimate Upgrade to $139.99, an $80 savings (36% off) when customers ordered a new Windows 7 notebook or desktop at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Baker, an analyst with the NPD Group, which specializes in tracking retail sales, called the promotion "brilliant" in a blog post this morning. "It gives incentive to some of that huge XP installed base to do the right thing and upgrade into a new PC, while offering them a way to cost-effectively upgrade that companion notebook they have bought in the last two and one-half years. which is running Vista," Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 7 is even greater the more PCs that you have that run it," Baker said in a follow-up interview. "People aren't likely to go out today and buy multiple new PCs, but this is a great way to drive the value of Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker called out Home Group , a new feature in Windows 7 that simplifies the task of setting up file-, printer-, photo- and music-sharing between Windows 7-equipped PCs on a home network, as one reason to upgrade as many home computers as possible to the new operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, one discounted copy of Windows 7 Upgrade can be bought per new PC, with the discount applicable to the same version as that which powers the PC. In other words, buyers of a new PC running Windows 7 Home Premium can purchase an upgrade copy of Home Premium at the discounted price, while consumers who buy a PC with Windows 7 Professional can get an upgrade copy of that edition at the reduced price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon, however, appears to be offering buyers of any Home Premium-, Professional- or Ultimate-equipped PC the discount for any of the three editions' upgrades. Buyers can order a notebook running Home Premium, for example, but buy an upgrade to Professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some buyers are ineligible for the deal, however. New machines running the entry-level version of Windows 7, dubbed Starter, don't qualify, essentially preventing most purchasers of netbooks -- which are dominated by Windows 7 Starter -- from taking advantage of the promotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discounted upgrade deal expires Jan. 2, 2010, and applies to consumers in the U.S. and U.K, as well as those in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, New Zealand, Poland and Slovakia. . Microsoft and its retail partners also started selling the $149.99 Windows 7 Family Pack today. The package lets buyers upgrade as many as three PCs from Windows XP or Vista to Windows 7 Home Premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;College students are eligible for a separate offer that prices Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade at $29.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. has acquired systems management vendor Opalis Software Inc. for about $60 million, according to an analyst report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brenon Daly, an analyst with The 451 Group, blogged earlier this week about the deal, citing unnamed financial and industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VC-backed Mississauga, Ontario, startup was making about $10 million a year from sales of software for automating IT processes, according to Daly. It also partnered with Microsoft in the spring (download PDF) , integrating its software into Microsoft's System Center management platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daly's report was echoed by blogs and tweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a spokeswoman, Microsoft said it is not commenting on rumors and speculation. Opalis, meanwhile, did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opalis' CEO Todd DeLaughter was previously general manager of Hewlett-Packard's OpenView systems management division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daly said the Opalis acquisition would be the fourth in this space in the last two years. HP bought Opsware for $54 million in 2007, while BMC Software Inc. acquired RealOps for $53 million. CA Inc. bought Optinuity last year. One key difference, he said, was that Opalis' revenue appeared to be higher than its counterparts at the time of acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCOTTSDALE, Ariz (Reuters) - The idea that hundreds of people would line up outside anything to do with Microsoft would have been far-fetched only a few years ago -- but on Thursday that's what happened when the software giant opened its first retail store in Scottsdale, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 500 people, some of whom had camped out all night, waited in line for the opening of store the Fashion Square Mall in this upscale city, where they were met with cheers by staff wearing Microsoft T-shirts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has at least partially succeeded in changing opinion about its lack of coolness, helped by positive reviews for its new Windows 7 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a good idea to give consumers a warm and fuzzy (feeling) about using an operating system...

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched Windows 7 on Thursday, its most important release in more than a decade, aiming to win back customers disappointed by Vista and strengthen its grip on the PC market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which powers more than 90 percent of personal computers, has received good reviews for the new operating system, which it hopes will grab back the impetus in new technology from rivals Apple Inc and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They met expectations but that was pretty much it," said Michael Gartenberg, a long-time Microsoft analyst at market research firm Interpret after a launch event in New York.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer hopes that home users who like Windows 7 will help spark corporate adoption of the new operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who unveiled the latest version of Microsoft's flagship software at a crowded event in New York on Thursday, needs corporations to adopt Windows 7 after the failure of its predecessor Vista to win over the lucrative business market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Employees are going to come in saying, 'I want Windows 7 -- I've got it at home,'" Ballmer told Reuters Television in an interview at the launch on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The combination of those factors and the productivity it gives people at work will definitely be a propeller."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many companies are running old computers with the aging Windows XP operating system, after skipping Vista, which had early problems meshing with other programs and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7, which has been greeted with largely positive reviews, could be a catalyst to get people and businesses to upgrade and buy new computers, said Ballmer, depending on the course of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's "tough to predict because of the economy," he said. "But certainly it's the chance to encourage corporations to update their computers, to get families to upgrade or put in a second or third computer. I am optimistic, but we have the economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer touted new PCs running Windows 7 as the economical choice over generally more costly Apple Inc (AAPL.O) machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's particularly affordable in this economy and certainly as we look at our No. 1 competitor, affordability is a real advantage for the Windows 7 PC versus alternatives based on Macintosh."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bobbi Rebell; Writing by Bill Rigby; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK told a federal judge on Thursday that JPMorgan should be forced to return more than $4 billion to the bankrupt holding company, whose bank was seized by regulators and sold to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual Inc attorneys argued in a bankruptcy court that records and depositions show the disputed money was on deposit at the holding company's banks when they were seized last year in the biggest bank failure in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for JPMorgan  Chase Co (JPM.N) and federal regulators described Washington Mutual Inc's bookkeeping as a "shell game" that would require more evidence to determine if the money was a deposit or some other form of transaction, such as a capital contribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge, Mary Walrath, said she would take the issue under advisement and issue a decision at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp seized the banking operations of Seattle-based Washington Mutual in September 2008 and immediately sold them to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion. The thrift's holding company filed for bankruptcy protection the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue on Thursday and subject to hundreds of pages of briefs and hours of depositions was more than $4 billion in deposits that Washington Mutual Inc said was held by Washington Mutual Bank fsb and Washington Mutual Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not a single witness, not a single witness says the most obvious and fundamental thing, that the funds belong to JPMorgan," said David Elsberg, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel which represents Washington Mutual Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan attorneys argued that they have not had an opportunity to question top decision makers at Washington Mutual Inc about what they said were questionable transactions, some taken on the eve of the bank failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Sacks an attorney with Sullivan and Cromwell which represents JPMorgan, described other transactions by Washington Mutual in which deposits were recharacterized as loans and back to deposits in the space of days for regulatory reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He questioned why a $3.67 billion deposit was moved between two banks owned by the holding company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why did they move that money. How do we know it was not a capital contribution? We haven't been able to talk to the people who moved that money," said Sacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDIC also weighed in, arguing against the request for summary judgment that would force JPMorgan to turn over the funds. The attorney for the agency said it could, as receiver of the banks, demand a return of the deposit to itself under the agreement to sell the banking operations to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge will also have to weigh the value of competing claims which could offset part of the value of the deposit.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Morgan Stanley Finally Profits

Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) reported third-quarter 2009 income of $498 million
this morning or 38 cents per share, compared with a loss of $159 million or
$1.37 per share in the prior quarter and an income of $7.7 billion, or $7.38 per
share a year ago. The results were much ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of
30 cents per share. 

The results marked the first quarter of income in a year`s time. Results were
aided by robust underwriting revenues in the investment banking operation
resulting from higher levels of market activity, strong growth in fixed income
sales and trading, commodities, prime brokerage and wealth management business,
which offset losses in commercial real estate. 

Unlike the preceding quarters, the results were in line with strong results from
competitors like Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), which has been grabbing market share
after the financial crisis. 

St. Jude Beats Zacks Estimate

St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE: STJ) today reported financial results for the
third quarter of 2009 before the market opened. Earnings per share came in at 59
cents, compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents and the year-ago
earnings of 54 cents. 

Net sales in the reported quarter increased 7% year over year to approximately
$1.2 billion. Excluding an unfavorable foreign exchange translation (FX), net
sales increased 10% year over year. Growth was witnessed across all the business
segments. However, the company`s domestic revenues were below expectation
primarily due to lack of purchase of cardiac rhythm management (CRM) devices by
roughly 50 hospitals in the U.S. 

St. Jude`s cash and cash equivalents stood at approximately $798.3 million at
the end of the reported quarter. The company ended the quarter with an
outstanding debt of roughly $2.0 billion. 

St. Jude has provided earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter and
full fiscal 2009. For the fourth quarter, earnings per share are expected
between 61 and 63 cents. For full fiscal 2009, earnings per share are expected
between $2.41 and $2.43. 

St. Jude is a leading medical devices manufacturer that designs, manufactures
and distributes medical devices to treat cardiovascular and neurological
conditions. 

Presently, St. Jude Medical holds the #2 market position for ICDs and pacemakers
behind Medtronic Inc. (NYSE: MDT) but ahead of Boston Scientific Corporation
(NYSE: BSX). This segment is the company`s largest in terms of revenues. St.
Jude also holds the #2 market position behind Medtronic in neuromodulation.

recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from the Pros

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

US Bancorp Exceeds Estimates

US Bancorp (NYSE: USB) has reported third quarter earnings of $603 million or 30
cents per share. Results were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents,
and reflected higher revenue and an increase in fee income. 

However, credit losses and nonperforming assets continued to trend higher in the
quarter, reflecting continued stress in the commercial, commercial real estate,
residential real estate and consumer loan portfolios. We note that the rate of
deterioration has somewhat moderated in the quarter. 

Quarterly results were, however, impacted by a $415 million of provision for
credit losses in excess of net charge-offs, net securities losses of $76 million
and a gain of $39 million associated with the company`s investment in Visa Inc.
(NYSE: V). These items reduced earnings by 19 cents per share. 

Results for the quarter were driven by record total net revenue of $4.3 billion,
representing an increase of 2.2% sequentially and 25.8% year-over-year. Results
reflected a growth in interest income and fee income. 

Credit metrics continued to deteriorate in the quarter, though the rate of
deterioration has moderated. Net charge-offs were 227 basis points (bps) of
average loans outstanding, up 24 bps sequentially and 108 bps year-over-year. 

Non-performing assets as a percentage of related assets were 2.39%, up 19 bps
sequentially and 151 bps year-over-year. As a result, provisions for credit
losses increased to $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion reported in the prior quarter
and $748 million in the year-ago period. 

Genzyme Misses &amp; Slashes

This morning, Genzyme Corp (Nasdaq: GENZ) reported third quarter earnings of 19
cents per share, which was well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents
and the year ago earnings of 93 cents. Moreover, revenues declined 9% to $1.06
billion. 

As expected, the temporary shutdown of the company`s Allston manufacturing
facility earlier this year impacted overall financial results. Although the
company has resumed production at this facility, the temporary shutdown led to a
disruption in the supply of key products Cerezyme and Fabrazyme. 

Cerezyme`s performance was highly affected with sales dropping 69.7% to $93.6
million in the reported quarter. Fabrazyme sales came in at $115.2 million, down
8% from the prior-year quarter. Genzyme expects to resume supply of new lots of
Cerezyme and Fabrazyme from late November and late December, respectively. The
company believes it will be in a position to meet anticipated demand for both
products in the first quarter of 2010. 

However, we believe Cerezyme, which is approved for the treatment of Gaucher
disease, could lose some share to Shire plc`s (Nasdaq: SHPGY) velaglucerase alfa
and Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc.`s (NYSE: PLX) Uplyso, both of which are
currently available under the US Food and Drug Administration`s (FDA) expanded
access program. 

We believe the availability of these two products, which have yet to receive FDA
approval, could eat into a part of Cerezyme`s patient base. Once launched, both
products will compete directly with Cerezyme. Although Genzyme holds a leading
position in the treatment of Gaucher disease, the patient population for the
disease is not large. As such, the entry of additional players in the market
could restrict its growth opportunities in the future.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Eli Lilly Beats, Raises Guidance

This morning, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (NYSE: LLY) reported strong third quarter
financials. The company`s earnings per share of $1.20 surpassed the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of $1.02 and 98 cents reported in the year-ago period.
Revenues recorded a 7% year on year increase to $5.56 billion, driven by an
increase in both volume and prices, partially offset by unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange. 

Of total revenues, while product sales were $5.4 billion (an increase of 6%),
collaboration and other revenues accounted for the remaining $176.5 million (an
increase of 51%), primarily due to the inclusion of Erbitux revenue as a result
of the ImClone acquisition. 

The company`s other products recorded robust growth during the quarter compared
to the year-ago period - Zyprexa (3% growth to $1.2 billion), Cymbalta (10%
growth to $790.2 million), Humalog (16% growth to $500 million), Alimta (47%
growth to $462 million). 

Wells Fargo Surprises Yet Again

Before the market opened Wednesday morning, Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) reported
third quarter 2009 diluted earnings of 56 cents per common share, compared with
57 cents in the second quarter 2009 and 49 cents in the third quarter 2008. 

Net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $2.6 billion, almost
flat compared with the prior quarter and up 61.1% year-over-year. The results
were substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents per share. 

Results were aided by strong top-line growth across all key business segments,
strong deposits and a robust loan growth rate. Unlike its major peers, Wells
Fargo witnessed strong growth in its traditional banking operations, especially
in its mortgage business acquired from Wachovia. Net interest income of $11.7
billion climbed 83.1% year-over-year. 

However, credit quality deteriorated further and losses rose sharply during the
quarter. The bank expects credit losses and non-performing assets to increase
further, though some moderation was visible. Net charge-offs rose to $5.1
billion (2.50% of average loans) from $4.4 billion (2.11%) in the prior quarter
and $2.0 billion (1.96%) in the prior-year quarter. Non-performing assets grew
to $23.5 billion (2.93% of loans) from $18.3 billion (2.23%) in the prior
quarter and $6.2 billion (1.53%) in the prior-year quarter. 

Credit-loss provisions were $6.1 billion, up 144.9% from a year earlier and
20.2% from the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses totaled $24.5
billion at Sept. 30, 2009, compared with $23.5 billion at June 30, 2009 and $8.0
billion at Sept. 30, 2008. 

Large banks including Wells Fargo, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC),
Citigroup, Inc. (NYSE: C) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) have suffered
from the increase in loan losses which were offset by strong growth in trading
operations.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has certainly stolen the show today. Paired with the release of the much-anticipated Windows 7 OS and the opening of the first Microsoft Store in Scottsdale, Arizona, Microsoft began selling PCs and third-party software on the store's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers for sale come pre-loaded with Windows 7. And, in an odd gesture, the company is also selling a few Netbooks -- low-cost PCs that Microsoft has battled vigorously in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft opened its online store back in November and only sold Microsoft products. Now all that has changed, quite possibly to increase the visibility and influence of Windows 7, an OS Microsoft finally seems proud of. Usability has increased as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Trevin Chow, Senior Lead Program Manager for Microsoft Store, in a blog post: "We initially launched the online store last November, and since then we have had nearly a years worth data coming in from usability studies, web analytics, and direct customer feedback. Based on all of this data, coupled with the newly expanded product catalog, one of the biggest goals we had in this release was to simplify site navigation for our customers. With the new site, you'll notice a re-designed categorization, navigation and filtering system aimed to make it easier and faster to navigate as well as help you find products you want more quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only is Microsoft selling PCs, it is also pushing its Xbox 360 video game console and games, and the new Zune HD media player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pickings thus far are slim, and it's uncertain whether or not Microsoft will broaden its base to attract customers away from sites like Dell and Lenovo and back to the mothership. How much Microsoft is skimming off the top of sales is also undisclosed, but I imagine it's a decent chunk; otherwise the company would never have made the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/174141&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - U.S. and Guatemalan authorities captured a makeshift submarine loaded with an estimated 10 tonnes of cocaine in the Pacific Ocean off Guatemala, Guatemalan police said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four men aboard the vessel -- three Colombians and a Mexican -- were arrested when it was detained Wednesday night by U.S. anti-drug agents and the Guatemalan Coast Guard some 175 miles off Guatemala's Pacific Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the size of the seizure is confirmed, it would be the largest ever drug bust in Guatemala, which is becoming an important transit point for illegal drugs moved north by powerful Mexican trafficking cartels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug gangs operate with impunity in the jungles of northern Guatemala, where they receive shipments of South American cocaine and ship them across the border into Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's drug cartels have been moving into neighboring Guatemala as they seek to secure supply lines amid a brutal struggle for territory in Mexico that has claimed some 14,500 lives in the nearly three years since President Felipe Calderon came to power and launched an army crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-drug patrols in the waters around Central America have turned up at least two other large submarine-like vessels that can be as much as 59-feet long and carry sophisticated navigation equipment. The steel-and-fiberglass vessels run partially submerged in an attempt to evade radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Herbert Hernandez)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Customers like mix of hardware, in-store support&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Some say it 'rips off' Apple Inc's concepts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tim Gaynor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCOTTSDALE, Ariz, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) opened the first in a planned chain of stores on
Thursday, aiming to match rival Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) successful
foray into retailing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hundreds of people, some of whom had waited all night
outside the Fashion Square Mall in this upscale Phoenix valley
city, were met with cheers by staff wearing Microsoft
T-shirts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's fantastic," student Bobby Cramer said, shouting to
make himself heard above the scrum. "It's exciting to have ...
a place to go to where you can get the software and hardware
together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft had a short-lived experiment in retailing in San
Francisco's Metreon Center 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 500 customers picked over hardware including Xbox
360s, Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Dell Inc DELL.O laptops,
as well as the Windows 7 operating system, which launched on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft announced in February its plan to open stores,
hiring a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) executive to run
them. A second store is due to open in Orange County,
California, in coming days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft may have a way to go to emulate Apple's splashy
store openings and product launches. For example, when Apple
began selling its 3G iPhone in July 2008, thousands of people
camped outside stores from all over the world for days for the
chance to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "WARM AND FUZZY"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said last week that
through the stores, the company was looking to make a direct
connection with users, showing the "customer what you really
can do".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first shoppers through the doors clearly liked the
concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a good idea to give consumers a warm and fuzzy
(feeling) about using an operating system ... It will make
consumers feel better about their purchase," said Hafthor
Stefansson, an IT consultant who said he uses both Apple and
Microsoft systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In July, Microsoft's chief operating officer said the
company would open stores "right next door" to Apple stores.
The nearest Apple store to Scottsdale is several miles away in
Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're doing exactly what Apple did five years ago - the
concept's a rip off," said James Smith, 31, a cab driver who
turned out for the opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft might have come up with a better idea than
taking Apple's straight out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But videographer Erin Phoenix, a long-time Apple user
wearing an i-Phone T-shirt to the opener, said he thought the
result would be good for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are kind of copying the concept the Apple Stores have
of customer service ... (but) it will also give Apple more
competition."

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing search war between Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. is intensifying as both companies battle to outpace the other in real-time search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a dance of timing yesterday, both companies announced major real-time search deals at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Microsoft stole the limelight Wednesday morning when it announced deals with both Twitter and Facebook to include the social networks' status updates in Bing's search results . And as the conference chatter was all about how long it would take Google to sign its own deal to catch up with its search rival, Google came out later in the day to announce its own deal, not with Facebook, but with microblogging site Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These deals up the ante in the search wars , giving both Microsoft and Google new weapons to deploy against each other," said Dan Olds, principal analyst with The Gabriel Consulting Group. "Since they both have deals with Twitter, there's parity there and it becomes a matter of execution - which search engine does the best job of sifting through Twitter for the results the user wants?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was very spare in giving out any information on its deal with Facebook, but Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president of Microsoft's Online Audience Business, was more forthcoming about the deal with Twitter .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehdi said the deal will integrate tweets into Bing's search results. Microsoft's search engine also will rank the tweets according to how relevant they are to the specific query. Bing also will be set up to pull out any URLs listed in the tweets so they can be listed separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing's real-time Twitter search went up in beta yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Marissa Mayer, Google's vice president ofsearch products, announced that the company will be integrating tweets into its own search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Mayer didn't offer many details of the Twitter deal, she spoke more about a different, though related, announcement. She noted that in a few weeks, Google will launch a service called Social Search in Google Labs. Social Search is designed to enable users to search for tweets and blogs written by their friends and the people whom their friends follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We came up with a way to have social networks influence your search results. If you're signed into Social Search you get content from your friends," she said in an interview with Computerworld . "If you do a search for a restaurant, you'll see regular search results, plus it's supplemented with what your friends have had to say about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayer said users will be able to fill out a Google Profile, linking to their friends on Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace and other social networks. If they use Gmail, Google will have access to their contacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You opt in to using Social Search and then we look at who your friends are and what content they might be publishing," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, said this latest salvo in the search war between Google and Microsoft comes down to relevancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Were one to connect to a social media site the other missed, it would create the impression that one was out of the loop," he said. "It's mostly image. Microsoft is aggressively trying to make Google look out of step and slow. Google is working frantically to assure Microsoft is not successful in this effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Enderle said, it appears that Google is chasing Microsoft, and that situation typically does not bode well for any market leader. He added that it also suggests Google has lost focus on its core technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezra Gottheil, an analyst at Technology Business Research Inc., said he's not sure how excited people will be to search for status updates on Facebook, but it looks bad for Google to be without that connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if it turns out that Facebook results aren't that important, the fact that Facebook is available through one search engine and not through the other will cause some Facebook users to at least try Bing," he said. "Google would prefer there not be a reason to give Bing a try."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK told a federal judge on Thursday that JPMorgan should be forced to return more than $4 billion to the bankrupt holding company, whose bank was seized by regulators and sold to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;

The attorney for the agency said it could, as receiver of the banks, demand a return of the deposit to itself under the agreement to sell the banking operations to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge will also have to weigh the value of competing claims that could offset part of the value of the deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main bankruptcy case is In re Washington Mutual Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington), No. 08-12229.

&lt;p&gt;  EMERYVILLE, CA, Oct 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 

News Facts

    -- As companies and governments make plans for enterprise-wide migrations
to Microsoft Windows 7, BigFix, Inc. recommends that customers perform a
thorough hardware and software asset discovery and inventory to prepare
for the upgrade.

    -- From a hardware perspective, IT departments need to know which
computers are "Windows 7 ready," which require upgrades or replacement,
and which should stay on previous Windows versions.

    -- On the software side, organizations need to know which machines run
applications that may not be compatible with Windows 7. Here, the choice
may be to upgrade these applications, provision them to run in XP mode, or
put off Windows 7 migration for those assets until compatible versions
become available.

    -- Software inventories can also provide valuable information on
application usage patterns and licensing contract compliance. The adoption
of a new OS provides a key opportunity to evaluate other IT expenditures
such as software licenses. Information discovered here can help avoid
disputes with vendors and even cut licensing costs through more productive
deployment of expensive applications, or better balancing of software
supply with actual end-user demand.

    How BigFix Can Help

    -- BigFix sets up organizations for Windows 7 migration success. BigFix
offers extensive asset discovery and inventory, software update, and
software license management through the BigFix Unified Management
platform.

    -- BigFix helps organizations measure and complete their Windows 7
migrations. BigFix offers real-time asset visibility and policy
enforcement, speeding their execution and producing accurate results.

    -- BigFix offers cost-effective scalability, securing and managing from
100s to 100,000s of distributed endpoint computers whether physical or
virtual, fixed or mobile.

    -- BigFix also delivers answers to virtually unlimited questions about an
environment -- in minutes -- allowing organizations to quickly gain
control over their Windows 7 migration.

    Background and Context

    -- Industry analyst reviews and early adopter experiences with Windows 7
suggest a rapid enterprise-wide adoption of this platform.

    -- As with any large-scale migration to new technology, enterprise users
seek to avoid costly execution errors that can potentially disrupt service
availability or cost overruns.

    -- BigFix Security and Systems Management solutions support Windows 7.

    Supporting Quotes

    Amrit Williams, BigFix CTO, commented, "We're providing our customers the
technology, tools, and expertise to realize the full benefits of migrating
to Windows 7. Enabling a successful migration strategy in a timely fashion
while minimizing conflicts and unexpected disasters will help our
customers meet their OS migration plans and ultimately cut the overall
costs of adopting and managing Windows 7."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERTH Oct 22 (Reuters) - Apache Corp (APA.N) and Kuwait
Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC) have agreed to
supply gas to Chevron Corp.'s (CVX.N) proposed Wheatstone gas
export project in Australia, Chevron said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apache and KUFPEC will supply gas from their Julimar and
Brunello gas fields off northwestern Australia to Chevron's
wholly-owned Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project
located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, Chevron said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Julimar and Brunello discoveries hold a combined total
of about 2.1 trillion cubic feet of gas. Under the agreement,
Apache will own a 16.25 percent equity stake in Wheatstone,
while KUFPEC will hold 8.75 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The additional gas supply will extend the life of the
Wheatstone project -- making it more desirable for customers and
bringing increased benefits to Australia through employment,
government revenue and local business opportunities," Roy
Krzywosinski, managing director of Chevron's Australia unit,
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. energy firm Apache said in a separate statement that
its net share of capital for the project, before any sell-down,
is estimated to be $1.2 billion for upstream development of the
fields and a $2.9 billion for Wheatstone facilities, including
the LNG plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the deal will reinforce Chevron's position as a
dominant LNG supplier in the Asia-Pacific region, it is expected
to deal a blow to rival Woodside Petroleum Ltd's (WPL.AX)
ambitions to swiftly expand its Pluto LNG project, which is also
located in Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woodside, which is currently building the first phase of the
A$12 billion Pluto project, has hoped to be able to buy gas from
operators of neighbouring gas fields to help underpin the
project's second-train expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first phase of the Wheatstone project consists of two
LNG processing trains with a total capacity of about 8.6 million
tonnes per year (mtpy) and a domestic gas plant. A final
investment decision is planned for 2011, Chevron said.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's standing as an operating system developer is on the line today as the company launches Windows 7, according to analysts and other experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a reputation issue at stake here," said Michael Silver, Gartner's primary Microsoft analyst. "Apple has been making fun of them, and Microsoft wants to put an end to that, and all the talk about Vista. Microsoft wants to make clear that customers shouldn't lose faith that they're able to put out an operating system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A tremendous amount is at stake," agreed Preston Gralla, a long-time Windows watcher who has extensively reviewed Windows 7 for Computerworld . "Vista was so poorly received. Windows 7 will show if they can do operating systems right, or if they've finally lost it, especially since [Bill] Gates hasn't been around for years. The question is, does Microsoft still have it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates stepped down 10 years ago as the CEO of the company he co-founded, then left the firm in mid-2008 to devote more time to the charitable foundation that bears the names of Gates and his wife, Melinda. Windows 7, then, is Microsoft's first post-Gates Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft finds itself in a position of vulnerability three years after the introduction of Vista because of its failure to convince users to upgrade from the even-then-aged Windows XP. After several delays that sent it scrambling to get out Vista, Microsoft found the operating system panned by reviewers and left in the lurch by OEMs, who initially failed to deliver reliable drivers and tried to sell underpowered PCs that didn't have the horsepower to run the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's critics and competitors -- particularly Apple -- took advantage of the misstep to bash the Windows ecosystem, ridicule its vulnerability to hacker exploits and claim that Microsoft had dropped the ball for the first time since 2000, when it released the also-dismissed Windows Millennium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Microsoft, Windows 7 is the most important release of Windows, ever," said Silver, "because Vista was, by far, the worst release of its flagship product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone from home users and corporate administrators to bloggers and analysts questioned Microsoft's ability to deliver a reliable, desirable operating system. Was Vista a one-off failure, or the first in what could be a string of disasters that would weaken its grip on the operating system market?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an interesting position for Microsoft," said Allan Krans, an analyst at Technology Business Research. "It's a critical release for Microsoft because Windows is their traditional core business. That's where they've made billions over the last 30 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 2009 is not 2006. People now spend most of their computing time on the Internet, where the browser is the interface, not the operating system they equate with the computer. That's making some wonder whether a desktop operating system matters, or if it does, whether it matters as much as it used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some think it increasingly doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the success or failure of Windows 7 will change the dynamics," argued Krans. "The pressure against Microsoft will continue to mount. If it does succeed, Windows 7 buys them more time to put together the pieces of their cloud initiatives, which is their future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Azure , a cloud-based Windows platform that Microsoft first unveiled a year ago, is the company's bet on for the future, and the key part of that transition from desktop to Internet, said Krans. But other pieces, such as moving its Office franchise to the Web, something it started last summer with Office Web Apps , are also important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their cloud pieces are key to what happens to them over the next 10 years," said Krans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silver agrees. The majority of applications used in business may require Windows today, but that's not a given down the road. "Organizations are more OS-neutral now," said Silver, referring to Web-based applications and services. "And consumers are embracing devices other than traditional PCs. Windows 7 is really important because desktop operating systems are still important today. But if current trends continue, by 2015 only a small percentage -- 30% or 40% -- of users will need Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Does the operating system really matter when everyone is connected to the Web?" asked Gralla. "I don't think we're there yet, but if Windows 7 isn't a big success, we're that much closer to saying, 'I don't care what OS I use, I'll use Google Docs or Office, and store my stuff on the Internet'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every expert agrees with Gralla, Krans and Silver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot is riding on this release," said Yun Kim, an analyst with Broadpoint AmTech. "But I don't think Microsoft is in any jeopardy. If it fails, it's not going to hurt the company from a financial point of view," Kim continued, pointing out that Windows still controls a huge slice of the operating system market, and that when people buy new PCs, there are actually few alternatives to Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Windows 7's success will be determined by the computer industry as a whole, by computer makers specifically, who have to convince people to buy in the face of a global economic malaise. "It's all driven by new PCs, so as long as Microsoft has an operating system out there, that's what you get. You have no choice, really," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly, echoed Gralla. In many ways, Microsoft's work is done, and it's now up to PC manufacturers to decide whether Windows 7 is good enough. "Windows 7 needs to be a big success because this isn't just a battle for the hearts and minds of users, but also for system makers," said Gralla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By virtually all accounts, Windows 7 is a better operating system -- much better, say some -- than Vista. So Microsoft has that going for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect the new operating system to be extremely successful," said Silver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, that's a given. Companies in particular, but also consumers, delayed purchasing new PCs in the lead up to, and during, the recession. Those machines are now aged -- the majority of computers worldwide still run the eight-year-old Windows XP -- and must be replaced sooner rather than later. And Windows 7 will be the beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft did its part, too. "A lot of the problems with Vista were hardware-based," said Gralla, ticking off driver issues and system requirements that many machines, even new, couldn't match. "Microsoft made a serious, serious mistake with Vista. But it made the conscious decision to make Windows 7 run on Vista-level hardware," Gralla added. "They could just as easily have said, 'We have much more powerful computers now, let's take as much advantage of that as we can.' But they didn't do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some continue to denigrate Windows 7 as the operating system that Vista should have been, or even dub it as merely a "service pack" upgrade from Vista. That's unfair, said Gralla, who noted a slew of interface improvements and considerable under-the-hood enhancements and additions. On the same hardware, Windows 7 is "a little bit zippier" than Vista, he argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there's no denying today's launch is a landmark for Microsoft, if only because it may be its last shot at convincing its toughest audience -- the millions still running Windows XP -- that it's time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Windows 7 doesn't deliver, it means more short-term competition from Apple and even Linux, said Silver. "But if it fails, the most important result will be that Windows XP won't die, which could force Microsoft to again extend support, which they don't want to do," Silver said. "XP is Windows 7's biggest competitor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone sees Microsoft balanced on the knife's edge today. "The only way that it would not be a success is if there was a revolt against the OS, like users did against Vista," said Kim. "As long as it doesn't suck, Microsoft should be okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

Solution Award at the SharePoint 2009 conference taking place this week in
Las Vegas. The award recognizes Aeturnum's Search Solutions Framework as
an outstanding partner solution built on FAST search technology that
demonstrates high-end search capabilities and offers a compelling user
experience. The Search Solutions Framework is an integrated business
information platform that enables Microsoft customers to easily customize
and extend the capabilities of FAST and SharePoint to fully expose their
rich functionality and deliver maximum user benefit and ROI.

    The award is part of the inaugural SharePoint Conference Partner Awards
recognizing a select group of partners for their ability to drive
innovation and help customers save money and increase efficiency by
realizing the benefits of SharePoint as an integrated server platform and
the best-in-class enterprise search solutions enabled by FAST technology.
Aeturnum was one of just six partners to be recognized with an award.

    Aeturnum provides enterprise application development services and
solutions including business intelligence, data warehousing and search.
The company partners with Microsoft to provide best-in-class  information
access and portal solutions for its customers and has strong expertise
with both Microsoft FAST and SharePoint technologies. These portals are
built on Aeturnum's Search Solutions Framework, which integrates
pre-developed technology components with FAST ESP and Microsoft
technologies to enable fast, easy access to the right information inside,
across and outside the enterprise. The Framework leverages FAST to
enhance SharePoint's content search capabilities and extend its access to
a variety of data sources across the enterprise including back end
systems such as product catalogs, inventory, billing and merchandising as
well as the Internet, e-mail databases, audio and video files, document
images and other internal and external repositories. It also enables FAST
to unify and personalize all these search results based on the user, and
display them via the SharePoint UI.

    "Enterprise users generally purchase a new technology with a clear idea of
its potential benefits; however, they are not always able to fully
translate the technology's capabilities into the desired outcomes for
their business users," said Rajat Bhakhri, president and CEO of Aeturnum.
"Aeturnum's Search Solutions Framework enables organizations to easily
customize and extend FAST and SharePoint to gain maximum benefit as
quickly and efficiently as possible. We're very proud to be recognized by
Microsoft and look forward to continuing to develop these solutions to

&lt;p&gt;Oct 22 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Pepco
Holdings Inc (POM.N) and Vectren Corp (VVC.N) to "underweight"
from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analyst Andrew Smith recommended pairing a short Pepco
position with a long side on NRG Energy Inc (NRG.N), Dynegy Inc
(DYN.N) or Edison International (EIX.N), saying the companies
may benefit from a rise in natural gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also recommended shorting Vectren against long
positions on NV Energy Inc NVE.N or Wisconsin Energy Corp
(WEC.N) as it expects both the stocks to offer attractive,
stable and regulated earnings growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith said the downgrade of electric-services company Pepco
was based on expectations of a difficult outlook for its
unregulated power plant arm, Conectiv Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst lowered his rating on energy-holding company
Vectren, citing difficult market conditions for its coal mining
and gas marketing and storage segments in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Pepco and Vectren were down 2 percent in morning
trade Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC, Oct 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Drug companies are carefully navigating the current stretch of industry
consolidation as giants merge and promising small firms seek interested
buyers.

    With conditional FDA clearance earlier this month, Pfizer and Wyeth merged
in one of the largest corporate marriages of all time. The new
organization will manage a merged portfolio of products that the FDA
described as 'highly complementary.' Despite that promise, however,
concerns remain about the merger's effect on issues ranging from long-term
shareholder value to the retention of talented employees.

    "In some ways, mega-deals like this one create more questions than
answers," says Jason Richardson, president of Cutting Edge Information.
"It will be years before we know how effective this merger actually was."

    While the media focuses on large deals such as this one or the
yet-to-close Merck/Schering-Plough merger, most acquisitions lack the
flash to make major headlines. The bulk of M activity involves smaller
organizations. The past year has been especially active for such mergers,
according to "Pharmaceutical Mergers and Acquisitions,"
(http://www.cuttingedgeinformation.com/mergers-acquisitions/) a new report
from Cutting Edge Information.

    "Pressure from both sides of a deal drives the merger activity we're
seeing," says Richardson. "Larger companies make acquisitions to position
themselves in certain markets and to prepare for patent expirations. A lot
of smaller and startup companies, meanwhile, face tremendous financial
pressure as operating capital dwindles and access to funding remains
tight."

    The Cutting Edge Information report covers the drivers and financing of
M activity over the past year, and it describes how companies deal with
the most challenging integration problems. With this report, readers
grasp key components of M success:


--  Get a feel for the current M landscape: learn what drives
    acquisition strategies for top companies -- and how other organizations
    seek suitors for their own sales.
--  Build an M plan that focuses on key goals, avoids costly mistakes,
    and realizes deal potential as quickly as possible.
--  Complete integration as quickly as possible to boost productivity and
    realize deal potential.
--  Build an integration timeline to avoid common operational and cultural
    pitfalls.
--  Clarify roles, responsibilities and career paths to avoid costly
    attrition and retain valuable employees.
--  Gather perspectives and predictions on future deals from the very
    managers that execute them.

&lt;p&gt;CORTE MADERA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
SL Corporation&#174;, a leading provider of real-time monitoring, analytics and
visualization software, today announced that the SL-GMS&#174; C++/Developer and
Developer for Microsoft .Net products now support Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174; 7.
Developers who have come to rely on SL-GMS development tools to create graphical
interfaces in XP or Vista need only download the Windows 7 version of SL-GMS to
migrate their displays. 

"With the scheduled end-of-life of XP and the general availability of Windows 7,
many of our OEMs and VARs are looking to leapfrog Vista and move directly to the
latest Windows OS," said Rodney Morrison, vice president of Products for SL
Corporation. "We are committed to the success of these important partners,
offering quick support and easy migration for the latest version of such
underlying technologies." 

With Windows 7, SL`s OEMs and VARs have a strong, modern successor to the
robust, but aged, Windows XP. While XP works well for many companies, it is
relatively weak in areas such as security, networking and other features more
important today than when XP was designed around 1999. 

Windows 7 introduces real advances in organizing programs and files, arranging
the taskbar and desktop, eliminating clutter, and quickly viewing and launching
a page or document. It also addresses many of Vista`s main flaws -sluggishness,
incompatibility with third-party software and hardware, heavy hardware
requirements, and constant security warnings.

&lt;p&gt;McAfee Products for Consumers and Businesses Provide Necessary Security for
Users of Microsoft`s Newest Operating System
SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
McAfee, Inc. (NYSE:MFE), the world`s largest dedicated security technology
company, today announced that its computer security products support Microsoft
Windows 7*, the new Microsoft operating system that was officially released
today. 

McAfee security products for consumers and businesses provide necessary
protection for Windows 7 users against threats such as viruses, spyware, Trojan
horses, hacker intrusions and malicious Web sites. In addition, McAfee
encryption and data loss prevention solutions for enterprises will support
Windows 7. 

"McAfee technology ensures computer users around the globe have security
protection available for their use of Windows 7. People upgrading their
operating system should also upgrade their computer security," said Dave DeWalt,
McAfee president and chief executive officer. "We continue to see an elevated
cybersecurity threat landscape with unprecedented levels of malicious software
seen this year by McAfee Labs. Windows 7 is just as prone to attack as previous
versions of Microsoft`s operating systems." 

Already Microsoft has had to address critical security flaws in Windows 7.
Earlier this month Microsoft issued its biggest software patch on record to fix
a range of security issues in its software programs, including Windows 7.
Several of the security flaws could allow a remote attacker to commandeer a
vulnerable Windows system after the user simply views a rigged Web site. McAfee
provided protection against exploitation of most of these security threats on
the day of Microsoft`s patch release. 

McAfee Enterprise Products

All McAfee products designed to protect computers used by businesses,
governments and other organizations support Windows 7. This includes the
flagship McAfee Total Protection for Endpoint and the McAfee Total Protection
Service. 

McAfee technology provides organizations with the peace of mind that they are
protected against attacks that exploit Windows vulnerabilities such as those
disclosed by Microsoft earlier this month. With this protection, IT teams can
implement patches on their own schedule, saving time, money, and effort. 

McAfee is an end-to-end technology provider with an interlocked, comprehensive
set of security products that can be managed centrally by the McAfee ePolicy
Orchestrator security management platform. Moreover, the comprehensive set of
McAfee-based products and services not only secures Microsoft infrastructure,
but the total enterprise. 

Citrix Systems, Inc., a leading provider of virtualization, networking and
software-as-a-service (SaaS) technologies, is an early adopter of Windows 7 and
is rolling the operating system across its business to as many as 12,000
endpoints. Citrix is installing McAfee Total Protection for Endpoint at the same
time. 

"With McAfee-based products supporting Windows 7, we can securely roll out the
new Microsoft operating systems in our enterprise," said Richard LaBella,
manager corporate IT security at Citrix. "Now is the time to update the
operating system, it is also the time to update the necessary security tools to
make sure the endpoints are properly protected." 

McAfee Consumer Products

All consumer products from McAfee support the new operating system. Existing
customers have already begun receiving the latest version of McAfee-based
products that support Windows 7; other users can install the Windows 7
compatible version from the McAfee.com Web site. 

McAfee-based products provide users with complete protection, including
protecting against vulnerabilities and threats that their system, data and
family are exposed to with the new Microsoft operating system and other third
party applications. Users should protect their Windows 7 system, data and
network by installing an up-to-date security product, just as they should with
any operating system. 

McAfee has published an FAQ on it product compatibility with Windows 7 as well
as a detailed Windows 7 Web site on McAfee consumer products. 

* McAfee Data Loss Prevention products are planned to offer support for Windows
7 in 2010.

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI (Reuters) - Microsoft is working on a new operating system that will be targeted at corporate customers, Acer's chairman said on Thursday, as the software giant launches its next-generation Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The tides are turning and it's time for most customers to consider switching to the new system," J.T. Wang told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know when the new corporate-focused system will be launched, but they're looking at designing one now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft launched Windows 7 on Thursday in one of its most important software releases in more than a decade, aiming to win back customers after its much-maligned introduction of Vista about three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in three years, IBM has unveiled a new high-end model in its DS8000 series enterprise-class disk storage arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on IBM's latest Power6 processor, the new DS8700 model announced today offers up to 2.5 times the performance of IBM's current DS8300 array and is up to 50% more energy efficient, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DS8700, which starts at $290,000, also allows users to configure the array with hard drives that have native full disk encryption for data security while the drives are in the box or after they have been removed at end of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, IBM announced the use of solid-state disks (SSD) in its storage and server lineup, including the DS8000 series. The new DS8700 expands on the use of SSD technology by incorporating smart data placement software in the array. Announced in May, smart data software identifies highly accessed data and places it on higher-performance drives within a single frame. In the DS8700, the software automatically migrates data to and from Fibre Channel and SSD drives, optimizing data placement in a tiered array.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By moving only 10% of the hottest data from Fibre Channel drives to solid-state drives, clients can see approximately a 300% performance gain for high-transaction workloads," an IBM spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Woo, an analyst at market research firm IDC, said the addition of SSDs and performance-monitoring software is also critical as data centers become more virtualized. "As we do more virtualization ... performance becomes a function of concentrated [I/Os per second]. So the availability of SSDs becomes very critical to that performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Peters, an analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group in Milford, Mass., said that IBM's upgrades to its high-end array are significant for existing customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, companies such as Compellent Technologies Inc. already provide the ability to move data at a subvolume level between disk storage tiers in an array. But "this is all new to you if you're an IBM customer," Peters said. "So, on balance, this is more than a step and less than a leap forward. It's a solid stride forward for IBM."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The System Storage DS8700 also allows current DS8000 series owners to nondisruptively upgrade from base models to the most advanced models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said the DS8700 is backward-compatible, allowing prior generations of DS series arrays to interoperate with it. The DS8700 offers full interoperability with the prior model's hard drives, drive enclosures, tools, scripts and copy services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woo said he considers the boost in overall performance from the Power6 processor to be the most significant upgrade to the DS8700. Also, the array's ability to flash-copy data and replicate it to other, lower-end IBM storage systems is significant because it allows administrators to perform testing and development on the DS8700 and then flash-copy that data for analysis on less costly, lower-end arrays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's one of the single most advantageous elements of this announcement," Woo said. "Also, given the fact that this system is used in high-transaction environments with sensitive information ... I think the use of full disk encryption by IBM was a smart move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM today also is announcing enhancements to its N series network-attached storage array line, including its new Performance Accelerator Module (PAM II) SSD cards. The enhanced cards are 16 and 32 times larger than before and offer increased cache memory to improve response time by 30% across all N series systems. The new cards also help reduce power consumption by up to 50% compared with traditional hard disk drives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is also introducing new IBM System Storage EXN3000 expansion disks (serial-attached SCSI) for the N series arrays that offer high capability and resiliency and 22% better rack space efficiency. An essential technology to this launch is the new N series SnapManager for Microsoft Hyper-V, which provides users with a virtualization management tool to enable automated data protection and disaster recovery for Microsoft Hyper-V environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has reached collaboration agreements with Twitter and Facebook to get their members' public status updates and messages indexed and presented in useful ways on the Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president of Microsoft's Online Audience Business, made the announcement on stage at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership with Twitter has it working with Microsoft to optimize how Bing crawls and indexes "tweets." Microsoft in turn will apply search algorithms to the Twitter messages, so that Bing users will not only be able to see a real-time feed of "tweets" but also rank them by how relevant they are to their query, Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a big deal we've been working on for a long time," Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rank "tweets" by relevance, a feature Microsoft calls "Best Match," Bing will take into consideration a number of factors, such as who are the authors of the messages based on a "social relevance" score Bing will assign to them, Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing will also evaluate the message's quality, noticing, for example, if it contains a link to an online article or Web page. It will also take into consideration how popular the message is by calculating how many times it has been "re-tweeted" by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing links to Twitter messages, Bing will extract the URLs of the pages that the messages are making reference to, so that users can go directly to that source of the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When providing links to "tweets" that contain a shortened URL, Bing will put in parenthesis the main Web domain of the link, so that users know, before clicking, whether it's a reputable site and thus avoid landing in a malicious phishing or malware-laden site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing will also display a tag cloud of the most popular Twitter topics, so that users can click on and dive deeper into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twitter deal is nonexclusive, and hours later rival Google announced its own agreement with Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 'tweets' will be integrated universal-search style, ranked alongside the other [different types of] results, and you'll be able to click on those results and go to a page that shows only 'tweets' and real-time updates," said Marissa Mayer, Google's vice president of search products and user experience, in an interview after her appearance on stage at the Web 2.0 Summit to announce the news. Users will also be able to restrict results to Twitter posts from the get-go using the engine's filtering controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has so far been crawling Twitter posts on its own, but the subset of content available in this manner has been very small, she said. With this Twitter partnership, Google gets access to what Twitter calls its "firehose" API (application programming interface), which was recently released, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So we can do this really comprehensive coverage and indexing of 'tweets' integrated into Google search," Mayer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Microsoft, Google has identified what Mayer calls "relevance signals" in Twitter posts, such as the links they contain and the people authoring them. The latter remains constant, so a Twitter author's level of competency in a given topic can be analyzed and evaluated, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Google is looking at social-networking content in a broader scale beyond Twitter. When asked if Google is interested in striking a deal like this with Facebook, Mayer said, "We're interested in comprehensiveness, which is a fundamental element of search. We need to have all the answers in order to find the answers for people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, she said that Google is working on a new search feature to let users view content in their Google search results that their friends have shared with them on social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can use social networks and analyze them to improve search quality. When you're signed in and have a Google Profile established, we'll look at the different social networks you associate with, understand who your friends and connections are, and surface content written by them on your results pages," Mayer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twitter search-result integration and the new social-networking results feature will be implemented "very soon," Mayer said, declining to be more specific. Google's announcement of the Twitter agreement states it will be ready "in the coming months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it seems Bing is for now ahead of Google with an optimized search experience for Twitter that is already live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Google remains by far the most popular search engine, Microsoft is making a big push to improve its position in this market, starting with Bing's launch in May and the broad search deal with Yahoo, which is awaiting regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its core microblogging and social-networking features, Twitter has emerged as a repository of real-time testimonies on whatever is on people's minds, such as news stories of global importance, celebrity gossip and hot-button issues. As such, being able to capture, analyze and make sense of Twitter's stream of posts is seen as an important new area in the world of search engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're super happy with the Twitter partnership," said Qi Lu, president of Microsoft's Online Services Division, who was also on stage being interviewed by conference moderator Tim O'Reilly. Lu declined to disclose financial details of the deal. He also said he wasn't sure on its duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Mehdi nor Lu said much about the Facebook arrangement, other than to indicate that it will be similar in nature to Twitter's but that it will be implemented at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see what shape the Facebook agreement takes, considering that Facebook allows individual members to make only basic profile information available via search engine results. Facebook has indicated it may let members make their profiles open to anyone on the Web, including their status updates, but that hasn't happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, on the other hand, is a much more open service and most of its users make public their "tweets," messages that can't be longer than 140 characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook expects its deal with Bing to become active early next year, a Facebook spokeswoman said via e-mail. Before Bing can make Facebook status updates searchable, Facebook has to first roll out to all users its new Publisher Privacy Control system, which is now being tested with a small group of users, the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As you may recall, the new Publisher Privacy Control enables users to define who can see the content they publish on a per-post basis. For example, they may want to make some posts available to everyone, while restricting others to their friends and family," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Facebook have an existing partnership through which Microsoft provides Web search and search ads to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Most important release in more than a decade&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Reviews positive, no immediate effect on bottom line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Boost to PC sales seen next year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft shares up 80 pct since March&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
launched Windows 7 on Thursday in its most important release
for more than a decade, aiming to win back customers after the
disappointing Vista and strengthen its grip on the PC market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company, which powers more
than 90 percent of personal computers, has received good
reviews for the new operating system, which it hopes will grab
back the impetus in new technology from rivals Apple Inc
(AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's the first really significant release of Windows in a
decade," analyst Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities
told Reuters Television. "Given the missteps around Vista,
people really questioned Microsoft's relevancy in the
technology space. So this is a critical first step for
Microsoft regaining that credibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new system -- which is faster, less cluttered and has
new touch-screen features -- comes almost three years after the
launch of Vista, whose complexity frustrated many home users
and turned off business customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The success of Windows -- which accounts for more than half
of Microsoft's profit -- is crucial for Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer to revive the company's image as the world's most
important software firm. [ID:nN16236889]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I have to say I'm chomping at the bit," Ballmer told an
audience of Microsoft customers and partners in Toronto on
Wednesday, adding that he is ready to make sales calls himself
on Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales won't immediately impact the bottom line of
Microsoft, which is expected to post a lower quarterly profit
on Friday. [ID:nN16352711]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHEAPER THAN VISTA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is charging $199.99 for the Home Premium version
of Windows 7, or $119.99 for users seeking to upgrade from
older versions of the operating system -- well below comparable
prices for Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also has a range of offers in conjunction with retailer
Best Buy (BBY.N) and PC makers such as Dell Inc DELL.O and
Acer Inc (2353.TW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first time, shoppers will be able to buy PCs loaded
with the software direct from a branded Microsoft store, with
the first of a planned chain set to open on Thursday in
Scottsdale, Arizona. [ID:nN16364916]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. holiday season will soon reveal whether consumer
PC sales get a kick from Windows 7, but success with
corporations -- the key to Microsoft's financial power -- won't
be clear until next year, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Come June of next year, we are going to get the real
indication of the business-to-business marketplace," said Mark
Simons, chief executive of the U.S. arm of Toshiba Corp
(6104.T), the world's No. 5 PC maker, on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early indications are that companies are getting ready to
switch to Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People like it," said Michael Capone, chief information
officer for payroll services firm ADP (ADP.O), pointing out its
quick start-up time and good user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a line outside my door from people wanting to get
into the pilot program," said Capone, at a technology
conference in Orlando, Florida, on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His company typically waits at least 18 months to begin
broad deployment of a new version of Windows, said Capone, but
this time he could be more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the surveys that we've done about half the CIOs (chief
information officers) indicated that they would just use
Windows 7 on existing PCs as opposed to replace the entire
hardware," said Barnicle. "That would be very positive for
Microsoft but maybe not so positive for the PC manufacturers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHARES UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good reviews, and a surge in technology stocks across the
board, have lifted Microsoft shares about 80 percent since
March. They hit their highest level in just over a year on
Wednesday, closing at $26.58 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a better operating system -- it does the job,"
said Lance Ulanoff, editor-in-chief of PCMag.com. "They've
certainly got it a lot more right than they did with Vista."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A range of new PCs incorporating the software in all shapes
and sizes from Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Dell and others are
set to be unveiled on Thursday, in the hope of reigniting
consumer spending before the holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global PC sales rose 2.3 percent in the third quarter
compared to a year ago, according to research firm IDC, after
two quarters of declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Market-watchers are betting on further recovery of computer
sales next year, as the economy improves and businesses replace
old machines, but opinion is divided on how strong the impact
of Windows 7 will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What's going to be really interesting is whether this
spurs a hardware replacement cycle or it's just a Windows
replacement cycle," said Barnicle, who estimates that more than
820 million PCs across the world run Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For stories related to the launch of Windows 7, click on

&lt;p&gt;Due to a reporting error, the story "With Hyper-V R2, Microsoft sets its sights on VMware," which ran on the wire Friday, misstated the requirements for using Microsoft's Live Migration tool. The fifth and sixth paragraphs of the story have been corrected and now read:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V R2 ships free with Windows Server 2008 R2, although to take full advantage of some of its more advanced capabilities customers will have to purchase System Center Virtual Machine Manager, which costs US$869 per physical server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new features include Live Migration, which allows virtual machines to be moved from one physical server to another without interrupting service. Hyper-V R2 can also take advantage of more powerful servers, with support for up to 64 physical processors, and allows virtual machines to be migrated between two servers based on the same processor family, such as AMD's Opteron chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong sales of netbook computers, combined with plummeting sales of Microsoft Office to consumers, hurt Microsoft Corp.'s otherwise-strong first-quarter 2010 results reported today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one analyst expects the trend to continue, even with the release of a netbook-friendly Windows 7 and a free Web version of Office for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netbooks made up about 12% of total Windows shipments in the first quarter, Microsoft general manager for investor relations, Bill Koefoed, said in a conference call after the earnings release. And netbook shipments are likely to keep growing faster than the rest of the market, acknowledged Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to Vista's bloated operating system, which takes more hard drive space and processing power, those netbooks almost all run Windows XP. Microsoft reportedly earns about $15 for every copy of Windows XP sold to a PC maker, or original equipment manufacturer (OEM), compared with $50 to $60 for every copy of Vista, and now, Windows 7, sold to PC makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, OEM revenue was down 6% year-over-year, despite Microsoft's selling an unspecified "record number of Windows licenses" this quarter due to the release of Windows 7 to OEMs in July. Total Windows revenue of $4.09 billion was down 4% from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to entice netbook makers to switch to the relatively streamlined Windows 7, especially the low-end Windows 7 Starter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not say how many netbooks this quarter shipped with Windows 7 instead of XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Rob Helm, an analyst with the independent Directions on Microsoft, Windows 7 Starter costs OEMs about twice as much as XP. For most netbooks, that will be too high, he said. As a result, he doesn't expect most OEMs to switch off XP until it is phased out next fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft Business Division revenue fell 11% year-on-year to $4.4 billion, dragged down by a 34% year-over-year decline in consumer sales. That mirrors a 30% annual drop in the prior quarter. Sales to consumers make up about a quarter of MBD's total revenue. They come mostly from retail sales of Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has juiced Office sales in the last several years through heavy promotions for students, military personnel, retirees and other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has come back to bite Microsoft, Helm said, by "hurting their [year-over-year revenue] comparables." Strong sales of netbooks, which are often too lightweight to run the full Office suite, has hurt, too, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer revenue may continue to fall, as Microsoft gets ready to debut the free Office Web for both consumers and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aimed to counter the free Google Docs, Office Web won't have all of the features of Office 2010. Microsoft plans to run ads inside Office Web to entice users to upgrade to Office 2010, Helm said. While that may entice large businesses, he doesn't see that tactic attracting many consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of the new capabilities in Office 2010 depend on businesses running SharePoint Server," he said. "For consumers and small businesses, Office 2010 becomes a lot harder sell because it looks an awful lot like Office 2007."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft didn't talk about how it plans to win back consumers to Office during its conference call. Liddell said he doesn't expect MBD's overall sales to pick up in the second quarter, although they may pick up in calendar year 2010 as businesses begin to upgrade to Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's results smashed Wall Street expectations on Friday, sending its shares up 7 percent, as the PC market improved and sales of its Windows software and Halo video game were stronger than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results top a big week for the world's largest software company, which launched its Windows 7 operating system to positive reviews on Thursday, as it looks to regain leadership in the technology sector from rivals Apple Inc and Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is back. They are able to succeed despite heightened competition from Apple's share gain and Google's great brand," said Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies  Co. "The numbers were unbelievable. An absolutely blowout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their biggest one-day jump since April, Microsoft's shares hit their highest level since June 2008, helping the Nasdaq pare losses. The results follow better-than-expected earnings from technology bellwethers IBM, Intel Corp, Google and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiscal first-quarter profit fell 18 percent to $3.57 billion, or 40 cents per share, compared with $4.37 billion, or 48 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street had expected much worse, calling for profit of 32 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 14 percent to $12.92 billion, partly reduced by a deferral of $1.47 billion in revenue to future quarters related to Microsoft's free upgrade to Windows 7 for recent buyers of the predecessor Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That beat analysts' average forecast of $12.31 billion, the first time the software maker had done so in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's results are closely tied to sales of PCs, which rose in the latest quarter by about 2 percent after two quarters of declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not include any pre-sales of Windows 7 in its latest results, offering the hope that the current quarter will show a boost in sales from the new system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are seeing some of the benefit of the improvement in PCs that we have heard about," said Brendan Barnicle at Pacific Crest Securities. "This is a trend. They've got some good momentum behind them and it's just going to get accelerated now that you have Windows 7 out in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company played down hopes for a quick recovery from the worst recession in decades, sticking with a characteristically cautious outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 (which ended June 30) may well have been the bottom of the economic reset," said Chief Financial Officer Christopher Liddell on a conference call on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He repeated his view that technology spending should recover gradually in 2010. "We are not seeing a large rebound, but we'd like to think, certainly as we go into next calendar year, we'll start to see businesses spending again," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which is tightening its belt in the economic slowdown, also cut its outlook for operating expenses for the full fiscal year to $26.2 billion from its previous target of $26.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly profit fell in Microsoft's main units, producing the Windows operating system and Office suite of applications. Profit rose in its server unit and its entertainment and devices unit, which makes the Xbox console and Halo video game series. Its loss-making online services unit, which includes the new Bing search engine, reported a wider loss than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 7.6 percent, or $1.99, at $28.58 on Nasdaq. They have risen 92 percent since hitting a more-than 10 year low in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle and Juan Lagorio; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has confirmed a problem that hundreds of users have reported with downloading Windows 7, according to its support forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is currently investigating the reports, but has not yet come up with a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For those that have purchased Windows 7 from Digital River and receive the error 'We are unable to create or save new files in the folder in which this application was downloaded' when going through the 'Unloading the Box' [step]...Microsoft and Digital River are aware of the issue and it's being investigated," a Microsoft support engineer said in a message posted yesterday .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will post back to this thread when we have additional updates," added the engineer, an 11-year veteran of the company identified only as "Michael."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minneapolis, Minn.-based Digital River powers the downloading of Microsoft's $29.99 Windows 7 upgrade offer to students . Digital River handled the electronic purchasing and downloading for Windows Vista and Office 2007 in early 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users began reporting problems with installing downloaded copies of Windows 7 within hours of the operating system's launch yesterday. In a thread that contained more than 320 messages as of 1 p.m. ET Friday, users complained that they were stymied by the issue. "I double click on 'Win7-P-Retail-en-us-x64.exe' and I get the message 'Unloading the Box'," said "Darkfrye50" early Thursday morning. "Once the status bar reaches the end, I get the error."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What a freakin' mess," exclaimed another user, "Goaliegeek" on the same thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the users said that they were students taking advantage of Microsoft's discount upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than provide customers with a disk image, or .iso file -- which could easily be burned to an installation DVD -- as Microsoft did with the Windows 7 previews it supplied users this year, Digital River delivered an .exe file named "Win7-P-Retail-en-us-x64.exe" and two additional files with the ".box" filename extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When users launched the .exe file -- which was supposed to unpack the .box files -- they received the error Microsoft's Michael mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft suggested that users try one of the workarounds spelled out by others in the support forum. At least one of them, which required users to fire up a command-line tool called "Oscdimg" to create an .iso out of the downloaded files, did the trick, people reported. Oscdimg must be downloaded from the Microsoft Web site; it's available as part of the "Windows Automated Installation Kit" for Windows XP and Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Download Squad Web site has also published a set of instructions on converting the downloaded files to a disk image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But users continued to post complaints. "Any updates at all on this? This is a horrible 'new start' for Windows," said "gozeemer" on the long thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is also ******* me off," griped "James388" on the thread. "Seems like my download is corrupted also, it won't let me download it again. WTF?!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital River did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights ev3, Inc. (Nasdaq: EVVV) as the Bull of the Day
and Iconix Brand Group (Nasdaq: ICON) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on Ford (NYSE: F), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS)
and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

ev3, Inc. (Nasdaq: EVVV) benefits from the growing demand for minimally invasive
treatment of vascular diseases and disorders. Vascular disease and its
precursors affect over 90 million people in the United States and more than 1
billion people worldwide. Vascular disease is the leading cause of death in the
world. 

The company's broad product portfolio makes it well positioned for long-term
growth. In addition, ev3's products are primarily life-sustaining, a hedge
against the current economic turmoil. We rate the company's stock an Outperform
with a target price of $13. 

Bear of the Day: 

Iconix Brand Group's (Nasdaq: ICON) specialty retail apparel sector has always
been in demand from the consumers. However, it is grappling with the recession
as macroeconomic headwinds are causing consumers to increase savings and defer
new purchases. Consumers are trading down to cheaper alternatives or heavily
discounted merchandise. 

Further, management lowered its guidance, reflecting dilution related to the
company's equity offering and the negative impact related to the transition of
the Rocawear women's license to a new licensee. Therefore, we lowered our rating
on the stock to Underperform, until we see any catalyst to trigger the company's
growth trajectory.

Permanent vs. Temporary Lay-Offs

In earlier post-war recessions, a far greater percentage of the workforce was in
manufacturing. Inventories of things like Autos would build up, and Ford (NYSE:
F) and General Motors would react by shutting down the plants for a month or
two, but those UAW members could be pretty sure that they would get called back
as soon as things picked up. Not so this time around. In September, 56% of all
job losses were described as permanent. Never before this downturn had that
percentage gone above 45%. 

As I have pointed out before, the core problem facing the job market is the lack
of new job creation, not an excessively high number of people being laid off.
However, when the layoffs that we do have are of the "forever" type, it makes
the situation far worse. 

How we deal with that as a society will be a big issue going forward. Do we
expand the safety net for these people who lose their jobs permanently, and risk
having them become long-term dependants of the state, and undermine the
incentive for those who still have jobs to stick with them? Or do we take a much
harsher position of letting them fend for themselves and end up in a society of
even more extreme disparities between the haves and the have-nots -- a land
where some live in opulence beyond the wildest dreams of avarice, and vast
numbers live on the borders of starvation as is often seen in less developed
countries? 

Already based on standard measures of income inequality, the U.S., looks much
more like Cameroon than Canada -- something that is to some extent masked by the
far higher standard of living for both the rich and the poor in the U.S.
relative to countries like Cameroon. There is a very real danger that if the
level of income inequality were to rise significantly more -- which is what will
happen if large segments of the population are permanently unemployed -- that
the underlying social stability could be undermined. This is especially true if
there is no real safety net like there is in Europe. 

Massive multibillion bonus pools at firms like Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), which greatly benefited from taxpayer largess last
year, help neither the issue of income inequality, nor, ultimately, social
stability.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported revenue that was down 14 percent year-on-year for its first fiscal quarter, with net income down 17 percent -- but it still beat analyst expectations on both counts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures were dragged down by deferral of revenue from sales of Windows 7 to PC manufacturers ahead of the operating system's launch on Thursday, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall revenue totalled US$12.92 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, down from $15.06 billion a year earlier. Net income fell to $3.57 billion, for earnings per share of $0.40, down from $4.37 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast revenue of $12.32 billion and EPS of $0.32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $1.47 billion in deferred revenue would not have been enough to maintain sales in the company's Windows and Windows Live division, where revenue fell $1.66 billion year on year, to $2.62 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, chief financial officer Chris Liddell put a bright face on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very pleased with our performance this quarter and particularly by the strong consumer demand for Windows," he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft had not had to defer Windows 7 sales, profit would have gone up 8 percent, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales in the Servers and Tools Division remained steady at around $3.4 billion, with operating income there up 23 percent to $1.28 billion while operating profit in the Entertainment and Devices Division, which makes the Xbox, doubled to $312 million on sales that were steady at $1.89 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's results were buoyed by consistent strength in consumer PC sales, including the rise of netbooks, Liddell said during a conference call Friday. "What I think we're seeing is the robustness in the concept of a PC. It's something people want to spend money even in a recession."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But weakness in computer purchasing by businesses has posed "a significant negative," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That can't continue forever," he added. "Eventually those PCs wear out and need to be replaced." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, corporate customers are "playing out" budgets that were set late last year when the crisis was at its worst, so Microsoft does not believe business spending will pick up until 2010, according to Liddell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're all waiting to see how the economy rebounds and how well it does," he said. "We're not seeing a large rebound but certainly as we go into next calendar year we'll see businesses spending again, and we'll be raised with that." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects "flattish" performance on the services side for the rest of its fiscal year, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Windows 7, Microsoft has received good anecdotal feedback from corporate customers, but expects companies won't start upgrading until next year, Liddell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Certainly all the early signs are good at this stage," he said. Pre-orders for the OS have been "extremely good," and the vendor is anticipating strong retail sales through the holiday season, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up about $1.81 in midday trading Friday to $28.40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been times when Microsoft launching a new operating system was a big deal. Yesterday was not one of them. And that's how Microsoft wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know people will disagree, citing the apparent effort Microsoft put into those dopey launch parties and other consumer promotions, but the difficulty of upgrading from XP to Windows 7 makes it a difficult sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no real excitement, no real surprises at the Windows 7 launch yesterday in New York. And that's OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumers and many small businesses, Windows 7 is the operating system that will come on their next PC. Will the new OS convince customers to upgrade to new hardware for the holidays? Will it uncork pent-up demand? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That probably depends more on the economy than anything else, which is a win for Microsoft after many customers went out of their way to avoid Vista. If you need a new computer, Windows 7 seems a safe choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we know? Because Windows 7 is so well known, and user-tested, that there was little for Microsoft to say at the launch. The new OS was even widely available ahead of yesterday's event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For business, Microsoft is pushing upgrades. And it appears it will get them. IT departments are not as shy about reformatting disks and reloading applications as consumers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, I have talked to a number of small businesses that see no reason to upgrade--no compelling features--and will wait. Presumably until their XP hardware finally dies. Or until Windows 7 SP1 is released, whichever comes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a consumer perspective, Windows 7 is an improved "Vista Lite" OS. For enterprises, it improves on both XP and Vista and adds new features. It shows that Microsoft learned from it Vista mistakes and dialed back the glitz in favor of building a more useful OS than either XP or Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The #1 Goal of Windows 7 is to not be another Windows Vista and, so far, it has succeeded. Microsoft wisely sacrificed surprise and hoopla for confidence and trust, which Windows 7 is well on its way to building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Coursey tweets as  @techinciter  and can be  contacted  via his Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/174225&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sees negative impact from planned higher taxes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * In talks with other players for wireless phones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Rules out short-term deal with partner Megacable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on wireless plans)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cyntia Barrera Diaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa expects planned tax increases in Mexico to hit
profits, but still plans to bid in a long-awaited spectrum
auction to develop a wireless phone network in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's lower house of Congress this week passed a
watered-down version of President Felipe Calderon's tax reform
proposal. Senators are now revising the plan to raise a value-
added tax, along with levies on beer, telecommunications,
gaming and high income earners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If approved by the Mexican Senate, these new taxes, and
increases on current taxes, will have a material negative
impact on our company and its subsidiaries," Televisa's
Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia told analysts
during a conference call on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX), the world's biggest producer
of Spanish-language content, offers television, Internet and
telephone packages using its broadband network, but wants to
add wireless communications to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also operates dozens of bingo halls across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, famous for its tear-jerker soap operas, is
waiting for the publication of rules governing a planned
auction of wireless spectrum that the government hopes will
boost competition in Mexico's telecommunications market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are open to participate in the spectrum auctions, also
jointly with already established wireless operators," De
Angoitia said. "We are also in discussions with experienced
international players," he added without mentioning names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRANCHING OUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa has expanded outside its core broadcast television
business in recent years to boost revenue and remain relevant
in a changing market where customers increasingly favor
exclusive TV content and access to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's recent bets on cable and satellite television
have proved successful, although rising competition has forced
it to rethink marketing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The arrival last year of smaller rival Dish was a
particularly strong blow to Televisa's pay television units.
Dish, with its super cheap, no-frills satellite TV offer, hopes
to end its first year of operations with 1 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In what analysts read as a counter move, Televisa's cable
companies teamed up with Guadalajara-based Megacable
(MEGACPO.MX) this year to offer a very affordable TV, Internet
and phone bundle aimed at low-income earners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few weeks ago, its SKY direct-to-home unit introduced a
$12.50 package -- VeTV -- to compete directly against Dish's
lowest offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's customers from its three cable companies totaled
1.7 million at the end of September, while its SKY ended the
third quarter with 1.8 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked whether Televisa was interested in buying Megacable,
De Angoitia said: "We are not looking in terms of
consolidating, or buying, or doing something with that company
in the short term. However, something could happen in the mid
to long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa has been sitting on a cash pile for several
quarters now and analysts wonder when it will use it for an
acquisition. The company has granted extraordinary dividends to
shareholders in the past when it has not found something
attractive to buy.

 (Recasts, adds CFO comments, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O)
results smashed Wall Street expectations on Friday, sending its
shares up 7 percent, as the PC market improved and sales of its
Windows software and Halo video game were stronger than
expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results top a big week for the world's largest software
company, which launched its Windows 7 operating system to
positive reviews on Thursday, as it looks to regain leadership
in the technology sector from rivals Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and
Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is back. They are able to succeed despite
heightened competition from Apple's share gain and Google's
great brand," said Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies
 Co. "The numbers were unbelievable. An absolutely blowout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With their biggest one-day jump since April, Microsoft's
shares hit their highest level since June 2008, helping the
Nasdaq pare losses. The results follow better-than-expected
earnings from technology bellwethers IBM (IBM.N), Intel Corp
(INTC.O), Google and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fiscal first-quarter profit fell 18 percent to $3.57
billion, or 40 cents per share, compared with $4.37 billion, or
48 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street had expected much worse, calling for profit of
32 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales fell 14 percent to $12.92 billion, partly reduced by
a deferral of $1.47 billion in revenue to future quarters
related to Microsoft's free upgrade to Windows 7 for recent
buyers of the predecessor Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That beat analysts' average forecast of $12.31 billion, the
first time the software maker had done so in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's results are closely tied to sales of PCs, which
rose in the latest quarter by about 2 percent after two
quarters of declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company did not include any pre-sales of Windows 7 in
its latest results, offering the hope that the current quarter
will show a boost in sales from the new system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You are seeing some of the benefit of the improvement in
PCs that we have heard about," said Brendan Barnicle at Pacific
Crest Securities. "This is a trend. They've got some good
momentum behind them and it's just going to get accelerated now
that you have Windows 7 out in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Redmond, Washington-based company played down hopes for
a quick recovery from the worst recession in decades, sticking
with a characteristically cautious outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 (which ended June 30) may
well have been the bottom of the economic reset," said Chief
Financial Officer Christopher Liddell on a conference call on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He repeated his view that technology spending should
recover gradually in 2010. "We are not seeing a large rebound,
but we'd like to think, certainly as we go into next calendar
year, we'll start to see businesses spending again," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which is tightening its belt in the economic
slowdown, also cut its outlook for operating expenses for the
full fiscal year to $26.2 billion from its previous target of
$26.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quarterly profit fell in Microsoft's main units, producing
the Windows operating system and Office suite of applications.
Profit rose in its server unit and its entertainment and
devices unit, which makes the Xbox console and Halo video game
series. Its loss-making online services unit, which includes
the new Bing search engine, reported a wider loss than a year
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were up 7.6 percent, or $1.99, at $28.58
on Nasdaq. They have risen 92 percent since hitting a more-than 10
year low in March.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Cazenove's joint venture owners are keen to decide whether J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) should buy out its UK investment banking partner before bonuses are set for staff around the turn of the year, industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decision on a buyout or carrying on the JV should be made before bonuses are set by early January, according to the sources. Uncertainty about a deal and future structure of the company could see rivals attempt to poach staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks were delayed by recent changes at the helm of JP Morgan's investment bank, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It named Jes Staley as chief executive of the unit in a surprise shake-up on September 29, which saw the departure of Bill Winters, its London-based co-CEO of investment banking. Winters had always been keen on taking full control of the JV, one person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal has not yet been agreed and talks continue, Cazenove said. It declined further comment. JP Morgan declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan owns 50 percent of the joint venture and Cazenove Group owns the rest under a deal struck five years ago. Both JP Morgan and Cazenove have the right to trigger a full takeover by the U.S. bank in February, under put and call options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price is likely to be the key issue, however, and there is limited transparency on the value of the venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was valued at about 700 million pounds ($1.17 billion) when JP Morgan bought its half in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazenove shares trade on an internal market, but only during narrow windows twice a year.

This person was not involved in the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that price Cazenove Group would be valued at just under 1 billion pounds and the joint venture at double that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just under half of Cazenove's shares are owned by current staff, about 9 percent is owned by institutions and the rest are owned by former partners.

It comes amid broad and continuing doubts about the ability of cloud vendors in general to properly secure their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, which has made no secret of its ambitions in the cloud computing arena, is currently working on getting its services certified to the government's Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) standards for much the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how much value customers of either company will attach to the certifications, particularly because they were not designed specifically to audit cloud computing environments. Even so, the external validation offered by the standards is likely to put both companies in a better position to sell to the U.S. government market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with Computerworld this week, Bill Billings, chief security officer of Microsoft Federal, said the company is currently in the process of taking its Business Productivity Online Suite through the ISO 27011 certification process. The hosted service includes Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Office Live Meeting and Office Communications Online. He declined to say just when Microsoft hopes to achieve the certification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to offer customers, particularly in the government, a higher level of assurance about Microsoft's cloud services than FISMA-certification alone provides, said Teresa Carlson, vice president of Microsoft Federal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FISMA is outdated. It is largely a paper-based exercise. We want to take it up a notch" by getting ISO 27011 certification, Carlson said. At the same time, Microsoft is also working to get its cloud services certified to the standards prescribed under FISMA; it hopes to complete the task by year's end, Carlson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISO 27001 standard is managed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission. To get certified under the standard, Microsoft will need to show that its physical, logical, process and management controls for protecting its suite of cloud services meet a rigorous set of audit criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the ISO 27011 standard is widely recognized internationally, it has failed to gain much traction in the U.S., said Chenxi Wang, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "Most U.S. companies don't pay much attention to ISO 27001. They don't know quite what to make of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, in the absence of any cloud-specific certification standard, ISO 27001 remains one of the best security benchmarks available. "There's nothing specific to cloud-computing in it. But it has been used in traditional outsourcing for years and is the best standard there is" for information security, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com last year became one of the first vendors of hosted applications to become certified under ISO 27001 standards. It's unclear how much that certification has helped the company acquire new customers, Wang said. But it has certainly played a role in reinforcing Salesforce.com's message about the security and reliability of its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News about Microsoft's plans to acquire ISO 2700 certification comes amid persisting concerns about cloud security. The concerns have been fueled by high-profile incidents such as the recent chaotic outage of Microsoft's Sidekick T-Mobile and one in July involving Twitter and Google Apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the vendors themselves and many analysts have insisted the incidents had nothing to do with cloud security failures, the perception about the cloud being vulnerable to security failures has continued to persist. It is for those reasons that certifications such as ISO 27001and FISMA are important, especially in government, Billing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Within the federal market, it is a cultural issue," Billings said. "This is really about making them feel comfortable about their partnership" with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Becoming customers` preferred industry partner is the driving force behind the
newly expanded Pfizer Animal Health, according to the company`s executive
leadership team. 

Although the recent integration of Wyeth`s animal division, Fort Dodge, makes
Pfizer the largest animal health provider in Europe, size is not the main
objective. 

Speaking at the unveiling of the new look Pfizer Animal Health today in Paris,
Albert Bourla, PAH Area President of Europe, Africa, Asia and the Pacific
Regions, told journalists: 

"I think this is a historical moment, memorable for our corporate history, but
even more importantly, it is a truly significant moment in the history of the
industry. 

"While we are becoming the biggest company in the sector, it is how we use our
size to benefit our customers that will bring true value to the industry." 

Mr Bourla said the expanded company will work with customers to become partners
over providers, and offer solutions over products. 

"We are not only bringing together trusted and complementary product portfolios,
we are combining people, talent and expertise. 

"It is our collective responsibility to use these resources in a way that really
matters. We will stand behind vets and the customers they serve, from pet owners
to farmers and producers by providing them with technical expertise, scientific
solutions and increased services." 

Ugo Cosentino, Vice President Operational Business Strategy, who joins Pfizer
from Fort Dodge, said the new look company is committed to becoming its
customers` preferred partner. 

"We have a vision to deliver Human Care for Animal Kind, and while our size will
help us achieve this, the more important factor will be how we relate to our
customers. 

"We will work with our partners to understand their needs, and offer solutions
across the sector, from emerging diseases to business development. 

"We are dedicated to achieving the promises we make today, as we work together
to make our vision a reality." 

The new Pfizer Animal Health employs over 1,500 people in Europe, and is
directly represented in 59 countries in the Europe-Africa-Middle East region
with net sales of around $1.2billion.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Barnes  Noble
Inc (BKS.N) to "sell" from "neutral" and said the bookseller's
move into electronic books market may weigh on its earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Barnes  Noble, whose shares were down 6 percent at $17.65
in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange, on Tuesday
unveiled its electronic reader to rival Amazon.com Inc's
(AMZN.O) dominant Kindle, priced identically at $259 ahead of
the holiday shopping season. [ID:nN20319058]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The migration of books to digital formats clearly
challenges BKS's store-based model," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect long-run pressure on earnings as margins,
already thin, come under pressure from deleverage of rent,
investment in the digital distribution business, and market
share loss," Goldman said and cut its price target on the stock
to $18 from $21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse, which rates the company "underperform," also
lowered its price target on the stock to $16 from $18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dubbed the Nook, Barnes  Noble's electronic reader
features a colour screen and dual display, and unlike Kindle
allows its users to share most books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we applaud management for these efforts and think it
has the potential to be a major player in this business, the
concern is whether being a player will ultimately sacrifice
profitability," Credit Suisse said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The risk, in our view, is that as the math currently
works, each sale through a Nook is not just unprofitable but
potentially replaces a higher margin sale at stores."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's quarterly profit and revenue beat Wall Street expectations, sending shares of the world's largest software maker sharply higher on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAURA DIDIO, ANALYST, ITIC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a wounded animal and you corner it, that is when it is at its most dangerous. Microsoft knows that its core businesses are under siege from competitors as powerful as they are -- IBM Google, Apple and others. They can swing into action when they have to. They have considerable resources to bring to the table."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAXMI PORURI, FOUNDING PARTNER, PRIMARY GLOBAL RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Probably the PC picked up because of what Intel said that the fourth quarter and going forward is slightly up from what was previously forecast. They're seeing not a recovery, but a little bit of a turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're going to be well positioned to take some share away on the server side and as well on the content management side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think Oracle reported a disappointing quarter recently largely because they're going to be struggling with their acquisitions a bit in terms of how they're going to integrate some of their technologies. So we think Microsoft has a pretty good opportunity going forward in the next 12 to 18 months to take some share away on that end."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHARD WILLIAMS, ANALYST, CROSS RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was stronger than we anticipated. Gross margin improved, operating margin was a little weaker than anticipated, but the strength seems to have come from server tools. And online was a little bit better. Entertainment was a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As for the stock today, we've seen it: It jumped a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Windows 7 will be more popular than has been generally expected. I think it will kick in faster than Vista or XP, but having said that it will be the March quarter before we see it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KATHERINE EGBERT, ANALYST, JEFFERIES  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is back. They are able to succeed despite heightened competition from Apple's share gain and Google's great brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers were unbelievable. An absolutely blowout. Crazy good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every division is solid, including Windows, which is where people thought there would be some slowdown ahead of the Windows 7 upgrade cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of PC buying going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most upside was probably in the entertainment area, which is Xbox. There was about $300 million in upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In cost controls they reported a really good operating margin and they guided down their op-ex for the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BENNETT GAEGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF LISTED EQUITY TRADING, STIFEL NICOLAUS CAPITAL MARKETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They moved the market. They came in with expectation set they were going to be a little soft this quarter in front of the Windows 7 release. The fact they came out and exceeded both the top and bottom line has fueled this move higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was their first big product release in some time, a lot of people were looking for this quarter to be not quite as strong, you see the huge revenue upside, big EPS beat, they are taking their operating expense guidance lower. All in all they are setting up for a stronger move with this release of Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRENDAN BARNICLE, SENIOR ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are seeing some of the benefit of the improvement in PCs that we have heard about, also some of the benefit is improvement in server unit sales, and you have a huge improvement in Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a trend. They've got some good momentum behind them and it's just going to get accelerated now that you have Windows 7 out in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had lower numbers and I thought we may get some upside, but not this much.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI Oct 23 (Reuters) - U.S. drug firm Pfizer (PFE.N)
has approached several Indian drugmakers for possible alliances
to bolster its revenues, the Economic Times reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has tapped Cadila Healthcare (CADI.BO), Emcure,
Intas Pharma and Mankind Pharma, but the Indian companies have
not responded favourably to the offers, the report said citing
an unidentified senior industry executive with direct knowledge
of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer approached Mankind Pharma with a lucrative offer,
valuing the India company at $1 billion," the report quoted
another person familiar with the matter as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mankind's founder and managing director R. C. Juneja,
however, denied that any multinational firm had approached it
with an offer, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intas and Cadila did not respond to emailed queries from
the paper and Emcure officials could not be contacted, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for Pfizer Ltd (PFIZ.BO) when contacted by
Reuters said, "We do not comment on rumours or speculation."  
Some of Pfizer's popular products are set to go off-patent in
the next three years, exposing it to competition from cheaper

&lt;p&gt;Competition between VMware and Microsoft got a little tighter on Thursday with the release of Windows Server 2008 R2, which includes a major update to Microsoft's Hyper-V virtualization software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VMware dominates the server virtualization market, but Microsoft hopes to change that with its new offering, Hyper-V R2. The update adds important capabilities that help Microsoft close the functionality gap with VMware and other rivals. But analysts still see the product falling short in a few areas required for running enterprise-class applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've got a lot of the basics covered if you are doing basic consolidation, but they are lacking a lot of the advanced use-case stuff like business continuity, resource optimization and VDI (virtualization desktop infrastructure)," said Gary Chen, research manager for enterprise virtualization software at IDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next version of the product will likely address many of these issues, he said. In the meantime, Microsoft will try to exploit the advantages it has historically used to push its data center server products, including lower prices and a close tie-in with other Microsoft software. "They are definitely more competitive on pricing," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V R2 ships free with Windows Server 2008 R2, although to get some of the new features, such as Live Migration, customers will have to purchase System Center Virtual Machine Manager, which costs US$869 per physical server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Migration allows virtual machines to be moved from one physical server to another without interrupting service. Hyper-V R2 can also take advantage of more powerful servers, with support for up to 64 physical processors, and allows virtual machines to be migrated between two servers based on the same processor family, such as AMD's Opteron chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the choice of which product to use may come down to whose vision customers most believe in for how the future of virtualization will play out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is counting on its belief that virtual servers ultimately won't account for more than 50 percent of a company's server infrastructure, with physical servers representing the rest. In this scenario, Hyper-V's ability to manage both physical and virtual servers may give it an edge over VMware, whose tools manage only virtual infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's idea of how virtualization gets deployed is fundamentally different from that of VMware, which sees customers running nearly all their servers, along with much of their storage and networking equipment, in a virtualized environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the competition may have had a head start on the hypervisor for the server, we always take the long-lead view and say, 'Where is this going to go?' " said Bob Kelly, corporate vice president of infrastructure server marketing at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft's view, server sprawl -- where companies add extra physical servers that are needed for only brief periods of time -- is a logical and natural response to fears that key applications could be overwhelmed during periods of peak demand. Virtualization allows companies to increase server density, while still maintaining enough extra server capacity to handle peak loads, Kelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's why I still maintain that at some point, you'll be at 40 percent to 50 percent virtualized and you're 50 percent physical, and that's an important thing to recognize. If you recognize that, you can set the strategy. It's not, 'Oh God, we thought the world was going to be only virtual.' That, fundamentally, is why I think VMware is in trouble," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new version of Hyper-V still lags behind VMware's product in several ways and will not meet all the virtualization needs of larger companies, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study released in September, Burton Group said Hyper-V R2 is missing two of the 27 features it considers essential for running enterprise-class applications in production: the ability to assign run priority to each virtual machine on a server, which determines the order in which they are restarted after a hardware failure, and support for multiple virtual CPUs when running Linux and Windows 2000 as guest operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These limitations prevent the platform from meeting the production requirements of the typical large enterprise," Burton Group analyst Chris Wolf wrote in a recent report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Hyper-V R2 will be attractive primarily to small and medium-sized businesses and for use at the departmental level, the report said. However, large companies that have "long-standing technology, business, and strategic investments in Microsoft products" may be willing to accept the absence of key features in Hyper-V R2 to avoid the cost of switching to Microsoft from another virtualization platform later, he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We always try to be best in class in every category we're in," Kelly said. "Sometimes the other guy gets there a little bit ahead of us, so we're in the catch-up position. Sometimes we're ahead of the other guy and we're in the lead position. That's just the nature of this game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft works to match the functionality VMware offers today, VMware is laying the groundwork for what it sees as the next stage of virtualization, where companies deploy applications to a pool of virtualized servers in the cloud, and are then able to move those workloads back and forth between internal and external data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an ambitious strategy and one that is not sure to pay off, given the concerns about security and reliability in the cloud among corporate CIOs. But it positions VMware for what could become an important use of virtualization in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I'm a software development company and I want to unseat the guys at the top, what I have to do is see where the market is going and beat them there. [VMware President and CEO] Paul Maritz did that," Wolf said in an interview. "He said, 'The market is moving towards the cloud and I want to sew up as many cloud providers as I can before my competition does.' And they've done that by a high order of magnitude, with over a thousand service providers now in the VMware partner network. That's huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware believes it can hold on to its technical edge for the foreseeable future, even as Microsoft steps up its investments in virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not something you can do given just programmers and time," said Andrew Dutton, VMware's general manager of Asia-Pacific and Japan. "This is technically really difficult code and hence the patents around it. The thought that someone is just going to come into the market and take this over just through desire ain't going to happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Microsoft is going to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's obviously still very early in the market, no matter how much hype there is, no matter how much people think this game is over," Kelly said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has released a tool that lets netbook owners install Windows 7 on their machines using a USB flash drive, sidestepping the usual requirement of a DVD drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility, Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool, creates a bootable flash drive from a downloaded .iso file, or disk image, of Windows 7, and can be purchased from Microsoft's online store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This tool allows you to create a copy of the .iso file to a USB flash drive or a DVD," said Microsoft in the instructions accompanying the tool . "To install Windows 7 from your USB flash drive or DVD, all you need to do is insert the USB flash drive into your USB port or insert your DVD into your DVD drive and run Setup.exe from the root folder on the drive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USB/DVD Download Tool solves the problem facing netbooks users who want to upgrade to Windows 7, since virtually all netbooks lack a DVD drive. Earlier this year, rumors circulated that Microsoft might offer Windows 7 upgrades on a flash drive, but the talk turned out to be nothing but wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users need a 4GB USB drive to install Windows 7 on a PC without an optical drive, Microsoft said. Other requirements include .NET Framework 2.0 or later, and the ability to run as administrator on the to-be-upgraded netbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The netbook's BIOS must also be modified to set the boot order so that the USB drive is first on the list. "Please see the documentation for your computer for information on how to change the BIOS boot order of drives," Microsoft recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, Microsoft warned users to seek help if they were unfamiliar with tweaking the BIOS. "If you are not comfortable making this type of BIOS change, I recommend you seek some assistance from your favorite 'tech geek,'" Microsoft spokesman Brandon LeBlanc urged in an entry to the Windows 7 blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because most netbooks run Windows XP, only a "clean" upgrade to Windows -- Microsoft dubs it "Custom" during the installation -- is possible. That requires users to back up data and application settings before upgrading, then restore the data and settings, as well as reinstall all applications. (This Computerworld FAQ outlines the steps to take before beginning the Windows 7 upgrade from XP.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USB/DVD Download Tool is a 947KB file that can be downloaded from Microsoft's site ( download .exe file ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Oct 25 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) reported

&lt;p&gt; Chevron began a planned overhaul on Oct 14 of the El

&lt;p&gt;New Global Alliance Expected to Expand PLM in All Industries
ARMONK, N.Y &amp; VELIZY-VILLACOUBLAY, France--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS) (Paris:DSY) (Euronext Paris: #13065,
DSY.PA) today signed an agreement under which DS intends to acquire IBM sales
and client support operations encompassing DS's Product Lifecycle Management
(PLM) software application portfolio, as well as customer contracts and related
assets, for approximately $600 million in cash. 

DS and IBM have also defined the next steps in their long-standing relationship,
and plan to establish DS as an IBM Global Alliance Partner and expand their
services partnership. 

The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2010, subject
to the execution of local agreements and completion of regulatory processes and
applicable labor relations requirements in various countries. 

While the transaction is being completed, both companies expect their existing
operations, including customer service and product availability, to continue as
usual. After completion of the transaction and integration of the two companies`
PLM operations, DS PLM customers will benefit from simplified engagement and
support processes for DS's market-leading PLM product portfolio. 

"The adoption and integration of PLM and 3D collaboration by a growing number of
enterprises require deep industry knowledge," said Bernard Charl&#232;s, president
and CEO of Dassault Syst&#232;mes. "The planned integration of the IBM sales force
and related business operations represents the largest investment in our
corporate history. We are putting our customers and partners first, creating a
globally efficient sales organization to bring the value of V6 PLM applications
to every enterprise in every industry." 

"We are reaching a new level of customer engagement built on commitment,
multi-industry knowledge and high-value solutions for sustainable innovation,"
added Charl&#232;s. "Looking forward, the wide adoption of 3D lifelike experience and
PLM will require the combination of direct sales, our network of partners and
online communities." 

Pursuant to the planned global alliance agreement, IBM and DS expect to continue
to jointly invest in developing, deploying and supporting client PLM
environments, delivering integrated PLM solutions to their clients worldwide. 

The enhanced services agreement is expected to bring significant potential to
the global marketplace with extended IBM resources and expertise to help
transform client PLM environments, leveraging the DS V6 portfolio. Both
companies are dedicated to strengthening and extending their cooperation in the
areas of professional services, cloud computing, middleware, flexible financing,
hardware, and sales and distribution. 

"With this announcement, IBM is evolving its partnership with DS to better align
our mutual strengths and better address our clients' PLM needs," said Tom Hawk,
general manager, IBM Global Industrial Sector. "This transaction also helps fuel
IBM's focus on PLM integration through middleware, business transformation and
application services, and dynamic infrastructure." 

Steve Mills, senior vice president and group executive, IBM Software Group,
added: "Today's agreement positions both our companies for growth in the PLM
space, allowing us to focus on our core competencies and better serve our
clients. The extensive use of IBM Software platforms in the DS application
portfolio will continue to make our partnership unique and valuable to our
customers." 

Dassault Systemes Forward-looking Information

Statements in this press release that are not historical facts but express
expectations or objectives for the future, including but not limited to
statements regarding the completion of the acquisition of IBM PLM are
forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements are based on DS management's current views and
assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual
results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due
to a range of factors. Some of the following risk factors could adversely affect
the transaction, DS`s future results and/or the operations of the business
acquired from IBM.In particular: (i) Required regulatory approvals for the
acquisition may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all, which could delay
or prevent completion of the transaction; (ii) The failure to consummate the
transaction and successfully combine the businesses of IBM and DS in the
expected time frame may adversely affect DS`s future results; (iii) Furthermore,
even if the combination occurs in accordance with the expected time frame, the
integration of IBM`s sales and client support business operations into DS may
not be successful or anticipated benefits to DS from the transaction may not be
realized; (iv) After completion of the transaction, DS will have significantly
more revenue and employees than it did prior to the transaction and the
attendant integration process will require DS to expand the scope of its
operations and financial systems and DS's management will be required to devote
a substantial amount of time and attention to the process of integrating the
operations of the IBM business.

Unfavorable changes in any of the above or other general risk factors related to
DS`s business as described in the Company`s regulatory reports, including the
Document de r&#233;f&#233;rence, as filed with the French "Autorit&#233; des march&#233;s
financiers" (AMF) on April 2, 2009, could materially affect the Company`s
financial position or results of operations.

&#224; l`ensemble des secteurs industriels
ARMONK, N.Y (ETATS-UNIS) et VELIZY-VILLACOUBLAY--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

IBM (NYSE:IBM) et Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS) (Paris:DSY) (Euronext Paris : #13065,
DSY.PA) ont sign&#233; aujourd`hui un accord pr&#233;voyant l`acquisition par DS des
activit&#233;s de ventes et de support client d`IBM d&#233;di&#233;es au portefeuille
d`applications PLM (Product Lifecycle Management ou gestion du cycle de vie des
produits) de DS, ainsi que les contrats clients et actifs associ&#233;s. La
transaction s'&#233;l&#232;ve &#224; environ 600 millions de dollars US en cash. 

DS et IBM ont &#233;galement d&#233;fini les prochaines &#233;tapes de leur relation &#233;tablie de
longue date et pr&#233;voient d`attribuer &#224; DS le statut d`IBM Global Alliance
Partner, tout en renfor&#231;ant leur partenariat de services. 

La transaction devrait &#234;tre finalis&#233;e durant le premier semestre 2010, sous
r&#233;serve de la signature d`accords dans chacun des pays concern&#233;s, de la
finalisation des proc&#233;dures r&#233;glementaires et de la lev&#233;e des conditions
applicables en mati&#232;re de relations sociales dans divers pays. 

Durant la phase de finalisation de la transaction, les deux soci&#233;t&#233;s pr&#233;voient
de poursuivre leurs activit&#233;s de mani&#232;re inchang&#233;e, notamment en termes de
service client et de disponibilit&#233; des produits. Une fois la transaction
finalis&#233;e et l`int&#233;gration des activit&#233;s PLM des deux soci&#233;t&#233;s r&#233;alis&#233;e, les
clients PLM de DS vont b&#233;n&#233;ficier, pour son portefeuille de produits PLM
leaders, de proc&#233;dures d`engagement et de support simplifi&#233;es. 

&#171; L`adoption et l`int&#233;gration des solutions PLM et de collaboration 3D par un
nombre croissant d`entreprises requiert une connaissance approfondie de
l`industrie&#187;, d&#233;clare Bernard Charl&#232;s, Directeur G&#233;n&#233;ral de Dassault Syst&#232;mes.
"L`int&#233;gration des forces de vente d`IBM et de ses activit&#233;s connexes est le
plus important investissement jamais r&#233;alis&#233; par notre soci&#233;t&#233;. Nous pensons en
priorit&#233; &#224; nos clients et &#224; nos partenaires, en cr&#233;ant une force de vente
efficace &#224; l`&#233;chelle mondiale afin d`apporter toute la valeur des solutions PLM
V6 &#224; toutes les entreprises de tous les secteurs industriels. &#187; 

&#171; Nous acc&#233;dons &#224; un niveau sup&#233;rieur de relation client, fond&#233; sur
l`engagement, la connaissance multisectorielle et les solutions &#224; haute valeur
ajout&#233;e garantissant une innovation durable &#187;, ajoute Bernard Charl&#232;s. &#171; A
l`avenir,l'adoption g&#233;n&#233;ralis&#233;e des solutions 3D r&#233;alistes et du PLM demandera
d`associer les ventes directes, notre r&#233;seau de partenaires et les communaut&#233;s
en ligne. &#187; 

Dans le cadre du contrat d`alliance mondiale pr&#233;vu, les deux soci&#233;t&#233;s comptent
poursuivre leurs investissements communs pour d&#233;velopper, d&#233;ployer et assurer le
support des environnements PLM de leurs clients &#224; travers le monde, en leur
apportant des solutions PLM int&#233;gr&#233;es. 

Le contrat de services &#233;tendu devrait offrir un potentiel important sur le
march&#233; mondial, gr&#226;ce &#224; l`extension des ressources et &#224; l`expertise accrue
d`IBM. Celles-ci vont contribuer &#224; transformer les environnements PLM des
clients en tirant parti du portefeuille de solutions V6 de DS. En outre, les
deux soci&#233;t&#233;s souhaitent renforcer et &#233;tendre leur collaboration dans les
domaines des services professionnels, du cloud computing, du middleware, du
financement flexible, des &#233;quipements informatiques, des ventes et de la
distribution. 

&#171; Cet accord permet &#224; IBM de faire &#233;voluer son partenariat avec DS afin de mieux
associer nos forces r&#233;ciproques et de mieux r&#233;pondre aux besoins de nos clients
PLM &#187;, indique Tom Hawk, General Manager, IBM Global Industrial Sector. &#171; Cette
transaction va &#233;galement permettre &#224; IBM de focaliser son attention sur
l`int&#233;gration des solutions PLM, en donnant la priorit&#233; au middleware, aux
services de transformation des m&#233;thodes de l`entreprise et des applications,
ainsi qu`aux infrastructures dynamiques. &#187; 

Steve Mills, Senior Vice-President et Group Executive d`IBM Software Group,
ajoute : &#171; L`accord conclu aujourd`hui permet &#224; nos deux soci&#233;t&#233;s de se pr&#233;parer
&#224; la croissance sur le march&#233; du PLM, de se concentrer sur leurs c&#339;urs de m&#233;tier
et d`am&#233;liorer le service offert &#224; leurs clients. L`utilisation pouss&#233;e des
plateformes d`IBM Software dans le portefeuille d`applications de DS va
p&#233;renniser le caract&#232;re unique de notre partenariat et sa valeur pour nos
clients. &#187; 

Avertissement concernant les d&#233;clarations relatives aux perspectives d`avenir de
Dassault Systemes

Ce document pr&#233;sente des informations qui ne sont pas de nature historique mais
qui expriment des attentes ou des objectifs pour le futur, notamment, de fa&#231;on
non limitative, les d&#233;clarations concernant l`acquisition d`IBM PLM qui sont des
informations relatives aux perspectives d`avenir de la Soci&#233;t&#233;. 

Ces perspectives d`avenir sont fond&#233;es sur les avis et hypoth&#232;ses actuellement
retenus par la direction de DS et prennent en compte un certain nombre
d`incertitudes et de risques connus et non connus. En cons&#233;quence, les r&#233;sultats
ou les performances qui seront r&#233;alis&#233;s sont susceptibles d`&#234;tre
substantiellement diff&#233;rents des r&#233;sultats et des performances anticip&#233;s, du
fait de plusieurs facteurs. 

Certains des risques et des incertitudes suivants peuvent affecter
d&#233;favorablement la transaction, les r&#233;sultats et les performances anticip&#233;es de
DS et/ou les op&#233;rations de l`entit&#233; acquise d`IBM. 

En particulier : (i) l`approbation des proc&#233;dures r&#233;glementaires peut ne pas
&#234;tre obtenue ou ne pas &#234;tre r&#233;alis&#233;e dans les d&#233;lais pr&#233;vus ce qui peut retarder
ou emp&#234;cher la finalisation de la transaction. (ii) l`impossibilit&#233; de r&#233;aliser
la transaction et d`associer avec succ&#232;s les activit&#233;s de IBM et de DS dans les
d&#233;lais pr&#233;vus peut affecter d&#233;favorablement les r&#233;sultats et les performances
anticip&#233;s de DS. (iii) De plus, m&#234;me si la transaction est finalis&#233;e dans les
d&#233;lais pr&#233;vus, l`int&#233;gration des activit&#233;s ventes et support client de IBM dans
DS peut ne pas r&#233;ussir ou ne pas apporter &#224; DS les b&#233;n&#233;fices escompt&#233;s de la
transaction (iv) Apr&#232;s la finalisation de la transaction, l` effectif et le
chiffre d`affaires de DS augmenteront substantiellement et la phase
d`int&#233;gration obligera la Soci&#233;t&#233; &#224; &#233;tendre ses responsabilit&#233;s op&#233;rationnelles
et financi&#232;res. La direction de DS devra consacrer une attention et un temps
importants &#224; la phase d`int&#233;gration des activit&#233;s de IBM. 

Des &#233;volutions d&#233;favorables de ces facteurs ainsi que d`autres &#233;v&#233;nements tels
que d&#233;crits dans le Document de r&#233;f&#233;rence de la Soci&#233;t&#233;, d&#233;pos&#233; aupr&#232;s de
l`Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers (AMF) le 2 avril 2009, pourraient sensiblement
affecter la situation financi&#232;re de la Soci&#233;t&#233; ou ses r&#233;sultats.

With the release of this new service, Microsoft Co., Ltd., working with each of
its software partners, will test each application to ensure a smooth transition
for corporate customers to cloud computing. Joint marketing activities for this
service will commence in November 2009. IIJ is targeting 4,000 server sales in
the first three years of operation.

This service enables customers to build a flexible cloud-computing environment
by selecting only those server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) necessary to
meet the needs of each business, and without the extra work of building one's
own corporate server. Using the Dynamic Datacenter Tool Kit to build data
centers for cloud computing -- with applications such as Microsoft's Hyper-V
virtualization technology and the System Center administration tool -- in
conjunction with the advanced cloud platform of IIJ GIO, IIJ will provide cloud
services optimized for a corporate system environment built on Windows Server.
With this configuration, each corporate user can easily and quickly build a
cloud-based Windows Server environment that is equivalent to their existing
system without modifying existing applications.

In the future, IIJ and Microsoft will perform joint technology testing with the
aim of providing services that can be run either on the company's own system or
on a cloud environment -- whichever is more appropriate -- in order to meet the
broad needs of our corporate customers.

&lt;p&gt;IBM will announce a range of additions to its already-burgeoning portfolio of BI (business intelligence) tools on Monday during its annual Information on Demand (IOD) conference in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New software for content analysis will help users mine unstructured data, such as a raft of customer e-mails, for insights, said Rob Ashe, general manager of BI and performance management. For example, a restaurant chain could determine which menu items are receiving particularly high praise or scorn, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is also announcing new analytics modules for tracking sales performance, worker recruitment and training, and supply chain management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Big Blue plans to showcase a new mining toolkit for InfoSphere Streams, its software for real-time data analysis, and Master Information Hub, an add-on to its InfoSphere Master Data Management server. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Master data refers to data objects that are common to many applications in a company, such as "customer." The Information Hub will allow customers to expand the range and contextual relevance of data in their MDM environments. For example, a consumer products company could relate a list of GPS coordinates to components it purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the IOD lineup seems to reflect past shows, which were "overstuffed" with a passel of middle-of-the-road announcements, said Forrester Research analyst James Kobielus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's real trump card -- its recent purchase of predictive analytics vendor SPSS -- should be taking center stage instead, according to Kobielus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they don't play up the SPSS acquisition to the hilt, they'll be doing themselves and customers a disservice," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt IBM has big plans for SPSS. It formed a new services arm dedicated to business analytics, staffing it with some 4,000 consultants. A key focus of the organization will be no doubt to push predictive analytics, which focus on determining future events and exploring "what-if" scenarios, versus generating reports from batches of historical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictive analytics is the next hot area in BI, according to Forrester. In a report published earlier this year, the analyst firm called IBM's SPSS purchase "a tipping point" followed by a wave of similar acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPSS will indeed have a significant profile at IOD, according to Ashe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Information on Demand conference continues through Thursday in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday blamed user confusion for the problems many have encountered trying to move from Vista to Windows 7 after buying a discounted upgrade offered to college students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Digital River and Microsoft are aware that some customers from the Windows 7 Academic Store had difficulties completing the download or installation of the product," said a Microsoft support engineer identified as "Michael" in a message posted Sunday to the company's support forum .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minneapolis, Minn.-based Digital River fulfills download orders for Microsoft's $29.99 Windows 7 upgrade offer to students. Several hundred users have said that they were unable to upgrade from Windows Vista to the new operating system after purchasing, then downloading, a Windows 7 upgrade, from Digital River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are aware that consumers are encountering difficulties installing Windows 7 where the customer is currently running a 32-bit version of Windows such as Windows Vista, but purchased the 64-bit version of Windows 7," Michael said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, users reported that an error message prevented them from unpacking files downloaded from Digital River. The message read: "We are unable to create or save new files in the folder in which this application was downloaded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This error occurs when you are in the unloading phase of the 64-bit Windows 7 download process and are running a 32-bit version of Windows such as Windows XP or Windows Vista 32-bit," Michael added. "This is by design, as you cannot launch setup for the 64-bit version of Widows 7 while running a 32-bit operating system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, users can conduct "in-place" upgrades -- those that retain all data, settings and applications -- only from Vista 32-bit to Windows 7 32-bit, or from Vista 64-bit to Windows 7 64-bit. The company had spelled out the in-place upgrade paths last summer, before it released Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to move from Windows Vista 32-bit to Windows 7 64-bit, or if you are running Windows XP, you have to do a "Custom" or clean installation that must be started by booting off the Windows 7 64-bit DVD," Michael stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Windows 7 custom upgrade, called a "clean" install by some, requires users to back up data and settings from Windows XP or Vista, install Windows 7, then restore the data and settings before finally reinstalling all applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students who mistakenly downloaded the 64-bit edition of Windows 7 from Digital River should request a refund, Microsoft's Michael continued, then pay for and download the 32-bit version instead. He pointed customers to a page on Digital River's site where they could request a refund. "In the Web form, select the Order question option in the drop-down menu and include 'Refund and Request 32-bit' in the first line of the problem description," Michael recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His advice runs counter to the policy listed on the Digital River support site, which says that there are no refunds for the student discount Windows 7 upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael claimed that Digital River has identified and contacted customers who have been affected by the download error. "Digital River has been making every effort to make it right for these customers," he said. The Microsoft engineer also said Microsoft would not handle support questions about Windows 7 unless customers were able to reach the initial installation screen; all issues prior to that step were to be directed to Digital River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, users blamed both companies for their problems, and were irked that neither had stepped up to accept responsibility or provide answers. "This problem is not being resolved by anyone," complained a user tagged as "tatguy6" on the same support thread Saturday. "Someone is to blame. I guess we are just gonna have to wait for someone to pull their heads out of their butts and do something for us to resolve this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I [have] had enough," added "arkavat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatguy6, arkavat and several others said that they were, or had, filed complaints against Digital River with the Better Business Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital River has yet not responded to a request for comment made last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Landmark, a brand of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), today launches GeoGraphix Discovery
3D software, the new Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows PC-based offering
incorporating state-of-the-art interactive visualization tools from Microsoft`s
Xbox gaming console and the 64-bit capabilities and performance of the new
Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. Using this new member of the GeoGraphix
product family, Discovery 3D software users will have an immersive, game-like
experience when developing geologic interpretations. 

GeoGraphix Discovery 3D software is one of the first oil and gas solutions
leveraging the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system as well as the latest
DirectX graphics technology, combined with Microsoft Xbox gaming technology. The
resulting product vastly improves the way geoscientists interact with and
manipulate 3D subsurface models, allowing for faster, more accurate
interpretations and decisions. 

Chris Usher, senior director of Landmark Software and Services, said, "Discovery
3D software is the result of the partnership combining Landmark`s geoscience
expertise and Microsoft`s rich and pervasive technology platform. Landmark is
again leading in innovation by introducing an E visualization product that
applies the latest in 3D graphics and gaming technology, giving geoscientists a
seamless and productive way to interact with 3D models. Discovery 3D software
also provides up-and-coming generations of geoscientists a familiar environment
to work in, making it quick and easy for them to adopt this technology. This
familiar experience is completed by the Windows PC platform for Discovery 3D
software, making high-performance 3D visualization and interpretation tools
accessible and affordable to companies of all sizes." 

"We are delighted with the Halliburton partnership," said Albrecht (Ali)
Ferling, Ph.D., managing director, Worldwide Oil and Gas Industries for
Microsoft. "Discovery 3D software is a great example and just the tip of the
iceberg in a series of breakthrough innovations our companies will deliver to
the oil &amp; gas industry in the coming months and years. Halliburton`s commitment
to the Windows 7 operating system and DirectX graphics is a great recognition of
the enterprise-class capabilities and technology delivered by our latest
operating system, as well as a confirmation of the great momentum of Microsoft`s
offerings and partnerships in the oil and gas industry worldwide." 

When combined with the Discovery software integrated platform framework,
resulting workflows provide a novel interaction with all of the well
information, geologic interpretations, structural and geo-referenced layers in
three dimensions. Geologic interpretations developed using the GeoGraphix
Discovery workflow, and visualized in real time through Discovery 3D software,
translate to an enhanced, more complete understanding of the geologist`s work,
and they ultimately improve models in a real-world, 3D earth model domain.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights American Physicians Service Group (Nasdaq:
AMPH) as the Bull of the Day and AGCO Corp. (NYSE: AGCO) the Bear of the Day. In
addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE),
Fannie Mae (NYSE: FNM) and Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are upgrading our recommendation on American Physicians Service Group
(Nasdaq: AMPH) from Neutral to Outperform. American Physicians second quarter
operating earnings of 82 cents per share were significantly ahead of the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of 66 cents. 

Results were driven by better-than-expected results in the Financial Service
segment, strong policyholder retention and favorable developments from prior
years. The company is also experiencing the benefits of the implementation of
its cost containment measures. 

Though declining rate continued to partially offset growth, policyholder
retention, conservative reserve position and capital position augur well for a
solid growth path with the market recovery. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are downgrading our rating on AGCO Corp. (NYSE: AGCO) from Neutral to
Underperform. The company is witnessing soft demand conditions in most of its
markets due to the significant slowdown in the global economy. 

The near-term outlook for agricultural equipment is extremely uncertain,
especially in Europe, which represents a major portion of the company's total
revenue. Given the continued slowdown in the global economy, tighter credit
markets and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, AGCO expects 2009
revenue to decline 20 23% from $8.4 billion in 2008. 

Also, the company forecasts 2009 EPS in the range of $1.30 $1.50, compared to
$4.09 in 2008 due to weak sales and lower margins. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Used Home Sales Soar

While the official inventories are down, I am still concerned about the "shadow
inventory" out there. Banks have been slow to foreclose, in part due to
political pressures, but also because if they do so, then they are going to have
to book the loss. Instead, they are trying to modify the mortgages through the
HAMP program, which allows them to "extend and pretend" that the mortgages are
still performing just fine. 

In the meantime, more and more people are falling behind on their mortgage
payments. In a separate report, Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE) reported that
delinquencies jumped to 3.33 percent of its book of business in September from
3.13 percent in August and 1.22 percent in September 2008. Those are not just
one payment late, but delinquencies of 90 days or more. 

The rise in delinquencies has been relentless and shows no signs of slowing. One
of four things has to happen. Either all these folks who are behind on their
mortgages will have to: 

1) Come up with the cash to back to current 

2) The mortgage must be modified in a way that people can afford the house,
resulting in a big hit to the value of the mortgage to the bank by either
cutting the interest rate and or principal on the mortgage 

3) The banks and ultimately Freddie -- and Fannie Mae (NYSE: FNM) -- will just
have to let people continue to live rent- and mortgage-payment-free indefinitely


4) Or there will have to be another wave of foreclosures. 

Microsoft Beats, Results Down

Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT) reported first quarter 2010 earnings that
beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Revenue beat the consensus by
4.9%. 

Revenue of $12.9 billion was down 1.4% sequentially and 14.2% year over year.
This excludes $1.47 billion in deferred revenue related to the Windows 7 Upgrade
Option as well as initial sales of Windows 7 to OEMs and retailers. Consumer
demand drove increases in Windows and Xbox products, but this was offset by
sluggish business spending. Foreign exchange had a $233 million impact on
revenue in the last quarter. 

Approximately 35% of total revenue came from annuity, 30% from OEM, 25% from
licenses and 10% from other business. Management estimates that the PC market
was up mid-teens from the Jun 2009 quarter, with approximately 12% of the total
market consisting of net books.

&lt;p&gt;  MINNEAPOLIS, MN and LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 26 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Analysts International Corporation (AIC) (NASDAQ: ANLY), a leading
systems integrator for state and local government, and Microsoft
Corporation today announced a new contract with the Las Vegas
Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) to modernize the Department's
criminal intelligence processes leveraging the Microsoft Fusion Core
Solution. The companies will also integrate information from the region's
dispatch systems into the Information Sharing and Analysis Tools (ISAT)
platform to help the LVMPD and the Southern Nevada Counter-Terrorism
Center (SNCTC) better fight crime and combat domestic terrorism.

    "Our number one priority is to help the LVMPD proactively prepare for and
counter potential threats and criminal activities," said Elmer Baldwin,
AIC President and CEO. "Providing a consolidated view of Southern Nevada
dispatch data will be a significant step forward for regional public
safety. And, with the deployment of the Microsoft Fusion Core Solution,
AIC's law enforcement experts can quickly identify and implement new
capabilities for the Department, ensuring the right people have access to
the right information at the right place and time."

    "Criminal intelligence and intelligence fusion processes have evolved over
the years but they haven't been modernized to take full advantage of
today's advanced technology," said LVMPD Homeland Security Deputy Chief
Greg McCurdy. "Together with AIC, we will document and improve our
critical business processes and then automate them with the help of the
Microsoft Fusion Core Solution. When this work is complete, the
Department's detectives and analysts will be better prepared to fight
crime and protect the Las Vegas community."

    The Microsoft Fusion Core Solution is an easy-to-use, quick-to-configure
solution that combines the robust capabilities of the ESRI ArcGIS Advanced
Enterprise Server(TM) and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007(TM). The
solution provides pre-loaded and configurable forms for collecting,
assigning and satisfying many different types of criminal intelligence
service requests. It provides out-of-the-box functionality that can be
integrated with existing systems to enhance security and management
reporting capabilities.

    "AIC is a key Microsoft partner for justice, public safety and homeland
security applications," said Joe Rozek, Executive Director of Homeland
Security and Counterterrorism for Microsoft's U.S. Public Sector business.
"Their years of experience in the justice and public safety space,
combined with their deep technical expertise and ability to deploy the
Microsoft Fusion Core Solution, is making a world of difference for our
customers and is resulting in safer communities."

    "The ISAT is a solid information sharing foundation thanks to the past
work of AIC and Microsoft," said Phil Roland, LVMPD's Chief Information
Officer. "Incorporating regional dispatch information into the ISAT will
get us one step closer to our objective of providing timely access to
comprehensive and accurate information, and ultimately to help support
our officers' experience, intuition and knowledge."

&lt;p&gt;  MINNEAPOLIS, MN and LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 26 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Analysts International Corporation (AIC) (NASDAQ: ANLY), a leading
systems integrator for state and local government, and Microsoft
Corporation today announced a new contract with the Las Vegas
Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) to modernize the Department's
criminal intelligence processes leveraging the Microsoft Fusion Core
Solution. The companies will also integrate information from the region's
dispatch systems into the Information Sharing and Analysis Tools (ISAT)
platform to help the LVMPD and the Southern Nevada Counter-Terrorism
Center (SNCTC) better fight crime and combat domestic terrorism.

    "Our number one priority is to help the LVMPD proactively prepare for and
counter potential threats and criminal activities," said Elmer Baldwin,
AIC President and CEO. "Providing a consolidated view of Southern Nevada
dispatch data will be a significant step forward for regional public
safety. And, with the deployment of the Microsoft Fusion Core Solution,
AIC's law enforcement experts can quickly identify and implement new
capabilities for the Department, ensuring the right people have access to
the right information at the right place and time."

    "Criminal intelligence and intelligence fusion processes have evolved over
the years but they haven't been modernized to take full advantage of
today's advanced technology," said LVMPD Homeland Security Deputy Chief
Greg McCurdy. "Together with AIC, we will document and improve our
critical business processes and then automate them with the help of the
Microsoft Fusion Core Solution. When this work is complete, the
Department's detectives and analysts will be better prepared to fight
crime and protect the Las Vegas community."

    The Microsoft Fusion Core Solution is an easy-to-use, quick-to-configure
solution that combines the robust capabilities of the ESRI ArcGIS Advanced
Enterprise Server(TM) and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007(TM). The
solution provides pre-loaded and configurable forms for collecting,
assigning and satisfying many different types of criminal intelligence
service requests. It provides out-of-the-box functionality that can be
integrated with existing systems to enhance security and management
reporting capabilities.

    "AIC is a key Microsoft partner for justice, public safety and homeland
security applications," said Joe Rozek, Executive Director of Homeland
Security and Counterterrorism for Microsoft's U.S. Public Sector business.
"Their years of experience in the justice and public safety space,
combined with their deep technical expertise and ability to deploy the
Microsoft Fusion Core Solution, is making a world of difference for our
customers and is resulting in safer communities."

    "The ISAT is a solid information sharing foundation thanks to the past
work of AIC and Microsoft," said Phil Roland, LVMPD's Chief Information
Officer. "Incorporating regional dispatch information into the ISAT will
get us one step closer to our objective of providing timely access to
comprehensive and accurate information, and ultimately to help support
our officers' experience, intuition and knowledge."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 26 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on
Monday it had a molten sulfur leak from a pipeline while a
barge was being loaded with it at the marine terminal of its
330,000-barrel-per-day Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We had a leak of elemental sulfur from a pipeline. We were
loading a barge at the refinery when this occurred," said Steve
Renfroe, a refinery spokesman, referring to the Sunday morning
incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We stopped loading and we are repairing the line and are
in the process of retrieving the sulfur," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Renfroe declined to comment on whether production at the
refinery was impacted, citing company policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said initial reports that about four tons of sulfur may
have leaked into Bayou Casotte in Mississippi were overstated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe it's much less than that," Renfroe added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cause of the leak was under investigation, he said.

&lt;p&gt;COOPER CITY, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Linxter, Inc. today announces the release of an open source Microsoft SQL Server
integration service, intended to illustrate the benefits of system integration
using cloud services instead of web services. .NET developers are welcome to
modify and extend the code for their own integration projects. 

With the Linxter - Microsoft SQL integration service, database administrators
and system integrators can use their existing .NET skills to connect distributed
applications and integrate distributed systems with their SQL server, all
without building or exposing web services. With the integration service`s open
source code and Linxter`s plug and play communication plumbing, the technical
barrier to entry is dramatically lowered for developers who want to create
programs that can exchange data with their database server. 

Database integration is now as easy as downloading the Linxter - Microsoft SQL
integration source code, modifying as you please, and creating a Linxter account
to control your backend permissions and restrictions. Developers are encouraged
to enhance the source code themselves, or if needed, contact Linxter Inc. to
find someone who has already worked with the Linxter technology. 

Cloud services built with Linxter are firewall friendly and provide secure,
reliable, well-governed, asynchronous data exchange. A cloud messaging platform,
Linxter eliminates common technical barriers such as message polling,
transactional queues, dynamic endpoint reconfiguration, encryption and
authentication, internet connection retries, non-repudiation and file chunking. 

Linxter, Inc. released the Linxter - Microsoft SQL integration service as part
of an ongoing effort to ensure that Linxter provides the ultimate ease of use
experience for developers. Our goal is to provide the developer community with a
variety of sample apps and services (http://linxterdeveloper.com/sample-apps)
made possible with Linxter`s in-the-cloud communication plumbing. 

To learn more about leveraging cloud services to connect other kinds of
distributed apps, visit http://linxter.com. 

About Linxter, Inc.

Linxter, Inc. was established to create new paths and opportunities for data
exchange. Realizing immense growth in Internet-enabled devices would cause a
bottleneck for programming in the communication layer, Jason Milgram
(CEO/Founder) began developing Linxter to provide message-oriented middleware
as-a-service. A behind-the-scenes technology, Linxter removes the complexities
and costs for developers when implementing secure, reliable messaging among
disparate programs. 

Linxter, Inc. is headquartered in Cooper City, Florida. For more information,

&lt;p&gt;Manhattan Associates' Distribution and Transportation Solutions Ready-To-Run on
IBM Virtualization Technology

ATLANTA, Oct. 26, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The growing use of server
virtualization technology has enabled companies to reduce costs and overhead
while optimizing computing resources throughout the enterprise. Though the
technology creates deployment flexibility, it can also result in performance
issues if high-yield solutions running on the server are not tested for a
virtualized environment. To support this technology, Manhattan Associates
(Nasdaq:MANH) today announced that its Warehouse Management (WMS) and
Transportation, Planning and Execution (TP) solutions are tested and
ready-to-run on the IBM AIX 6.1 operating system, featuring PowerVM

operating systems on IBM Power Systems. PowerVM virtualizes processor and I/O
resources for client partitions, enabling increased asset utilization, enhanced
infrastructure flexibility and reduced costs. Virtualization technology allows
organizations to consolidate multiple operating systems and software stacks on a
single platform, and allocate the platform to meet specific business and
application requirements in a more dynamic fashion.

"Virtualization of our Manhattan Associates solutions on IBM Power Systems
technology has enabled us to respond rapidly to new business requirements and to
create test and development environments at no incremental cost in terms of
hardware or power consumption," said David Markwell, vice president, information
technology for Loblaw Companies Limited, a Manhattan WMS customer.

Management product suite, is designed for optimal collaboration and

&lt;p&gt;Users remained stymied today by endless reboots after trying to upgrade their PCs to Windows 7, according to messages posted on Microsoft's support forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An answer has yet to be found for all users, who began reporting the problem last Friday after watching the upgrade stall two-thirds of the way through the process. Most users said that their PCs had displayed an error that claimed the upgrade had been unsuccessful and that Vista would be restored. Instead, their PCs again booted to the Windows 7 setup process, failed, then restarted the vicious cycle .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Microsoft engineers, including the company's senior group manager for Windows supportability, have offered advice, but on Monday users continued to publish complaints on a growing forum thread .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think I've gotten to the point where trying to install Windows 7 is simply not worth it," said "Chimaera717" around 1 p.m. ET today. Chimaera717 was one of the first users to gripe about reboot hell. "I'm more content with actually having a working computer. Anyone know if we can get our money back?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Microsoft support engineers posting to the thread urged users to burn downloaded upgrades -- which were delivered as disk image, or .iso, files -- at their DVD drives' slowest speeds to reduce the chance of corrupting the data, one possible explanation for the endless reboots. At the same time, one user pointed others to a document published last July on Microsoft's support site that spelled out a possible solution .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late Monday, Paul Aaron, Microsoft's senior group manager for Windows supportability, chimed in with a link to another support document . "From reading through the article, it looks like there is a service running in the background that is preventing the upgrade from completing," Aaron said. "Hope this helps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document, published in early September, noted that the "iphlpsvc" service -- which offers IPv6 connectivity over an IPv4 network -- may cause Vista-to-Windows 7 upgrades to hang at the 62%-completed mark. The fix that Aaron highlighted requires users to modify the advanced system settings of the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those instructions didn't do anything for some users, who said that their systems were still crippled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You people at Microsoft just don't get it, do you?" protested a user tagged as "FJP57" on the thread. "The problem for many here is that the store-bought upgrade, not just the download, is failing in all types and makes of computers. Read the posts. It's not isolated. There is NO BOOT MENU OPTION TO LOAD VISTA AGAIN. IT'S GONE. The boot cycles over and over again. It's that simple. This is not an operator error. It's a Microsoft problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endless reboot is among the top active threads on Microsof's Windows 7 installation support forum. Only the thread that outlines the problem college students have had upgrading using a discounted $30 download has more messages and views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft's head of support, however, the endless reboot problem isn't on the company's top list of concerns. "It's very early in the process," said Ben Bennett, the director of Microsoft's Windows consumer global support group, in an interview Monday afternoon. "In terms of the top issues of customers who choose to upgrade, the XP-to-Windows 7 [upgrade] is up there on the list for lots of reasons. The netbook upgrade scenario -- how do I upgrade my netbook to Windows 7 -- is also a big one. And another is, 'Where are my applications?' after people have upgraded. They wonder what happened to e-mail and photo editing, for example. Those are the top issues so far."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, said Bennett, the volume of support calls and queries for Windows 7 is lower than Microsoft expected. "With Vista [in 2007], sales were not quite what we expected, but Windows 7 is very different," Bennett said, as he declined to quantify the difference between Vista and Windows 7 support volume, saying that it was in part reliant on sales. "But on the pure support side, Windows 7 is similar to our lower volume expectations. It's still very, very early, but volumes are lower on the support side with Windows 7 while volumes are higher on the sales side."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's long-term expectations are that it will field a smaller number of support calls and questions for Windows 7 compared to Vista, Bennett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some users whose PCs are constantly rebooting disagreed with that rosier outlook for Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have to say that my system is a very generic Windows Vista Home Basic install that I've done nothing to," said someone nicknamed "tjtull" in a message posted around 2 p.m. ET today. "I haven't added any fancy video cards or drivers to it. The machine I'm trying to upgrade is a notebook computer that has nothing special about it and no peripherals attached to it. Not to grouse continually about this, but I find it inexplicable that a vanilla upgrade from the same software company would not work on my vanilla install."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- New 1394b Bus Driver Uses Kernel-Mode Driver Framework, Adds Support for 800
Megabit/Second Speeds, Longer Distances, Alternative Media --
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Support for IEEE-1394b in Microsoft Corporation`s new Windows 7 release
guarantees optimal FireWire performance in video, audio, storage,
instrumentation, and other innovative new PC applications, the 1394 Trade
Association said today. 

The 1394 bus driver was rewritten for Windows 7 to add support for higher speeds
and alternative media as defined in the IEEE-1394b specification. The legacy
stack will also be present on Windows 7, providing compatibility with virtually
everything that worked with previous versions. 

Microsoft has a technical backgrounder on Win7 FireWire support entitled "1394
Bus Driver in Windows 7." It provides information about IEEE 1394 support in
Windows 7 so that 1394 developers can understand the new 1394 bus driver and
provide support for higher speeds and alternative media. The current version of
this paper is maintained at this URL:
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/connect/1394_Windows7.mspx

It also is available at www.1394ta.org/

"Win7 support for 1394b provides significant benefits to designers, developers
and users who rely on FireWire 800 for their computer, consumer, industrial and,
in the future, automotive, applications," said Max Bassler, chairman of the 1394
Trade Association. "Microsoft has also added the 1394b protocol stack to its
latest MS Auto Version 4.0 for the automotive systems environment, another very
positive development." 

1394b is being applied in products and systems that require reliable
peer-to-peer connectivity over long distances. It features 800 Mbps bandwidth
with no host required, optimize bandwidth utilization, and provides all-digital
signaling, longer cabling distances (up to 100 meters), loops for redundant
connections, and additional types of cables, among other benefits for the PC,
consumer electronics and automotive industries. 

The 1394 Trade Association is a worldwide organization dedicated to the
advancement of the IEEE 1394 (FireWire) standard. The 1394TA recently celebrated
its 15th year of promoting 1394. More than 1.25 billion 1394 ports have been
shipped since that time. For more information, visit www.1394ta.org

&lt;p&gt;If SAS Institute CEO Jim Goodnight is feeling pressured by IBM's recent US$1.2 billion purchase of rival predictive analytics vendor SPSS, he's not showing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I haven't noticed much difference, really, since IBM bought them," he said in an interview Tuesday at SAS' Cary, North Carolina, campus. "We have competed with SPSS for 35 years. We've competed with IBM that same amount of time. Nothing really new competitively has taken place as far as we're concerned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAS bills itself as the world's largest privately held software company, reporting $2.26 billion in sales during 2008. It has seen heightened competition of late, as vendors such as IBM, Oracle and SAP aggressively flesh out their BI (business intelligence) strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's SPSS purchase particularly seemed aimed at SAS, given the latter's long track record in predictive analytics, which center on modeling future outcomes and conducting "what-if" scenarios, rather than generating reports from historical data stores. Forrester Research has predicted further consolidation in the predictive analytics space, which includes a range of smaller vendors as well as open-source projects, in the wake of IBM's move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is hoping to boost predictive analytics projects with a new 4,000-strong services arm it formed earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope they can find work for all of them," Goodnight said. "Analytics is big, it's certainly the next wave, but I'm not sure it can grow as rapidly as IBM thinks it can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, SAS is planning to showcase its predictive analytics wares during a customer event in Las Vegas Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One SAS package is supposed to help debt-collection operations. It can be used to develop customer models showing which means of contact is best for various types of debtors. For example, companies could use it to make sure live collections agents focus on people who are the most likely to actually pay back some money, given the expense of running a call center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes are using another "optimization" software application from SAS to determine how to price game tickets, said Bill Nowicki, director of ticket operations, during a panel discussion Tuesday at SAS headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On an annual basis, our executive team gets together and tries to determine, based on the previous sales cycle, what the optimal base price will be," he said. "[We've looked] at our promotions we've run previously, and seen how well they fared." But the team lacked a "scientific model" that could look at those past sales, analyze them and come up with a price that would boost sales but also keep the team competitive with other entertainment options, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had to figure out a better way to do that than gut instinct," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAS is also planning to discuss a new application, SAS Enterprise Case Management, which helps fraud investigators document ongoing cases and assists with making required regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies should use technology to systematically detect fraud because "fraudsters" behave like a network, said Chris Swecker, a former assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's criminal investigative division and corporate security director for Bank of America, who now works as an independent consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By addressing fraud in a "one-off" fashion, companies end up playing a frustrating game of "whack-a-mole," he said, referring to the carnival game where players try to smack a plastic mole with a mallet as it rapidly and randomly pops out of holes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another persistent problem is that few fraudsters ever get prosecuted, he said. The FBI transferred 2,500 agents to counterterrorism efforts some years back, he said. "That's a lot of agents when you consider there's only 11,000. That meant we had to set higher thresholds. We would not investigate a [fraud] case under $500,000. So, most of these singular fraud cases will never get prosecuted. ... The universe of fraudsters out there is not diminishing. It's a very low-risk environment for them to operate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond constrained law enforcement resources, other problems include complex multi-jurisdictional cases and the vagaries of international law, Swecker added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tackling the issue of software testing, Microsoft this week is offering a tool that leverages model-based testing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool, Spec Explorer 2010, also referred to simply as Spec Explorer, is available on the Microsoft DevLabs site, said S. Somasegar, senior vice president of the Microsoft developer division, in a Monday evening blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Last week, Microsoft released a second beta version of the planned Visual Studio 2010 platform. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thorough, consistent, and extensible testing of systems remains one of the biggest challenges in creating and maintaining software systems," Somasegar said. "The Spec Explorer tool released today on DevLabs tackles that problem using model-based testing techniques."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spec Explorer models software behavior and generates test suites from those models. Models can be viewed as graphical renderings to understand expected system behavior. Test suites can run standalone or in the Visual Studio test framework or other unit test frameworks. Engineers with no modeling background can build models with Spec Explorer, Somasegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Models are written in &#160;C# and accompanied by configuration files in a scripting language called Cord, for "Coordination Language," the Spec Explorer team blog reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several Microsoft projects of various sizes have already used Spec Explorer as part of their development process.&#160; Using Spec Explorer has helped those teams create test cases more quickly, ensure predictability of requirement coverage, and support the projects' lifecycle management and software updates," Somasegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is seeking feedback on Spec Explorer. A commercial version may or may not be released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also has been developing its model-based software development platform, which has been dubbed "Oslo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft previously has built a predecessor tool, Spec Explorer 2004, used by Microsoft product groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft offers Spec Explorer 2010 software test tool," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

 (Recasts first paragraph, adds Visa results and volume)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The SP 500 and the Nasdaq
fell on Tuesday as investors booked profits following the
stock market's recent run-up, while a weaker-than-expected
reading on a measure of consumer confidence raised doubts
about spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology and consumer discretionary shares fared worse
than the broader market as investors sold recent winners.
Baidu Inc's (BIDU.O) disappointing outlook added to the
negative tone for tech names. The semiconductor index .SOXX
shed 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even so, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI eked out
a slim gain after IBM (IBM.N) raised its share repurchase plan
to $9.2 billion and shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron
(CVX.N) rose on the back of BP Plc's (BP.L)(BP.N) strong
earnings. For details, see [ID:nLQ683027]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The day's declines marked the third straight day of losses
for the SP 500 and the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People want to take some profits. The consumer confidence
numbers weren't great," said Stephen Carl, principal and head
of U.S. equity trading at The Williams Capital Group LP in New
York. "We had a good run with the Dow topping around 10,000
over the last week. Many people feel the market could be
overvalued."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 14.21
points, or 0.14 percent, to 9,882.17. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX fell 3.54 points, or 0.33 percent, to
1,063.41. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC declined 25.76
points, or 1.20 percent, to 2,116.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baidu, the Chinese Web Search company's stock, down 11.4
percent at $383.66, was the second-worst drag on the Nasdaq,
behind Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which fell 2.5 percent to $197.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Google Inc(GOOG.O) , the world's leading Web
Search company, declined 1.1 percent to $548.29, a day after
Baidu forecast a sequential decline in fourth-quarter
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Exxon Mobil shares shot up 2.3 percent to $74.91,
while Chevron shares climbed 1.5 percent to $76.59 following
BP's results. The energy sector also got a boost from a bounce
in crude oil prices. U.S. front-month crude CLZ9 ended up 87
cents, or 1.11 percent, at $79.55 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VISA CLIMBS AFTER THE BELL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the bell, Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest
payment network, posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly
profit, raised its dividend and authorized a stock-buyback
plan. Its stock rose 1.3 percent to $74.86 in after-hours
trading. [ID:nN27264293]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa shares ended regular trading at $73.90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the economic front, the Conference Board's index of
consumer confidence fell to 47.7 in October, weaker than
economists had forecast. The data showed consumers were
increasingly concerned about job market conditions.
[ID:nN27241974]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP retail index .RLX fell 1.6 percent and the SP
consumer discretionaries index .GSPD dropped 1.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other data showed home prices rose for the fourth-straight
month in August. The Standard  Poor's/Case-Shiller composite
index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose more than
expected in August. [ID:nNYS007473]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broadly, the SP 500 is now up 57.2 percent from the
12-year closing low of March 9. At Tuesday's close, it showed
a drop of 3.1 percent from its post-March closing peak reached
about a week ago on Oct. 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volume was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with
about 1.40 billion shares changing hands, below last year's
estimated daily average of 1.49 billion. On the Nasdaq, about
2.42 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of
2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Decliners beat advancers by a ratio of about 2 to 1 on
both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The incoming chief executive of Chevron Corp added his voice to the many petroleum interests that oppose climate legislation in the U.S. Congress, saying it could harm the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As written, these bills would lay heavy new costs on every family and business in the U.S.," John Watson, who will become CEO of Chevron on January 1, said at a meeting at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said climate bills in both the Senate and the House of Representatives "can do far more harm than good to our economy and American workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bills would burden petroleum businesses with hidden costs on transportation fuels like gasoline and diesel, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, the company's current CEO, David O'Reilly, said efforts to cut U.S. carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 were unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson took that a step by saying that the short-term goal in the Senate bill of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent under 2005 levels by 2020 was not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even with the best of intentions and an all out effort, we will only get part of the way there," Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backers of climate legislation say a price on carbon would spur companies to invest more in low-carbon fuels like wind and solar power, advanced biofuels, and energy conservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But passage of climate legislation is unlikely this year, in part because senators from energy-intensive states that have already lost many jobs to the recession fear that it could cost even more jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many oil companies have said the climate legislation would boost fuel prices because the firms would not be given enough carbon credits in the early years of the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a cap-and-trade market favored by the House and Senate as well as President Barack Obama, polluters would have to turn in a credit for every ton of carbon they emit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many permits, also known as allocations, in both the Senate and House bills would be given away to companies in the early years to ease costs on industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate version of the climate bill, which built on legislation passed narrowly in the House in June, would give 2.25 percent of permits to emit greenhouse gases in a cap-and-trade market to refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would give larger amounts of the credits to power and natural gas distribution companies, which would be required by states to protect consumers from rising energy prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman who spoke to reporters after Watson's speech said the company would not comment on whether refiners should get more of the credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Editing by Christian Wiessner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Looks to almost triple advisers to 1,000 advisers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Expansion builds on Bear Stearns acquisition
 (Adds last two paragraphs on hiring from rivals)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 27 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N),
the second largest U.S. bank, is looking to add financial
advisers, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told a conference in New
York on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank is looking to reach a total of about 1,000
advisers, or brokers, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our strategy there is to go to 1,000 of the top, top,
top," he said, adding, "So if you're really, really good, call
JPMorgan up and we'll be happy to hire you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon, who previously headed brokerage Smith Barney and
whose father and grandfather were brokers, made the comments in
response to a question from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There has been a broad shake-up in the U.S. retail
brokerage business in the last year, since Bank of America Corp
(BAC.N) acquired Merrill Lynch  Co's so-called "thundering
herd" of brokers, and since Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citigroup
Inc's(C.N) Smith Barney agreed on a joint venture for their
brokerage units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if JPMorgan did more than double the size of its
brokerage, it would still be a small unit by comparison with
those rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of the third quarter, Bank of America had just
under 15,000 brokers and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney had about
18,000. JPMorgan had 365 brokers at the end of the third
quarter, up from 323 a year earlier; it had no brokers before
buying Bear Stearns in March last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REGULATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a broad-ranging discussion at the Securities Industry
and Financial Markets Association annual meeting, Dimon also
discussed regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He reiterated his support for a resolution mechanism and
systemic risk regulator that could deal with banks and other
companies that become "too big to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked about bankers' compensation -- which has been a
hot-button issue since banks including JPMorgan received
billions in bailout money from the U.S. government -- Dimon
said President Barack Obama's pay czar Kenneth Feinberg has a
tough job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All of us need Citibank, Bank of America, all these other
companies to be vibrant and healthy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan repaid $25 billion it received from the U.S.
government's Troubled Asset Relief Program earlier this year
but Bank of America and Citigroup -- which each received $45
billion -- still face pay restrictions for their top staffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said Feinberg must walk a fine line to avoid hobbling
these banks so that they cannot compete by hiring or retaining
staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said New York-based JPMorgan will not actively seek to
hire staff away from the banks that are under pay
restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I, morally, have an issue with people going against those
companies that have been hamstrung," he said.

family and business in the U.S.," John Watson, who will become
CEO of Chevron on Jan. 1, said at a meeting at the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said climate bills in both the Senate and the House of
Representatives "can do far more harm than good to our economy
and American workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bills would burden petroleum businesses with hidden
costs on transportation fuels like gasoline and diesel, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In June, the company's current CEO, David O'Reilly, said
efforts to cut U.S. carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 were
unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson took that a step by saying that the short-term goal
in the Senate bill of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20
percent under 2005 levels by 2020 was not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even with the best of intentions and an all out effort, we
will only get part of the way there," Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Backers of climate legislation say a price on carbon would
spur companies to invest more in low-carbon fuels like wind and
solar power, advanced biofuels, and energy conservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But passage of climate legislation is unlikely this year,
in part because senators from energy-intensive states that have
already lost many jobs to the recession fear that it could cost
even more jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many oil companies have said the climate legislation would
boost fuel prices because the firms would not be given enough
carbon credits in the early years of the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a cap-and-trade market favored by the House and Senate
as well as President Barack Obama, polluters would have to turn
in a credit for every ton of carbon they emit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many permits, also known as allocations, in both the Senate
and House bills would be given away to companies in the early
years to ease costs on industry. [ID:nN26184796]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Senate version of the climate bill, which built on
legislation passed narrowly in the House in June, would give
2.25 percent of permits to emit greenhouse gases in a
cap-and-trade market to refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would give larger amounts of the credits to power and
natural gas distribution companies, which would be required by
states to protect consumers from rising energy prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman who spoke to reporters after Watson's
speech said the company would not comment on whether refiners
should get more of the credits.

"rjm77me" is buying where the waters are red. 

"When do you buy - when you see a sea of red. 

I found following stocks as great market proxy: 

(AMEX: URE) - ETF Low at 5.51 and closed at 5.92 - 8% move 

(NASDAQ: DRYS) Shipping play - Marine index has been creeping up 

(NYSE: GNK) 

I did buy (NASDAQ: DRYS) in my 401k at 7.07 and consider as trading vehicle for
$100 - buy limited quantity of 500 to 700 shares and buy with limit orders and
limit sell orders. 

Another potential buy is (NYSE: GE) - for longer term - is in down trend at this
time. 

I am trading these in my trading account."

&lt;p&gt;http://www.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights NTT DoCoMo (NYSE: DCM) as the Bull of the Day
and Embraer (NYSE: ERJ) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research
provides analysis on JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq:
FITB) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We maintain an outperform rating for NTT DoCoMo (NYSE: DCM), the largest mobile
service provider in Japan. The company currently maintains a leading 50% share
of the Japanese wireless market. 

DCM upgraded 98% of its total coverage area with 3G-HSDPA, while emerging 4G LTE
networks are planned for deployment through 2010. DCM's decisions to focus on
mobile content, along with a renewed geographic expansion drive outside Japan
are positive indicators. 

Furthermore, the company is launching an innovative online money transfer
service. We consider DCM as an attractive long-term investment opportunity. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are downgrading our recommendation on Embraer (NYSE: ERJ) from Neutral to
Underperform. The international economic environment remains an issue,
considering the company's exposure to the U.S. and Europe. 

Moreover, the company's high concentration for some models, with primary focus
on American airline companies, exposes it to considerable risks. However, lower
oil prices compared to 2008 and the support of the Brazilian Government appear
to be encouraging. We also remain optimistic about the strength in the company's
aircraft family. 

Nevertheless, the considerable strain on the Brazilian airport infrastructure
will certainly impact the company's local sales.

Bank Failures Pass 100 for the Year

In order to replenish the declining fund, the FDIC board recently proposed that
the U.S. banks should pay fees for three years in advance. Also, the regulators
are considering requesting the healthy banks to bail out the government as soon
as it is necessary to replenish the deposit insurance fund, which has slipped to
0.22% of insured deposits, below the mandated minimum of 1.15%. 

In the second quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 416 from 305 in the first quarter. This is the highest
since the savings and loan crisis in 1994. Bank failures have cost the FDIC's
fund that insures deposits an estimated $25 billion this year. Increasing loan
losses on commercial real estate are expected to cause hundreds more bank
failures in the next few years. The FDIC anticipates the bank failures to cost
about $100 billion over the next four years.&#9632;&#9632; 

The failure of Washington Mutual last year was the largest in U.S. history. It
was acquired by JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). Other major acquirers of failed
institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB) and U.S.
Bancorp (NYSE: USB).

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Another Source of Capital: Sotheby`s

This morning`s New York Times has an interesting little blurb on another asset
class held by major banks -- Art. According to the article, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:
DB) has the largest corporate art trove in the world, with 60.000 contemporary
works. UBS (NYSE: UBS) and J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) could also open major museums
with what they hold along their hallways and in their basements. These assets
provide no income, other than psychic income to employees when displayed in the
offices, and none at all when sitting in storage. 

Due to wave after wave of consolidation in the banking industry, many
institutions really have no idea of exactly what they are holding. A great art
collection does nothing for the safety and soundness of the bank. A great
painting does not make loans to small businesses that create jobs to move the
economy forward. 

The time has come for the banks to start auctioning off these assets, not all at
once so the market does not become flooded, but over a couple of years in a
concerted effort to monetize these vanity assets. The proceeds would bolster
bank capital ratios and would also be good for the likes of Sotheby`s (NYSE:
BID) and Christie's. Perhaps even a few museums might buy the works, and the
public could get to see them as well. 

For the banks who are living on public life support, like Citigroup (NYSE: C),
having a private museum should not even be an option. The bank will operate just
as well with a cheap reproduction on the walls as it will with an original
Warhol or Lichtenstein. It is an outrage that this process has not already
started.

&lt;p&gt;
BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 27, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Iridium Communications Inc.
(Nasdaq:IRDM) today announced that it has engaged Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. as its
lead global advisor on the financing of Iridium NEXT, the company's next
generation satellite constellation. The company continues to expect to fund a
substantial portion of the cost of Iridium NEXT from internally generated cash
flow, as well as revenues derived from hosted payloads on its next generation
constellation and from warrant proceeds. In addition, the recent closing of the
company's merger, which substantially strengthened the company's balance sheet,
has enhanced the opportunity to pursue various financing options. Goldman Sachs
will lead the initiative to secure the remainder of funding necessary to
develop, build and launch the new constellation, which is anticipated to begin
launching in 2014.

Iridium has said that it expects to announce the selection of a prime contractor
in the coming months. Lockheed Martin and Thales Alenia Space are competing to
secure the prime contract for the development of Iridium NEXT.

"Our business performance, including our recent announcement of our entry into
the Mexican market, supports our confidence that a substantial portion of the
cost of our next generation of satellites will be funded from internally
generated cash flow," said Iridium CEO Matt Desch. "We are pleased to have
appointed Goldman Sachs as our lead advisor, and I am confident that we are in
the optimal position to secure the best possible support for Iridium NEXT."

Iridium has also retained Hawkpoint Partners Limited as an additional advisor to
focus on European sources of financing. Hawkpoint is a leading corporate finance
advisor that has worked with Iridium in the past as it completed its transition
from private to public company. Hawkpoint's experience and focus on Europe will
complement Goldman Sachs' global efforts in support of all potential
vendor-supported financing opportunities.

&lt;p&gt;50 Additional Winners Receive Free Coca-Cola for One Year
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
This past summer Las Vegas resident Dana Stanley stopped by her neighborhood
Albertsons to do some grocery shopping, which included picking up her favorite
Coca-Cola products - Diet Coke with Lime for her and Coca-Cola and Sprite for
her family. With her purchase, she was automatically entered to win a beautiful
$250,000 Taylor Morrison home in Southern California. To her surprise, Stanley
was selected as the winner of the 2009 Coca-Cola California Dream Home Giveaway
promotion sponsored by Albertsons, while 50 additional winners won a year`s
supply of Coca-Cola products. 

Stanley, a mother of three, entered the contest at her neighborhood Albertsons
and said "I can`t tell you how stunned I still am. You just think that these
kinds of things never actually happen, but they do. When it finally started to
sink in, I started getting goose bumps I was so excited." 

"We are excited that our dream home giveaway promotion is offering a family the
peace of mind and financial relief during these tough economic times," said Luis
Fernando Ramirez, vice president, West Region, Coca-Cola North America. "At home
around the dinner table is where the most cherished memories happen. Now, the
Stanley family has a brand new place that they can call home and where they can
open happiness with an ice-cold Coke." 

During the promotion, which ran from June 17 to August 11, consumers received
one automatic entry into the giveaway each time they purchased eligible
Coca-Cola products with their Albertsons Preferred Savings Card at a
participating store. "The response to the promotion was tremendous," said Sue
Klug, president of Albertsons Southern California Division. "We were excited to
know that one of our customers would have a chance to win a dream home." 

Stanley had the opportunity to choose her new home from one of Taylor Morrison`s
Southern California neighborhoods: Las Colinas and Los Arboles in Irvine; Market
Street at Dos Lagos and Shady Grove, both in Corona; Bellafina in Montclair;
Buenaterra in Buena Park or Palazzo in Stanton. 

"Home ownership is the American Dream and we`re thrilled to help the Stanley
family attain that dream in one of our great communities," said Phil Bodem,
division president for Taylor Morrison in Southern California. 

Stanley`s two-bedroom, 1,651-square-foot home is currently being built by Taylor
Morrison in the company`s Market Street community at Dos Lagos. It is expected
to be completed in March 2010. Stanley`s home will be situated close to
shopping, dining and entertainment, making it even easier for her to enjoy the
community, which was designed by the award-winning Robert Hidey Architects.

spend another $5.0 billion on share repurchases, boosting its
total outstanding stock buyback program to $9.2 billion, a
reflection of its strong cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said on Tuesday it will repurchase shares on the open
market or in private transactions, depending on market
conditions. It also said it expects to request approval for
additional share repurchase authorization at its April board
meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of International Business Machines Corp rose as much
as 1.7 percent after the announcement, which analysts said was
good for shareholders although not entirely a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The buyback would add to around $4.2 billion remaining at
the end of September from a previously approved plan, with the
total amount representing around 5.9 percent of IBM's $157
billion market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a decent size," said Broadpoint AmTech analyst Brian
Marshall. He said one of the key components of IBM's earnings
growth in the past few years was through share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is in conjunction with what they've been doing in the
past few years and I think they're trying to get the stock
moving," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts said the large buyback was possible as IBM
has not been as acquisitive as some of its tech peers, such as
Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) or Oracle Corp ORCL.O. But they
also said the move does not prohibit future deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the third
quarter, ending the period with with $11.5 billion of cash on
hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have a lot of dry powder," said Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said IBM has returned $73
billion to shareholders since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect share buybacks to remain a priority at IBM in
the coming year," said J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Moskowitz,
reiterating an "overweight" recommendation on the shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's stock closed up 0.45 percent, or 54 cents, to $120.65
on Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;50 Additional Winners Receive Free Coca-Cola for One Year
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
This past summer Las Vegas resident Dana Stanley stopped by her neighborhood
Albertsons to do some grocery shopping, which included picking up her favorite
Coca-Cola products - Diet Coke with Lime for her and Coca-Cola and Sprite for
her family. With her purchase, she was automatically entered to win a beautiful
$250,000 Taylor Morrison home in Southern California. To her surprise, Stanley
was selected as the winner of the 2009 Coca-Cola California Dream Home Giveaway
promotion sponsored by Albertsons, while 50 additional winners won a year`s
supply of Coca-Cola products. 

Stanley, a mother of three, entered the contest at her neighborhood Albertsons
and said "I can`t tell you how stunned I still am. You just think that these
kinds of things never actually happen, but they do. When it finally started to
sink in, I started getting goose bumps I was so excited." 

"We are excited that our dream home giveaway promotion is offering a family the
peace of mind and financial relief during these tough economic times," said Luis
Fernando Ramirez, vice president, West Region, Coca-Cola North America. "At home
around the dinner table is where the most cherished memories happen. Now, the
Stanley family has a brand new place that they can call home and where they can
open happiness with an ice-cold Coke." 

During the promotion, which ran from June 17 to August 11, consumers received
one automatic entry into the giveaway each time they purchased eligible
Coca-Cola products with their Albertsons Preferred Savings Card at a
participating store. "The response to the promotion was tremendous," said Sue
Klug, president of Albertsons Southern California Division. "We were excited to
know that one of our customers would have a chance to win a dream home." 

Stanley had the opportunity to choose her new home from one of Taylor Morrison`s
Southern California neighborhoods: Las Colinas and Los Arboles in Irvine; Market
Street at Dos Lagos and Shady Grove, both in Corona; Bellafina in Montclair;
Buenaterra in Buena Park or Palazzo in Stanton. 

"Home ownership is the American Dream and we`re thrilled to help the Stanley
family attain that dream in one of our great communities," said Phil Bodem,
division president for Taylor Morrison in Southern California. 

Stanley`s two-bedroom, 1,651-square-foot home is currently being built by Taylor
Morrison in the company`s Market Street community at Dos Lagos. It is expected
to be completed in March 2010. Stanley`s home will be situated close to
shopping, dining and entertainment, making it even easier for her to enjoy the
community, which was designed by the award-winning Robert Hidey Architects.

&lt;p&gt;Well that was fast. Microsoft has yanked its sponsorship from an upcoming half-hour special on Fox featuring Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, according to Variety.  The special was set to air on November 8, and was going under the working title "Family Guy Presents: Seth  Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show." &#160; The show, announced earlier this month, was to be commercial free, but would feature Windows 7 marketing messages woven into the fabric of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to time to sign off on the show, however, Microsoft wasn't laughing.  Variety reports that Microsoft executives came to view the special's taping on October 16, but got more than they bargained for when MacFarlane and Family Guy co-star Alex Borstein started doing jokes about the deaf, the Holocaust, and incest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special's content turned out to be a little too much for Redmond, and the company decided the show was "not a fit with the Windows brand." Despite pulling out of the television special, Microsoft still plans on going forward with a 12-week college tour featuring movie nights hosted by Family Guy characters, online videos, and the chance for college students to try out Windows 7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MacFarlane special is the second time this year that Microsoft has backed off from advertising featuring potentially offensive humor.  In July, Redmond had to pull a Web-only commercial called O.M.G.I.G.P. -- Oh My God! I'm Gonna Puke --starring actor Dean Cain discussing the private browsing feature in Internet Explorer 8.  The ad featured a woman who couldn't stop vomiting after discovering pornography on her husband's computer. &#160; Microsoft said it pulled O.M.G.I.G.P. after receiving complaints about the ad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Microsoft has passed on the show, Variety says Fox plans on going forward with the November 8 special in partnership with a new, yet-to-be-named sponsor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/174443&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank, which acquired about 350 advisers through its purchase of investment bank Bear Stearns in March last year, is looking to reach a total of about 1,000 advisers, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our strategy there is to go to 1,000 of the top, top, top," he said, adding, "So if you're really really good, call JPMorgan up and we'll be happy to hire you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, whose father and grandfather were brokers, made the comments in response to a question from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a broad ranging discussion at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association annual meeting, Dimon also discussed regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reiterated his support for a resolution mechanism or systemic risk regulator that could deal with banks and other companies that become "too big to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Reporting by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Target Date Evaluation Tool Now Available Online to Advisors
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


J.P. Morgan Funds has launched an online version of its target date evaluation
program, the Target Date Compass. The program provides a framework advisors can
use to evaluate design factors such as time horizon, participant behavior, risk
management and asset class diversification, and identify those target date
strategies that are most closely aligned with the goals of the plan sponsor and
its participants. 

"With a vast universe of target date funds to choose from, advisors and plan
sponsors need a framework to sort out and identify the right option based on
their goals," said David Musto, head of J.P. Morgan`s retail investment only
retirement business. "With Target Date Compass, advisors can make sure they have
thoroughly assessed the elements of a fund`s design and whether or not it is the
right match for the plan. We have now made the advisor`s job easier by providing
them with the ability to go online to customize and generate these reports more
efficiently, so that they can serve their clients in a timely way." 

Advisors have real-time access to the Compass, which plots the plan sponsor to a
specific target date type, and identifies the target date strategies associated
with that target date type. Now, advisors can go online and customize the
Compass by adding or removing funds from the Target Date universe in order to
focus on the most relevant funds. In addition, they can generate, in real-time,
a detailed target date analysis report which provides a side-by-side
quantitative and qualitative analysis of the selected funds. The advisor may
also archive pervious reports on the system. 

Once the target date type is determined, then an advisor can identify the
appropriate funds, conduct due diligence, prepare a recommendation, and support
the implementation of the selected target date fund. The universe of target date
funds and data behind the online analysis of Target Date Compass is powered by
Lipper.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives yesterday acknowledged that they were surprised by the snafu that prevented some college students from upgrading their Vista PCs to Windows 7, but said the company had taken steps to remedy the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I would say that the way that customers were taking advantage of the student offer was somewhat of a surprise," said Ben Bennett, the director of Microsoft's Windows consumer global support group. "We didn't think there would be a large demand for upgrades from 32-bit to 64-bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, which Bennett confirmed has been one of the leading issues Microsoft's support staff has faced since Windows 7's launch last Thursday, popped up when students tried to upgrade a 32-bit version of Vista to a 64-bit edition of the new operating system. The copy of Windows 7 they had downloaded from Minneapolis-based Digital River -- which fulfills download orders for Microsoft's $29.99 Windows 7 upgrade offer to students -- stalled with an error message when users tried to upgrade from 32- to 64-bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not support an "in-place" upgrade from 32- to 64-bit, or vice versa, on any edition of Windows 7. In a message posted to the company's support forum last weekend, a Microsoft support engineer said that the error, which appeared when the downloaded .exe file users would not "unpack," was part of a "by design" process to block impossible upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday, Bennett defended Microsoft's decision to offer only the packed .exe file to students, but said that it would soon add the option to download an .iso file, as it does for customers ordering a Windows 7 download from its own online store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the Windows ecosystem, there are hundreds of possible configurations, and we tuned [the discount] to students who were updating to 32-bit Windows 7," Bennett said, adding that Microsoft believed that path was the one that the majority of students would take. "We think hard about how our customers are going to take advantage of our offers, but we never get it exactly right," Bennett admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to tweak the student discount to account for users who want to migrate from 32-bit Vista to 64-bit Windows 7. "We're obviously seeing people who want to upgrade to 64-bit," said Bennett. "That's good feedback, so let's respond."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bennett said Microsoft and Digital River would offer the option of downloading an .iso file, which customers can then burn to a DVD or copy to a USB flash drive for conducting a "clean" upgrade, the only type of upgrade possible from 32-bit to 64-bit. A clean upgrade, also the only one allowed for Windows XP users, requires users to back up data and settings, install Windows 7, then restore the data and settings before finally reinstalling all applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft added the .iso option late Monday, according to a message posted on the support thread dedicated to the problem. "For those customers of the Student Offer who wish to install the 64-bit version of Windows 7, but are currently running a 32-bit operating system, there is now an optional downloadable ISO file of Windows 7 64-bit to allow for install," a support engineer identified only as "Michael" wrote around 9:30 p.m. PT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who have already bought the 64-bit version should contact Digital River via an online form and include "64-bit Windows 7 Solution" in the first line of the request description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In hindsight, we think we responded fairly quickly to the problem," Bennett argued. Microsoft has contacted, or is in the process of contacting, customers affected by the problem and has offered them an .iso version they can burn to DVD. Microsoft will also modify the student offer to make it clearer what version users should download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The student offer snafu has been one of the most heavily trafficked topics on Microsoft's support forums. Over the weekend, Microsoft seemed to put the blame on users who mistakenly downloaded the 64-bit version of the upgrade. Previously, users had raged at both Microsoft and Digital River, for first not providing enough information, then for not accepting responsibility. Several said that they had reported Digital River to the Better Business Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Aaron, a senior group manager for Windows supportability, said he understood users' anger. "Customers are frustrated with issues that they're having, but the longer they wait, the more they get frustrated," he said. "Today we're light years faster than with we were when Vista launched. But we need to respond faster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
The IBM (NYSE: IBM) board of directors today declared a regular quarterly cash
dividend of $0.55 per common share, payable December 10, 2009 to stockholders of
record November 10, 2009. 

With the payment of the December 10 dividend, IBM will have paid consecutive
quarterly dividends every year since 1916. 

The board today also authorized $5 billion in additional funds for use in the
company`s stock repurchase program. IBM said it will repurchase shares on the
open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market
conditions. 

This amount is in addition to approximately $4.2 billion remaining at the end of
September 2009 from a prior authorization. With this new authorization, IBM will
have approximately $9.2 billion for its stock repurchase program. IBM expects to
request additional share repurchase authorization at the April 2010 board
meeting. 

Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer said
"IBM`s strategic transformation to higher value businesses continues to drive
profitable growth, and our strong cash flow performance has enabled IBM to
return $73 billion since 2003 to our shareholders."

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a proud and long-standing worldwide sponsor of the Olympic
Games, today announced that it will extend its Olympic Games sponsorship for a
period of eight years. 

In renewing its sponsorship, Visa will retain the rights it has enjoyed since
1986 and remain the exclusive payment services sponsor and the only card
accepted at the four Olympic Games that follow London 2012 Olympic Games,
including the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, the 2016 Olympic Games
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the 2018 Olympic Winter Games and the 2020
Olympic Summer Games. 

The renewal announcement was made during a formal contract signing ceremony by
Visa Inc. Group President, Rupert Keeley, and International Olympic Committee
President, Jacques Rogge, in Moscow, Russia. 

Over the past twelve Olympic Games, Visa has utilized its sponsorship to
increase its global brand leadership, grow Visa transaction volume, expand
acceptance in new and emerging markets and enhance preference for its products
and services. 

The new contract will enable Visa to deliver additional benefits to clients and
their cardholders with expanded point-of-sale presence, exclusive acceptance
programs for Olympic-related transactions and increased access to unique
experiences for Visa clients to offer to their customers through Visa marketing
programs. 

"The Olympic Games deliver tremendous global exposure and access to virtually
every demographic group," said Antonio Lucio, Chief Marketing Officer of Visa
Inc. "The Olympic Games also deliver tangible and proven business building
benefits to Visa, its clients and partners. Client activation around the Beijing
2008 Olympic Games, which involved more than 573 clients in 41 countries,
illustrates the universal appeal of this marquee property." 

IOC President Jacques Rogge said: "Our partnership with Visa demonstrates a
shared commitment - to the future of youth and sport, to the future of the
Olympic Games and to the strengthening of the Olympic ideals and values we
respect. On behalf of the IOC, the 205 National Olympic Committees around the
world, and the athletes themselves, I would like to thank Visa, its clients and
partners for their commitment through to the 2020 Olympic Games." 

The unwavering and growing appeal of the Olympic Games has provided Visa with a
flexible platform on which to build integrated marketing campaigns. Over the
years, Visa`s use of the Olympic sponsorship to support its business has evolved
with its business strategy. 

"During the early days of our Olympic sponsorship, we focused on promoting our
exclusive acceptance at the Games. Today, we utilize the sponsorship platform to
promote the advantages of using Visa instead of cash and check and to facilitate
the development and advancement of the payment infrastructure in Olympic host
countries. 

"With efforts in support of the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games already underway,
and London 2012 well into our planning stages, we are particularly excited about
the opportunities that the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games will provide. We look
forward to working with partners in Russia, the Sochi Organizing Committee and
the IOC to further build on our Olympic legacy and make the Sochi 2014 Olympic
Winter Games a global success," Lucio said. 

Visa`s commitment to the Olympic Movement, National Olympic Committees, national
teams and individual athletes has been an important factor in ensuring the
continuance and success of the Olympic Games. Visa has created a number of
programs around the world to help sustain Olympic teams and athletes as they
embark on their journey to the Games. Visa was also the first worldwide Olympic
partner to mount marketing destination programs linked to the cities hosting the
Olympic Games. 

Visa also retains exclusive category rights to all 205 National Olympic
Committees and their Olympic teams around the world. These rights include
advertising and promotional use of Olympic marks and imagery from the Olympic
Games as well as marks from the National and International Olympic Committees.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) has extended its deal as the exclusive payment service of the Olympics for eight years, through 2020, saying the Games worldwide popularity has boosted its business and brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest payment network said the sponsorship deal with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) runs through the 2020 Summer Games and extends a relationship that began in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deal, which includes Visa being the only card accepted at Olympic venues as well as use of the Games' five-ring logo, were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, top Olympic sponsors, such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), often pay as much as $100 million in cash and in-kind services as sponsors for a four-year period that includes a summer and winter games, analysts said. Many spend three times that amount in marketing the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IOC has said it wants to raise about $1 billion from top sponsors for the 2010 and 2012 games, up from $866 million in prior two games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Olympics have proven to build our business over time," Antonio Lucio, Visa's chief marketing officer, said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's basically a marketer's dream," he said, adding it was one of two sports properties along with soccer's World Cup that appeal to a global audience. Visa also sponsors the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Visa extended its sponsorship of the U.S. National Football League by five seasons at an estimated $8 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports leagues and teams have been hurt over the past year as major corporate sponsors have cut spending on sports marketing, including sponsorships, advertising and tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending on sports sponsorships by North American-based companies is expected to rise only 0.7 percent this year to $11.48 billion, after growth in 2008 of 14.6 percent, according to IEG, owned by advertising giant WPP Plc (WPP.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa has seen its revenue growth slow over the last year as debt-burdened consumers use their credit cards less often. Last month, Visa CEO Joseph Saunders said U.S. consumer spending would remain lackluster for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the company has pushed ahead with sponsorships, as Lucio said research shows sports deals drive consumer transactions and improve brand image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1986, Visa and its partners have issued more than 21 million Visa cards bearing the Olympic rings. For the Summer Games last year, Visa added about 90,000 ATM machines and signed up some 216,000 merchant acceptance locations in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa also said its brand equity is 25 percent higher among consumers who are aware of its Olympic sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Olympics has not been immune to the slowdown, although more of the pain has been felt by local organizing committees rather than the IOC. Locking in sponsors so far ahead only helps, said Timo Lumme, IOC director of TV and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no question the financial stability that comes from long-term support, and early long-term support, cannot be underestimated," Lumme said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine sponsors are signed for the current four-year period ending in 2012. Atos Origin SA (ATOS.PA), Panasonic Corp (6752.T) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) have extended until 2016, while Coke and Omega, like Visa, are signed through 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Olympics' appeal is simple, said Chris Welton, a former top marketing executive for the IOC who now works as a consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not about who wins, but how people get there," he said. "When you're at an Olympic Games, you can feel that kind of magic in the air, and that's why despite tough economic times ... it still survives because people yearn for the purity of those values."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Klayman; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Mercent(TM), a leading provider of on-demand marketing solutions for
retailers, today reported Mercent retail clients selling through
Microsoft Bing(TM) Shopping and the popular Microsoft Bing(TM) Cashback
increased gross merchandise value by 550% in Q3 relative to the second
quarter 2009. Significant growth demonstrates Bing's selling
effectiveness and the staggering rate at which merchants are adopting
this online advertising and sales channel using Mercent's platform.

    "Mercent has done a commendable job of seamlessly integrating its online
channel management platform with the Bing Shopping system," commented
Trevor Klein, Senior Vice President at Auto Anything. "There was
absolutely zero work required on our part. Most important, we realized
product sales immediately following launch. We believe engaging this
channel through Mercent will absolutely help accelerate and increase sales
for Auto Anything this holiday season and beyond."

    Over the past 24 months consumer spending habits have changed the retail
playing field, placing pressure on merchants to demonstrate value to

U.S. online retail sale will increase 11% to $156 billion -- an
approximate increase of $14.8 billion over 2008. Furthermore, eCommerce
sales are expected to continue rebounding in 2010 and experience double
digit growth through 2011."

    According to Eric Best, Mercent CEO, "Merchants recognize the value of
low-cost access to highly popular and profitable channels like Bing

    double-digit increases in every division.
--  Consolidated operating income grew 24.0% to Ps. 3,959 million for the

--  Consolidated net controlling income increased 70.4% to Ps. 2,134

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Chevron's crude oil production in Angola will rise by a quarter in the next two years and it expects new discoveries to boost the country's oil production further, Ali Moshiri, Chevron's president for Africa and Latin America said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron (CVX.N) is one of Angola's largest oil producers, responsible for operating oilfields with an output of over 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil in 2008, of which 145,000 bpd was its own equity oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two new oilfields, Mafumeira Norte and Tombua-Landana, came onstream in 2009 with peak production for both fields expected to be reached in 2011, totaling an extra 130,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see great potential in Angola and our investment is sustainable. It is one of the most active areas in Africa for us at the moment," Moshiri told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's $3.8 billion Tombua Landana Project reached first oil in August 2009 with recoverable resources estimated at approximately 350 million barrels. Peak production of 100,000 bpd of crude oil is expected to be reached in 2011. Moshiri believes Angola has big potential and expected oil production to increase further, driven by continued interest from large foreign oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now all the major oil companies are players in Angola and with all this investment our expectation is that there will be other discoveries and that there is potential for higher oil production in Angola."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angolan crude oil production has approached 2 million bpd this year and briefly overtook Nigeria as Africa's largest oil producer, encouraging interest from oil companies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main operators currently working in Angola are Western majors, including France's Total (TOTF.PA), Chevron and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), but expectations are that Chinese companies will increase their investment across West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINESE INTEREST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moshiri said Chinese interest in increasingly stable country's like Angola was inevitable given its need to fuel its growing economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think China has interest anywhere and everywhere that has a hydrocarbon resource and for a good reason. Their economy depends on crude oil at the moment and I think we're going to continue to consider China as a partner who is looking for resources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further incentive for potential oil investors in Angola, where many opportunities are in expensive offshore developments, is the recovery of crude oil prices this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude oil has rallied over 150 percent from its low of $32.40 a barrel in December last year, hitting a 2009 high of $82 a barrel on Thursday, which should encourage further investment in more expensive deep offshore opportunities in Angola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Moshiri said short-term oil price movements, up or down, would not have an impact on the decisions it makes on future projects in Angola because it has long and deep ties with the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long term, Chevron is keeping a close eye on the macro-economic influences on the oil price to ensure future security for its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The oil price is affected by the global economy, in places like China and India. We are watching for that to make sure it has a strong foundation and it can support our projects for many years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although crude oil has been the concentration for foreign operators in Angola, Chevron said its focus, in partnership with the Angolan government, was switching to natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Angola is now diversifying from oil into gas. Gas could actually have more potential in Angola than crude oil and LNG exploration could also lead to more light oil finds," Moshiri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's main gas project Angola Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a multi-billion dollar operation expected to supply 5.4 million tonnes per annum of LNG for export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of September 2009, the project was around 46 percent complete and remains on schedule for start-up in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sue Thomas)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Avocent Corporation (Nasdaq: AVCT), a global leader in IT operations management,
today announced that Microsoft has opted to use an Avocent hardware, software
and services data management solution to manage its Microsoft Technology Center
(MTC) Thames Valley facility. The solution gives the company powerful control
over the new state-of-the-art facility. 

Tools include Avocent DSView 3 management software, which provides a single
point of control via a simple Web-based interface, so IT administrators can
remotely control servers and network equipment. IT managers no longer have to
regularly visit the data center, even when a server crashes, shaving hours every
week from their schedule. 

Crucially, the Avocent end-to-end solution facilitates a high level of security.
For reasons of client confidentiality, Microsoft manages servers at the console
level and the Avocent end-to-end solution means that IT managers can see and
manage these consoles easily, saving time and increasing efficiency. 

Said Hao-Yin Tsang, Lab Engineer at MTC Thames Valley: "The alliance between
Microsoft and Avocent is a huge advantage for us. Without these solutions we
simply couldn`t run our data center effectively. The Avocent technologies
provide a secure, simple means of managing the entire infrastructure, reducing
the amount of time we need to spend in the data center and helping us provide a
reliable and effective service to our customers." 

MTC is looking to use Avocent solutions to further optimize the data center in
the future, including Avocent MergePoint Infrastruture Explorer, which will
create a diagram of the data center to calculate power consumption across all
devices. 

Said Owen McKee, Country Manager UK, Avocent: "Microsoft has to offer its
customers best-in-class data center services and it has to do it efficiently and
securely. Avocent solutions are the foundation that makes this possible by
giving Microsoft technicians full visibility of facility performance, remote
access and the infrastructure to ensure client data remains absolutely
confidential."

&lt;p&gt;New adventures in the charming world of Pixie Hollow are abound in this year`s
new release from Disney Interactive Studios
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Last year, Disney Interactive Studios invited girls and fans everywhere to grab
their Nintendo DS and fly away to Tinker Bell`s enchanting Pixie Hollow to play
as a Disney Fairy. The follow-up to that rich and immersive experience is
available today in retail stores nationwide. Disney Fairies:Tinker Bell and the
Lost Treasure for Nintendo DS comes to North America this holiday season on the
same day as the all-new Blu-ray and DVD release from Walt Disney Studios Home
Entertainment, the second in a series of direct-to-DVD computer-animated
adventures. 

"Working closely with the filmmakers, we`ve been able to once again extend the
beautiful environments, whimsical character animations and engaging tale of
discovery seen in `Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure` onto Nintendo DS," said
Craig Relyea, senior vice president of global marketing, Disney Interactive
Studios. "The video game sequel allows players to mix creativity with gameplay,
recreates memorable film moments and gives players more ways to connect with the
online world of Pixie Hollow, the center of the Web-based universe for Disney
Fairies. This cross platform synergy is indicative of how we are able to
introduce compelling new ways to play every year." 

Unique to this year`s game is the ability for players to create and personalize
up to five of their own fairies, from facial features to hair accessories, each
with different talents focusing on tinkering, light, water, animal and
gardening. One of those fairies can be uploaded onto the Disney Fairies Pixie
Hollow (PixieHollow.com) virtual world from Disney Online, where visitors
worldwide have created more than 22 million fairy avatars. Players are then able
to use their DS fairy to go on quests, play talent games and gather items within
the PixieHollow.com world. 

The film-based Story mode opens as the Disney Fairies prepare for the Autumn
Revelry, and Tinker Bell is chosen to create the prestigious Fall Scepter that
can rejuvenate the Pixie Dust tree. But when her good friend Terence offers to
help, Tinker Bell`s stubbornness and temper get the best of her, causing her to
shatter the scepter`s fragile moonstone, as well as her friendship with Terence.
To make things right, Tinker Bell must now embark on a perilous quest north of
Never Land to find the Mirror of Incanta, which will grant her one wish. 

Players will notice that similar to the film, Tinker Bell`s wardrobe has been
updated to reflect the Autumn season and her evolution. In addition to the
iconic green dress, she will be seen in-game sporting a jacket, leggings, boots
and belt to carry all her tinkering tools. Other delightful activities in Tinker
Bell and the Lost Treasure are mini-games that involve fun tasks such as sewing,
collecting water drops, balloon making and unscrambling puzzles. 

Players can also embark on an online quest that ultimately unlocks a special
item on both platforms and they can add ingredients gathered in the DS game to
their collection on PixieHollow.com. The two platforms are now linked through
up-to-date news and polls, dispatched from the online world directly to DS. 

In addition, Disney Fairies:Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure includes DGamer,
the online community exclusive to Disney gamers on Nintendo DS, allowing players
to connect with others and unlock Fairy-themed items in their DS game. 

Developed by Hydeand published by Disney Interactive Studios, Disney Fairies:
Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is rated E for Everyone by the Entertainment
Software Rating Board (ESRB), with a suggested retail price of $29.99. For more
information, please visit www.disneyfairiesvideogame.com. 

Also available for iPhone and iPod touch is Disney Fairies Fly. Fairies Fly lets
players pick their favorite character and glide with the wind as Tinker Bell,
Iridessa, Silvermist, Rosetta or Fawn, tackling the many challenges that await
them in five magical worlds. Players can tilt and move their iPhone to dodge
obstacles and grab customized pick-ups and pixie dust to unlock the next levels.
Latest version available now for $4.99, includes new video and over 20 new
Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure images and more.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Anonymous trading venues known as "dark pools" are a technological evolution that have benefitted both institutional and retail trading by bringing down transaction costs, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said in a memo to the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the SEC voted unanimously for ways to make the dark pools more transparent, such as revealing the electronic trading messages that are sent to a limited group of market participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a report submitted to the SEC on October 22, Goldman said the investing community -- especially retail -- has benefitted from the evolving market structure and industry competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman report, posted on the SEC website, summarized a meeting held on September 24 between its executives and the commission staff to discuss issues involving market structure including short selling and dark pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the report, Goldman stated five common myths regarding dark pool trading and supplied arguments in an effort to dispel those myths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark pools are trading platforms where buyers and sellers can anonymously match large blocks of stock, keeping details of the deals and prices concealed to prevent distorting prices in the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark pools, the largest of which are run by banks such as Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), account for an estimated 10 to 15 percent of overall U.S. equity volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said in the report that increased competition from dark pools pushes all execution venues to compete for retail order flow in a superior manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While market structure evolution has not been without its challenges, they have been accompanied by a secular decline in both implicit and explicit trading costs, benefiting primarily retail investors," Goldman said in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says "dark pools" have benefitted trading in general&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says increased competition reduced trading costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oct 27 (Reuters) - Anonymous trading venues known as "dark
pools" are a technological evolution that have benefitted both
institutional and retail trading by bringing down transaction
costs, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said in a memo to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, the SEC voted unanimously for ways to make the
dark pools more transparent, such as revealing the electronic
trading messages that are sent to a limited group of market
participants. [ID:nN21498280]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a report submitted to the SEC on Oct. 22, Goldman said
the investing community -- especially retail -- has benefitted
from the evolving market structure and industry competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman report, posted on the SEC website, summarized a
meeting held on Sept. 24 between its executives and the
commission staff to discuss issues involving market structure
including short selling and dark pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the report, Goldman stated five common myths regarding
dark pool trading and supplied arguments in an effort to dispel
those myths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dark pools are trading platforms where buyers and sellers
can anonymously match large blocks of stock, keeping details of
the deals and prices concealed to prevent distorting prices in
the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dark pools, the largest of which are run by banks such as
Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), account for an
estimated 10 to 15 percent of overall U.S. equity volume.
[ID:nHKG120662]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said in the report that increased competition from
dark pools pushes all execution venues to compete for retail
order flow in a superior manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While market structure evolution has not been without its
challenges, they have been accompanied by a secular decline in
both implicit and explicit trading costs, benefiting primarily
retail investors," Goldman said in the report.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Fox has lost Microsoft as the exclusive sponsor of its upcoming "Family Guy" variety special after the software company's executives watched the show's taping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the companies announced they were teaming for an unprecedented collaboration on "Family Guy Presents: Seth  Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show," a special set to air November 8 during Fox's popular Sunday animated block. Instead of traditional commercials, the special was to feature creative promotion of Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 7, woven into the show's content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then executives watched the animated show in a live taping before a studio audience. Here's a statement from Microsoft:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We initially chose to participate in the Seth and Alex variety show based on the audience composition and creative humor of 'Family Guy,' but after reviewing an early version of the variety show it became clear that the content was not a fit with the Windows brand. We continue to have a good partnership with Fox, (series creator and writer) Seth MacFarlane and (co-star and writer) Alex Borstein and are working with them in other areas. We continue to believe in the value of brand integrations and partnerships between brands, media companies and talent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special reportedly contained jokes about deaf people, the Holocaust, feminine hygiene and incest. In other words, it was just like a regular "Family Guy" episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 30-second ad during "Family Guy" costs about $214,750. Buying an entire half-hour special during sweeps doubtless put the Microsoft deal into the millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox plans to move forward with another integrated sponsor, though it's unclear how this will work since the network's live taping included Windows 7-related humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by SheriLinden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With software being created by IBM researchers, developers will be able to adapt a Web page for voice browsers -- and for mobile browsers that fall short of a PC-like Web experience -- with easy-to-follow lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visual editor technology, which doesn't yet have a formal name, was designed to solve the problem of taking information from a Web page, with multiple columns and boxes, and presenting it to people who can't see or get to a full-featured browser. To reach those people, the various parts of a Web page's content -- headings, columns, tables and so on -- need to be presented in sequence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's new tool allows developers to dictate that sequence using a series of arrows, on a view of the Web page itself, that connect to form a single line around the page from the first element to the last. The company has posted a video that demonstrates it. Eventually, it will automatically generate those lines, which developers will then be able to fine-tune. The system could give some developers greater control over how pages appear or sound to users, according to analyst Bill Weinberg of Linuxpundit.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning a traditional two-dimensional Web page into a single stream of content can help to get its information out to more users. Voice browsers are already available for computer users with impaired vision. Handset makers are increasingly using voice input and output for many functions on a phone. This can help consumers use their phones when it's not convenient to look at the screen or find the right buttons, though today these capabilities fall short of full Web browsing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the iPhone introduced consumers to phone browsers that are like those on a PC, but some users are getting fed up with having to manipulate the view on a small screen in order to see parts of those pages close up, Weinberg said. In addition, most of the world's cell phones are so-called "feature phones" that don't have full HTML browsers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we're talking about the global mobile marketplace, we still have to deal with a mix of WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) and ad hoc browsers," Weinberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's software lets Web masters edit the flow of content created with AJAX, Javascript or XMLHttpRequest (XHR). By making the process simple, the company hopes to make it accessible to Web developers of all skill levels, according to IBM spokesman Ari Fishkind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By addressing AJAX and Javascript, IBM should be able to reach most Web developers today, Linuxpundit's Weinberg said. But the tool might appeal most to small and medium-sized businesses and small mobile development houses, he said. Enterprises with large amounts of material to present tend to use content management systems on the back end that can reformat the content for mobile delivery. There are also other specialized tools on the market that can adapt traditional Web pages automatically based on a set of parameters. However, IBM's technology would probably give more hands-on control, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presenting an entire Web page audibly still presents the problem of making users listen to a lot of content they didn't need to hear, though there are some techniques used for visually impaired people that give the gist of a passage and let them skip over it, Weinberg said. Still, there may be no way around some hands-on editing to optimize content for new settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if you format the content correctly, it's usually best if you actually change the content a bit," said analyst Michael Cote of Redmonk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM announced Monday that the development tool works, though its features might change and the company hasn't yet determined how or when it will be offered. It might be included in software from IBM's Lotus or Rational divisions, or offered as an open-source tool, IBM's Fishkind said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments)
 (For the latest Australia and New Zealand bond news, double
click on [AU/CRD] and then double click on the ID number)

 SYDNEY, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCL.AX),
Australia's top soft drink bottler, has sold US$400 million of
notes in the United States to refinance debt, it said on
Thursday.

 The offer, the first for the company in the 144a market,
was well-oversubscribed at the final margin of 95 basis points
over U.S. Treasury, Keith Allan, assistant treasurer at
Coca-Cola Amatil said. (See [ID:nN28297675] for deal details)

 The 144a bond market is open to professional investors
known as "qualified institutional buyers".

 Strong demand allowed the borrower, which roadshowed,
launched and priced the offer on the same day, to pay a lower
spead than around the 100 bps initially anticipated.

 Allan estimated the Australian unit paid five to 10 basis
points more than its U.S. parent company, Coca-Cola Enterprises
(CEE.N).

 The offer was more than twice oversubscribed at 95 bps and
was snapped up by money managers and insurance companies, a
source who has seen the terms said.

 Coca-Cola Amatil considered selling bonds in other markets,
including Europe, Australia and the United States, and opted
for the large and liquid 144a bond market because of its
cheaper borrowing costs.

 In the past, the beverage bottler favoured the rival U.S.
traditional private placement (USPP) market, which has been a
popular source of funds for Australian companies looking for
large volume and long-dated debt.

 "The U.S. 144a market priced our credit more aggressively
than in the USPP," said Allan.

 Coca-Cola Amatil also considered the Australian bond market
but passed following preliminary pricing indications.

 "A domestic transaction would not be able to compete with
the price we received in the 144a market," Allan added.

 Bond issues from non-financial borrowers are rare in
Australia and represent only 3 percent of a record A$77 billion
at the end of September, data from consultancy firm ADCM shows.

 Typically, companies prefer to raise funds in Europe or the
United States where they can sell larger amounts over longer
terms than those in Australia.

 Australian non-financial firms have raised A$23 billion
offshore so far this year, representing 16 percent of the total
raised offshore by local companies, according to ADCM data.

 Coca-Cola Amatil, whose next large debt maturity is in
2012, has about A$2 billion of debt.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - The Walt Disney Co. plans to build a 12-stage production facility at its Golden Oak Ranch in the Santa Clarita Valley, northwest of Los Angeles, primarily to serve the production needs of ABC Studios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney and ABC Studios have filed applications with Los Angeles County for Disney/ABC Studios at the Ranch, a high-tech soundstage and production facility. The facility, which would include six pairs of soundstages, would take up 56 acres in the western tip of the 890-acre Gold Oak Ranch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has only two soundstage facilities, one on the Disney lot, which has virtually no usable outdoor space, and one at its Prospect Studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, ABC Studios' 14 locally produced series are spread over nine facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Ranch facility is built, it could accommodate about four established and as many as six freshman shows, said ABC Studios executive director production Richard Ballering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "synergy of indoor and outdoor production" was the main draw at Golden Ranch, which would still have 195 acres for outdoor filming and movie ranch space after construction is completed, Ballering said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined comment on the size of the company's investment in the ranch. According to figures released by ABC Studios, the project is expected to generate 3,152 new jobs and $522 million in economic activity during construction and 2,854 full and part-time jobs and $533 million in annual economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no official launch date for the facility, but Disney is looking as a possible 2013 construction start date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. purchased the Gold Oak Ranch in 1959 to use for outdoor filming. It originally was used primarily for Westerns, gradually expanding to a wide range of feature, TV and commercial productions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the films and series shot on the premises include "Old Yeller," "Pearl Harbor," "Independence Day" and the two "Pirates of the Caribbean" sequels as well as "Lassie," "Bonanza," "The X-Files," "CSI" and "Entourage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by SheriLinden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(please visit our entertainment blog via www.reuters.com or on blogs.reuters.com/fanfare/)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft have missed a deadline for finalizing their search and advertising deal and have now extended the deadline for an unspecified period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the companies announced in July that Microsoft's Bing search engine would power Yahoo's search results, they said that they planned to finalize the deal by Oct. 27 or use an arbitration panel to hammer out their differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Yahoo said the companies have agreed to extend the period to negotiate and execute the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the complex nature of the transaction, there remain some details to be finalized," Yahoo said in the filing. "The parties are working diligently on finalizing the agreements, have made good progress to date, and have agreed to execute the agreements as expeditiously as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filing does not provide a new deadline for finalizing the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, Microsoft said it was committed to the agreement and that the companies had mutually agreed to extend the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We plan to do this as expeditiously as possible. Both companies are optimistic that we will be able to close this deal by early 2010," Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft initially estimated it would take them two years to fully implement the deal, which also involves Yahoo providing premium search advertising services for both companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is facing an antitrust review by the U.S. Department of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * EBITDA surges 38 pct from year ago
 (Recasts to add details, shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO Oct 28 (Reuters) - Visanet VNET3.SA, the
Brazilian credit card company that sold shares for the first
time this year, said on Wednesday net income surged 35 percent
in the third quarter helped by an unexpected jump in revenue
from receivables and a reduction in expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sao Paulo-based company reported profit of 396.7
million reais ($226 million), compared with 294.2 million reais
a year earlier, according to a securities filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit cards is one of the fastest-growing segments in
Brazil's thriving financial industry, driven by consumers that
are buying more goods with interest rates at a record low and
the economy recovers from its first recession in almost two
decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net operational revenue advanced 28 percent in the quarter,
after fees and credit card equipment leasing soared 22 percent
and 17 percent, respectively, the company said. Visanet was
paid 57 million reais in receivables ahead of time, which
accounted for about 6 percent of revenue in the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results "confirm the firm expansion of our network of
accredited affiliates nationwide," Visanet said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Costs related to the payment of royalties to Visa Inc rose
almost fourfold to 32.6 million reais. Financial expenses
dropped 63 percent as the company paid lower borrowing costs on
its obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EBITDA, a gauge of operational profitability that stands
for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, rose 26 percent to 569.9 million reais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EBITDA margin, or the proportion of EBITDA over total
revenue, gained 2.9 percentage points to 65.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Common shares of Visanet gained 1.7 percent to 16.06 reais
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=1.755 reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors could be disappointed if they anticipate tons of money waiting to get back into the stock market, since "cash on the sidelines" is much less than estimated, Goldman Sachs analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on their calculations, net equity inflow from individuals, institutional investors and corporations over the next several quarters could total $600 billion, the analysts said in a research note on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"'Cash on the sidelines' is much less than the $3.4 trillion in money market mutual fund assets that market participants typically cite as the No. 1 reason stocks are poised to rally," analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have been keeping cash in money market mutual funds, which are considered a safe haven compared with equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cash on the sidelines" is often cited as a likely reason why stocks stand to gain more. The Standard  Poor's 500 .SPX index is already up some 55 percent since its early March low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential inflow of $600 billion over a 12-month period could be a "bullish backdrop" for investors but "will not be sufficient to sustain a robust market rally without accompanying improvements in the U.S. economy and the corporate earnings outlook," the analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

Brazilian credit card company that sold shares for the first

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
BP plc (NYSE: BP), ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), U.S. Steel Corp.

the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

BP Tops on Better Cost Control

BP plc (NYSE: BP) reported its third quarter 2009 results of $1.71 per ADS
(American Depositary Share), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 on
the back of stronger cost controls and increased upstream volumes. However, in
comparison with the year-earlier results, earnings fell approximately 34% on
lower oil prices. 

BP`s strong performance sets the stage for earnings releases by ExxonMobil
(NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX), which are scheduled to report their results
on Thursday and Friday this week, respectively. 

BP expects its capex budget to be $20 billion for the year. The company`s
attractive dividend (currently yielding around 6%) remains unchanged from the
year-ago level. We believe that BP`s dividend is safe with the recent uptrend in
oil prices. 

Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $8.1 billion
compared with $14.9 billion a year ago. Net debt at the end of the quarter was
$26.3 billion, representing net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 21% (compared
with 17% a year ago). 

Steel Output Mounting

Key steel consuming industries such as auto, shipbuilding and construction have
been experiencing weak demand in the last quarters, forcing global steel makers
to lower production levels. U.S. Steel Corp. (NYSE: X) had slashed production by
almost 62% during the second quarter of 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO
(NYSE: PKX) was forced to reduce production for the first time in its history.
POSCO curtailed production by about 15% during the period. 

However, with steel demand picking up in the last couple of months, United
States Steel Corp. is restarting its blast furnace at its Hamilton, Ontario,
plant after a nine-month shutdown. U.S. Steel had closed the Hamilton blast
furnace in Nov 2008. It suspended the remaining operations at Hamilton and the
Nanticoke facilities in March 2009 due to a drop in demand. Both the facilities
were running at less than half their capacity.

&lt;p&gt;Solar Electric Power Association Recognizes PGE`s Partnership Model on Recent
Solar Projects
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric (NYSE:POR) was recognized today by the Solar Electric
Power Association with a 2009 Solar Business Achievement Award in the category
of Partnering for Success. 

PGE received the national solar award in partnership with U.S. Bank, the Oregon
Department of Transportation, and ProLogis, for being the first utility in the
nation to develop a unique third-party ownership model to help develop
large-scale solar projects in its service area. 

The unique model allows PGE and its customers to overcome project-funding
constraints and capture the value of tax benefits that neither customers nor PGE
could otherwise use. 

The utility solar business model pioneered by PGE uses the 50 percent Oregon
Business Energy Tax Credit, the 30 percent Federal Investment Tax Credit,
accelerated depreciation, and utility incentives to finance solar projects. 

"Portland General Electric has developed an innovative utility solar partnership
program that has worked through the challenges inherent in project financing and
siting, while leveraging the business needs of the utility and the interests of
customers," said Julia Hamm, SEPA executive director. 

"We want to thank our customers and partners who have worked to make these
important solar projects possible," said Carol Dillin, vice president of
customers and economic development, PGE. "Our solar business model is part of
our strategy to work together with our customers to help reach the state`s
renewable energy standard of 25 percent renewable energy by 2025." 

The two projects recognized in the 2009 partnership award are the Oregon Solar
Highway, the nation`s first solar highway project, located at the I-5/I-205
interchange in Tualatin, Ore., and the ProLogis rooftop project, the Northwest`s
largest rooftop installation, located in Portland. 

The Oregon Solar Highway demonstration project, a collaborative effort of PGE,
U.S. Bank, and ODOT, began supplying renewable power in December 2008 to help
light the way for drivers at the Interstate 5 and Interstate 205 interchange in
Tualatin, Ore. The 104-kilowatt photovoltaic system covers about 8,000 square
feet - roughly the length of two football fields - and produces about 112,000
kilowatt hours a year, or 28 percent of the 400,000 kilowatt hours used to light
the interchange. 

The 1.1-megawatt rooftop ProLogis solar project, a collaborative effort of PGE,
U.S. Bank and ProLogis that is the largest rooftop project in the Pacific
Northwest, began generating solar power in December 2008. The project, which
uses "thin-film" solar panels, is installed on the rooftops of three ProLogis
distribution warehouses in northeast Portland and covers more than 328,000
square feet. 

Earlier this year, SEPA recognized PGE as a national utility leader in the
integration of solar into its generation portfolio in 2008. PGE ranked eighth in
the nation - and fourth in the West - in total solar generation installed. 

Currently, PGE has 7.4 megawatts (MW) of solar capacity interconnected in PGE`s
operating area with almost 500 solar "net metering" customers (customers who
generate their own electricity), which is enough to power more than 685 homes
and offset more than 3 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. 

About Portland General Electric Company: Portland General Electric,
headquartered in Portland, Ore., is a vertically integrated electric utility
that serves approximately 814,000 residential, commercial and industrial
customers in Oregon. Visit our Web site at www.PortlandGeneral.com. 

About the Solar Electric Power Association: SEPA is comprised of more than 550
utilities and solar industry members. From national events to one-on-one
counseling, SEPA is the go-to resource for unbiased and actionable solar
intelligence. Breaking down information overload into business reality, SEPA
takes the time and risk out of implementing solar business plans and helps turn
new technologies into new opportunities.

&lt;p&gt;Jive has given its enterprise social-networking software what it calls its biggest overhaul yet, giving users the ability to collaborate on Microsoft Office files and to use the product from mobile devices, including an application built specifically for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jive's Social Business Software (SBS) 4.0, which the company will release on Tuesday, comes with a new "connector" that allows users to jointly author, view, annotate and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this functionality, multiple users can simultaneously work on Office documents on their PCs and have their changes reflected and consolidated on a single copy of the file hosted centrally on the SBS server. This approach is meant to replace the practice of having workgroup members e-mail Office documents among themselves as they collaborate on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering how ubiquitous Office is in workplaces of all sizes, Jive made a good move by adding this type of collaboration functionality, which Microsoft has yet to provide natively in the suite, said Bradley F. Shimmin, an analyst with Current Analysis. "Jive has in a way leapfrogged Microsoft's own intentions [for Office collaboration]," Shimmin said, referring to Microsoft's plans for a Web-hosted version of Office, called Office Web Apps and still in development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the new Jive Mobile module opens up the ability to post content to SBS threaded discussions, blogs, documents and status updates via e-mail from cell phones such as the BlackBerry. In addition, the module has a "native" iPhone application that provides a user experience very close to how SBS works on the desktop, according to Jive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving access to enterprise collaboration tools from mobile phones is becoming a must-do for vendors like Jive, as users increasingly expect to be able to continue this type of work while away from the office, Shimmin said. "What Jive is doing here isn't revolutionary, but rather necessary," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBS 4.0 also offers enhancements to the suite's Bridging Module, which is designed to let users import comments and discussions in public SBS forums into private SBS forums for internal analysis and collaboration. For example, a company that provides public SBS forums to its clients for customer support can funnel into a private SBS forum a discussion it considers important. That way, the appropriate business officials can jointly review it, posting comments online and drafting plans of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBS, introduced in 2006, belongs to a new wave of enterprise collaboration software that has emerged in recent years as alternatives to traditional wares from Microsoft and IBM's Lotus. These new collaboration tools tend to be easier to set up, less expensive and more intuitive for end-users, because they're modeled after Web 2.0-type applications popular among consumers, such as wikis, blogs, discussion forums and social networks, albeit with IT management and enterprise security features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and IBM, noticing this trend, have been adapting their collaboration products and developing new ones to compete against Jive and other vendors such as Socialtext. Microsoft even partners with one of these new vendors, NewsGator, which provides an enterprise social-networking component to SharePoint Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise social-networking and collaboration products such as SBS typically provide online collaborative spaces where employees can jointly annotate and edit documents, post comments and receive automated alerts about colleagues' actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Jive announced plans to link SBS with major content management systems (CMSes), like SharePoint, arguing that SBS provides a better environment for users to collaborate than the typical CMS product. "Jive is trying to make its platform a sort of collaboration Switzerland," Shimmin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jive offers SBS both as server software that can be installed on customer premises and as SaaS (software-as-a-service) accessed via the Internet and hosted on an external data center. SBS 4.0 costs US$59 per user per year on-premise and $85,000 per year for up to 250,000 monthly page views as SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;

fell for a fourth straight day on Wednesday after disappointing
housing data and a lower forecast for third-quarter U.S. growth
by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hardest hit of the major indexes was the Nasdaq, which was
dragged down by big cap tech shares after a two-week period in
which technology had outperformed the other sectors. Apple Inc
(AAPL.O) was down 2 percent at $193.50 and Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) fell 1.2 percent at $28.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stocks were hurt by a government report showing an
unexpected fall in new home sales last month, while Goldman
Sachs cut its forecast for gross domestic product, saying
stocks may have gone too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We finally started to worry about the after-effects of
market stimulus" as government stimulus ends, said Alan Lancz,
president of Alan B. Lancz  Associates Inc in Toledo, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You get a reality check that this (market) is just
overstretched... we haven't had a correction of more than 3-4
percent in the past seven, eight months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 50.03
points, or 0.51 percent, at 9,832.14. The Standard  Poor's 500
Index .SPX was down 12.04 points, or 1.13 percent, at
1,051.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 38.26
points, or 1.81 percent, at 2,077.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until now, the SP technology sector had lost the least
ground since the market's closing high of 1,097.91 on Oct. 19,
according to analysts at Bespoke Investment Group, but that
sector was feeling the brunt of the losses on Wednesday. Apollo
Group Inc (APOL.O) shed more than 18 percent after it said
federal regulators launched an informal inquiry into its
revenue recognition practices. [ID:nBNG336127]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weak home sales data heightened concerns that housing
demand will slip as the one-time home buyer tax credit is
phased out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of newly built single-family homes fell 3.6 percent
last month, their first drop since March, prompting investors
to doubt the strength of recovery in consumer mood and the
housing sector. [ID:nN28296063].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs cut its forecast for third-quarter GDP to 2.7
percent from 3.0 percent, the investment bank said. Data on GDP
-- a gauge of economic growth, which the  government will
release on Thursday -- is expected to show a rise of 3.3
percent, according to 77 analysts polled by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX also moved above its 50-day
average and outpaced the nearest month volatility futures
contract as the SP 500 index retreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Inc (V.N) jumped 3.5 percent to $76.44 a day after it
posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, raised its
dividend and authorized a stock-buyback plan.  [ID:nN27264293]

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is viewed as the most likely buyer or partner for IAC/InterActiveCorp's (IACI.O) Ask.com if CEO Barry Diller decides to throw in the towel on the struggling search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diller effectively hung a "for sale" sign on Ask.com on Tuesday, when he said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts that the search business is "challenging" and its future is "speculative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering questions about whether he would consolidate a business that has been unable to expand beyond its 4 percent market share in search queries, Diller said, "The answer is 'yes.' And it is unlikely that we would be the consolidator."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts are taking those words as a 'come and talk to me' message to Microsoft, which relaunched its search engine as Bing this year. Microsoft is seeking distribution deals with any number of partners to compete against Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the search market, Ask.com is a distant fourth behind Google with its 64.9 percent share, Yahoo with 18.8 percent and Microsoft with 9.4 percent, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Ask's revenue now comes from an advertising relationship with Google, which provides links of relevant advertisers in response to a user's search query on Ask.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, Microsoft wants share so they could pick up those points from Ask," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at Brigantine Advisors. "Plus it has a double impact since Google powers Ask's paid search."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask.com has tried a number of different strategies in the last few years to drive users to its search service, including TV advertising, vertical marketing partnerships with the likes of NASCAR, and more user-friendly search technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet as Diller himself acknowledged on Tuesday, it has been very difficult to change users' habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said if Diller is to make a decision on Ask's future, then sooner is probably better than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search market is going through major changes with Bing gaining market share, and a new search partnership between Microsoft and Yahoo expected to kick in next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is viewed as willing to spend to bulk up its search share, but that could change if IAC doesn't move now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no place for a third player in search," said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst at Global Equities Research. "This is a market where the winner takes it all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other key player in the search business is Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) AOL. Diller quelled speculation that he might be interested in buying AOL by saying on Tuesday that IAC would not be a consolidator in search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such speculation has dogged IAC because it has around $1.8 billion of cash and barely any debt, but Diller has maintained he is only interested in small acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, IAC "could be open to a partnership (with AOL?) at some point in the future if it was beneficial to all parties involved," Credit Suisse analyst John Blackledge said in a client note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AOL, which is about to be spun off from its parent, could also have a role in IAC's final decision. It is the fifth ranking search network with 3 percent share. Its search advertising is also powered by Google, a partnership that comes up for renewal in December 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Diller's probably front-running the AOL deal to get the best terms," said Gillis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mickey Mouse Makes His Wii Debut Alongside Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Walt
Disney`s First Cartoon Star
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Interactive Studios today announced the development of Disney Epic
Mickey, an adventure-platforming game with light role-playing elements for the
Wii home video game console. The game stars Mickey Mouse who has been
re-imagined for videogames by luminary game designer Warren Spector and his
Junction Point game development studio. In Disney Epic Mickey, Spector, a
life-long Disney fan, taps into Mickey Mouse`s rich history along with the
characters and worlds brought to life by Walt Disney to create an edgy and
unexpected cartoon adventure. 

"Mickey is an adventurous and rambunctious mouse," said Warren Spector, creative
director and vice president, Junction Point. "I want to bring his personality to
the forefront, place him in a daunting world and connect his spirited character
with video game players worldwide. Ultimately, each player decides for him- or
herself what makes Mickey cool." 

In the game`s fiction, a sorcerer named Yen Sid creates a beautiful,
whimsically-twisted world where Disney`s forgotten and retired creations thrive.
Originally, the powerful sorcerer from "The Sorcerer`s Apprentice" in Walt
Disney`s 1940 film "Fantasia" was nicknamed "Yen Sid" by Disney animators,
although never named as such on screen. In Spector`s game, Oswald the Lucky
Rabbit - Walt Disney`s first cartoon star created in 1927 - becomes the earliest
inhabitant of Yen Sid`s Cartoon Wasteland after Mickey Mouse is created. Oswald
makes the Cartoon Wasteland comfortable for other retired characters as they
join him in this magical land. Years pass, and as Oswald dwells in the Cartoon
Wasteland, he becomes resentful watching Mickey`s popularity swell. When Mickey
curiously stumbles upon Yen Sid`s map, he makes an innocent yet terrible mistake
and inadvertently devastates Oswald`s comfortable world. Eventually, Mickey`s
mistake pulls him deep into the mysterious Cartoon Wasteland to face the
destruction he unknowingly created. 

"Having Warren combine creativity and innovation with one of the world`s most
famous characters takes Mickey back to his creative roots and allows fans to
deepen their engagement with him as a character - especially in video games,"
said Graham Hopper, executive vice president and general manager of Disney
Interactive Studios. "In addition to Warren`s lifelong love of cartoons, films
and comics, his visionary approach to game design and storytelling will make
certain that this heroic tale of discovery and redemption resonates with Disney
fans and gamers alike." 

Players use the Wii Remote to wield magical paint and thinner to re-shape the
world around them. Paint`s creativity and thinner`s damaging effect give the
player robust tools and empowers them to make choices about how they move
through the world. Each player`s decisions to use paint, thinner or both
dynamically changes the world with consequences that affect the environment,
interactions with other characters, and even Mickey`s appearance and abilities. 

"The core of this game is the idea of choice and consequence, and how that
defines both the character and the player," said Spector. "By putting the
mischievous Mickey in an unfamiliar place and asking him to make choices - to
help other cartoon characters or choose his own path - the game forces players
to deal with the consequences of their actions. Ultimately, players must ask
themselves, `What kind of hero am I?` Each player will come up with a different
answer." 

Blurring reality and fantasy, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit`s role is as significant
in the game as it was in real life. The Walt Disney-created Oswald appeared in
26 silent cartoons between 1927 and 1928 for Charles Mintz, who contracted with
Universal for distribution. At this time, Oswald was primed to be Walt`s first
big animated star. When faced with daunting production costs, Walt asked for
more money to ensure the quality of the Oswald cartoons. When a deal could not
be reached, Walt lost the rights to Oswald and with the rabbit went much of
Walt`s staff. Among those who remained with Walt was animator, cartoonist and
long-time friend Ub Iwerks, and together they created a new character named
Mickey Mouse. 

The initial concept behind Disney Epic Mickey originated within the Disney
Interactive Studios` Think Tank. The Think Tank conceptualized Mickey as a
cartoon character thrown into turmoil. Spector expanded and refined Disney Epic
Mickey`s concept and built the game for a broad audience fully utilizing the Wii
and Wii Remote for accessibility and engaging gameplay. 

Developed by Junction Point in Austin, TX, Disney Epic Mickey is slated for a
fall 2010 release. The game currently is unrated by the ESRB. For more

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from Goldman client note, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) on
Wednesday cut its forecast for third-quarter U.S. gross
domestic product growth to 2.7 percent from 3.0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a short client note released after the durable goods
report, Goldman Sachs economists Jan Hatzius, Ed McKelvey and
Andrew Tilton noted that shipments were somewhat weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The shipments of capital goods and total durable goods
inventories are the last major piece of information feeding
into tomorrow's preliminary report on GDP growth," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Based on this information as well as other data released
in the past couple of weeks -- including complete book value
inventory data for August -- we now estimate that real GDP rose
at a 2.7 percent annual rate, somewhat less than the 3 percent
annual rate that we had previously thought," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data on GDP -- a gauge of economic growth, which the
government will report on Thursday, is expected to show a rise
of 3.3 percent, according to 77 analysts polled by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The day before the September jobs report, Goldman
economists increased their forecast of job losses to 250,000
from 200,000, a call that turned out to be much closer to the
actual number of 263,000.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will unveil on Wednesday several open source initiatives to boost interoperability between Microsoft technologies, such as Windows 7, Windows Azure, and Silverlight, and open source technologies, including the Eclipse tools platform and Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the company has at times been viewed as the commercial opposite of the open source movement, the company's latest gestures to the open source community show Microsoft is willing to make moves that can assist open source devotees build products that rely on Microsoft's products. Microsoft is working with Tasktop Technologies and Soyatec in projects and technologies being unveiled Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Last week, Microsoft released a second beta version of its Visual Studio 2010 software development platform. | Get InfoWorld's 21-page hands-on look at the new version of Windows, from InfoWorld&#8217;s editors and contributors. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is part of our ongoing efforts to make our products more open," said Vijay Rajagopalan, principal architect for the Microsoft interoperability strategy team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In partnership with Eclipse solutions provider Tasktop, Microsoft is looking to enhance the developer experience of Eclipse on the newly released Windows 7 platform. Support is being extended to run the Eclipse IDE on Windows 7 and also to build Windows 7 applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies will develop updates to the Eclipse IDE to incorporate features of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. The intention, according to Microsoft, is to ensure that the "improved" productivity and user experience of Windows 7 will be available to developers using the Eclipse IDE and also to desktop applications built on the Eclipse platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers will be able to access Windows 7 functionality such as Jump Lists from the redesigned Windows 7 task bar. Jump Lists enable access to Eclipse-specific functions. Also, the project will extend Eclipse Standard Widget Toolkit to integrate Windows 7 features such as task bar display of progress and search widget integration. Updates also will modernize the look and feel of Eclipse to match the Windows 7 user interface experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are working with Tasktop to improve&#160;the developer experience on Windows 7," Rajagopalan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasktop will contribute enhancements to the Eclipse that will be available under the Eclipse Public License for early access in the first quarter of 2010. General release is planned for the Eclipse Helios technology release train in June 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows remains a critical platform for Eclipse users, stressed Mik Kersten, CEO of Tasktop. "Over three-quarters of Eclipse downloads are of the Windows distribution," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This joint effort between Tasktop and Microsoft is going to bring those new enhancements in Windows 7 into the hands of Eclipse IDE users," Kersten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also is announcing an open source plug-in, called Windows Azure Tools for Eclipse, to give PHP developers more flexibility in developing Web applications for the Windows Azure cloud platform. The plug-in, available as a free download, features wizards and utilities for writing, debugging, and deploying PHP applications to Azure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Essentially, it's an open source plugin that will enable PHP developers using Eclipse to create PHP Web applications," Rajagopalan said. The technology is available for download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existing Windows SDK for PHP is bundled into the Eclipse PHP project through the plug-in, which also includes a Windows Azure "storage explorer" to browse data contained in Azure tables, blobs, or queues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its Eclipse endeavors, Microsoft still has no plans to join the Eclipse Foundation. "I think we'll continue to explore opportunities to work with them," Rajagopalan said. "At this stage, we haven't made any decision to join the Eclipse community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also being unveiled is Windows Azure SDK for Java, providing tools to help Java developers use Azure. The SDK leverages Windows Azure Storage services for storing data and offers development methods for writing Web applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are releasing the Java SDK for Windows Azure so that Java developers who are running on-premise applications or other cloud applications can [also] use Azure storage," said Rajagopalan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soyatec partnered with Microsoft on both Eclipse Tools for Windows Azure for PHP and Windows Azure SDK for Java. Microsoft and Soyatec also have released a 1.0 version of Eclipse Tools for Silverlight, which is a plug-in for Eclipse-based developers to build rich Internet applications that leverage Silverlight. Included in the project is support for Macintosh and guidance on interoperability between Silverlight applications and Java-based Web sites and Web services, including REST, JSON, and other standards, Microsoft said. A customer technology preview of the plug-in was offered in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft-Soyatec road map calls for spring 2010 availability of version 2 of Eclipse Tools for Silverlight, featuring support for Silverlight 3.0 and offline application capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its initiatives, Microsoft is reaching over to the "other side" -- the open source developers, said analyst Al Hilwa of IDC. "[However,] it's a question mark" as far as how many developers will take Microsoft up on its accommodations, he said. But Microsoft's efforts are commendable, even if the company does have its own self interest in mind, Hilwa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day, this is not a charitable organization per se. I don't expect them to be, but the important thing is there's different ways to interpret what may be in their interest," he said. "Now, they're taking a more open view of what's in their interest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Microsoft is trying to extend adoption of Azure to Java developers, Hilwa noted. "They're saying it's not necessary that you have to be a .Net developer to take advantage of Azure," said Hilwa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been on a campaign in recent years to make accommodations for open source. The company cited developments such as its Windows Azure for PHP effort and Restlet Extension for ADO.Net Services to bridge Java and .Net. The company also is working with Zend, IBM and others on Simple API for Cloud Application Services, an open source project for cloud interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company in the past, however, has irked open source devotees with endeavors like forging an intellectual property agreement with Novell pertaining to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft extends Windows 7 and Azure to open source developers," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles City Council approved a US$7.25 million five-year deal Tuesday in which the city will adopt Gmail and other Google Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is touting the deal as a major endorsement of its cloud-based approach to computing, but it turns out that some of the funding is indirectly coming from an unlikely source: Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Los Angeles City Council minutes, just over $1.5 million for the project will come from the payout of a 2006 class action lawsuit between the City and Microsoft. Microsoft paid $70 million three years ago to settle the suit, brought on behalf of six California counties and cities who alleged that Microsoft used its monopoly position to overcharge for software. Microsoft has paid out more than $1 billion in other class-action settlements based on similar claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles City Council approved the deal unanimously on Tuesday, according to Google Spokesman Andrew Kovacs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migration from the city's Novell GroupWise e-mail servers will be handled by contractor Computer Sciences Corp. Other applications such as calendaring, document sharing and chat will be handled by Google Apps too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-year contract will cost Los Angeles about $1.5 million more than simply sticking with Novell. But because the city will get extra storage capacity from Google, while at the same time being able to run other software on the Novell servers, it's worth the cost, according to an Oct. 7 city finance committee memo written by City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has pushed Google Apps as an option for government agencies, promising to ship a product called Government Cloud, which will be certified under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), sometime next year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles deal may hint at how this product will work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Sept. 15 memo from the Los Angeles Information Technology Agency, Google will "provide a new separate data environment called 'GovCloud.' The GovCloud will store both applications and data in a completely segregated environment that will only be used by public agencies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This GovCloud would be encrypted and "physically and logically segregated" from Google's standard applications. The data would be stored only in the U.S. and only accessible to U.S citizens who have undergone security clearance. Because data would be encrypted and then stored on many different servers, Google's administrators wouldn't typically be able to access the information, although there would be so-called "Super Administrators" who would be able to recompile the data and read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city would own the data and would  be notified of "any request of data or security breach," the memo states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics are still worried about security and privacy, though. They convinced Los Angeles council members to tack on a "liquidated damages" clause to the contract that would award the city a payout in the event of a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kovacs of Google downplayed privacy and security concerns over the project. "One thing that was very clear in council today," he said. "They believe that Google Apps will make the city more secure than their current solution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised Texas Instruments
Inc TXN.N to its highest rating on greater potential for
margin expansion, while cutting flash memory maker SanDisk Corp
(SNDK.O) by a notch to "neutral" on valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Near-term downside risk for SanDisk stock should be limited
as long as NAND supply-demand is in balance and pricing is
stable, analyst James Covello wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NAND chips are used in a variety of consumer electronics
applications such as cell phones and data cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, if NAND supply-demand dynamics begin to change,
leading to excess capacity, we could become incrementally
bearish given the potential risk to average selling prices and
margins," Covello said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Texas Instruments, Covello said the market undervalues
the company's margin potential in 2010-2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see room for margin expansion in 2010 to Texas target
of 55 percent, which should be a positive catalyst for the
stock," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Texas Instruments' business should also benefit from
sizable share gains in analog segment beginning in the second
half of 2010, given its significantly lower cost structure, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SanDisk' shares closed at $22.69 on Nasdaq while shares of
Texas Instruments closed at $23.80 on the New York Stock
Exchange Tuesday.  (Reporting by Mansi Dutta in Bangalore;

Consolidated comparable third quarter operating income grew 5 percent. North
American comparable operating income grew $23 million or 9 percent and, in
Europe, operating income grew $46 million, or 17 percent, including a negative
currency impact of approximately $31 million. In the quarter, total revenues
were down 3 percent, as North American revenue declined 4 percent and European
revenue fell 1 percent. Excluding a negative currency impact of 3 percent, total
revenues were flat. Comparable EPS results of 51 cents include a negative
currency impact of approximately 4 cents. 

"Year to date, we have achieved strong profit growth through successful
execution of brand and marketplace initiatives and efficiency and effectiveness
programs," said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. "Going
forward, we continue to develop solid business plans for 2010 that will enable
us to increase the efficiency and synergy of our system and deliver consistent,
balanced growth." 

Consolidated third quarter results include a decline of 6&#189; percent in comparable
physical case bottle and can volume. Net pricing per case increased 7&#189; percent,
and cost of sales per case increased 3&#189; percent. Pages 10 through 14 of this
release provide a reconciliation of reported and comparable operating results. 

NORTH AMERICAN RESULTS

In North America, increased operating profitability reflects the benefits of
price/package architecture, efficiency initiatives, and year-over-year declines
in some commodity prices. Third-quarter volume declined 10 percent, impacted by
the Olympic-related promotional volume growth hurdle created in the same quarter
a year ago and the shift of 4th of July holiday volume into the second quarter.
Pricing per case grew 7&#189; percent and cost of sales per case increased 3&#189;
percent. 

"Profitability in North America remained in-line with our expectations despite a
challenging economic, consumer and operating environment," Mr. Brock said. "Our
earlier actions to drive improved effectiveness and efficiency and to enhance
margins through price/package architecture initiatives continue to improve
profitability. 

"We see ongoing growth opportunities in North America created by the strength of
our brands and portfolio," Mr. Brock said. "Long-term success requires even
greater efficiency and supply chain synergy, sustained strong cost control, and
even stronger marketplace execution. We are working closely with The Coca-Cola
Company to enhance our current strategies and take the steps necessary to
achieve these objectives." 

EUROPEAN RESULTS

Europe again achieved strong volume and pricing growth in the quarter. Third
quarter volume grew 4 percent, driven primarily by 4&#189; percent growth in the
Coca-Cola trademark brands. Coca-Cola Zero grew more than 15 percent, and brand
Coca-Cola grew 4&#189; percent. In addition, water grew approximately 25 percent
reflecting the benefits of the addition of Abbey Well in Great Britain and
double-digit growth for Chaudfontaine on the Continent. European net pricing per
case was up 4&#189; percent and cost of sales per case was flat. 

"Our European leadership team has continued to manage successfully through
current economic challenges, producing another quarter of excellent operating
and profit improvement," Mr. Brock said. "We benefited from our ongoing
efficiency and cost control initiatives and from the growth of our core
sparkling brands, which remain a key element of the sustained growth in European
profitability. 

"To meet the challenge of sustaining our pattern of growth in Europe, we will
remain focused on growing our core brands even as we expand our presence in
other key categories with the addition of Monster and vitaminwater," Mr. Brock
said. "We also will begin distributing Ocean Spray juice drinks in Great Britain
and France early next year, enhancing our portfolio of still brands that already
includes Oasis, Fanta Still, and Capri-Sun." 

FULL-YEAR 2009 OUTLOOK

Management now expects full-year comparable 2009 earnings per diluted common
share to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.57. This range includes an expected
negative currency impact of 16 cents per share and excludes nonrecurring items.
Excluding the impact of currency, revenue is expected to increase in a low to
mid single-digit range and decline slightly on a reported basis. The company
also expects strong free cash flow of approximately $800 million and capital
expenditures of approximately $900 million. 

Free cash flow will continue to be used for debt reduction, although the company
is evaluating methods for returning additional cash to shareowners. The
effective tax rate for 2009 is expected to be approximately 25 percent.

 (a)The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Net Pricing per Case" is used to more clearly evaluate bottle and can pricing trends in the marketplace. The measure excludes the impact of fountain gallon volume and other items that are not directly associated with bottle and can pricing in the retail environment. Our bottle and can sales accounted for approximately 91 percent of our net revenue during the third quarter and first nine months of 2009. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (b)The non-GAAP financial measures "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Net Pricing per Case" and "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Cost of Sales per Case" are used to separate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our operations. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (c)The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Cost of Sales per Case" is used to more clearly evaluate cost trends for bottle and can products. The measure excludes the impact of fountain ingredient costs as well as marketing credits and Jumpstart funding, and allows investors to gain an understanding of the change in bottle and can ingredient and packaging costs. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (d)"Comparable Bottle and Can Volume" excludes the impact of changes in the number of selling days between periods. The measure is used to analyze the performance of our business on a constant period basis. There were the same number of selling days in the third quarter of 2009 versus the third quarter of 2008. There were three additional selling days in the first nine months of 2009 versus the first nine months of 2008. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (e)The non-GAAP measure "Free Cash Flow" is provided to focus management and investors on the cash available for debt reduction, dividend distributions, share repurchase, and acquisition opportunities.                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (f)The non-GAAP measure "Net Debt" is used to more clearly evaluate our capital structure and leverage.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - With President Barack Obama due to visit China next month, speculation is swirling Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) may finally be about to announce a long-awaited deal to build a theme park in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney and the Shanghai government have been waiting since January for Beijing's approval to move forward with what would be the country's second Disneyland, after a Hong Kong park opened in 2005 to a string of operational problems and lackluster attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beijing has approved the project.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is launching free iPhone and iPod touch applications, giving fans access to Disney content and interactive features anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney.com, part of the Disney Interactive Media Group, said it will offer users of the popular Apple Inc devices items like the new "Click2Life" feature that lets fans take pictures of images from the Disney.com Web site, and eventually in the physical world, and unlock exclusive content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a teenager may one day see a poster of an upcoming "Pirates of the Caribbean" film in a mall, snap a picture of the poster with an iPhone and then generate video content related to that picture or character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Davis, vice president of Disney.com, said in an interview that the media giant realized it already had a huge audience of iPhone and iPod touch users for its content on its existing mobile application on Disney.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney.com reaches nearly 31 million unique visitors per month and said that among mobile Web sites, it ranks as the No. 1 entertainment mobile site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also has an expanding lineup of many paid applications currently available in Apple's App Store including Toy Story Mania!, Disney Fairies Fly, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Breakspin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our iPhone and iPod touch traffic is heavily made up of kids and moms. The iPod touch has a very specific demographic geared to the tween," he said, adding that within Disney content, there are various safety controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the applications are self-contained, once you're in the application, you can't get into anything else," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new application organizes Disney-branded content within one destination on each device, lets users interact with Disney characters through customizable photo frames and audio greetings, listen to Radio Disney live, watch music videos and buy Disney music on Apple's iTunes Store.&lt;/p&gt;

 (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, click [DEALTALK/])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By George Chen and Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES, Oct 28 (Reuters) - With U.S.
President Barack Obama due to visit China next month,
speculation is swirling Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) may finally be
about to announce a long-awaited deal to build a theme park in
Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney and the Shanghai government have been waiting since
January for Beijing's approval to move forward with what would
be the country's second Disneyland, after a Hong Kong park
opened in 2005 to a string of operational problems and
lacklustre attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Beijing has approved the project. Now it's up to Shanghai
and Disney to work out the plan and make this thing happen," a
Shanghai government source familar with the situation told
Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source asked not to be identified before a deal was
made public, while spokespeople from Disney and the Shanghai
government said they had nothing to announce at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By building in Shanghai, the company that brought Mickey
Mouse and Toy Story to the big screen would be tapping a huge
consumer market and growing personal wealth in one the
country's modern, Western-influenced cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media reports have placed the cost of the park around $3.6
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney would also aim to grab mainland money-making chances
that have tended to elude it in Hong Kong, where its fifth
resort was built in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anticipation is riding high that good news on Disney will
be timed to coincide with Obama's visit to China from Nov. 15
to 18 -- granting Disney its decade-old wish to locate a theme
park on the mainland of the world's most populous country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said a Disney agreement could be a feel-good
bilateral story, highlighting U.S. cultural influence and an
investment that does not entail U.S. job losses in the
manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China would get a boost to its leisure sector and to
domestic demand as it tries to trim its dependence on exports,
which left it vulnerable during the financial crisis, wrote
Gong Weisong, an editor at the state-run Shanghai Securities
News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For a big country, besides GDP, soft power is also very
important, and developing a culture industry has great
commercial value," he wrote in a front-page commentary on
Wednesday that said the time was right to go ahead with the
Disney project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China could also underscore its commitment to protecting
the Disney brand to counter widespread U.S. complaints that its
protection of intellectual property rights is still lax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'DISNEY-CONCEPT' STOCKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under a plan agreed upon by Disney and the Shanghai
government in January, Disney would own a 43 percent equity
stake in the new theme park and a local government-owned joint
venture holding company would own 57 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan calls for a large theme park and hotel complex to
open in 2013 in the southern outskirts of Shanghai's Pudong
district. Media reports have placed the cost of the park around
$3.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the Shanghai government said it had no
information to release at this moment on the Disney project,
while a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles-based media
conglomerate said it had not been told of any approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No deal has been agreed to, no project has been approved,"
said Disney spokeswoman Leslie Goodman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nevertheless, talk of the deal was widespread in Chinese
financial markets, pushing up the shares of so-called
"Disney-concept" stocks such as Shanghai Lujiazui Finance 
Trade Zone Development and Shanghai Jielong Group Industry,
which are expected to be participants in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lujiazui Finance (600663.SS) rose 4 percent on Tuesday to
its highest since mid-August, after Chinese media reported a
deal could be near. Jielong Group (600836.SS) soared its 10
percent daily limit, on a day the benchmark Shanghai composite
index .SSEC fell nearly 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Securities Times, one of China's three official
financial newspapers, reported on Tuesday that policy makers
had approved the project earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Currently, it is going through the final administrative
process, with a formal announcement likely to be made to the
public this week," the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks were stalled by a Shanghai government scandal in 2006
and Disney's need to focus on Hong Kong Disneyland.

&lt;p&gt;Jive has given its enterprise social-networking software what it calls its biggest overhaul yet, giving users the ability to collaborate on Microsoft Office files and to use the product from mobile devices, including an application built specifically for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jive's Social Business Software (SBS) 4.0, which the company will release on Tuesday, comes with a new "connector" that allows users to jointly author, view, annotate and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this functionality, multiple users can simultaneously work on Office documents on their PCs and have their changes reflected and consolidated on a single copy of the file hosted centrally on the SBS server. This approach is meant to replace the practice of having workgroup members e-mail Office documents among themselves as they collaborate on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the new Jive Mobile module opens up the ability to post content to SBS threaded discussions, blogs, documents and status updates via e-mail from cell phones such as the BlackBerry. In addition, the module has a "native" iPhone application that provides a user experience very close to how SBS works on the desktop, according to Jive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBS 4.0 also offers enhancements to the suite's Bridging Module, which is designed to let users import comments and discussions in public SBS forums into private SBS forums for internal analysis and collaboration. For example, a company that provides public SBS forums to its clients for customer support can funnel into a private SBS forum a discussion it considers important. That way, the appropriate business officials can jointly review it, posting comments online and drafting plans of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBS, introduced in 2006, belongs to a new wave of enterprise collaboration software that has emerged in recent years as alternatives to traditional wares from Microsoft and IBM's Lotus. These new collaboration tools tend to be easier to set up, less expensive and more intuitive for end-users, because they're modeled after Web 2.0-type applications popular among consumers, such as wikis, blogs, discussion forums and social networks, albeit with IT management and enterprise security features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and IBM, noticing this trend, have been adapting their collaboration products and developing new ones to compete against Jive and other vendors such as Socialtext. Microsoft even partners with one of these new vendors, NewsGator, which provides an enterprise social-networking component to SharePoint Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise social-networking and collaboration products such as SBS typically provide online collaborative spaces where employees can jointly annotate and edit documents, post comments and receive automated alerts about colleagues' actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Free app part of expanding lineup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is
launching free iPhone and iPod touch applications, giving fans

it will offer users of the popular Apple Inc (AAPL.O) devices
items like the new "Click2Life" feature that lets fans take
pictures of images from the Disney.com Web site, and eventually in
the physical world, and unlock exclusive content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For instance, a teenager may one day see a poster of an
upcoming "Pirates of the Caribbean" film in a mall, snap a picture
of the poster with an iPhone and then generate video content
related to that picture or character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Davis, vice president of Disney.com, said in an
interview that the media giant realized it already had a huge
audience of iPhone and iPod touch users for its content on its
existing mobile application on Disney.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney.com reaches nearly 31 million unique visitors per month
and said that among mobile Web sites, it ranks as the No. 1
entertainment mobile site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also has an expanding lineup of many paid applications
currently available in Apple's App Store including Toy Story
Mania!, Disney Fairies Fly, The Nightmare Before Christmas and
Breakspin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our iPhone and iPod touch traffic is heavily made up of kids
and moms. The iPod touch has a very specific demographic geared to
the tween," he said, adding that within Disney content, there are
various safety controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Because the applications are self-contained, once you're in
the application, you can't get into anything else," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new application organizes Disney-branded content within
one destination on each device, lets users interact with Disney
characters through customizable photo frames and audio greetings,
listen to Radio Disney live, watch music videos and buy Disney
music on Apple's iTunes Store.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 29 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
raised concerns about Galleon hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam
and his associates as far back as 2001, the Financial Times

newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Rajaratnam, 52, was arrested on Oct. 16 along with five
others in what prosecutors described as the biggest hedge fund
insider trading case ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 2001 note, written by an analyst at the bank's
alternative asset management arm, said the unit "should reduce
our allocation" in Galleon's technology fund, pointing to what
it described as "more negative news about Raj and his cohorts,"
the Financial Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The JPMorgan note alleged that the principals of Galleon

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today confirmed that users can apply a workaround trick to do a clean install of Windows 7 on a blank hard drive as long as they toe the licensing line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post earlier this week, Eric Ligman, who works in Microsoft's worldwide partner group, took exception to stories that showed people how to use the less-expensive Windows 7 upgrade editions to install the new operating system on blank drives. Computerworldcovered the upgrade install trick -- first reported by noted Windows blogger Paul Thurrott -- last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the past several days there have been various posts, etc. across a variety of social media engines stating that some 'hack' (be it a person or a procedure) shows that a Windows 7 Upgrade disc can perform a 'clean' installation of Windows 7 on a blank drive from a technical perspective," said Ligman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They often forgot to mention a very basic, yet very important piece of information," said Ligman about Thurrott's blog post and the resulting reports by others. "'Technically possible' does not always mean legal," Ligman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to use upgrade media to install Windows 7 on a blank hard drive, users must abide by the operating system's EULA, or end-user licensing agreement ( download PDF ). "To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. After you upgrade, you may no longer use the software you upgraded from," the EULA states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, said Ligman, means users must either have a "full" retail license of Windows XP or Vista, or assuming the Windows 7 upgrade is applied to an existing PC, that the upgrade is done on that same machine, which has a so-called "OEM" license attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are many, many, many, many of you out there that already own Windows licenses that qualify for the Windows 7 Upgrade, so this is a non-issue for you," said Ligman. "For you, since you have the previous version FULL Windows license and qualify for the Windows 7 Upgrade, you have the rights to do a 'clean' install."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On PCs purchased with Windows XP or Vista preinstalled by the computer maker -- which slap an "OEM" license of Windows on the machine -- users can install a Windows 7 upgrade edition on that system's blank hard drive, but on no other, Ligman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An OEM license is a full license," Ligman wrote in a comment to this blog post, answering a user's question. "So an OEM + an upgrade gets you the upgraded version."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokeswoman today confirmed Ligman's account of when it's permissible to use upgrade media -- which costs up to $100 less than the same version's "full" edition -- to install Windows 7 on a blank drive. "You can always do a clean install if you're upgrading, so long as you're upgrading a machine that's already running genuine Windows XP or Windows Vista," she said in an instant today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slightly less-expensive alternative to a "full" license of Windows 7 -- and one that can be applied on a blank drive or on a new PC that the user has assembled, is a retail "OEM" edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OEM copies of Windows are traditionally cheaper because they're intended for small-scale system builders who install them on new custom-crafted PCs. There's nothing to prevent an individual user, however, from buying and installing an OEM version of Windows on their PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downsides to an OEM edition are that the license bans users from transferring the operating system from one PC to another, it comes sans support of any kind, and it can only be used for a so-called "clean" install, which requires that data and settings be restored from backups, and applications be reinstalled, after the operating system is on the drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Computerworld readers pointed out that an OEM license for Windows 7 costs even less than an upgrade. "You could save even more money if you just buy the OEM versions from places like TigerDirect or Newegg," said an anonymous commenter of last week's story on the upgrade trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Computerworld noted that online retailers, including Newegg.com , were pre-selling OEM editions at reduced prices .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Newegg has discontinued its pre-sale prices, it currently lists the OEM version of Windows 7 Home Premium at $106.99, and Windows 7 Professional at $139.99 -- $8 and $49 less than its prices for upgrades, respectively. Newegg's OEM editions are an even bigger bargain than the full versions; they're priced $49 and $142 under the full editions of Home Premium and Professional, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike a Windows 7 upgrade, an OEM edition can be used to install the new operating system on a brand new, and thus blank, virtual machine, making OEM licenses attractive to users, such as people who own Macs, who want to run Windows 7 in a virtualized environment, such as VMware's new Fusion 3 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can deploy three different versions of Windows 7 in a virtual machine -- Home Premium, Professional and Ultimate. That follows the relaxed rules Microsoft announced in January 2008 for Windows Vista, when it modified the EULA for Home Premium .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  * Man who exposed bribery scheme a felon-plaintiffs &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  * Chevron says evidence shows gov't interference in case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A lawsuit against Chevron
Corp (CVX.N) over pollution of Ecuador's jungle in the 1990s
took another bizarre turn when the plaintiffs released a report
saying a man who helped force the removal of an Ecuadorean
judge from the $27 billion case is a convicted drug smuggler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiff-commissioned report was released on Thursday
to the media by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This report raises serious questions about Chevron's
credibility with this so-called bribery scandal," Steven
Donziger, a U.S. lawyer advising the Ecuadoreans in the
pollution case told reporters on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The local plaintiffs in the 16-year-old environmental
damage case have said that Texaco, bought by Chevron Corp in
2001, dumped billions of gallons of polluted water in the
jungle around where they live for more than two decades before
leaving Ecuador in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge Juan Nunez removed himself from the case after
Chevron accused him of being involved in a $3 million bribery
scheme for environmental remediation contracts. The judge, who
did not admit any wrongdoing, said he removed himself from the
case so it could proceed. [ID:nN29153772]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ecuador's government launched an investigation into the
alleged bribery scheme after Chevron offered as evidence
secretly taped video shot with cameras that had been hidden in
a watch and pen. Chevron posted the video on YouTube,
www.youtube.com/texacoecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report released by the Amazon Defense Coalition
plaintiffs group claimed that one of the men who shot the
footage, Wayne Hansen, is a convicted felon with no apparent
experience in the remediation business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diego Borja, an Ecuadorean logistics contractor who had
once worked for Chevron, also shot some footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said neither man was paid, though the San Ramon,
California-based company has said it assisted Borja with the
costs of relocating out of Ecuador and other support because he
and the company feared for his safety and the safety of his
family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has said it is paying for legal representation for
Borja and Hansen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Donziger called on the U.S. Justice Department to ensure
Ecuadorean investigators can get all the facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Unless the DOJ devotes resources to investigate the role
of Chevron in making this happen, I doubt we're going to get to
the bottom of this," Donziger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Justin Higgs declined by email to comment
specifically on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The content on the video and transcripts that we turned
over to the (Ecuador) Prosecutor General and U.S. Department of
Justice shows inappropriate meetings held by the judge (who was
at the time overseeing the case), government interference in
the case and a bribe plot involving $3 million," Higgs wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He recommended any questions for Hansen go to his lawyer.
But San Francisco lawyer Mary McNamara said on Thursday she was
no longer representing Hansen, and could not comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report claimed to have found in public records that
Hansen pleaded guilty in U.S. court to conspiring to import
275,000 pounds (125,000 kg) of marijuana from Colombia in
1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hansen, sentenced to 32 months in federal prison, was
released after little more than a year and a half, according to
the report by San Francisco-area investigator Grant Fine.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today touted the new self-help support baked into Windows 7, even as its engineers continue to wrestle with an "endless reboot" problem that has crippled some computers being upgraded from Vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's revamped technical support relies heavily on a new feature in Windows 7, dubbed "Action Center," said Lori Brownell, general manager of product quality and online support, in a long statement Microsoft issued Wednesday. Action Center is Windows 7's version of Vista's Security Center, but it also offers more than 20 automated troubleshooters that are accessed either at the user's request, or automatically by the OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These troubleshooters can diagnose and solve the most common problems reported by Windows users, including set-up and compatibility issues, hardware defects and the like," said Brownell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other Microsoft executives also called out the Action Center as a cornerstone for the support changes the company's instituted with Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the things we've put together is a[n] Action Center script that helps users migrate [data files] out of the Windows.old folder," Ben Bennett, the director of Microsoft's Windows consumer global support group, said in an interview earlier this week. Some users, he added, have been unable to access, or even find, critical documents after upgrading to Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Assuming you didn't completely reformat your drive -- and only a few customers do -- you still have the old folders on the machine," Bennet continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Action Center is based on PowerShell," added Paul Aaron, Microsoft's senior group manager for Windows supportability, talking about the command line- and scripting language-based tool integrated into Windows 7. "If customers call in, we can run that script by getting them to download it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is using feedback from more traditional support venues -- phone- and e-mail-based support -- to create new Action Center scripts, said Aaron. "Once we've proved them, and hit the quality bar that we want, we'll post them to the Download Center," he said, referring to Microsoft's centralized download site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other new support moves Microsoft's made for the launch of Windows 7 include a Twitter account -- MicrosoftHelps -- that it's using to take support queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're using it more as a routing function," said Aaron. "We have a team looking for those tweets, and they try to look for answers in the Microsoft support properties. If they can find an answer, they'll do a TinyURL for answers. If not, they'll post the question on behalf of the user on Microsoft Answers ," he continued, referring to the new umbrella moniker for Microsoft's consumer support. "It's not intended to directly answer questions, but to get people the right answers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bennett seconded that. "Every day, we're coming up with new ways to get the word back up to users," he said. "This is the first time we've been able almost to get real-time help to users. I think we're moving faster than we've ever been able to move before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aaron said he sympathizes with stymied users. "Customers are frustrated with issues that they're having, but the longer they wait, the more they get frustrated," he said. "Today, we're light years faster than with we were when Vista launched. But we need to respond faster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft still offers support via phone, e-mail and real-time chat, Brownell pointed out, even as she urged users to hit the Web first. "We've got some work to do, but I'm pleased with the plumbing we've built into Windows 7. We've come a long way, and we're only going to get better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft's support changes haven't mollified users who have run into problems -- sometimes very serious ones -- with Windows 7 in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has yet to come up with a solution for all the users whose PCs have fallen into an endless reboot loop after they've tried to upgrade from Vista to Windows 7, for example. On the growing Answers thread dedicated to the topic, some users who have tried the steps support engineers have offered still have not regained control of their machines or have been able to access their documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Followed steps and nothing. After reboot, nothing has changed. Still in the loop," said a user identified as "tmanpikos."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others have given up. "I have had enough. I have now given up and have gone back to XP, which still works fine but is getting a little old," said "daeld" on the same thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, a solution, assuming one is found, will be posted to the Answers forum. "Microsoft is continuing to investigate this issue," a spokeswoman said today in an e-mail. "We will post information on the existing thread as it becomes available."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks featured in this
week`s analysis include Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP), Kao (OTC:
KCRPY), Revlon (NYSE: REV) and Helen of Troy (Nasdaq: HELE) 

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by Dirk van Dijk, CFA. 

This week: Staples Turn to Shine

The Consumer Staples sector has the second-best sector rank and the second-best
revisions ratio for this year, following only the small and incoherent
Conglomerates sector. (Incoherent by their very nature of being conglomerates). 

This is largely due to Consumer Staples consistently surprising on the upside in
the third-quarter earnings season so far. Among the S 500 firms in the sector,
there have been 16 positive surprises and only 1 disappointment through last
Friday`s close. 

Not only that, but the sector is actually producing honest to goodness earnings
growth. Nothing dramatic mind you, but these companies are seeing positive
year-over-year comparisons in distinct contrast to most of the economy. Among
the S 500 firms, 12 have reported higher earnings than a year ago, while only
5 are lower. Most of the gains, however, have come from better-than-expected
margin as there have actually been more disappointments on the top line (7 to 9)
than positive surprises. Plus, the majority (5 to 12) have reported lower sales
than last year. 

While this has been a very successful earnings season for almost all areas of
the market, the Staples sector is among the best. For the S 500 excluding the
Staples, the ratio of positive earnings surprises to disappointments is 5.56:1,
which is very strong, but it trails well behind the 16:1 ratio in the Staples
sector. Actual earnings growth has been hard to come by outside the Staples
sector with a positive growth to negative growth ratio of 0.59, far below the
Staples 2.40:1 ratio. (Medical is an exception and has also done well.) 

Among the 206 industry groups we rank, the four groups from the Consumer Staples
sector are in the top 15. The two most important of these are soft drinks, where
all the major players like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) are
Zacks #2 Rank ("buy") stocks and none of the 17 firms in the industry have ranks
worse than a 3. The firms that are Zacks #3 Rank ("hold") are for the most part
bottling companies located abroad. 

The Cosmetics Industry is also looking good with only one firm with a Zacks Rank
worse than 3 and that is a Japanese firm (Kao (OTC: KCRPY)). Revlon (NYSE: REV)
and Helen of Troy (Nasdaq: HELE) are standouts with number 1 rankings. 

These steady eddie companies have by and large underperformed in the massive
stock market rally since March, and look relatively inexpensive. Given there
strong estimate momentum they are worth taking a second look at as possible
additions to your portfolio. If the economic recovery were to falter, they would
be a good place to hide as well.

&lt;p&gt;  LONGMONT, CO, Oct 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
DigitalGlobe (NYSE: DGI), a leading global provider of commercial
high-resolution world-imagery products and services for defense and
intelligence, civil government, and commercial customers, today announced
it has signed an agreement with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) to launch
the Clear30 program, an initiative to distribute high-resolution, 30-cm
aerial imagery of contiguous landscapes, initially in the U.S. and
Western Europe. These orthophoto mosaics will be available through Bing
Maps and through DigitalGlobe channels.

    The Clear30 initiative is a new agreement that expands the current
relationship between Microsoft and DigitalGlobe and reflects a commitment
to increase accessibility and use of high-resolution digital imagery. To
collect the first ever multicontinental aerial imagery from 30 cm, the
companies will use the UltraCamG, a large format digital aerial camera
manufactured by Vexcel Imaging GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Microsoft, which is based on Vexcel's UltraCam large format camera
systems, the top selling large format aerial sensors internationally.

    "We're excited about the launch of the Clear30 program and our continued
relationship with DigitalGlobe," said Steve Stanzel, general manager of
Bing Maps at Microsoft Corp. "By providing DigitalGlobe exclusive access
to our advanced UltraCamG imagery, we can provide our mutual customers
easy access and integration of high-resolution digital aerial orthophotos
for vast landscapes around the world."

    "We are very pleased to be expanding our relationship with Microsoft and
look forward to introducing the UltraCamG imagery into our world imagery
solutions," said Jill Smith, chairman and chief executive officer of
DigitalGlobe. "The addition of large quantities of very high-resolution
digital aerial imagery, collected quickly and published on a consistent
update schedule, will further enhance our ability to distribute a
comprehensive digitized globe to our customers."

    The companies did not provide financial details concerning the agreement.

    Imagery from the UltraCamG will further expand DigitalGlobe's industry
leading ImageLibrary and will complement the satellite imagery products
available from the DigitalGlobe high-resolution satellite constellation,
including the recently launched WorldView-2 satellite. Current collection
areas for the UltraCamG program include the contiguous United States and
Western Europe.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Oct 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
on Thursday that it expects spending in 2009 to be about $26
billion, flat with 2008, but $3 billion lower than the
company's initial forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In March, the company told analysts that it expected to
spend about $29 billion this year, at the upper end of its
five-year annual spending target of $25 billion to $30 billion
per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expected gap is due in part to about $600 million in
cost savings and the pace of government approvals for some
projects, a company executive said on a conference call with
analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spent $19 billion through the first three quarters of
this year to develop energy supplies, it said.

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA--(Business Wire)--
Organized by Pharma IQ, a division of IQPC, the Clinical Trials Logistics
conference will be held December 7-9, 2009, at the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia,
PA (www.clinicaltrialslogistics.com). 

In today`s drug development climate, clinical supply professionals face unique
risk mitigation issues including complying with regulations, evaluating
cost-effective distribution processes, shipping between research labs or
hospitals and international shipping. 

"Clinical supply is consistently getting more complex," says Steve Jacobs,
President of Global BioPharm Solutionsand former President of Bilcare Global
Clinical Supplies, and a featured speaker at the Clinical Trials Logistics
conference. "As we do more and more global studies, it`s really important to
learn from what others have done right and wrong." 

The Clinical Trial Logistics conference showcases best practices from clinical
logistic experts for streamlining logistics and overcoming inefficiencies,
including:

* Optimizing Clinical Supply Chains: Creating efficiencies and developing
successful vendor relationships 
* Effective Clinical Logistics Risk Mitigation Strategies: Due diligence in
emerging markets and considerations between internal vs. external manufacturing 
* Storage, Packaging and Transport Solutions for Accelerating Clinical
Logistics: Efficient, on-time shipments and effectively addressing challenges 
* Investigating the Global Clinical Trials Regulatory Landscape: Complying with
US standards and customs issues for import/export procedures

Steve recently spoke with IQPC on their Blog Talk Radio Show and commented on
the importance of understanding regulations and logistics challenges in each
country, specifically emerging countries. "If you actually take a look at just
the regulatory requirements, they are taking in the vicinity of 44 weeks from
the time you start putting together the regulatory documents to the time you can
actually ship clinical supplies into the country." 

Steve will present a session titled How to Avoid Common Mistakes and Pitfalls
for Clinical Trial Logistics Challenges in Emerging Countries on Wednesday,
December 4, 2009. 

Other speakers at the Clinical Trials Logistics conference include the Food &amp;
Drug Administration, Department of Homeland Security, Sanofi-Aventis, Pfizer,
AstraZeneca, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, Human Genome Sciences, Schering Plough.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Thursday said its quarterly profit fell 68 percent, missing Wall Street estimates, as the global recession bit into fuel demand and crude oil prices fell from year-ago levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts attributed the earnings miss to weaker-than-expected results from Exxon's exploration and production arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The production was about 4 percent below what we were modeling and that resulted in lower earnings" Pavel Molchanov, energy analyst with Raymond James, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, and others have seen profits hit as ongoing weakness in world economies hurt demand for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles are high, and both crude oil and natural gas prices declined sharply from year-ago levels in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas company's profit in the quarter was $4.73 billion, or 98 cents per share, compared with $14.83 billion, or $2.85 per diluted share, in the same quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.03 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has so far this year spent $19 billion on projects aimed at boosting oil and natural gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are well-positioned for continued production growth with projects such as QatarGas, RasGas and Gorgon LNG which will contribute additional long-plateau production for decades and provide Exxon Mobil with a strong foundation," Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas output in the quarter rose 3 percent, helped by the start-up of several major liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings from the company's exploration and production arm fell 63 percent to $4 billion. Exxon's quarterly refining earnings skidded 89 percent to $325 million, hurt by weak margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell to $82.26 billion from $137.7 billion a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's shares fell 2.3 percent, or $1.66, to $72.18 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Driver in Houston, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

Wall Street estimates, as the global recession bit into fuel
demand and crude oil prices fell from year-ago levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts attributed the earnings miss to
weaker-than-expected results from Exxon's exploration and
production arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The production was about 4 percent below what we were
modeling and that resulted in lower earnings" Pavel Molchanov,
energy analyst with Raymond James, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, and
others have seen profits hit as ongoing weakness in world
economies hurt demand for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stockpiles are high, and both crude oil and natural gas
prices declined sharply from year-ago levels in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Irving, Texas company's profit in the quarter was $4.73
billion, or 98 cents per share, compared with $14.83 billion,
or $2.85 per diluted share, in the same quarter a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.03 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has so far this year spent $19 billion on projects
aimed at boosting oil and natural gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are well-positioned for continued production growth
with projects such as QatarGas, RasGas and Gorgon LNG which
will contribute additional long-plateau production for decades
and provide Exxon Mobil with a strong foundation," Rex
Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil and gas output in the quarter rose 3 percent, helped by
the start-up of several major liquefied natural gas projects in
Qatar, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings from the company's exploration and production arm
fell 63 percent to $4 billion. Exxon's quarterly refining
earnings skidded 89 percent to $325 million, hurt by weak
margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue fell to $82.26 billion from $137.7 billion a year
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's shares fell 2.3 percent, or $1.66, to $72.18 in
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED: 

"Despite ongoing global economic weakness and reduced demand for products, we
continued our robust investment program and delivered strong results.

"Our third quarter earnings, excluding special items, were $4.7 billion. While
continuing to be impacted by lower commodity prices and weak product margins, we
maintained our focus on operational excellence and invested $19 billion through
the first three quarters of the year to develop new energy supplies.

"Oil-equivalent production increased by 3% over the third quarter of 2008 with
contributions from major start-ups of world-class assets including Qatargas 2,
Train 5 and Ras Laffan 3, Train 6 in Qatar.

"We are well-positioned for continued production growth with projects such as
QatarGas, RasGas and Gorgon LNG which will contribute additional long plateau
production for decades and provide ExxonMobil with a strong foundation.

"ExxonMobil`s industry leading financial strength has allowed us to continue to
invest across the economic cycle focusing on world class opportunities.

"Our commitment to a disciplined and long term focused investment strategy sets
ExxonMobil apart from its competitors.

"In addition to funding our capital and operating programs, we distributed $2.0
billion in dividends and purchased $4.0 billion of ExxonMobil common stock to
reduce shares outstanding during the third quarter."

THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

* Earnings excluding special items were $4,730 million, a decrease of 65% or
$8,650 million from the third quarter of 2008. 
* Earnings per share excluding special items were $0.98, a decrease of 62%. 
* Earnings were down 68% from the third quarter of 2008 which included a special
gain of $1,620 million from the sale of a natural gas transportation business in
Germany and a special charge of $170 million related to the Valdez punitive
damages award. Earnings for the third quarter of 2009 did not include any
special items. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were $6.5 billion, down 5% from the third
quarter of 2008, reflecting the impacts of a stronger U.S. dollar. 
* Oil-equivalent production increased nearly 3% from the third quarter of 2008.
Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production was up about 5%. 
* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately $9.0 billion,
including asset sales of $0.2 billion. 
* Share purchases of $4.0 billion reduced shares outstanding by 1.2%. 
* Two major liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities in Qatar - Qatargas 2, Train
5 and Ras Laffan 3, Train 6 - commenced production. With annual production
capacity of 7.8 million tons each, both trains join Qatargas 2, Train 4 as the
largest operating LNG production facilities in the world. 
* Participants in the Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project approved a
development plan that will include three LNG processing trains with a capacity
of 5 million tons per year each. The development decision followed execution of
LNG sales and purchase agreements with PetroChina International Company Limited
and Petronet LNG Limited of India for ExxonMobil`s equity share of LNG in the
project. 
* Fujian Refining and Petrochemical Company Limited announced the startup of new
chemical units - including an ethylene steam cracker, a polyethylene unit, a
polypropylene unit and aromatics facilities - in its new fully integrated
refining and petrochemical complex in Fujian Province, China. 
* ExxonMobil announced an alliance with leading biotech company, Synthetic
Genomics Inc., to research and develop next generation biofuels from
photosynthetic algae. If research and development milestones are met, ExxonMobil
expects to spend more than $600 million under the program.

Third Quarter 2009 vs. Third Quarter 2008

Upstream earnings, excluding special items, were $4,012 million down $5,339
million from the third quarter of 2008. Lower crude oil and natural gas
realizations accounted for the majority of the decline, reducing earnings
approximately $4.9 billion while higher operating costs reduced earnings
approximately $300 million. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased nearly 3% from the third
quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota
effects and divestments, production was up about 5%. 

Liquids production totaled 2,335 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), up 45 kbd
from the third quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes,
OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was up over 5%, as
increased production from projects in the United States and Kazakhstan was
partly offset by field decline. 

Third quarter natural gas production was 8,129 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per
day), up 309 mcfd from 2008. New production volumes from project additions in
Qatar and the United States were partly offset by maintenance in Europe. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $709 million, $1,170 million lower
than the third quarter of 2008. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings, excluding special
items, were $3,303 million, down $4,169 million from last year. 

Downstream earnings of $325 million were down $2,688 million from the third
quarter of 2008. Lower refining margins drove the decline, reducing earnings
$2.6 billion. Petroleum product sales of 6,301 kbd were 387 kbd lower than last
year's third quarter, mainly reflecting asset sales and lower demand. 

The U.S. Downstream recorded a loss of $203 million, down $1,181 million from
the third quarter of 2008. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $528 million were
$1,507 million lower than last year. 

Chemical earnings of $876 million were $211 million lower than the third quarter
of 2008. Weaker margins drove the decline, reducing earnings $170 million. Third
quarter prime product sales of 6,356 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 296 kt
higher than the prior year primarily due to the absence of last year`s hurricane
impacts. 

Corporate and financing expenses excluding special items were $483 million, up
$412 million due mainly to lower interest income. 

During the third quarter of 2009, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 61 million
shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $4.2 billion.
These purchases included $4.0 billion to reduce the number of shares
outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with
the company's benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from
4,806 million at the end of the second quarter to 4,747 million at the end of
the third quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently
anticipated to equal $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. Purchases may
be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be
increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 

First Nine Months 2009 vs. First Nine Months 2008

Earnings of $13,230 million ($2.71 per share) decreased $24,170 million from
2008. Excluding special items, earnings for the first nine months of 2009 were
$13,370 million, a decrease of $22,870 million from 2008. 

FIRST NINE MONTHS HIGHLIGHTS

* Earnings excluding special items were $13,370 million, down 63%. 
* Earnings per share excluding special items decreased 60% to $2.74, reflecting
lower earnings and the continued reduction in the number of shares outstanding. 
* Earnings were down 65% from 2008. Earnings for 2009 included a special charge
of $140 million for interest related to the Valdez punitive damages award.
Earnings for 2008 included a special gain of $1,620 million from the sale of a
natural gas transportation business in Germany and special charges of $460
million related to the Valdez punitive damages award. 
* Oil equivalent production remained essentially flat with the same period in
2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production was up 1%. 
* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately $21.0 billion,
including $1.1 billion from asset sales. 
* The Corporation distributed a total of $22.0 billion to shareholders in the
first nine months of 2009 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares
outstanding. 
* Dividends per share of $1.24 increased 8%. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were $18.8 billion, down 3% versus 2008
due to the stronger U.S. dollar.

Upstream earnings, excluding special items, were $11,327 million, down $16,821
million from 2008. Lower crude oil and natural gas realizations decreased
earnings approximately $15.8 billion while higher operating costs reduced
earnings about $1.0 billion. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production was essentially flat compared to the same
period in 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects
and divestments, production was up 1%. 

Liquids production of 2,385 kbd remained flat with 2008. Excluding the impacts
of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production
was up over 2%, as new volumes from project additions in west Africa and the
United States, and lower maintenance activity, were partly offset by field
decline. 

Natural gas production of 8,778 mcfd decreased 64 mcfd from 2008. Higher volumes
from Qatar were more than offset by field decline. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2009 were $1,882 million, a decrease
of $3,662 million. Earnings outside the U.S. excluding special items were $9,445
million, down $13,159 million. 

Downstream earnings of $1,970 million were $3,767 million lower than 2008.
Weaker margins decreased earnings approximately $2.8 billion. Lower volumes and
refinery optimization due to weaker demand reduced earnings about $500 million
while higher operating costs resulted in a $300 million decline in earnings.
Petroleum product sales of 6,407 kbd decreased from 6,761 kbd in 2008, mainly
reflecting asset sales and lower demand. 

U.S. Downstream earnings were $134 million, down $1,535 million. Non-U.S.
Downstream earnings were $1,836 million, $2,232 million lower than last year. 

Chemical earnings of $1,593 million decreased $1,209 million from 2008. Weaker
margins reduced earnings by approximately $500 million while lower volumes
reduced earnings about $400 million. Unfavorable foreign exchange effects
decreased earnings by $200 million. Prime product sales of 18,150 kt were down
1,206 kt from 2008. 

Corporate and financing expenses excluding special items were $1,520 million, up
$1,073 million mainly due to lower interest income. 

Gross share purchases through the first nine months of 2009 were $17.3 billion,
reducing shares outstanding by 4.6%. 

Estimates of key financial and operating data follow. 

ExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters on a
webcast at 10 a.m. Central time on October 29, 2009.To listen to the event live

Cautionary statement

Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections, events or
conditions are forward-looking statements.Actual results, including project
plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes
in long-term oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry; completion of repair projects as planned; unforeseen
technical difficulties; political events or disturbances; reservoir performance;
the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of terrorism or sabotage;
changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under
the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" on our website and in Item 1A of
ExxonMobil's 2008 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of
any future date. References to quantities of oil or natural gas may include
amounts that we believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet
classified as "proved reserves" under SEC definitions.

Frequently used terms

Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings
excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items.Both are
non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of
base business performance across periods.Reconciliation to net income
attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.The release also includes
cash flow from operations and asset sales.Because of the regular nature of our
asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors
to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities
when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing
activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is
shown in Attachment II.Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used
financial and operating measures and other terms is contained under the heading
"Frequently Used Terms" available through the Investors section of our website
at exxonmobil.com.

Accounting guidance adopted in first quarter 2009

Effective January 1, 2009, ExxonMobil adopted the authoritative guidance on
consolidation as it relates to noncontrolling interests. The guidance changed
the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which were recharacterized
as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity.The guidance
required retrospective adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements
for existing minority interests.All other requirements will be applied
prospectively. The adoption of the accounting guidance did not have a material
impact on the Corporation`s financial statements.

References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable to
ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.Unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, special items, earnings excluding special items,
Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and
earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable
to noncontrolling interests.

Effective January 1, 2009, ExxonMobil adopted the authoritative guidance for
earnings per share as it relates to determining whether instruments granted in
share-based payment transactions are participating securities.The guidance
required that all unvested share-based payment awards that contain
nonforfeitable rights to dividends should be included in the basic Earnings Per
Share (EPS) calculation. Prior-year EPS numbers have been adjusted

&lt;p&gt;  KIRKLAND, QUEBEC, Oct 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: A video and photo are included with this press release.

    Pfizer Canada is encouraging Canadians to celebrate every breath with a
soaring new online film entitled simply: Breathe.

    Now playing online at morethanmedication.ca, the short film shares a
sweeping symphony of human experiences - from the everyday to
life-altering. All punctuated by a single breath.

    The made-in-Canada film features a mix of intimate, lighthearted and
intense scenes, including: a woman appreciating fresh cut flowers; an
excited child blowing out birthday candles; a teen cannonballing into a
swimming pool... and a firefighter struggling to inhale, surrounded by a
blaze of smoke and flame. The film builds to a surprising and moving
conclusion.

    At the close of the film, a narrator says the following words as they
appear on-screen: To be truly healthy, sometimes we all need to take a
breath. Pfizer believes that to be truly healthy, it takes more than
medication. Visit morethanmedication.ca.

    Sometimes we all need to take a breath

    "Pfizer Canada recognizes that to be truly healthy, it takes more than
medication. It also takes appreciation and celebration for how powerful
small things like a single breath can be," says Ghislain Boudreau,
Vice-President of Public Affairs and Stakeholder Relations at Pfizer
Canada.

    "Breathe is a reminder to slow down and appreciate the moment," explains
Boudreau. "Stress and feeling overwhelmed are one of the most common
things Canadians tell us they battle on a daily basis. We hope that
Breathe inspires Canadians to visit morethanmedication.ca to learn more
about what they can do to manage stress and feel well."

    As with all Pfizer Canada More than Medication initiatives, Breathe never
mentions medications or products. The online film closes with an
invitation to visit morethanmedication.ca, where you will find deep
breathing exercises and much more. Morethanmedication.ca is Pfizer's
made-in-Canada health resource that's devoted to helping Canadians live
healthier lives by providing comprehensive, non-medicinal health and
wellness information.

    In addition to a variety of wellness tools, visitors can explore six
health areas that include: Eat Better, Manage Stress, Strengthen your
Mind and Body, Relate Better, Be in Charge of your Own Health Care and Be
Brave.

    Breathe was created by Pfizer Canada in collaboration with advertising
agency partner zig and interactive agency partner Klick. Media agency
partner Mediacom Canada is managing the national advertising buy.

Nutrition Education, Physical Activity, Community Involvement and Recycling


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola has chosen 20 inspiring people to be Torchbearers for the Vancouver
2010 Olympic Torch Relay. The U.S. Torchbearers were selected because they each
use their passion for positive living to affect meaningful, enduring change in
local and global communities. 

The Torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame through Calgary, Canada, on
January 18-19, 2010 as it makes its way to Vancouver and the Opening Ceremony
for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games on February 12, 2010. The Olympic Torch Relay,
presented in part by Coca-Cola, will last for 106 days, cover more than 27,000
miles (45,000 kilometers) and link together more than 1,000 communities and
places of interest throughout Canada. 

Torchbearers were selected because of their commitments to sustainably promoting
three aspects of positive living, including:

 Balanced Living - staying active and physically fit while having fun with family and friends                    
 Community - working to make good things happen for people throughout the community                              
 Recycling - helping the planet by recycling or donating time to a recycling program in the community or school

health organizations, three Coca-Cola North America employees and Olympic gold
medalists Shawn Johnson and Steven Lopez, who are part of the Coca-Cola "Six

PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR) today reported net income of $32
million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2009,
compared to zero for the third quarter of 2008. 

The net income increase reflects the refund to customers related to the Trojan
proceedings, which was recorded on September 30, 2008 and which reduced net
income by $20 million in the third quarter of 2008. Higher net income in the
third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008 was also driven by
the 2009 general rate case, an increase in the fair value of non-qualified
benefit plan assets, and lower administrative costs. Operating results continue
to reflect the sustained effects of the recession, with a 2% decrease in total
retail energy deliveries. Also, during the third quarter of 2009, PGE
experienced an increase in purchased power and fuel expense primarily driven by
extended outages at Unit 4 of Colstrip and the Boardman coal-fired generating
plants. 

"Effective management of our business is all the more critical during a period
of economic challenges. We've put special emphasis on identifying and
implementing cost efficiencies, including temporary reductions in operating
expense, while still making progress on key capital projects," said Jim Piro,
President and Chief Executive Officer. "We plan to submit a general rate case
for 2011 that is consistent with our continued focus on operational excellence
and long-term investments that create value for our customers and our
shareholders." 

Net income increased $20 million, or 30%, for the nine months ended September
30, 2009 relative to the nine months ended September 30, 2008. Net income was
$87 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30,
2009 compared to $67 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2008. Net income for the nine month periods ended September
30, 2009 and 2008 was comparable, excluding the refund recorded in the third
quarter of 2008 related to the Trojan proceedings, which reduced net income by
$20 million in 2008. 

Third Quarter Highlights

* Completed Biglow Canyon Phase II on schedule and within budget, resulting in
65 wind turbines supplying power to our service territory. Wind generation
increased 88% in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of
2008, representing 4% of the Company's total system load in the third quarter of
2009 compared to 2% in the third quarter of 2008. Biglow Canyon II will be fully
in customer prices effective January 1, 2010 utilizing the Renewable Adjustment
Clause regulatory mechanism. 
* PGE issued its draft Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) for public comment. The
IRP details PGE's proposed strategic power and transmission plans through 2020.
The draft IRP proposes to meet 2015 projected loads with emphasis on energy
efficiency, new natural gas-fired and renewable resource generation, and new
transmission capacity. It also includes a recommendation to proceed with
additional emissions controls at Boardman to allow the Company to comply with
regulatory requirements for continued operation of the plant. 
* Secured an additional $150 million in financing, expecting to issue 5.43%
Series First Mortgage Bonds in early November 2009. 
* Residential energy sales increased 5% as compared to the third quarter of
2008, but were more than offset by an 11% decrease in total industrial energy
deliveries, which includes energy deliveries to direct access customers. Total
retail energy deliveries decreased approximately 2% as compared to the third
quarter of 2008. 
* In the third quarter of 2009, PGE recorded a $5 million gain on the fair value
of non-qualified benefit plan assets, compared to a $4 million loss recorded in
the third quarter of 2008. 
* Administrative and other expense decreased by $5 million, or 10%, as compared
to the third quarter of 2008.

2009 and 2010 Earnings Guidance

PGE reaffirms 2009 earnings guidance with diluted net income per share ranging
from $1.35 to $1.45 for 2009. 

The Company initiates 2010 earnings guidance with diluted net income per share
ranging from $1.50 to $1.65 for 2010. The 2010 expectation is based on the
following:

* Load growth of 0% to 2% in 2010 over weather adjusted 2009, reflecting the
expected continued uncertainty in the industrial sector and impact from a slow
economic recovery; 
* Escalating operating and maintenance costs due to higher healthcare costs,
salary escalations, higher compliance costs and other administrative costs; and 
* Temporary reductions in operating costs to partially offset escalating
expenses and economic pressure on load growth.

Liquidity

PGE has revolving credit facilities providing an aggregate borrowing capacity of
$525 million. As of September 30, 2009, the aggregate borrowing capacity
available under the credit facilities was $335 million. 

PGE posts or receives collateral (in the form of cash or letters of credit)
pursuant to its power and natural gas purchase contracts. As of September 30,
2009, PGE had posted collateral of $256 million. Provided market prices do not
change from September 30, 2009, the Company expects approximately 35% of the
margin deposits to roll-off in the fourth quarter of 2009, and approximately 47%
to roll-off in 2010. 

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures in 2009 are estimated to be $732 million, primarily related
to Biglow Canyon Phases II ($230 million) and III ($175 million), the smart
meter project ($60 million) and continuing expenditures for production,
transmission and distribution ($235 million). The Company estimates capital
expenditures to be $545 million in 2010, the majority of which relate to Biglow
Canyon Phase III ($200 million), the smart meter project ($60 million) and
continuing expenditures for production, transmission and distribution ($245
million). PGE plans on issuing approximately $250 million in debt in 2010 to
finance its capital expenditures.

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft have missed a deadline for finalizing their search and advertising deal and have now extended the deadline for an unspecified period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the companies announced in July that Microsoft's Bing search engine would power Yahoo's search results, they said that they planned to finalize the deal by Oct. 27 or use an arbitration panel to hammer out their differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Yahoo said the companies have agreed to extend the period to negotiate and execute the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the complex nature of the transaction, there remain some details to be finalized," Yahoo said in the filing. "The parties are working diligently on finalizing the agreements, have made good progress to date, and have agreed to execute the agreements as expeditiously as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filing does not provide a new deadline for finalizing the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Microsoft said it was committed to the agreement and that the companies had mutually agreed to extend the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We plan to do this as expeditiously as possible. Both companies are optimistic that we will be able to close this deal by early 2010," Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the tremendous pressure on both companies to close the deal and start implementing it, they may very well be close to finishing their negotiations despite missing the deadline, said Greg Sterling, of Sterling Market Intelligence. "To some degree time is really an important factor," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 18 months or so there has been great uncertainty surrounding Yahoo, he said. "Yahoo really suffered a huge brain drain as a result of that uncertainty and lack of focus. You really get the sense that Yahoo has been bloodied by all the contortions and lack of clarity around its strategic direction," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, on Wednesday, Yahoo executives spent the day at an analyst conference "trying to restore confidence across the board," Sterling noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is under almost equal pressure to get the deal moving, he said. While Microsoft's new search engine, Bing, has seen growth since it launched, that growth has been relatively slow and hasn't had much of an affect on market leader Google. The Yahoo deal is an important strategic move for Microsoft, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be a good sign that the companies have not said they are turning to an arbitration panel, per their initial plan, or set a new deadline. "Maybe they're close. Maybe it's a work-over-the-weekend kind of thing," Sterling said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft initially estimated it would take them two years to fully implement the deal, which also involves Yahoo providing premium search advertising services for both companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is facing an antitrust review by the U.S. Department of Justice. That review can take place even without the companies having finalized their deal because the DOJ is analyzing its broader competitive impact, which it can do based on the details the companies have already provided, Sterling said. Also, the companies were probably keen to have the DOJ begin any investigation as soon as possible so as not to further delay the deal's implementation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juniper`s Ethernet Networking Technology Now Available Within IBM`s Data Center
Networking Portfolio; OEM Agreement Extended to Include SRX Series Services
Gateways
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) today announced that Juniper has reached a
significant milestone with its Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
relationship with IBM, announced in July. IBM is now delivering to customers a
suite of Ethernet networking products manufactured by Juniper. In addition, the
two companies have extended the OEM agreement to include Juniper Networks' SRX
Series Services Gateways, providing customers with a best-in-class choice of
network offerings that can reduce costs, improve services and manage risk. 

"We are continuing to combine breakthrough technology with a world class
partnership to help customers reinvent the experience and economics of
networking," said Mark Bauhaus, executive vice president and general manager,
Service Layer Technology Business Group, Juniper Networks. "The continued
expansion of the IBM and Juniper OEM demonstrates our joint commitment to
propelling a dynamic network infrastructure that is open, scalable, simple and
secure to address the exploding scale of Internet services for personal and
business productivity." 

"IBM is focused on providing its customers with the best networking choices and
flexibility in their solutions, which is why we`re pleased to offer IBM j-type
Ethernet networking products running the Junos operating system as part of our
data center networking portfolio," said Barry Rudolph, vice president, IBM
System Storage. "The continued success of our relationship and expansion of our
OEM partnership will help us reach our shared vision of advancing the economics
of networking and the data center." 

Today`s data centers require higher performance and less complex networks as an
essential element of their evolution. While there are extreme cost pressures on
IT budgets, the demand on data centers only increases with exploding data
volumes, demand for new services, speed and security, and always-on reliability.
In addition, cloud computing will further drive the need for massive scale,
efficiency, elasticity and security from networks and data center architectures.
The IBM and Juniper relationship is further evidence of the growing importance
of the high-performance network in the progression of data centers toward cloud
computing or cloud-like infrastructures. Both companies agree a
high-performance, secure network is vital to the operations of both the data
center (enabling service production) and the global network (enabling service
delivery). 

IBM and Juniper entered into the OEM agreement in July 2009. The agreement
allows the IBM System &amp; Technology Group (STG) to brand, label and sell select
Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches as IBM j-type e-series Ethernet
switches and MX Series 3D Universal Edge Routers as IBM j-type m-series Ethernet
routers. The suite of six Ethernet networking products is now generally
available within IBM`s data center portfolio. The expanded OEM agreement adds
the SRX Series Services Gateways, which will be available in the first half of
2010. For more information on IBM and Juniper, please visit:

REX W. TILLERSON, VORSTANDSVORSITZENDER VON EXXONMOBIL, ERKL&#196;RTE: 

&#8222;Trotz anhaltender weltweiter Wirtschaftsschw&#228;che und geringerer
Produktnachfrage haben wir unser effektives Investitionsprogramm fortgef&#252;hrt und
stabile Ergebnisse erzielt.

Unsere Ertr&#228;ge im dritten Quartal ohne Einrechnung von Sonderposten betrugen 4,7
Milliarden USD. W&#228;hrend wir weiterhin von niedrigeren Rohstoffpreisen und
schwachen Produktmargen betroffen waren, konzentrierten wir uns weiterhin auf
betriebliche Spitzenleistungen und investierten im Verlauf der ersten drei
Quartale des Jahres 19 Milliarden USD in die Entwicklung neuer Energiequellen.

Die &#214;l&#228;quivalent-F&#246;rderung stieg gegen&#252;ber dem dritten Quartal 2008 durch
wichtige Inbetriebnahmen von Weltklasse-Anlagen einschlie&#223;lich Qatargas 2, Train
5 und Ras Laffan 3, Train 6 in Qatar um 3 %.

F&#252;r ein weiteres F&#246;rderungswachstum sind wir mit Projekten wie QatarGas, RasGas
und Gorgon LNG, die &#252;ber Jahrzehnte zu einer zus&#228;tzlichen langen
Plateauf&#246;rderung beitragen und ExxonMobil eine stabile Basis bieten werden, gut
positioniert.

Die branchenf&#252;hrende finanzielle St&#228;rke von ExxonMobil hat es uns erm&#246;glicht,
weiter in den gesamten &#246;konomischen Kreislauf zu investieren und uns dabei auf
Spitzengelegenheiten zu konzentrieren.

Unser Engagement f&#252;r eine disziplinierte und langfristige Investmentstrategie
unterscheidet ExxonMobil von seinen Konkurrenten.

Neben der Finanzierung unserer Kapital- und Betriebsprogramme haben wir im
dritten Quartal Dividenden in H&#246;he von 2,0 Milliarden USD ausgesch&#252;ttet und
ExxonMobil-Stammaktien im Wert von 4,0 Milliarden USD gekauft, um die Menge der
im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien zu reduzieren."

H&#214;HEPUNKTE DES DRITTEN QUARTALS

* Die Ertr&#228;ge ohne Einrechnung von Sonderposten betrugen 4.730 Millionen USD,
was einem R&#252;ckgang von 65 % bzw. 8.650 Millionen USD gegen&#252;ber dem dritten
Quartal 2008 entspricht. 
* Der Gewinn pro Aktie ohne Einrechnung von Sonderposten betrug 0,98 USD. Dies
ist ein R&#252;ckgang um 62 %. 
* Die Ertr&#228;ge gingen gegen&#252;ber dem dritten Quartal 2008, in dem ein Sondergewinn
von 1.620 Millionen USD aus dem Verkauf eines Erdgastransportunternehmens in
Deutschland und Sonderkosten in H&#246;he von 170 Millionen USD im Zusammenhang mit
dem Valdez-Bu&#223;geld enthalten war, um 68 % zur&#252;ck. Die Ertr&#228;ge des dritten
Quartals 2009 umfassten keine Sonderposten. 
* Die Kapital- und Explorationsaufwendungen betrugen 6,5 Milliarden USD, was
einem R&#252;ckgang von 5 % gegen&#252;ber dem dritten Quartal 2008 entspricht und die
Auswirkungen eines st&#228;rkeren Dollars widerspiegelt. 
* Die &#214;l&#228;quivalent-F&#246;rderung stieg gegen&#252;ber dem dritten Quartal 2008 um fast 3
%. Die Belastungen durch F&#246;rderquoten sowie die Auswirkungen der OPEC-Quoten und
Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen nicht eingerechnet, stieg die F&#246;rderleistung um etwa 5 %. 
* Der Cashflow aus Gesch&#228;ftst&#228;tigkeiten und dem Verkauf von Aktivposten lag bei
etwa 9,0 Milliarden USD, was den Verkauf von Aktivposten in H&#246;he von 0,2
Milliarden USD beinhaltete. 
* Aktienk&#228;ufe in H&#246;he von 4,0 Milliarden USD reduzierten die Menge der im Umlauf
befindlichen Aktien um 1,2 %. 
* Zwei gro&#223;e Fl&#252;ssigerdgasanlagen in Qatar - Qatargas 2, Train 5 und Ras Laffan
3, Train 6 - begannen mit der F&#246;rderung. Mit einer j&#228;hrlichen
F&#246;rderungskapazit&#228;t von jeweils 7,8 Millionen Tonnen sind die beiden
Produktionslinien zusammen mit Qatargas 2, Train 4, die gr&#246;&#223;ten in Betrieb
befindlichen Fl&#252;ssigerdgas-F&#246;rderanlagen der Welt. 
* Die Teilnehmer des Gorgon-Fl&#252;ssigerdgasprojekts stimmten einem
Entwicklungsplan zu, der drei Fl&#252;ssigerdgas-Verarbeitungslinien mit einer
Kapazit&#228;t von jeweils 5 Millionen Tonnen pro Jahr vorsieht. Die
Entwicklungsentscheidung folgte dem k&#252;rzlichen Abschluss von
Fl&#252;ssigerdgas-Kaufvertr&#228;gen mit der PetroChina International Company Limited und
Petronet LNG Limited of India &#252;ber den Anteil von ExxonMobil am Fl&#252;ssigerdgas im
Rahmen des Projekts. 
* Die Fujian Refining and Petrochemical Company Limited k&#252;ndigte die
Inbetriebnahme neuer chemischer Anlagen - darunter eines Ethylen-Steamcrackers,
einer Poly&#228;thylen-Anlage, einer Polypropylen-Anlage und Anlagen f&#252;r aromatische
Kohlenwasserstoffe - in ihrem neuen, vollst&#228;ndig integrierten Raffinerie- und
Petrochemiekomplex in der Provinz Fujian in China an. 
* Exxon Mobil gab eine Allianz mit dem f&#252;hrenden biotechnologischen Unternehmen
Synthetic Genomics Inc. zur Erforschung und Entwicklung von Biokraftstoffen der
n&#228;chsten Generation aus photosynthetischen Algen bekannt. Sofern die Forschungs-
und Entwicklungsmeilensteine erreicht werden, rechnet ExxonMobil im Rahmen des
Programms mit Ausgaben von mehr als 600 Millionen USD.

Das dritte Quartal 2009 im Vergleich zum dritten Quartal 2008

Die Upstream-Ertr&#228;ge ohne Einrechnung von Sonderposten betrugen 4.012 Millionen
USD, was einem R&#252;ckgang von 5.339 Millionen USD gegen&#252;ber dem dritten Quartal
2008 entspricht. Geringere Roh&#246;l- und Erdgasverk&#228;ufe machten den Gro&#223;teil des
R&#252;ckgangs aus und senkten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa 4,9 Milliarden USD, w&#228;hrend h&#246;here
Betriebskosten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa 300 Millionen USD senkten. 

Auf &#214;l&#228;quivalent-Basis stieg die F&#246;rderung um fast 3 % gegen&#252;ber dem dritten
Quartal 2008. Die Belastungen durch F&#246;rderquoten sowie die Auswirkungen der
OPEC-Quoten und Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen nicht eingerechnet, stieg die F&#246;rderleistung um
etwa 5 %. 

Die Liquid-Produktion belief sich auf insgesamt 2.335 kbd (Tausend Barrel pro
Tag), was einem Anstieg von 45 kbd gegen&#252;ber dem dritten Quartal 2008
entspricht. Die Belastungen durch F&#246;rderquoten sowie die Auswirkungen der
OPEC-Quoten und Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen nicht eingerechnet, stieg die Liquid-Produktion um
mehr als 5 %, da die erh&#246;hte F&#246;rderung der Projekte in den Vereinigten Staaten
und Kasachstan teilweise durch den R&#252;ckgang auf den Feldern ausgeglichen wurde. 

Die Erdgasproduktion im dritten Quartal lag bei 8.129 mcfd (Millionen Kubikfu&#223;
pro Tag), was einem Anstieg von 309 mcfd gegen&#252;ber 2008 entspricht. Neue
F&#246;rdermengen aus neuen Projekten in Qatar und den Vereinigten Staaten wurden
teilweise durch Instandhaltungen in Europa ausgeglichen. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge aus Upstream-Arbeiten in den USA betrugen 709 Millionen USD und
lagen damit 1.170 Millionen USD unter denen des dritten Quartals von 2008. Die
Upstream-Ertr&#228;ge au&#223;erhalb der USA ohne Einrechnung von Sonderposten betrugen
3.303 Millionen USD, was einem R&#252;ckgang von 4.169 Millionen USD gegen&#252;ber dem
Vorjahr entspricht. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge im Bereich Downstream von 325 Millionen USD entsprechen einem
R&#252;ckgang von 2.688 Millionen USD gegen&#252;ber dem dritten Quartal 2008. Geringere
Raffineriemargen trugen zu dem R&#252;ckgang bei und minderten die Ertr&#228;ge um 2,6
Milliarden USD. Die Ums&#228;tze mit Erd&#246;lerzeugnissen von 6.301 kbd waren um 387 kbd
niedriger als im dritten Quartal des Vorjahres, was haupts&#228;chlich auf den
Verkauf von Aktivposten und eine geringere Nachfrage zur&#252;ckgeht. 

Der Downstream-Bereich in den USA verzeichnete Verluste in H&#246;he von 203
Millionen USD, was einem R&#252;ckgang von 1.181 Millionen USD gegen&#252;ber dem dritten
Quartal 2008 entspricht. Die Downstream-Ertr&#228;ge au&#223;erhalb der USA von 528
Millionen USD lagen 1.507 Millionen USD unter denen des Vorjahres. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge im Chemie-Bereich von 876 Millionen USD waren 211 Millionen USD
niedriger als im dritten Quartal 2008. Geringere Margen trugen zu dem R&#252;ckgang
bei und minderten die Ertr&#228;ge um 170 Millionen USD. Der Verkauf der
Premium-Produkte im dritten Quartal von 6.356 kt (Kilotonnen) war prim&#228;r
aufgrund der im Gegensatz zum letzten Jahr fehlenden Hurrikan-Auswirkungen um
296 kt h&#246;her als im Vorjahr. 

Die Konzern- und Finanzierungsaufwendungen ohne Einrechnung von Sonderposten
lagen bei 483 Millionen USD, was einem Anstieg von 412 Millionen USD
haupts&#228;chlich aufgrund geringerer Zinsertr&#228;ge entsprach. 

W&#228;hrend des dritten Quartals 2009 erwarb die Exxon Mobil Corporation 61
Millionen ihrer Stammaktien f&#252;r den Eigenbestand zu einem Bruttogesamtpreis von
4,2 Milliarden USD. Diese K&#228;ufe beinhalteten 4,0 Milliarden USD zur Reduzierung
der Zahl der im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien, wobei die Differenz davon zum
Ausgleich von Aktien verwendet wurde, die im Zusammenhang mit den
Unternehmungsleistungspl&#228;nen und -programmen ausgegeben wurden. Die Zahl der im
Umlauf befindlichen Aktien wurde von 4.806 Millionen am Ende des zweiten
Quartals auf 4.747 Millionen am Ende des dritten Quartals reduziert. Gegenw&#228;rtig
wird erwartet, dass die Aktienk&#228;ufe zur Reduzierung der Zahl der im Umlauf
befindlichen Aktien im vierten Quartal 2009 bei einem Gegenwert von 2,0
Milliarden USD liegen werden. Die K&#228;ufe k&#246;nnen sowohl auf dem freien Markt als
auch durch ausgehandelte Transaktionen erfolgen und k&#246;nnen jederzeit ohne
Ank&#252;ndigung erh&#246;ht, gemindert oder im Wert herabgesetzt werden. 

Die ersten neun Monate von 2009 im Vergleich zu den ersten neun Monaten von 2008

Die Ertr&#228;ge von 13.230 Millionen USD (2,71 USD pro Aktie) sanken gegen&#252;ber 2008
um 24.170 Millionen USD. Ohne Einrechnung von Sonderposten betrugen die Ertr&#228;ge
der ersten neun Monate 2009 13.370 Millionen USD, was einem R&#252;ckgang von 22.870
Millionen USD gegen&#252;ber 2008 entspricht. 

H&#214;HEPUNKTE DER ERSTEN NEUN MONATE

* Die Ertr&#228;ge ohne Sonderposten beliefen sich auf 13.370 Millionen USD, was
einem R&#252;ckgang von 63 % entspricht. 
* Der Gewinn pro Aktie ohne Sonderposten ging um 60 % auf 2,74 USD zur&#252;ck und
spiegelte so die geringeren Ertr&#228;ge und die fortschreitende Reduzierung der Zahl
der im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien wider. 
* Die Ertr&#228;ge sanken gegen&#252;ber 2008 um 65 %. Die Ertr&#228;ge von 2009 umfassten
Sonderkosten in H&#246;he von 140 Millionen USD f&#252;r Zinsen im Zusammenhang mit dem
Valdez-Bu&#223;geld. Die Ertr&#228;ge von 2008 enthielten einen Sondergewinn von 1.620
Millionen USD aus dem Verkauf eines Erdgastransportunternehmens in Deutschland
und Sonderkosten in H&#246;he von 460 Millionen USD im Zusammenhang mit dem
Valdez-Bu&#223;geld. 
* Die &#214;l&#228;quivalent-F&#246;rderung blieb gegen&#252;ber dem Vergleichszeitraum von 2008 im
Wesentlichen unver&#228;ndert. Die Belastungen durch F&#246;rderquoten sowie die
Auswirkungen der OPEC-Quoten und Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen nicht eingerechnet, stieg die
F&#246;rderleistung um 1 %. 
* Der Cashflow aus Gesch&#228;ftst&#228;tigkeiten und dem Verkauf von Aktivposten lag bei
etwa 21,0 Milliarden USD, was den Verkauf von Aktivposten in H&#246;he von 1,1
Milliarden USD beinhaltete. 
* Der Konzern sch&#252;ttete in den ersten neun Monaten des Jahres 2009 &#252;ber
Dividenden und Aktienk&#228;ufe zur Reduzierung der im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien
insgesamt 22,0 Milliarden USD an die Aktion&#228;re aus. 
* Die Dividende pro Aktie von 1,24 USD stieg um 8 %. 
* Die Kapital- und Explorationsaufwendungen betrugen 18,8 Milliarden USD, was
aufgrund des st&#228;rkeren US-Dollars einem R&#252;ckgang von 3 % gegen&#252;ber 2008
entspricht.

Die Upstream-Ertr&#228;ge ohne Einrechnung von Sonderposten betrugen 11.327 Millionen
USD, was einem R&#252;ckgang von 16.821 Millionen USD gegen&#252;ber 2008 entspricht.
Geringere Roh&#246;l- und Erdgasverk&#228;ufe setzten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa 15,8 Milliarden
USD herab, w&#228;hrend h&#246;here Betriebskosten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa 1,0 Milliarden USD
minderten. 

Auf &#214;l&#228;quivalent-Basis blieb die F&#246;rderung gegen&#252;ber dem Vergleichszeitraum von
2008 im Wesentlichen gleich. Die Belastungen durch F&#246;rderquoten sowie die
Auswirkungen der OPEC-Quoten und Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen nicht eingerechnet, stieg die
F&#246;rderleistung um 1 %. 

Die Liquid-Produktion von 2.385 kbd blieb gegen&#252;ber 2008 unver&#228;ndert. Die
Belastungen durch F&#246;rderquoten sowie die Auswirkungen der OPEC-Quoten und
Ver&#228;u&#223;erungen nicht eingerechnet, stieg die Liquid-Produktion um etwa 2%, da
neue Volumina aus neuen Projekten in Westafrika und den Vereinigten Staaten
sowie geringere Instandhaltungsaktivit&#228;ten teilweise durch den R&#252;ckgang auf den
Feldern ausgeglichen wurden. 

Die Erdgasproduktion von 8.778 mcfd sank gegen&#252;ber 2008 um 64 mcfd. H&#246;here
Volumina aus Qatar wurden durch den R&#252;ckgang auf den Feldern mehr als
ausgeglichen. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge aus Upstream-Arbeiten in den USA betrugen im Jahr 2009 1.882
Millionen USD, was einem R&#252;ckgang von 3.662 Millionen USD entspricht. Die
Ertr&#228;ge au&#223;erhalb der USA ohne Einrechnung von Sonderposten betrugen 9.445
Millionen USD, was einem R&#252;ckgang von 13.159 Millionen USD entspricht. 

Die Downstream-Ertr&#228;ge von 1.970 Millionen USD waren um 3.767 Millionen USD
niedriger als im Jahr 2008. Kleinere Margen senkten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa 2,8
Milliarden USD. Geringere Volumina und Raffinerieoptimierung aufgrund
schw&#228;cherer Nachfrage reduzierten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa 500 Millionen USD, w&#228;hrend
h&#246;here Betriebskosten zu einem R&#252;ckgang der Ertr&#228;ge um 300 Millionen USD
f&#252;hrten. Die Ums&#228;tze mit Erd&#246;lerzeugnissen von 6.407 kbd sanken von 6.761 kbd im
Jahr 2008, was haupts&#228;chlich auf den Verkauf von Aktivposten und eine geringere
Nachfrage zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren ist. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge im Downstream-Bereich in den USA betrugen 134 Millionen USD und
waren damit 1.535 Millionen USD niedriger. Die Downstream-Ertr&#228;ge au&#223;erhalb der
USA betrugen 1.836 Millionen USD und lagen damit 2.232 Millionen USD unter denen
des letzten Jahres. 

Die Ertr&#228;ge im Chemie-Bereich von 1,593 Millionen USD waren 1,209 Millionen USD
niedriger als 2008. Kleinere Margen reduzierten die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa 500
Millionen USD, w&#228;hrend kleinere Volumina die Ertr&#228;ge um etwa 400 Millionen USD
schrumpfen lie&#223;en. Ung&#252;nstige Wechselkursauswirkungen minderten die Ertr&#228;ge um
200 Millionen USD. Die Verk&#228;ufe der Premium-Produkte von 18.150 kt sanken
gegen&#252;ber 2008 um 1.206 kt. 

Die Konzern- und Finanzierungsaufwendungen ohne Einrechnung von Sonderposten
lagen bei 1.520 Millionen USD, was einem Anstieg von 1.073 Millionen USD

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is spiking its Office Accounting software family and will stop distributing the products as of Nov. 16, according to a posting on the company's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The product had outlived its usefulness, according to an FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continually evaluate our business strategies to make sure we're working to meet the needs of customers, partners and shareholders. With that in mind, we have determined that existing free templates within Office used with Excel was a better option for small businesses, and the Microsoft Dynamics ERP products were appropriate for mid-range organizations," it states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Accounting users will continue to receive support under the original terms, which provide five years of mainstream support and five years of extended support following the product's release. Specific retirement dates are listed on Microsoft's Web site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, certain online services, such as eBay and Equifax tie-ins, will be no more as of Dec. 15. Customers who bought the software very recently have a potential out, as they can return the software within 30 days of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's announcement didn't cite flagging sales as contributing to its decision. But the company has long struggled to compete against rival Intuit's products, which include the popular Quicken accounting application. Earlier this year, Microsoft announced it would stop selling its Money personal-finance software. &lt;/p&gt;

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Moody`s (NYSE: MCO), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), Fannie Mae (NYSE: FNM), Freddie

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

GDP Notes - In Depth

With massive amounts of space sitting idle in offices and empty strip malls
littering the landscape, look for new investment in commercial real estate to
continue to decline in coming quarters. Moody`s (NYSE: MCO) has estimated that
the value of commercial real estate has plunged by 41% since the peak a little
over a year ago, and that is hardly an inducement to build more. If a business
needs the space, it's far cheaper to just buy some that already exists. 

Spending on Equipment and Software (E), on the other hand, is starting to come
back, if only feebly -- rising 1.1% after a 4.9% decline in the 2Q and a 36.4%
plunge in the 1Q. Look for some stability in this line going forward as the new
Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) operating system will probably generate a new PC cycle,
but with capacity utilization still around 70% I would not expect a boom in
orders for new factory equipment. 

The real star of Fixed investment, though, came on the residential side, which
rose 23.4%. This is the first increase in almost four years, and follows
declines of 23.3% in the 2Q and 38.2% in the 1Q. The long string of declines had
brought residential investment to a record low share of GDP. The extraordinary
support of the housing sector by the government, including the first-time buyer
tax credit -- the Fed buying up $1.25 Trillion of Fannie Mae (NYSE: FNM) and
Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE)-backed paper to artificially suppress mortgage rates,
and the FHA acting like the old New Century Financial or Washington Mutual on
their worst days -- have played a big role in the turnaround. I seriously
question the sustainability of it after the support is removed, and I don`t
think the support can continue indefinitely. 

Exxon Misses, Production Up

ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) reported third quarter 2009 earnings of 98
cents per share, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 and year-earlier
earnings of $2.58. 

Though the earnings came in below expectations, the company maintained its
quarterly dividend of 42 cents per share and repurchased $4 billion worth of XOM
common stock. With a sound cash position, solid credit profile and diversity of
its asset base, both in terms of business mix as well as geographical footprint,
Exxon remains better positioned than any of its peers. 

The steep fall in oil prices and weak product margins caused a 65% drop in
earnings from the year-earlier quarter to $4.7 billion. The production of oil
and natural gas averaged 3.69 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up
approximately 3% year over year. When adjusted for the impact of entitlement
volumes and OPEC quota restrictions, production was up about 5%. Its refinery
throughput averaged at 5.35 million barrels per day, flat from the year-earlier
level.

N37B Ruggedized Handheld Computing Device Nearing Certification for Major
Telecom Company; Company Targets Ingram Micro as First Major Sales Channel
Partner
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Newport Digital Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: NPDT), a technology solutions driven
company focused on rapidly emerging businesses in the wireless technology space,
announced today that it has implemented the licensing agreement with Microsoft
Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) to develop applications for its Windows Mobile platform.
The Company has also progressed with their distribution agreement previously
announced with Ingram Micro, Inc. (NYSE: IM), which will serve as its initial
primary sales channel partner. 

Newport Digital Technologies, Inc. (NPDT), in conjunction with leading
Taiwan-based R technology incubators, the Institute for Information Industry
(III) and the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), is
commercializing a number of leading-edge Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
technologies. The first product is the N37B Ruggedized Handheld RFID reader and
computing device that was unveiled this week at the Voluntary Interindustry
Commerce Solutions Association (VICS) conference hosted by the University of
Arkansas RFID Research Center. NPDT is a named sponsor of this research center
at the Sam Walton College of Business. The N37B will also offer two more
complementary integrated options that include 3G connection module and location
and navigation-based GPS. The 3G option will enable the handheld to have data
connectivity anywhere a cellular connection is available, making for a "connect
anywhere" scenario for RFID business applications. The GPS option will allow for
the N37B to not only collect RFID data from item level inventory but to pinpoint
and report the location of the inventory scanned by the RFID reader. This
greatly enhances and expands the applications that can be offered from
Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). 

"We are thrilled to be approaching final certification of this RFID reader for
use on a major telecom`s wireless network," said NPDT CEO Gary DeMel. "We are
also excited by the response of the RFID industry at the VICS conference to the
total RFID solution NPDT demonstrated at the VICS conference. The N37B, which
will run on Microsoft`s Mobile Computing Platform, has wide application in RFID
market. NPDT will offer this device along with a comprehensive line of mobile
computing products and solutions targeting RFID field applications for asset
tracking, inventory management and point-of-sale for various B2B markets." 

NPDT's planned RFID product suite includes: Electronic Product Code (EPC) Global
certification laboratories, ruggedized, military/commercial-grade RFID enabled,
mobile handheld tablet computers, RFID forklifts, POS kiosks, POS Checkout, EAS
readers, USB readers and RFID tags. Utilizing the Microsoft Windows Mobile
operating system, NPDT will further extend the features and capabilities of its
products. 

"Newport Digital Technologies has developed truly innovative RFID technologies
and we are thrilled to work with them to bring these technologies and
applications to the Windows Mobile platform," said Daren Mancini, General
Manager in the Windows Mobile Sales division at Microsoft. 

"We are very excited to work with Microsoft's technology and business teams to
develop the next generation of RFID computing devices by utilizing Windows
Mobile with customized application suites," commented Gary DeMel, CEO.
"Microsoft, which provides software and hardware products and solutions
worldwide, is one of the world's premier companies and we are looking forward to
partnering with them through a successful licensing agreement. This agreement
may prove to be the springboard that launches Newport Digital into becoming a
recognized name in the wireless space. We are proud to be a company with
technology that Microsoft believes in." 

"At the VICS Conference NPDT was presented as sponsor alongside Motorola,
Impinj, Avery Dennison, and ADT; all leaders in the RFID industry today," said
NPDT CTO and COO Weiling Tsao. "The NPDT demonstration booth, in our opinion,
was by far the most elaborate, and the only one having live RFID demos. NPDT is
not interested in just selling a single device or product; our focus is to
deliver a total end-to-end RFID solution. Using the Microsoft Operating System
enables us to accommodate almost nearly all of our potential customer base. We
look forward to providing more guidance to our shareholders and clients as we
further develop our RFID solutions."

 WHAT:             The WORLD PREMIERE of Walt Disney Pictures` OLD DOGS, a film starring ROBIN WILLIAMS and JOHN TRAVOLTA as a couple of single guys who run a sports marketing firm and have their lives turned upside down when one learns that he`s a father-of twins.

 ABOUT             Two best friends-one unlucky-in-love divorc&#233; (ROBIN WILLIAMS) and the other a fun-loving bachelor (JOHN TRAVOLTA)-are unexpectedly charged with the care of 7-year-old twins while on the verge of the biggest business deal of their lives. The not-so-kid-savvy bachelors stumble in their efforts to take care of the twins (newcomers ELLA BLEU TRAVOLTA and CONNER RAYBURN), leading to one debacle after another, and perhaps to a new-found understanding of what`s really important in life.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
On Thursday, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) reported that its first-quarter
earnings fell 1%, but earnings exceeded forecasts. Furthermore, the consumer
products giant hiked projections for the year, in a sign that its efforts to
boost sales may be starting to pay off. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, PG
posted earnings of $3.31 billion, or $1.06 a share, compared with $3.35 billion,
or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. Per-share results rose as shares outstanding
fell. Earnings from continuing operations climbed to 97 cents from 96 cents.
Revenue declined 6% to $19.81 billion. 

In response to the earnings, the security saw some heavy call trading, as more
than 67,100 call contracts changed hands in the front three months of options.
This volume was more than double the stock's average daily call trading volume
of 28,523 contracts.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
This optimistic article observes that IBM (NYSE: IBM) "has been on a tear
lately, up almost 41% since [the market's] March 9 lows." However, the author
notes that Big Blue's bounce has been relatively small in comparison with the
gains collected by the Nasdaq Composite (COMP) and the S 500 Index (SPX)
during the same time frame. As a result, the stock "has some room to rise." In
fact, Barclays Capital analyst Ben Reitzes recently boosted his price target on
IBM to $140, surpassing the security's current all-time high of $138, which was
tagged back in 1999. 

As a caveat, the author notes that IBM is still struggling against weakness in
its hardware business. Despite the apparent dominance of the company's software
and services divisions, "all of IBM tends to do well when its hardware business
is on a roll." If the firm's own forecast can be believed, this critical unit
could be on the road to recovery -- CFO Mark Loughridge recently predicted that
the hardware business would enjoy double-digit profitability growth in the
fourth quarter.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) posted a 51 percent drop in quarterly profit on Friday, becoming the latest oil major to be hit by the steep decline in oil and natural gas prices and anemic margins at refineries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the profit was better than expected, shares of the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) slid 2.4 percent, in line with a sharp drop in U.S. crude prices and the broader stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron offset part of the sharp drop in energy prices in the past year by increasing its oil output and cutting costs during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington said two-thirds of the cost-cuts were permanent and unrelated to fluctuating prices and also said Chevron expects to exceed its recently raised 2009 production target of 2.66 million barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse analysts said in a note to investors it was "the best set of results from Chevron for a long time," particularly after Exxon's disappointing results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) dashed hopes for a near-term industry turnaround, saying a limp economic recovery was weighing on energy demand and prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's third-quarter net profit fell to $3.83 billion, or $1.92 per share, from $7.89 billion, or $3.85 per share, a year before. Excluding $400 million in gains from asset sales and other items, it earned $1.72 per share, topping the $1.47 analysts had forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, revenues fell 41 percent to $46.6 billion, slightly below the $47 billion analysts had forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's earnings from oil production fell 41 percent as an increase in output helped reduce the impact from the drop in oil prices, which reached a record in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas output rose 11 percent from a year before to 2.70 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, boosted by the start-up of the Blind Faith and Tahiti fields in the Gulf of Mexico and the Agbami field in Nigeria and an expansion at Tengiz in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings from refineries fell 90 percent to $194 million, and were particularly hard-hit in the United States, where the company pulled in a modest $34 million in quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive David O'Reilly said he expects refining to remain "pretty sloppy" for the next two years as smaller players shut down capacity and demand recovers, though he is encouraged by how much stronger Asian demand now looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly also said Chevron is looking at getting involved in the quickly growing U.S. shale gas drilling business, but only under the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to be able to do it at scale to move the needle," he said in what was his last quarterly conference call with analysts and investors before handing the reins to incoming CEO John Watson at the start of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell 2.4 percent to $76.08.

the past year by increasing its oil output and cutting costs
during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington said two-thirds of
the cost-cuts were permanent and unrelated to fluctuating
prices and also said Chevron expects to exceed its recently
raised 2009 production target of 2.66 million barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse analysts said in a note to investors it was
"the best set of results from Chevron for a long time,"

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska visited the United States twice this year, his spokesman said on Friday, but declined to say if he solved a visa row with the United States which had long irked top Russian officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit comes amid a thaw in Russia-U.S. political ties and the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday Deripaska met U.S. bankers during the trip ahead of a planned share sale of his firm RUSAL, the world's top aluminum firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman for Deripaska said the magnate, once Russia's richest man and now the most indebted oligarch, went to the United States on business trips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr Deripaska did visit the United States twice this year for business meetings. Mr Deripaska has no travel restrictions to any country including the U.S.," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to comment on a report in the Wall Street Journal that Deripaska's U.S. trips came under a secret arrangement with U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, when he was allowed to meet U.S. businessmen but also met FBI investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials have not explained why Deripaska had his visa revoked in 2007 and declined to comment on media reports the FBI was probing Deripaska's business interest as part of investigations into money laundering and organized crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deripaska has not faced any charges. He has denied any wrongdoing and blamed unnamed business rivals for orchestrating a campaign against him in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. embassy in Moscow declined to comment and directed inquiries to U.S. State Department, which was not immediately available for comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deripaska, whose fortune had been estimated at over $30 billion before the financial crisis wiped out most of this wealth, has said he would never do business in the United States and even had powerful Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calling on Washington to explain its refusal to grant the visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visa was revoked at a time when Russia-U.S. political relations were at a low ebb, complicating the task of resolving Deripaska's visa issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deripaska built much of his empire during Russia's "aluminum wars" of the 1990s when he won control of some of the country's biggest smelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Moscow and Washington said they aim to reset political ties and U.S. President Barack Obama visited Moscow in July when he met Putin and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deripaska has repeatedly denied media reports that he had acquired a major stake in U.S. car maker GM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His car producer GAZ is seeking a role as an industrial partner for GM's former unit, Germany's Opel, if a Russian-Canadian consortium of Magna and Sberbank is allowed to buy Opel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deripaska is also seeking to float the shares of Rusal in an initial public offering this or next year and the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday he met top executives of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs during his U.S. trips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, Editing by Dominic Evans)&lt;/p&gt;

it continues to build up its fixed-income capability under the leadership of Bob
Michele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest hires are likely to lead to new product launches, though JPMAM
could not confirm details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Didier Lambert, Alain Defise and Michal Wozniak have all joined from Fortis
Investments FOR.BR as senior portfolio managers based in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMAM said Lambert would be responsible for identifying, implementing and
managing local market investments across client portfolios, focusing on interest
rates and foreign exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Defise will identify credit opportunities and manage corporate exposures and
Wozniak will focus on investment opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three are re-joining Pierre-Yves Bareau who left his role as chief
investment officer for emerging market debt at Fortis to take up a position as
JPMAM's head of emerging market debt earlier in the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michele has been actively building his team since he left Schroders (SDR.L)
to become global chief investment officer of fixed income at JPMAM in September
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He attracted former colleagues Lisa Coleman and Stephen Lear from Schroders
and has added several credit analysts, fund managers and traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We now have the capabilities to look at the markets globally as a whole and
allocate to the cheapest regions and sectors," Michele said in comments to
Reuters earlier this month.
 "There's a lot of demand for credit now and if you have the capability to
broaden out the credit you look at, you can raise quite a large amount of
money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that the market for talent was tightening up a bit now so the
latest hires would probably be the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Things have stabilised so asset management firms are looking to grow again
and the availability of quality people has diminished," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMAM had some $1.3 trillion in assets under management at end-September,
most of it in fixed income.

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported earnings of $3.83 billion ($1.92
per share - diluted) for the third quarter 2009, compared with $7.89 billion
($3.85 per share - diluted) in the 2008 third quarter. Earnings in the 2009
period included gains of approximately $400 million ($0.20 per share) from asset
sales and tax items. Foreign-currency effects reduced earnings in the 2009
quarter by $170 million, compared with a benefit to income of $303 million a
year earlier. 

For the first nine months of 2009, earnings were $7.41 billion ($3.71 per share
- diluted), down 61 percent from $19.04 billion ($9.23 per share - diluted) in
the first nine months of 2008. 

Sales and other operating revenues in the third quarter 2009 were $45 billion,
compared with $76 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the first nine months of
2009, sales and other operating revenues were $120 billion versus $222 billion
in the corresponding 2008 period. The decline in both comparative periods was
primarily due to lower prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products.

"Our net oil-equivalent production this quarter was nearly 11 percent higher
than the same quarter a year ago," said Chairman and CEO Dave O`Reilly. "This
operational success helped mitigate a decline in earnings that was driven by
sharply lower prices for crude oil and natural gas." 

"In our downstream operations, we continued to experience weak margins on the
sale of gasoline and other refined products. Weak demand and plentiful supply
affected all our major markets," O`Reilly added. "Our refinery reliability
remains high, and we continue to focus on the safe and efficient operation of
our network." 

O`Reilly said continued aggressive cost-management efforts companywide in the
first nine months of 2009 contributed to about a 13 percent decrease in
recurring operating, selling, general and administrative expenses from the same
period a year earlier. 

In additional comments on upstream activities, O`Reilly said the recent final
investment decision to develop the Gorgon LNG project represented a major
milestone in the company`s strategy to commercialize its significant natural gas
resource base in Australia. Additional achievements in recent months included: 

Australia

* Discoveries of natural gas in the Carnarvon Basin off the northwest coast in
the 67 percent-owned Block WA-205-P, the 50 percent-owned Block WA-365-P and the
50 percent-owned Block WA-374-P, all Chevron-operated. 
* Agreements signed with two companies to join Chevron`s planned Wheatstone LNG
project as combined 25 percent owners and suppliers of natural gas for the
project`s first two LNG trains.

* Start-up of the 31 percent-owned and operated deepwater Tombua-Landana project
in Block 14, which is expected to reach maximum total production of
approximately 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2011. 
* Discovery of crude oil and natural gas offshore in the 39 percent-owned and

Greater Vanza Longui Area.

UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 2.70 million barrels per day in the
third quarter 2009, up 259,000 from 2.44 million barrels per day in the 2008
period. The increase was driven primarily by project start-ups since last year`s
third quarter.

U.S. upstream earnings of $878 million in the third quarter 2009 were down $1.3
billion from a year earlier. The effects of sharply lower prices for crude oil
and natural gas, lower gains on asset sales and higher depreciation expense were
partially offset by the benefits of increased production and lower operating
expenses. 

The company`s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas
liquids was approximately $60 in the 2009 quarter, compared with $107 a year
ago. The average sales price of natural gas was $3.28 per thousand cubic feet,
down from $8.64 in last year`s third quarter. 

Net oil-equivalent production of 745,000 barrels per day in the third quarter
2009 was up 98,000 barrels per day, or about 15 percent, from a year earlier.
The increase in production was primarily associated with start-up of the Blind
Faith Field in late 2008 and the Tahiti Field in second quarter 2009, along with
the restoration of volumes that were offline in September 2008 due to hurricanes
in the Gulf of Mexico. The net liquids component of production was up 24 percent
to 509,000 barrels per day in the 2009 third quarter, while net natural-gas
production of 1.42 billion cubic feet per day was down about 1 percent from a
year ago.

International upstream earnings of $2.8 billion decreased $1.2 billion from the
third quarter 2008 due mainly to the impact of lower prices for crude oil and
natural gas, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes of crude oil and
about $400 million of gains from asset sales and tax items related to the Gorgon
project in Australia. Foreign-currency effects decreased earnings by $81 million
in the 2009 quarter, compared with an increase of $316 million a year earlier. 

The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in the 2009
quarter was $62 per barrel, compared with $103 a year earlier. The average price
of natural gas was $3.92 per thousand cubic feet, down from $5.37 in last year`s
third quarter. 

Net oil-equivalent production of 1.96 million barrels per day in the third
quarter 2009 was up 9 percent, or 160,000 barrels per day, from a year ago. The
increase included approximately 220,000 barrels per day associated with two
projects - Agbami in Nigeria, which commenced operations in the third quarter of
last year and expansion at Tengiz in Kazakhstan. Partially offsetting this
increase was the effect of civil unrest in Nigeria. The net liquids component of
production increased about 15 percent from a year ago to 1.38 million barrels
per day, while net natural-gas production declined about 4 percent to 3.48
billion cubic feet per day.

U.S. downstream earned $34 million in the third quarter 2009, compared with $1.0
billion a year earlier. The decline was mainly the result of significantly
weaker margins on the sale of gasoline and other refined products. Operating
expenses were lower between periods. 

Refinery crude-input of 879,000 barrels per day in the third quarter 2009
decreased 43,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period, primarily due to the
effects of a planned shutdown in this year`s third quarter at the refinery in
Richmond, California. 

Refined-product sales of 1.42 million barrels per day were essentially unchanged
from the third quarter of 2008. Branded gasoline sales increased 4 percent to
623,000 barrels per day.

International downstream earned $160 million in the third quarter 2009, compared
with $817 million a year earlier. The decline was associated mainly with
narrower margins on the sale of gasoline and other refined products. Operating
expenses were lower between periods. Foreign-currency effects reduced earnings
by $97 million in the 2009 quarter, compared with a benefit of $63 million in
the same period last year. 

Refinery crude-input was 985,000 barrels per day in the 2009 third quarter, up
9,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period. 

Total refined-product sales of 1.82 million barrels per day in the 2009 third
quarter were 9 percent lower than a year earlier, due mainly to asset sales
since the third quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of asset sales, sales
volumes were down 2 percent between periods on lower demand for jet fuel and
fuel oil.

&lt;p&gt;Top Fashion Company Cuts Energy Costs by 85% and IT Support Costs by 50%
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Wyse Technology, the global leader in thin computing and client virtualization,
today announced that La Perla, one of the world`s leading luxury clothing
designers, selected IBM and Wyse to help improve its desktop capabilities and
cut energy and IT costs with the use of IBM's Smart Business Desktop Cloud
solution. 

Cloud computing can give end-users easy access to the critical information they
need remotely, from various devices, including desktops and thin clients,
virtually anywhere. IBM helps organizations benefit from this model with desktop
services that are designed to enable end-users that have network-attached PCs
and thin clients to access applications and data through a centrally managed
computing environment. 

"Today more than ever, enterprises need an affordable, reliable and efficient
way to deploy and manage desktop infrastructures," says Jan Jackman, Vice
President, End User Services &amp; Cloud Infrastructure, IBM Global Technology
Services. "Using IBM`s desktop cloud service, La Perla is realizing improved end
user services and significant cost reductions." 

As a leading fashion company, La Perla needed a flexible and agile desktop
solution to meet new and changing business demands, while also reducing its
overall IT spending. By working with IBM, La Perla is now operating Wyse virtual
clients, with the flexibility of adding more, on its private desktop cloud
solution. As a result, La Perla is benefiting from 50 percent cost reduction in
support and operational costs, 85 percent reduction in energy costs and a cost
avoidance of almost $100,000 by deployment of new Wyse clients. 

"La Perla`s growing business calls for more IT flexibility, scalability and
security," said Gianluca Guidotti ICT Director of La Perla. "Using IBM`s desktop
cloud solution, combined with Wyse`s clients and virtualization software, we are
able to realize those benefits, plus be more economical as our business demands
change." 

IBM and Wyse have joined forces to help clients leverage the power of cloud
computing to foster collaboration and innovation across a desktop cloud
environment. By combining IBM`s desktop cloud services and Wyse Technology`s
thin computing and client virtualization strengths, these companies are
delivering customers a higher-quality user experience, with greater reliability
and lower total cost of ownership. 

"We enable our customers to realize tremendous economic and business benefits
from our client virtualization hardware and software solutions," said Maryam
Alexandrian, Senior VP of World Wide Sales &amp; Channels for Wyse Technology. "Our
alliance with IBM allows us to rapidly deliver high-quality and highly-reliable
solutions in support of IBM`s desktop cloud offerings." 

This agreement was signed second quarter 2009.

&lt;p&gt;On the 4th and 5th of May, over 450 business professionals will gather in London
to push forward the corporate responsibility (CR) and sustainability agenda at
the biggest conference of its kind. 


LONDON--(Business Wire)--
The Responsible Business Summit will bring together the cream of the responsible
business world on the 4th and 5th of May for two days of dynamic discussion and
argument on the future of CR and sustainability.

Now in its 9th year, the Summit has a formidable reputation for collecting
together European CR experts and business leaders. The conference organisers,
Ethical Corporation, have surpassed themselves for the 2010 event - bringing
together no less than 6 international CEOs/Presidents to contribute to
proceedings. This year, an innovative new format ensures all keynote speakers
will give presentations linked specifically to issues integral to their
business. The conference heralds the end of vague PR-based speeches with little
useful content.

Kenneth Bengtsson, CEO and President of ICA, Scandinavia`s largest retailer will
be answering the following: "What are Scandinavian consumers asking you for on
sustainability? How are you responding, and what lessons have you learned?".

Later in the morning of the 4th, Hubert Patricot, President of Coca Cola Europe,
will tackle "What challenging targets should industry be reaching for on water
and carbon? How are Coca Cola working to address these targets?"

No less than 4 other international business leaders will be responding to direct
questions on their business practices in our keynotes. Other COEs/Presidents
include Ian Cheshire of Kingfisher Group, Christian Morales of Intel and Peter
Unsworth of Tata Beverages Group.

The rest of the conference is given over to 24 interactive workshops on CR and
sustainability issues highlighted during our months of primary research. For a
full list of topics to be covered, go to
http://www.ethicalcorp.com/rbs/agenda.asp.

Ethical Corporation is an independent company providing competitive intelligence
for business sustainability. We publish research, a magazine, a website, provide
commentary services and host conferences around the world on responsible
business.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced that its Board of Directors has approved
giving shareholders an advisory vote on executive compensation. The vote will
first occur at Pfizer`s Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2010 and will take
place on a biennial basis thereafter. 

"The Board`s action continues Pfizer`s long tradition of seeking and responding
to shareholder input on compensation and other corporate governance topics,"
said Matthew Lepore, Pfizer`s vice president and chief counsel for Corporate
Governance. "The advisory vote is an additional means of obtaining feedback from
our shareholders about executive compensation, which is set by the Compensation
Committee of the Board and is designed to link pay with performance. This
feedback will supplement our ongoing investor outreach activities on a broad
range of corporate governance topics, which will not diminish with the adoption
of this advisory vote." 

Timothy Smith, Senior Vice President Environment, Social and Governance Group
for Walden Asset Management, and Stephen Viederman of The Christopher Reynolds
Foundation said, "We commend Pfizer for taking this step. Once again, Pfizer has
exhibited leadership in responding to investor concerns, a proactive approach to
investor communications, and strong corporate governance." The Christopher
Reynolds Foundation sponsored a shareholder proposal regarding advisory votes on
executive compensation at Pfizer`s 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase  Co raised concerns about Galleon hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and his associates as far back as 2001, the Financial Times reported, citing an internal company document seen by the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 52, was arrested on October 16 along with five others in what prosecutors described as the biggest hedge fund insider trading case ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2001 note, written by an analyst at the bank's alternative asset management arm, said the unit "should reduce our allocation" in Galleon's technology fund, pointing to what it described as "more negative news about Raj and his cohorts," the Financial Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan note alleged that the principals of Galleon "liked to operate in the 'grey areas'" of the markets, the Financial Times wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for JP Morgan and Galleon did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Phil Wahba; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney Channel has green-lighted "Fish Hooks," its first animated series in three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cable channel has ordered 21 episodes of the high school comedy, which mixes 2D digital animation and photo collage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fish" revolves around party guy Milo (voiced by Kyle Massey); his neurotic brother, Oscar (Justin Roiland); and an overly dramatic goldfish, Bea (Chelsea Staub). They attend Freshwater High, a school submerged in a giant fish tank in the center of a local pet store. The series chronicles their daily lives as they deal with friendships, dating and sports as well as such atypical teen issues as giant lobster attacks and school field trips to the hamster cages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fish," produced by Disney TV Animation for Disney Channels Worldwide, is slated to premiere in fall 2010. It will mark the channel's first animated series debut since the 2007 premiere of "Phineas and Ferb."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was created and is co-executive produced by children's book illustrator Noah Z. Jones, and developed for television by Alex Hirsch ("The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack") and Bill Reiss ("Chowder").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by SheriLinden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;
