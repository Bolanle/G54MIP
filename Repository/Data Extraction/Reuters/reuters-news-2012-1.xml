&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - An arbitration panel has awarded U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp $908 million in compensation for Venezuela's 2007 nationalization of its assets, less than 10 percent of what the company sought in a long legal battle with the OPEC nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez likely will celebrate the ruling as a vindication of his nationalist confrontation with oil companies aimed at increasing revenue from the industry to boost funding for state-led anti-poverty programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Venezuela faces another arbitration with Exxon (XOM.N) over the nationalization of the Cerro Negro heavy oil project, and more than a dozen pending claims from companies like oil major ConocoPhillips (COP.N) resulting from a wave of state takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They must be elated that they got off so cheap. It's certainly a happy new year for Venezuela," said Russ Dallen, head bond trader at investment bank Caracas Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But what gives Exxon hope is that it's only the first of two arbitration proceedings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokesman said in an e-mail on Sunday that the International Chamber of Commerce, or ICC, had ruled that Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, "does have a contractual liability to Exxon Mobil. The ICC award is for $907,588,000."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision was made by a tribunal of the Paris-based ICC, which calls itself the world's leading institution for resolving cross-border business disputes and says it has handled several hundred cases a year since 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon had sought as much as $10 billion in compensation for its heavy crude upgrading project in the South American country's vast Orinoco belt, which was nationalized by Chavez along with three others. The award is less than the $1 billion Venezuela offered in compensation in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the ICC claim, Exxon filed for arbitration with the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, over the same issue. The Exxon spokesman said that case was scheduled to be argued next month, and that the date for any verdict was not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices for Venezuela's widely traded bonds are likely to react positively to the news given some expectations that the award could have been higher, Dallen said. Venezuela's sovereign debt and PDVSA's bonds may get a lift on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limited payout in the claim will help the socialist Chavez continue to boost state spending on public assistance and housing for the poor in the run-up to his October re-election bid, which is seen as the toughest of his 13 years in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STATE TAKEOVERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute between Exxon and Chavez became symbolic of the conflict between countries seeking more revenue from the booming oil industry and companies insisting on respect for investments and compensation for state takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICC decision appears to award Exxon a sum close to the $750 million it said it invested in the project - the amount Venezuela says Exxon deserves following the takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Exxon insists it should also be compensated for the increased value of the project, which at its outset in the early 1990s was considered risky because of low oil prices and uncertainty about the relatively untested operations to turn tar-like Orinoco oil into valuable light crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon took a risk when they went in. I'm sure they were expecting more than just making their money back," said Dallen, adding that it will be hard to reach a definitive conclusion about what the decision means until more details are released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exxon spokesman told Reuters the company was still reviewing the more than 400-page ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Venezuela bought back $630 million in bonds issued to finance the Cerro Negro project, which Dallen said may have figured into the calculation of the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local analyst Asdrubal Oliveros of Ecoanalitica estimated the value of Exxon assets in Venezuela at around $4.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips was an investor in two of the four Orinoco upgrader projects. Exxon and Conoco, who had in total asked for as much as $40 billion in compensation, both left the country after the nationalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez has said the country does not expect to pay more than $2.5 billion for the combined total of the claims by the two companies. PDVSA said in a debt prospectus it had set aside $1.5 billion in provision for litigation as of the first half of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's outstanding arbitration claims include disputes with Swiss cement-maker Holcim (HOLN.VX) and Canadian miner Gold Reserve Inc GRZ.A, which could force it to make large payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez's steady push to boost control over the country's oil industry started in 2004 and was followed by similar efforts in oil-producing countries ranging from Ecuador to Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say his nationalization drive has slowed foreign investment that could help lift Venezuela's crude production, which has been stagnant for years, and left fewer companies interested in its oil fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relations between Exxon and Venezuela were particularly acrimonious. In 2008, Exxon won an injunction against PDVSA to freeze up to $12 billion of its assets, a ruling that was quickly overturned but triggered furious criticism from Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies have remained eager to invest in the Orinoco belt, which is considered one of the world's largest crude reserves, with U.S. major Chevron (CVX.N) and Spain's Repsol (REP.MC) signing investment deals in 2010 for new multibillion-dollar projects there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Daniel Wallis and Stacey Joyce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - An international arbitration panel has awarded U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) $908 million in compensation for Venezuela's 2007 nationalization of assets, less than 10 percent of what it sought in a dispute that pitted a top global oil company against one of the world's largest oil exporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is likely to celebrate the ruling as a vindication of his nationalist confrontation with oil companies, aimed at increasing available funding for state-led anti-poverty programs in the OPEC nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The socialist leader, closely allied with Cuba's communist government, has cast Exxon Mobil as an icon of the global capitalism that is the pariah of his self-styled revolution. The limited payout in the claim will reduce potential liabilities at a time when Chavez is boosting state spending to shore up support in the run-up to his October re-election bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon Mobil spokesman said in an emailed message on Sunday that the decision by the International Chamber of Commerce confirmed that Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, "does have a contractual liability to Exxon Mobil. The ICC award is for $907,588,000."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil filed an arbitration claim in 2007 seeking as much as $10 billion in compensation for the Cerro Negro project located in the Orinoco heavy oil belt that Chavez nationalized along with three other projects in the same area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Venezuelan government sources told Reuters on Saturday that an arbitration panel had reached a decision in the case and that it was favorable to Venezuela. They declined to give the amount Venezuela was ordered to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATIONALIST TAKEOVERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela still faces more than a dozen outstanding arbitration claims, including disputes with U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Swiss cement-maker Holcim (HOLN.VX), which in some instances could force Venezuela to make payouts in the billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips was an investor in two of the four Orinoco projects, which turned tar-like oil into valuable light crude. The two companies had in total asked for as much as $40 billion in compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez has said the country does not expect to pay more than $2.5 billion for the combined total of the ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil arbitration claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil said in 2007 it had invested about $750 million in the Cerro Negro heavy crude project, which was renamed PetroMonagas as part of the state takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Exxon Mobil won an injunction against PDVSA to freeze up to $12 billion in company assets, a ruling that was quickly overturned but sparked furious criticism by the Chavez government and further deteriorated relations between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies have remained eager to invest in the Orinoco belt, which is considered to hold one of the world's largest reserves of crude, with U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N) and Spain's Repsol (REP.MC) signing investment deals in 2010 for new multibillion-dollar projects there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez's steady push to boost control over the country's oil industry starting in 2004 was followed by similar efforts in oil-producing countries ranging from Ecuador to Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say his efforts have slowed investments that could help lift Venezuela's crude production, which has remained stagnant for years, and left fewer companies interested in its oil fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Marianna Parraga; Editing By Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's PDVSA said on Monday it will pay Exxon Mobil Corp $255 million in compensation for nationalized assets - less than a third of what the U.S. oil giant said it was awarded by an arbitration panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South American OPEC member's state oil company issued a defiant statement saying it was deducting debts owed by Exxon, including PDVSA's repurchase of bonds linked to the nationalized project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That cut down the panel's original award of $908 million, PDVSA said, adding it would make the payment within 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paying only $255 million would leave Exxon (XOM.N) with only a fraction of the more than $10 billion it originally sought in compensation, and it would be a major victory for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez that could give oil-producing nations more power in nationalization disputes with companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Exxon may still come away with a larger payment because it is pursuing a separate case against Venezuela before the World Bank's arbitration tribunal. Both cases deal with the 2007 nationalization of the Cerro Negro project in the vast Orinoco heavy crude belt, one of the world's biggest crude reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's ruling was made by a tribunal of the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce, or ICC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The decision (by the ICC panel) shows PDVSA was right in believing Exxon Mobil's demands were completely exaggerated and sets the payment at a lower amount than what was claimed," PDVSA said in its statement on Monday, adding that Exxon's original claims were "lacking any logic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in September, Venezuela said it had offered Exxon $1 billion in compensation. [ID:nS1E78K26F] Last month, Chavez said he would be happy to discuss "a friendly agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government has always said it is willing to compensate for private investments in sovereign decisions to nationalize strategic assets in the national interest, provided such compensation is fair and reasonable," PDVSA said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokesman said the ICC decision gave the U.S. company $907.6 million "of real financial benefit" in the form of debt relief and cash, and that about $160.6 million of Exxon debt had already been credited by the tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The remaining $746.9 million could be paid through a combination of approximately $305 million in PDVSA funds already held for this purpose by New York courts, PDVSA's cancellation of additional project debt owed by ExxonMobil and payment of additional cash," Patrick McGinn said by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOOK VALUE vs MARKET VALUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company was awarded nearly $908 million by a tribunal of the ICC, which calls itself the world's leading institution for resolving international business disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICC does not make its arbitration decisions public, leaving few clues to the criteria behind the valuation. Exxon has said it is still reviewing the more than 400-page document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDVSA said on Monday that it was deducting $191 million that Exxon owed it for the repurchase of bonds linked to Cerro Negro, $300 million in offshore PDVSA accounts that Exxon had frozen during the dispute, and $160 million that the ICC panel awarded the Venezuelan company in counterclaims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling appears to back Venezuela's position that companies whose assets are nationalized should be compensated for the amount invested - sometimes called book value - rather than the market value the assets might fetch if sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The award to Exxon Mobil was less than many of us had expected," said oil industry analyst Oliver Campbell, a former finance coordinator at PDVSA. "Venezuela offered to pay Exxon net book value, which Exxon refused. But in the event, the award was not so much higher than net book value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which held a 42 percent stake in Cerro Negro, said in 2007 that it had invested about $750 million in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Exxon's case at the World Bank tribunal, Venezuela also still faces about 20 claims from companies including another oil major, ConocoPhillips (COP.N), resulting from a wave of state takeovers by the Chavez government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's World Bank case is expected to be argued next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Exxon Mobil continues with this second arbitration and its efforts to secure exorbitant compensation for the nationalization, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will take all necessary steps to defend itself," PDVSA said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The often vicious legal dispute, during which Exxon briefly managed to freeze as much as $12 billion in PDVSA assets, underlined the ideological differences between the U.S. oil giant and Chavez's socialist administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Daniel Wallis and Todd Eastham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Western banks increasingly interested in sukuk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* But controversy could affect their entry into sector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Advisor mounts detailed defence in Reuters column&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Says funds will not be used for interest-base lending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Argues Goldman's entry could help solve industry's
problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Andrew Torchia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - An advisor to Goldman Sachs
 has defended the U.S. bank's $2 billion Islamic bond
programme against criticism it may contravene religious
principles, in a controversy that could affect Western banks'
ability to enter the Islamic debt market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Goldman registered the sukuk programme with the
Irish Stock Exchange. It set up a Cayman Islands-registered
special purpose vehicle, Global Sukuk Co Ltd, to issue a sukuk
based on murabaha, a cost-plus-profit arrangement which complies
with Islamic law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts however have suggested Goldman might use the
proceeds of the issue to lend money to clients for interest,
which would be against Islamic law, and that the issue might not
trade at par value on the Irish exchange, which would also
contravene sharia law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asim Khan, managing director at Islamic finance advisory
firm Dar Al Istithmar, said such speculation was groundless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bulge-bracket banks such as Goldman Sachs can bring to
Islamic finance their sophistication and depth of experience in
liquidity management and equity/quasi-equity investment, which
can take Islamic finance closer to its true ideals, so long as
they adhere to the generally accepted sharia principles," Khan
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So far there is no basis to speculate otherwise," Khan,
whose London- and Dubai-based company advised Goldman on the
sukuk, wrote in a column contributed to Reuters. (For the full
column, click on ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the euro zone debt crisis poisoned conventional debt
markets last year, several big Western banks considered raising
money through Islamic finance, which is based on religious
principles and bans the payment of interest and pure monetary
speculation. The Arab Gulf, home to billions of dollars of
Islamic investment funds, has been relatively untouched by the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC's Middle East unit became the first Western
bank to issue a sukuk last May with a $500 million Islamic bond
carrying a maturity of five years. French bank Credit Agricole
 has said it is considering issuing an Islamic bond or
creating a wider sukuk programme that could lead to several
issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike HSBC with its HSBC Amanah brand, however, Goldman
does not have an established presence in the Islamic banking
sector, and its entry into the market has caused controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed Khnifer, an Islamic finance analyst in Saudi
Arabia, wrote that Goldman might use the proceeds of the sukuk
to fund conventional banking activities. He suggested the sukuk
might trade on the Irish exchange at levels other than par
value, which would be impermissible under sharia law, and that
the underlying structure of the sukuk might not be murabaha but
reverse tawarruq, which has been ruled unacceptable by some
Islamic scholars as an effort to hide the use of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his column, Khan wrote that the prospectus clearly showed
the proceeds of the sukuk would not be used to lend money to
Goldman clients for interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs, as an investment bank and as a proprietary
commodity trader, has invested billions of dollars in
commodities and will use the murabaha commodities in its
commodity trading business, which will partly replace the
conventional funding with Islamic finance," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan said the prospectus had informed investors that the
sukuk should only be traded at par value, and had warned
investors there was not expected to be a secondary market in the
instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He argued that the Goldman deal had a legitimate murabaha
structure. "One would have to stretch one's imagination a bit
too far to label such a vanilla murabaha transaction as a
tawarruq," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan also suggested Goldman's entry into Islamic finance
could help the industry overcome obstacles hindering its
expansion, including a shortage of tools to help banks manage
their liquidity, and a lack of sufficient involvement by
institutional funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The benefits of a large investment bank's foray into
Islamic banking could be significant," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controversies over the permissibility of financial
instruments, which can affect investors' willingness to put
money into them, have characterised Islamic finance since it was
born in its modern form in the 1970s. A range of scholars and
industry bodies set product standards which are sometimes
contradictory and act as guidelines rather than firm,
enforceable rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has said its sukuk could be denominated in United
Arab Emirates dirhams, U.S. dollars, Saudi riyals or Singapore
dollars. It has not disclosed a time frame for issuance, but has
insisted that Islamic scholars have given the programme adequate
certification that it complies with sharia principles.&lt;/p&gt;

      apelaci&#243;n en laCorte Provincial de Justicia de Sucumb&#237;os en Lago Agrio, 
      Ecuador, emitieron un fallo adverso, en un juicio ambiental que 
      involucra a Texaco Petroleum Company. Con este fallo se&#160;ratifica la 
      sentencia de la corte de primera instancia del&#160;14 de febrero de 2011.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron contin&#250;a buscando&#160;otras opciones&#160;a trav&#233;s de procedimientos

      Chevron&#160;en&#160;contra&#160;del&#160;Ecuador,&#160;en la Corte de La Haya bajo el Tratado 
      Bilateral de Inversiones entre Ecuador y Estados Unidos, el tribunal 
      emiti&#243; una orden el 9 de febrero de 2011&#160;ordenando&#160;que&#160;el&#160;Ecuador tome 
      todas las medidas a su alcance para&#160;detener&#160;la ejecuci&#243;n de la sentencia 
      de Lago Agrio hasta nuevo aviso de ese tribunal. El tribunal tambi&#233;n 
      se&#241;al&#243; que si se estableciera cualquier sentencia de una corte 
      ecuatoriana en el caso de Lago Agrio,&#160;estar&#237;a violando una obligaci&#243;n 
      del Ecuador con Chevron,&#160;de acuerdo a las leyes de&#160;derecho 
      internacional, el Ecuador podr&#237;a ser responsable de cualquier 
      p&#233;rdida&#160;que genere&#160;la ejecuci&#243;n de dicha sentencia (dentro o fuera de 
      Ecuador). Chevron tambi&#233;n est&#225; entablando acciones legales en la Corte 
      de Distrito de Estados Unidos en&#160;el Distrito Sur de Nueva 
      York&#160;en&#160;contra&#160;de&#160;los representantes de los demandantes de Lago Agrio, 
      por violaciones contra los estatutos federales&#160;contra la asociaci&#243;n para 
      delinquir y extorsionar, as&#237; como en otras leyes,&#160;basadas en la 
      abrumadora evidencia de fraude y corrupci&#243;n&#160;existentes&#160;en este caso.

      En respuesta al reciente fallo,&#160;Chevron emiti&#243; las siguientes 
      declaraciones:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;La decisi&#243;n de hoy es otro ejemplo&#160;evidente&#160;de la politizaci&#243;n y 
      corrupci&#243;n del sistema judicial ecuatoriano, que ha empa&#241;ado este 
      fraudulento caso desde&#160;su&#160;inicio. La sentencia de Lago Agrio fue 
      obtenida a trav&#233;s de un plan corrupto y fraudulento, gran parte del cual 
      fue captado en video y expuesto en la correspondencia y correos 
      electr&#243;nicos de los propios representantes de los demandantes. Su 
      conducta indebida incluye la fabricaci&#243;n de reportes periciales, la 
      invenci&#243;n de evidencia, el soborno y la confabulaci&#243;n con funcionarios 
      de las cortes, el lanzamiento de una campa&#241;a de intimidaci&#243;n contra los 
      jueces y hasta la redacci&#243;n por terceros de partes del mismo veredicto.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Hemos presentado evidencias de estos&#160;actos il&#237;citos&#160;a los jueces y 
      fiscales del Ecuador, pero las autoridades no han tomado ninguna acci&#243;n 
      correctiva. En Estados Unidos, sin embargo, no menos de ocho jueces 
      federales han encontrado que el juicio en Ecuador ha estado empa&#241;ado por 
      el fraude y la conducta indebida de los representantes de los 
      demandantes. Adem&#225;s, un tribunal internacional en la Corte Permanente de 
      Arbitraje en La Haya ha ordenado al Ecuador a tomar todas las medidas a 
      su alcance para suspender la ejecuci&#243;n de la sentencia de Lago Agrio 
      dentro o fuera del Ecuador.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron entiende que la sentencia ecuatoriana no es aplicable en 
      ninguna corte y que en Ecuador no se respeta el estado de derecho. La 
      compa&#241;&#237;a continuar&#225; buscando que los que han perpetrado este fraude, 
      para que rindan cuentas ante la Justicia&#8221;.

&lt;p&gt;LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador (Reuters) - An Ecuadorean appeals court on Tuesday upheld a ruling that Chevron Corp should pay $18 billion in damages to plaintiffs who accused the U.S. oil giant of polluting the Amazon jungle and damaging their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A local judge ordered Chevron to pay $8.6 billion in environmental damages last February, but the amount was more than doubled to about $18 billion because Chevron failed to make a public apology as required by the original ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We ratify the ruling of February 14 2011 in all its parts, including the sentence for moral reparation," the court in the Amazonian city of Lago Agrio said in its ruling, which was obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events are being watched closely by the oil industry for precedents that could impact other big claims against companies accused of pollution in the countries where they operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron swiftly denounced the appellate court's ruling, calling it "illegitimate" and a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's decision is another glaring example of the politicization and corruption of Ecuador's judiciary that has plagued this fraudulent case from the start," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lago Agrio judgment was procured through a corrupt and fraudulent scheme, much of which was captured on film and memorialized in the plaintiffs' representatives' own emails and correspondence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the company said it was pursuing an action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the plaintiffs' representatives regarding violations of the federal racketeering statute and common-law fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second largest U.S. oil company could also call for the intervention of Ecuador's Supreme Court in the case, which would open a new chapter in the 18-year-old legal saga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accused Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron in 2001, of dumping oil-drilling waste in unlined pits, polluting the forest and causing illness and deaths among indigenous people. They appealed the original court ruling, claiming more money would be needed for the cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This (ruling) confirms and ratifies that the company polluted and affected the Amazon," the plaintiffs said in a statement. "It is necessary to clarify that no amount will be enough to repair all the crime they did in our area, nor will it be enough to bring the dead back to life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron had also appealed the ruling, arguing that Texaco cleaned up all waste pits for which it was responsible, and said the Ecuadorean judge in the original case had ignored evidence of fraud on the part of the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'JUSTICE HAS BEEN DONE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the appellate court's decision, Ecuador's leftist president, Rafael Correa, said he was happy, and he described the dispute as a "David and Goliath" battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think justice has been done. The harm that Chevron caused to the Amazon cannot be denied," Correa told reporters in the coastal city of Guayaquil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has also been under pressure recently over environmental issues in Brazil. Last week, Brazil's oil industry watchdog issued a third citation against the company for an oil spill at an offshore field in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also been cited in a $20 billion civil lawsuit filed by public prosecutors over that spill. Brazilian federal police have indicted Chevron, the drilling company Transocean and executives from both companies in a criminal case alleging environmental crimes and obstruction of justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long legal battle in Ecuador has spawned accusations of dirty tricks and bribery. Activists portray it as a fight for justice against rich polluters - but Chevron says it is driven more by opportunism and greedy lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A judge in New York sought to freeze the original judgment against Chevron, but the decision was overruled on appeal in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has argued that Ecuador's judicial process has been corrupted and is banking on international arbitrators who are expected to decide this month if they will weigh in on what has become a landmark international legal dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tribunal working under The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration ordered last February that Ecuador suspend enforcement of any judgment in the lawsuit, pending a decision by its panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arbitration could then take years, if a previous dispute with Ecuador is any guide. It took four years for a separate international tribunal to rule that the OPEC-member country must pay Chevron $96 million in connection with commercial claims made in Ecuadorean courts in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Writing by Eduardo Garcia; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Eric Beech)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - MF Global unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of securities to Goldman Sachs in the days leading up to its collapse, according to two former MF Global employees with direct knowledge of the transactions. But it did not immediately receive payment from its clearing firm and lender, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of securities to Goldman occurred on October 27, just days before MF Global Holdings Ltd MFGLQ.PK filed for bankruptcy on October 31, the ex-employees said. One of the employees said the transaction was cleared with JPMorgan Chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time MF Global, which was run by former Goldman Sachs head Jon Corzine, was selling securities to Goldman to raise badly needed cash, the futures firm was also drawing down a $1.2 billion revolving line of credit it had with JPMorgan, according to one of the former MF Global employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Mary Sedarat said the bank did not withold money because of the line of credit. She declined further comment on details of the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has fought aggressively in bankruptcy court to protect its interests, and received a lien on some of MF Global's assets in exchange for granting the firm $8 million to fund its bankruptcy costs. The lien puts JPMorgan's interests ahead of MF Global customers who have not yet received an estimated $900 million worth of money from their accounts, which remain frozen as regulators search for missing funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hastily crafted transactions and the seeming inability of MF Global to recoup some of the money in the sale to Goldman may start to explain why so much money remains unaccounted for at the futures firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what type of assets Goldman bought from MF Global, but the securities were worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the former employees said. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal previously reported that George Soros' fund was a buyer of securities sold by MF Global, scooping-up some of its European sovereign debt at a deep discount. Panic among investors and clients about MF Global's $6.3 billion bet on European sovereign bonds led to its demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corzine, who was CEO of MF Global at the time of the collapse, headed Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999 before being ousted after a power struggle with co-CEO Henry Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corzine and other top MF Global executives reached out in desperation to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan, as well as Jefferies Group Inc JEF.N Barclays Plc (BARC.L), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX), State Street Corp (STT.N) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N), as potential buyers in its final days as the firm teetered toward collapse, Reuters earlier reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Henry; editing by Martin Howell and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Condemns Illegitimate Decision by Ecuador Appellate Court
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced there has been an adverse 
      ruling by the panel of three temporary judges presiding over appellate 
      proceedings in the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumb&#237;os in Lago 
      Agrio, Ecuador in an environmental lawsuit involving Texaco Petroleum 
      Company, upholding a lower court&#8217;s ruling from February 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron continues to seek recourse through legal proceedings outside of 
      Ecuador. In the arbitration proceedings Chevron instituted against 
      Ecuador in The Hague under the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty, 
      the Tribunal issued an order on February 9, 2011 requiring Ecuador to 
      take all measures at its disposal to prevent enforcement of the Lago 
      Agrio judgment until further order of the Tribunal. The Tribunal also 
      recorded that if it were established that any judgment made by an 
      Ecuadorian court in the Lago Agrio case was a breach of an obligation 
      Ecuador owed to Chevron as a matter of international law, any loss 
      arising from the enforcement of such judgment (within and without 
      Ecuador) may be losses for which Ecuador would be responsible to Chevron 
      under international law. Chevron also is pursuing an action in the U.S. 
      District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago 
      Agrio plaintiffs&#8217; representatives for violations of the federal 
      racketeering statute, common-law fraud, and other relief based upon the 
      overwhelming evidence of their fraud and corruption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In response to the ruling, Chevron issued the following statement:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s decision is another glaring example of the politicization and 
      corruption of Ecuador&#8217;s judiciary that has plagued this fraudulent case 
      from the start. The Lago Agrio judgment was procured through a corrupt 
      and fraudulent scheme, much of which was captured on film and 
      memorialized in the plaintiffs&#8217; representatives&#8217; own emails and 
      correspondence. Their misconduct includes fabricating expert reports, 
      manufacturing evidence, bribing and colluding with court officials, 
      waging a campaign of intimidation against judges, and even ghostwriting 
      parts of the verdict itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Evidence of these crimes has been provided to Ecuador&#8217;s courts and 
      prosecutors, but authorities there have taken no corrective actions. In 
      the United States, however, no less than eight federal judges have found 
      that the trial in Ecuador has been marred by the fraud and misconduct of 
      the plaintiffs&#8217; representatives. And an international Tribunal presiding 
      in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague has ordered Ecuador 
      to take all measures at its disposal to suspend enforcement of the Lago 
      Agrio judgment within and without Ecuador.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron does not believe that the Ecuador ruling is enforceable in any 
      court that observes the rule of law. The company will continue to seek 
      to hold accountable the perpetrators of this fraud.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Background:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Information on Chevron&#8217;s appeal can be found here. 
      Chevron is defending itself against false allegations that it is 
      responsible for environmental and social harms in the Amazon region of 
      Ecuador. Chevron has never conducted oil production operations in 
      Ecuador, and its subsidiary, Texaco Petroleum (TexPet), fully remediated 
      its share of environmental impacts arising from its participation in an 
      oil producing consortium with Petroecuador prior to 1992. After the 
      remediation work was certified by all agencies of the Ecuadorian 
      government responsible for oversight, TexPet received a complete release 
      from Ecuador's national, provincial and municipal governments prior to 
      being acquired by Chevron in 2001. Petroecuador was the majority owner 
      of the consortium in which TexPet participated until 1992 and has been 
      the sole owner of greatly expanded oil operations in the former 
      concession area over the past two decades. Last month, Petroecuador 
      announced it will complete its remediation of the sites it is 
      responsible for at a cost of $70 million. This figure stands in contrast 
      to the multi-billion dollar judgment affirmed today.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has been sued for $95 million by the trustee for securities marketed in 2005 by the former Bear Stearns Cos over alleged misrepresentations regarding the underlying mortgage loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Bank NA wants to force JPMorgan to buy back the mortgage loans because of alleged breaches of representations and warranties regarding the Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities Trust 2005-4, for which it serves as trustee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also accused the largest U.S. bank by assets of refusing to provide the underlying loan files, as the trust documents require, so it can investigate the extent of the alleged breaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit of US Bancorp said it made its request at the direction of a majority certificate holder in the trust. US Bank also sued Bear Stearns and its former EMC Mortgage Corp unit. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed on Friday in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, and publicly docketed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is one of many lawsuits seeking to hold banks responsible for investor losses over mortgages that may have been toxic, defective or improperly underwritten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon last month told investors that the bank has been sued over $54.9 billion of private-label securitizations, excluding the former Washington Mutual Inc, and expects that number to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the disclosures are clear, risks were plain and set forth," he said. "Investors, mostly sophisticated, they understood and accepted it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities Trust 2005-4 v. EMC Mortgage Corp et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 650003/2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by David Henry; editing by Gerald E.

			SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This news release may contain forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements regarding future 
      events, developments, the Company's future performance, as well as 
      management's expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans, estimates or 
      projections relating to the future (including, without limitation, 
      statements concerning revenue and net income), are forward-looking 
      statements within the meaning of these laws and involve a number of 
      risks and uncertainties. Management believes that these forward looking 
      statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions and 
      forecasts, however, undue reliance should not be placed on such 
      statements that speak only as of the date hereof. Moreover, these 
      forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and 
      uncertainties, some of which are outlined below. As a result, actual 
      results may vary materially from those anticipated by the 
      forward-looking statements. Among the important factors that could cause 
      actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such 
      forward-looking statements are: the volume and timing of systems sales 
      and installations; length of sales cycles and the installation process; 
      the possibility that products will not achieve or sustain market 
      acceptance; seasonal patterns of sales and customer buying behavior; 
      impact of incentive payments under The American Recovery and 
      Reinvestment Act on sales and the ability of the Company to meet 
      continued certification requirements; the development by competitors of 
      new or superior technologies; the timing, cost and success or failure of 
      new product and service introductions, development and product upgrade 
      releases; undetected errors or bugs in software; product liability; 
      changing economic, political or regulatory influences in the health-care 
      industry; changes in product-pricing policies; availability of 
      third-party products and components; competitive pressures including 
      product offerings, pricing and promotional activities; the Company's 
      ability or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; possible 
      regulation of the Company's software by the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration; uncertainties concerning threatened, pending and new 
      litigation against the Company including related professional services 
      fees; uncertainties concerning the amount and timing of professional 
      fees incurred by the Company generally; changes of accounting estimates 
      and assumptions used to prepare the prior periods' financial statements; 
      general economic conditions; and the risk factors detailed from time to 
      time in the Company&#8217;s periodic reports and registration statements filed 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A significant portion of 
      the Company's quarterly sales of software product licenses and computer 
      hardware is concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter, generally 
      with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final ten business 
      days of that month. Due to these and other factors, the Company's 
      revenues and operating results are very difficult to forecast. A major 
      portion of the Company's costs and expenses, such as personnel and 
      facilities, are of a fixed nature and, accordingly, a shortfall or 
      decline in quarterly and/or annual revenues typically results in lower 
      profitability or losses. As a result, comparison of the Company's 
      period-to-period financial performance is not necessarily meaningful and 
      should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. The 
      Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking 
      statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
      otherwise.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Investment bank JPMorgan upgraded its recommendation for Cisco Systems to "overweight" and raised its price target for the network equipment maker on expectations of a rebound in public sector spending and improved margins in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco stock was up 3.4 percent to $18.65 in midday trading in New York on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our proprietary analysis of 30 U.S. federal agency budgets implies that spending will increase in FY'12 after being down in FY'11 and may act as a tailwind for Cisco," JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, we believe Cisco represents a relatively safe haven for communications equipment investors," Hall added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its price target for Cisco shares to $21 from $19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problems Cisco encountered in 2011 were a number of small issues that resulted in a year-on-year decline in gross margins, Hall said, adding that it was not likely to happen this year because those problems have been addressed by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Nicola Leske; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

for $95 million by the trustee for securities marketed in 2005
by the former Bear Stearns Cos over alleged misrepresentations
regarding the underlying mortgage loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Bank NA wants to force JPMorgan to buy back the mortgage
loans because of alleged breaches of representations and
warranties regarding the Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities
Trust 2005-4, for which it serves as trustee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said JPMorgan has refused to provide the underlying
loan, as the trust documents require, so it can investigate the
extent of the alleged breaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit of US Bancorp said it made its request at
the direction of a majority certificate holder in the trust. US
Bank also sued Bear Stearns and its former EMC Mortgage Corp
unit. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman did not immediately respond to
requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed on Friday in the New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan, and publicly docketed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is one of many lawsuits seeking to hold banks
responsible for investor losses over mortgages that may have
been toxic, defective or improperly underwritten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities Trust
2005-4 v. EMC Mortgage Corp et al, New York State Supreme

      Fitch: Chevron Profile Unaffected by Ecuador Court Ruling
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Yesterday's ruling by a provincial appeals court in Ecuador upholding an 
      $18 billion judgment against Chevron Corp. creates headline risk but is 
      not expected to affect the company's credit profile, according to Fitch 
      Ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The judgment stems from a long-running civil court case in Ecuador in 
      which plaintiffs allege environmental damages related to wastewater 
      disposal in the Amazon Basin by a subsidiary of Texaco, which Chevron 
      acquired in 2001.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch continues to view the credit risk to bondholders stemming from a 
      prospective settlement as low. Risks of a large near-term payout are 
      mitigated by the potential for legal challenges to go on for years, as 
      well as the fact that Chevron has no significant assets remaining in 
      Ecuador.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By way of comparison, we note that the Exxon Valdez lawsuit was resolved 
      only after a lengthy round of appeals 20 years after the 1989 Prince 
      William Sound spill. In that case, the amount of punitive damages paid 
      was approximately 20% of the original award.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch also notes that Chevron had $20 billion of cash and time deposits 
      as of the end of the third quarter, an amount in excess of the full 
      judgement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron has vigorously contested the lawsuit on numerous grounds, and 
      regards the rulings of the Ecuadorian courts in the matter as 
      fraudulent. The company's opposition relates to a number of issues, 
      including questions regarding the enforceability of the claim in light 
      of a 1995 remediation agreement. Under that agreement, the company 
      believes that Texaco and Petroecuador, its Ecuadorian partner, were 
      released from liability by the government. Chevron also contests the 
      retroactive assessment of claims under Ecuador's statute of limitations 
      and is seeking recourse through legal proceedings outside of Ecuador.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron's issuer default rating (IDR) is 'AA'. Its strong liquidity and 
      cash flow generation profile provide substantial flexibility to absorb a 
      large damage payment, in the event that the case is resolved more 
      quickly than expected. As of Sept. 30, 2011, the company had free cash 
      flow over the preceding 12 months of $9.2 billion and total reported 
      balance sheet debt of approximately $9.5 billion, compared with assets 
      of $204.1 billion.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics 
      based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the 
      translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines with a core 
      focus on RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of genetically defined 
      diseases, including ALN-TTR for the treatment of transthyretin-mediated 
      amyloidosis (ATTR), ALN-PCS for the treatment of severe 
      hypercholesterolemia, ALN-HPN for the treatment of refractory anemia, 
      and ALN-APC for the treatment of hemophilia. As part of its &#8220;Alnylam 5x15TM&#8221; 
      strategy, the company expects to have five RNAi therapeutic products for 
      genetically defined diseases in advanced stages of clinical development 
      by the end of 2015. Alnylam has additional partner-based programs in 
      clinical or development stages, including ALN-RSV01 for the treatment of 
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, ALN-VSP for the treatment 
      of liver cancers, and ALN-HTT for the treatment of Huntington&#8217;s disease. 
      The company&#8217;s leadership position on RNAi therapeutics and intellectual 
      property have enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies 
      including Merck, Medtronic, Novartis, Biogen Idec, Roche, Takeda, Kyowa 
      Hakko Kirin, and Cubist. In addition, Alnylam and Isis co-founded 
      Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a company focused on discovery, development, 
      and commercialization of microRNA therapeutics; Regulus has formed 
      partnerships with GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi. Alnylam has also formed 
      Alnylam Biotherapeutics, a division of the company focused on the 
      development of RNAi technologies for application in biologics 
      manufacturing, including recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies. 
      Alnylam&#8217;s VaxiRNA&#8482; platform applies RNAi technology to improve the 
      manufacturing processes for vaccines; GlaxoSmithKline is a collaborator 
      in this effort. Alnylam scientists and collaborators have published 
      their research on RNAi therapeutics in over 100 peer-reviewed papers, 
      including many in the world&#8217;s top scientific journals such as Nature, 
      Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, and Cell. 
      Founded in 2002, Alnylam maintains headquarters in Cambridge,

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it is suing Britain's second-largest electronics retailer Comet for allegedly creating and selling "counterfeit" recovery CDs of its flagship Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement on its website, Microsoft said the retailer created more than 94,000 sets of Windows Vista and XP recovery CDs and sold them to customers buying Windows-loaded PCs and laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recovery disk is used to reinstall the operating system in a PC in case of system failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is disappointing that a well-known retailer created so many unwitting victims of counterfeiting," David Finn, associate general counsel at Microsoft for worldwide anti-piracy &amp; anti-counterfeiting, told Reuters in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2008 and 2009, Comet approached tens of thousands of customers who had bought PCs with the necessary recovery software already on the hard drive, and offered to sell them unnecessary recovery discs for 14.99," Finn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comet is owned by Kesa Electricals, Europe's No. 3 electronics retailer, but is in the process of being sold to private equity group OpCapita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Kesa spokesman told Reuters that Comet provided the disks as a service to its customers between March 2008 and December 2009, but stopped the practice when Microsoft objected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Comet sold the disks as many buyers of PCs and laptops did not create their own recovery CDs and faced problems when their computers failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a number of disks made, on which there was a cost and Comet charged this to the customer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comet believes the supply of the recovery CDs was in the best interests of its customers and "has a good sense of its claim and will defend its position vigorously," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Finn said customers can secure the recovery disks directly from computer manufacturers for free or a minimal amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was filed in the high court in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Himank Sharma and Tresa Sherin Morera)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow us on Twitter: @ReutersLegal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable operator, and Walt Disney Co on Wednesday said they had reached a comprehensive 10-year programming carriage deal for TV, Web and handheld devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement covers Disney's various networks including ABC and ESPN, and will allow Comcast's Xfinity TV customers to watch those networks live or on-demand on multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal gives a big boost to the cable TV industry's push for programmers and distributors to reach agreements that will enable paying subscribers to watch their favorite shows anytime. Distributors have pushed back over whether they should pay extra so their subscribers can watch the shows online or on other devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is incentive for the content companies and cable operators to be in all the screens," said Miller Tabak analyst David Joyce. "And ESPN in particular has the content that lends itself to multiple screens quite well - as well as monetizing it through various forms of advertising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also included in the deal is a broadcast retransmission agreement for ABC's seven broadcast stations and Comcast will launch Disney Junior - a new 24-hour basic channel for preschool-age children. Comcast will also provide its Xfinity customers with access to live Disney networks. In all, the agreement covers more than 70 services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the scope of assets Comcast and Disney/ABC/ESPN are making available to consumers, this agreement is unprecedented in our industry," said ESPN Executive Chairman George Bodenheimer. "It reinforces the value of the multichannel subscription and takes full advantage of new technologies, which serve all of our viewers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Yinka Adegoke and Paul Thomasch; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

			The Walt Disney Company and Comcast Corporation Announce a Long-Term,

      Multichannel Business Model
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Deal Provides Xfinity TV Customers Broad Access to Top Sports, News

		&lt;p&gt;
      Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) (Nasdaq: CMCSK) and The Walt Disney 
      Company (NYSE: DIS) today announced a long-term, comprehensive 
      distribution agreement that will deliver Disney&#8217;s top quality sports, 
      news and entertainment content to Comcast&#8217;s Xfinity TV customers into 
      the next decade on television, online, on tablets and handheld devices. 
      The new agreement enhances the multichannel business model and supports 
      the companies&#8217; mutual goal to deliver the best video content to 
      customers across multiple platforms using the latest technology and 
      cloud innovation. For the first time ever, Comcast&#8217;s Xfinity TV 
      customers will be able to watch ESPN, ABC or Disney shows live or on 
      demand and across multiple screens. The companies also agreed to 
      collaborate over the term of the deal to create new, innovative viewing 
      experiences for Xfinity TV customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The networks and services covered by the agreement include: ABC, ABC

      high-definition networks. Additionally, Comcast will launch Disney 
      Junior, a new 24-hour basic channel for preschool-age children, parents 
      and caregivers. Comcast will also provide its Xfinity TV customers with 
      broad access to a suite of live Disney networks on an authenticated 
      basis and expanded Xfinity On Demand content through Disney&#8217;s 
      comprehensive TV+ initiative. In total, 70 services are covered by the 
      broad scope of this new agreement. License fee schedules for different 
      services under the deal will be phased in over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Comcast was the first video provider to create technology that enabled 
      us to deliver content to customers where and when they want it across 
      any viewing experience,&#8221; said Neil Smit, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer, Comcast Cable. &#8220;We are very pleased to have reached this 
      unprecedented and innovative, long-term agreement with Disney which 
      embraces the future of entertainment and allows Comcast to continue to 
      bring our vision of TV Everywhere to Xfinity customers whether at home 
      or on the go.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Anne Sweeney, Co-Chairman, Disney Media Networks and President, 
      Disney/ABC Television Group, added, &#8220;This landmark deal is a great 
      example of what can be achieved when programmers and distributors 
      collaborate and innovate together to meet the ever-evolving needs of 
      consumers and enhance the viewing experience. By combining the best 
      news, sports and entertainment content available today with cutting-edge 
      technologies, we&#8217;re able to fully realize our comprehensive TV+ 
      initiative, and introduce a brand new suite of authenticated services to 
      Comcast subscribers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Added George Bodenheimer, Executive Chairman, ESPN, Inc., &#8220;Given the 
      scope of assets Comcast and Disney/ABC/ESPN are making available to 
      consumers, this agreement is unprecedented in our industry. It 
      reinforces the value of the multichannel subscription and takes full 
      advantage of new technologies, which serve all of our viewers.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;* Says Comet produced and sold 94,000 fake recovery CDs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Comet says to defend its position&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Parent Kesa's shares down 6 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Himank Sharma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it is
suing Britain's second-largest electricals retailer Comet for
allegedly creating and selling "counterfeit" recovery CDs of its
flagship Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on its website, Microsoft said the retailer
created more than 94,000 sets of Windows Vista and XP recovery
CDs and sold them to customers buying Windows-loaded PCs and
laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recovery disk is used to reinstall the operating system in
a PC in case of system failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is disappointing that a well-known retailer
created so many unwitting victims of counterfeiting," David
Finn, associate general counsel at Microsoft for worldwide
anti-piracy &amp; anti-counterfeiting, told Reuters in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2008 and 2009, Comet approached tens of thousands of
customers who had bought PCs with the necessary recovery
software already on the hard drive, and offered to sell them
unnecessary recovery discs for &#163;14.99," Finn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comet is owned by Kesa Electricals, Europe's No. 3
electricals retailer, but is in the process of being sold to
private equity group OpCapita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Kesa spokesman told Reuters that Comet provided the disks
as a service to its customers between March 2008 and December
2009, but stopped the practice when Microsoft objected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Comet sold the disks as many buyers of PCs and
laptops did not create their own recovery CDs and faced problems
when their computers failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a number of disks made, on which there was a cost
and Comet charged this to the customer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comet believes the supply of the recovery CDs was in the
best interests of its customers and "has a good sense of its
claim and will defend its position vigorously," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Finn said customers can secure the recovery
disks directly from computer manufacturers for free or a minimal
amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was filed in the high court in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kesa shares closed down 7 percent at 67.43 pence on the
London Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Microsoft shares were up
about 2 percent at $27.22 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;

			Lannett Reaches Special Protocol Assessment Agreement with FDA for 
      Cocaine HCl Phase III Trial
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE AMEX: LCI) today announced that it has 
      reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on a 
      Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), regarding the design of a Phase III 
      study of the company&#8217;s Cocaine HCl topical solution product, C-Topical&#8482;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Phase III trial will be a randomized, prospective, multi-site, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of C-Topical&#8482; 
      Solution as an anesthetic prior to a diagnostic procedure or surgery. 
      The primary endpoint for the trial is analgesic success immediately 
      after application and sustained throughout the diagnostic procedure or 
      surgery. The study will enroll at least 500 subjects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The SPA agreement provides a clear registration pathway for our 
      C-Topical product, and demonstrates exemplary collaboration and 
      cooperation between the FDA and Lannett,&#8221; said Arthur P. Bedrosian, 
      president and chief executive officer of Lannett. &#8220;We expect the 
      clinical trial to be completed, and to file a related 505(b)(2) New Drug 
      Application (NDA) in 2012. With this milestone, we can now look forward 
      to realizing the first of many future benefits of our newly-formed 
      clinical trial operations group within Lannett.&#8221;

			Goodwin Procter Invests in Youth Entrepreneurship Through Multilevel 
      National Partnership With BUILD
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goodwin 
      Procter LLP, an Am Law 50 firm, today announced a multilevel 
      national partnership with BUILD, 
      a nonprofit organization that uses entrepreneurship to challenge and 
      engage youth at some of the nation&#8217;s most troubled high schools. With 
      more than 1.2 million students dropping out of high school each year, 
      BUILD has helped 100 percent of its participating students complete high 
      school and get accepted into college.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goodwin Procter will contribute $40,000 and provide volunteers to 
      support BUILD business and academic programs. The firm&#8217;s attorneys and 
      staff in Boston, Washington, D.C. and the San Francisco Bay Area will 
      work with BUILD to help students create micro businesses and boost their 
      performance in school through regular tutoring, test prep and college 
      planning sessions. This partnership with BUILD is one of a number of 
      community and public service initiatives Goodwin will be undertaking in 
      connection with the firm&#8217;s celebration of its 100th 
      anniversary this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Founded in 1999 with four students, BUILD uses entrepreneurship to 
      propel disengaged, low-income youth through high school to college. 
      BUILD currently serves over 900 high school students in five locations. 
      By launching real start-up businesses, BUILD students learn to write 
      business plans, forecast financials and present to potential investors. 
      The experiential learning program engages the students by making school 
      relevant and motivating them to succeed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Eighty percent of BUILD students are the first in their family to go to 
      college, and yet last year 84 percent were accepted into at least one 
      four-year college or university.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are proud to partner with an organization that has made education a 
      priority for students who would not otherwise graduate high school and 
      go to college,&#8221; said Regina 
      M. Pisa, Chairman and Managing Partner of Goodwin Procter. &#8220;BUILD 
      has motivated so many students to succeed in school and in life, and we 
      are confident that our contribution will help BUILD assist even more to 
      achieve a college education.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to receive this financial contribution from Goodwin 
      Procter and even more excited to connect our students with volunteers 
      from the firm. We look forward to the commitment and energy we know they 
      will contribute to our organization and students,&#8221; said Suzanne 
      McKechnie Klahr, CEO and Founder of BUILD.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			David 
      Cappillo, a partner in Goodwin Procter&#8217;s Technology Companies 
      practice, serves on BUILD&#8217;s Local Advisory Board, which includes venture 
      capitalists, college presidents, business leaders, entrepreneurs, 
      educators and opinion leaders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other BUILD corporate partners include ATT, Bank of America, Wells 
      Fargo, Citibank, State Street, Microsoft, Bain Capital Partners, Mintz 
      Levin and Skadden Arps law firms, and John Hancock Financial Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BUILD believes that the power of student ideas in action drives youth to 
      reach their fullest potential in school and beyond. Its four-year high 
      school program offers a unique blend of entrepreneurship, academics, and 
      personal support that attracts and motivates many students who are 
      otherwise at high risk of failing classes and dropping out of high 
      school. BUILD currently serves high school students at programs located 
      in East Palo Alto and Oakland, CA; Washington, D.C., and Boston, MA.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. oil group ExxonMobil (XOM.N) is in talks to sell most of its 50 percent stake in Japanese refiner TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK (5012.T), in a deal that could be worth as much as $5 billion, four sources with knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks see Exxon belatedly join international oil and gas industry peers in scaling back downstream activities such as crude processing and fuel marketing, to focus on more lucrative activities -- finding and pumping oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move could also spark realignment among Japan's oil refiners, which have been cutting capacity to cope with falling demand caused by a weak economy and a shift to more efficient and environmentally friendly forms of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral, which imports and distributes Exxon oil in Japan, ranks as the country's No. 2 refiner behind JX Holdings (5020.T). Smaller rivals include Idemitsu Kosan Co (5019.T), Cosmo Oil (5007.T) and Showa Shell (5002.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this report is true, it could open the door for TonenGeneral to realign in alliance with another company. That may or may not include capital ties," said Hidetoshi Shioda, senior analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAPITAL RELATIONSHIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), BP (BP.L) and Chevron (CVX.N) have sold, closed or put up for sale many refineries in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company by market value, has long been a strong advocate of the integrated oil model, in which companies are active in every stage of the business from well head to forecourt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned sale may be an acknowledgement of a widely held view that in markets with slow-growing or falling fuel demand such as Japan and Europe, refining investments will struggle to offer good returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips, the third-largest U.S. oil major, last year decided to spin off its refining operations into a separate company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxonholds 50.02 percent of TonenGeneral, a stake worth 224 billion yen ($2.9 billion) at Wednesday's close. It also owns a sales network of around 4,000 gas stations across Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is planning to keep a certain level of ownership in TonenGeneral, seen as key to maintaining the refining partnership, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the talks are still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of the deal could climb to as high as 400 billion yen, but may settle at a lower price depending on the size of the stake to be sold, negotiations over the other assets, and TonenGeneral's funding situation, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official announcement could come as early as this month, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral said in a statement that ExxonMobil was considering a change to its capital relationship with TonenGeneral, but nothing had been decided. Exxon stressed it had no plans to withdraw from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ExxonMobil has no plans to exit the Japan market. We have been doing business in Japan for over 118 years," the oil giant said in a statement to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FUNDING BURDEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of TonenGeneral fell 5.8 percent to 792 yen, its lowest close in 14 months, reflecting investor worries over the burden the deal would place on its finances. Trading in the shares was the busiest in at least 24 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral plans to borrow money from several banks to finance the purchase, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is hard to see the strategic direction of TonenGeneral after it buys the assets from Exxon. A deal in the order of 400 billion yen would also strain its cash situation and raise the risk of lower dividends," said Yoshihiro Okumura, head of research at Chibagin Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil demand in Japan, the world's No.3 consumer, has been falling steadily for more than a decade, to about 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) from a record 4.2 million bpd in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That slide has accelerated following a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March, which dented economic activity and prompted some manufacturers to shift factories abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources had said Exxon might look to scale back in Japan after the country introduced new regulations in 2010, with a 2014 deadline for refiners to boost their ability to process heavy oil by building new cracking units or scrapping capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The directive was seen as particularly burdensome for TonenGeneral due to its relatively low heavy oil processing capacity. The Exxon unit has been a vocal critic of the scheme, calling it unnecessary meddling by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the unfavorable operating environment in Japan, the relationship with TonenGeneral serves an important strategic purpose for Exxon, making it unlikely that it would look at a complete withdrawal, some analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If ExxonMobil pulled out, they would lose a good outlet, and they could no longer ask TonenGeneral to import ExxonMobil's equity crudes," independent oil economist Osamu Fujisawa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 76.7500 yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Osamu Tsukimori and James Topham in Tokyo, and Tom Bergin in London; Writing by Nathan Layne; Editing by Chris Gallagher and Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;

      Customers to the Next Level of Management and Virtualization
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Maker of SANsymphony-V Storage Hypervisor Extends its Commitment to 
      Microsoft Solutions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DataCore Software, one of the industry&#8217;s premier providers of storage 
      virtualization software, today announced that it has joined the 
      Microsoft System Center Alliance. By becoming a System Center Alliance 
      partner, DataCore strengthens its support for System Center and other 
      Microsoft solutions, enabling organizations of all sizes to achieve 
      their virtualization goals and take advantage of the cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Microsoft System Center Alliance is a network of leading IT vendors 
      whose solutions support and integrate with Microsoft System Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft partners with the world&#8217;s leading solution providers to bring 
      companies the IT tools they need for achieving business goals,&#8221; said 
      Andrew Conway, director of System Center product management at 
      Microsoft. &#8220;DataCore&#8217;s SANsymphony-V storage hypervisor complements 
      System Center, with additional tools that help businesses create, manage 
      and monitor a dynamic storage environment and reap the benefits of their 
      infrastructure investments.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Building on a 13-year history of creating innovative storage 
      virtualization solutions designed to work on Microsoft platforms, 
      DataCore&#8217;s SANsymphony&#8482;-V storage hypervisor enriches Microsoft&#8217;s 
      virtualization solution by harnessing the native capabilities of Windows 
      Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server Hyper-V to address critical storage 
      challenges. The DataCore&#8482; SANsymphony-V storage 
      hypervisor enhances the value of diverse storage resources by 
      unifying advanced services, such as provisioning, auto-tiering, 
      replication and performance acceleration, through a common storage 
      virtualization layer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recently, DataCore introduced the SANsymphony-V Monitoring Pack for 
      System Center Operations Manager 2008 R2, providing constant visibility 
      into the health, performance and availability of virtualized storage 
      resources from within System Center. The combined solution encompasses 
      both on-premise and cloud-based, off-premise components, including 
      redundant high-availability elements and those in remote disaster 
      recovery sites. Information appears on a &#8220;single pane of glass&#8221; 
      alongside other facets of the data center, simplifying end-to-end 
      service management of diverse storage environments. DataCore&#8217;s 
      SANsymphony-V Monitoring Pack easily integrates with System Center 
      Operations Manager 2007 and the upcoming System Center Operations 
      Manager 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, SANsymphony-V&#8217;s snapshot and volume shadow copy service 
      capabilities work with System Center Data Protection Manager 2010 to 
      ensure consistent, seamless backups without disrupting any applications 
      running at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since its founding, DataCore storage virtualization solutions have been 
      designed to support and integrate with Microsoft solutions,&#8221; said Carlos 
      Carreras, vice president of alliances  business development for 
      DataCore Software. &#8220;Becoming a System Center Alliance Partner was a very 
      logical step, and as organizations continue to explore and build private 
      clouds, they will look to Microsoft and DataCore to help them succeed.&#8221;

			Mattern  Associates Conducts Open RFP Process for Wilentz, Goldman  
      Spitzer P.A. Resulting in Significant Cost Savings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Firm Saves 25-30% in Offsite Storage Fees and Reduces Permanent 
      Withdrawal Fees by 35%
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Industry leading legal support services consulting firm Mattern 
       Associates, LLC (www.matternassoc.com) 
      announces that it has successfully completed an open offsite records 
      storage RFP for law firm Wilentz, Goldman  Spitzer. At the end of the 
      project, Wilentz re-selected its incumbent vendor with a contract that 
      provided net savings of 25-30% in offsite storage fees for the firm, and 
      a 35% reduction in permanent withdrawal fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wilentz had a long term relationship with its incumbent offsite records 
      storage provider; however, the management team wanted to be sure the 
      provider&#8217;s pricing was in sync with current market benchmarks. The firm 
      ultimately brought in Mattern  Associates to conduct an open RFP 
      process, to make sure the rates they were agreeing to were in line with 
      industry benchmarks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ron Henry, Executive Director at Wilentz, comments, &#8220;We had a fairly 
      reasonable rate and were pleased with our provider&#8217;s services, but our 
      contract had not been renewed or reviewed in a long time. We felt we 
      wanted to bring in a consultant with the breadth of experience and 
      industry knowledge to engage in a full renegotiation, which is why we 
      contacted Mattern.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bob Tivey, IT and Facilities Director at Wilentz, adds, &#8220;We decided to 
      hire the consultants at Mattern  Associates since they are experts in 
      offsite storage facilities contracts. We also felt comfortable with the 
      business model of Mattern&#8217;s consultancy: a one-time, fixed fee that 
      would be realized immediately through the deal struck with the vendor. 
      We were very pleased with the results all around.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rob Mattern, President of Mattern  Associates, remarks, &#8220;This was our 
      first project with Wilentz, Goldman  Spitzer and are pleased with the 
      results we delivered for the firm. Service rates in offsite records 
      storage have changed dramatically in the past five years; we&#8217;re glad to 
      offer expert guidance and information throughout the RFP process. The 
      consultants of Mattern  Associates look forward to working on more 
      projects in the future with the excellent leadership team at Wilentz.&#8221;

			Silicon Biosystems to Present at J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Silicon Biosystems, Inc., a provider of specialized molecular and 
      cellular biology technology, announced today the company will present at 
      the 30th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, January 11, 2012, at 
      8 a.m. at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. Senior 
      management will present an overview of the company's business and its 
      proprietary platform used in the clinical research of rare cells, such 
      as circulating tumor cells, stem cells and fetal cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Silicon Biosystems is a medical device manufacturer leading the field in 
      the detection and isolation of single cells for cancer research and 
      prenatal testing. The company&#8217;s DEPArray&#8482; technology exploits 
      microelectronics and the principles of dielectrophoresis to find, sort, 
      isolate, and collect rare cells, e.g. circulating tumor cells (CTCs), 
      for further molecular analyses. The collection of pure populations of 
      target cells from biological samples provides more information about the 
      clinical utility of these cell populations beyond existing cell counting 
      technologies and will be an enabling technology for personalized therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are multiple large and growing market opportunities for technology 
      that find and isolate rare cells for molecular analysis. Silicon 
      Biosystems&#8217; products are used for research applications in metastatic 
      cancer, cardiovascular disease, prenatal diagnostics, and stem 
      cells.&#160;Fox Chase Cancer Center purchased the DEPArray system in 
      September 2011 for use in their clinical research to collect CTCs and 
      advance the understanding of micrometastatic cancer. In November 2011, 
      Baylor College of Medicine announced the purchase of Silicon Biosystems 
      DEPArray&#8482; technology for use in research programs related to finding and 
      characterizing rare fetal cells in maternal blood for use in prenatal 
      diagnostics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Silicon Biosystems
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Silicon Biosystems, Inc. was formed in October of 2010 as a wholly owned 
      subsidiary of Silicon Biosystems, S.p.A. based in Bologna, Italy. The 
      company manufactures and sells the DEPArray&#8482; platform which is based on 
      the principle of dielectrophoresis to isolate and manipulate cells in 
      suspension with a microelectronic array. The approach, patented by 
      Silicon Biosystems, offers the unique ability to control individual 
      cells and micro-particles inside a disposable cartridge. The DEPArray&#8482; 
      platform makes it possible to find, sort, select and separate individual 
      cells for further analysis or culturing. Silicon Biosystems is one of 
      the most innovative start-ups in the field of "lab-on-a-chip," based on 
      active substrates, as testified by a number of awards and recognitions.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - MF Global unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of securities to Goldman Sachs in the days leading up to its collapse, according to two former MF Global employees with direct knowledge of the transactions. But it did not immediately receive payment from its clearing firm and lender, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of securities to Goldman occurred on October 27, just days before MF Global Holdings Ltd MFGLQ.PK filed for bankruptcy on October 31, the ex-employees said. One of the employees said the transaction was cleared with JPMorgan Chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time MF Global, which was run by former Goldman Sachs head Jon Corzine, was selling securities to Goldman to raise badly needed cash, the futures firm was also drawing down a $1.2 billion revolving line of credit it had with JPMorgan, according to one of the former MF Global employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Mary Sedarat said the bank did not withold money because of the line of credit. She declined further comment on details of the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has fought aggressively in bankruptcy court to protect its interests, and received a lien on some of MF Global's assets in exchange for granting the firm $8 million to fund its bankruptcy costs. The lien puts JPMorgan's interests ahead of MF Global customers who have not yet received an estimated $900 million worth of money from their accounts, which remain frozen as regulators search for missing funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hastily crafted transactions and the seeming inability of MF Global to recoup some of the money in the sale to Goldman may start to explain why so much money remains unaccounted for at the futures firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what type of assets Goldman bought from MF Global, but the securities were worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the former employees said. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal previously reported that George Soros' fund was a buyer of securities sold by MF Global, scooping-up some of its European sovereign debt at a deep discount. Panic among investors and clients about MF Global's $6.3 billion bet on European sovereign bonds led to its demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corzine, who was CEO of MF Global at the time of the collapse, headed Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999 before being ousted after a power struggle with co-CEO Henry Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corzine and other top MF Global executives reached out in desperation to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan, as well as Jefferies Group Inc JEF.N Barclays Plc (BARC.L), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX), State Street Corp (STT.N) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N), as potential buyers in its final days as the firm teetered toward collapse, Reuters earlier reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Henry; editing by Martin Howell and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

			Forward-Looking Statement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This news release includes &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the 
      meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private 
      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, 
      but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger 
      between Merck and Schering-Plough, including future financial and 
      operating results, the combined company&#8217;s plans, objectives, 
      expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical 
      facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and 
      expectations of Merck&#8217;s management and are subject to significant risks 
      and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the 
      forward-looking statements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to 
      differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the 
      possibility that the expected synergies from the merger of Merck and 
      Schering-Plough will not be realized, or will not be realized within the 
      expected time period; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation 
      and health care legislation; the risk that the businesses will not be 
      integrated successfully; disruption from the merger making it more 
      difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; Merck&#8217;s 
      ability to accurately predict future market conditions; dependence on 
      the effectiveness of Merck&#8217;s patents and other protections for 
      innovative products; the risk of new and changing regulation and health 
      policies in the U.S. and internationally and the exposure to litigation 
      and/or regulatory actions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking 
      statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
      otherwise. Additional factors that could cause results to differ 
      materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be 
      found in Merck&#8217;s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the company&#8217;s other 
      filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) available at

			Rocket Software Completes Acquisition of IBM iCluster
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rocket Software, Inc. (www.rocketsoftware.com) 
      announced today that it has closed the acquisition of the iCluster 
      business from IBM. iCluster offers software for High 
      Availability/Disaster Recovery (HA/DR) for IBM i. The iCluster team will 
      be joining Rocket Software's global organization of more than 900 
      employees and become a new brand &#8211; Rocket iCluster &#8211; within the Rocket 
      Storage, Networks and Compliance group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Andy Youniss, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rocket Software, 
      said, "We are excited to announce this strategic acquisition. We believe 
      that iCluster&#8217;s HA/DR offerings are a perfect complement to Rocket&#8217;s 
      storage solutions and will help address the business continuity needs of 
      our customers. In addition, developing and providing solutions for IBM i 
      is a core focus area for Rocket, where we have multiple brands on this 
      platform. We plan to continue investing in Rocket iCluster to deliver 
      new features and functionality and will work to further enhance this 
      solution for HA/DR on IBM i. Most importantly, we want to assure our new 
      Rocket iCluster business partners and customers that Rocket Software is 
      committed to helping you achieve success with this solution."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the coming months, Rocket Software will be working to establish 
      direct relationships with iCluster partners, and introduce them to 
      Rocket Software. During the transition of business operations, partners 
      may continue to order iCluster from IBM as they do today. In addition, 
      Rocket is working closely with IBM to ensure that customer support needs 
      are seamlessly managed and support delivery is unaffected. In most 
      cases, the product contacts with whom partners work today will not 
      change given that the entire iCluster team has joined Rocket Software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rocket will be hosting two webinars for customers and partners to 
      introduce Rocket, discuss the acquisition and answer any questions. To

			News Facts:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Quest Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: 
        QSFT) today announced a new release of Quest&#174; 
        Site Administrator for SharePoint, a Microsoft SharePoint 
        management solution, to include central reporting capabilities for 
        SharePoint Online in Microsoft Office 365. The product helps users 
        understand, manage and secure multiple SharePoint installations from a 
        single product whether on-premises, in the cloud, or a hybrid of both.
      
			
        Site Administrator for SharePoint gives users an overview of their 
        existing environment by providing metrics, trends and other insights 
        into Office 365 usage, data growth, and storage distribution, which 
        enables organizations to efficiently manage their SharePoint Online 
        licenses.
      
			
        As organizations adopt this technology, one key area of focus will be 
        maximizing efficiencies. Quest&#8217;s Site Administrator empowers 
        SharePoint administrators to understand if that investment is being 
        used, or needs to be expanded, by aggregating license and storage 
        information from across all site collections and displaying it through 
        centralized charts and reports.
      
			
        As more organizations consider moving to SharePoint Online, many will 
        deploy proof-of-concept and pilot projects that result in hybrid 
        environments, spanning both on-premise and cloud deployments. Site 
        Administrator makes it easy for businesses to centrally monitor and 
        manage their environments regardless of whether SharePoint is based 
        on-premises, online, or both.

      &#8220;With this first-to-market Office 365 reporting capability, Quest Site 
      Administrator for SharePoint will help IT managers be confident as they 
      take the first step to the cloud. This single tool helps them understand 
      and manage their existing on-premise environments and prepare for 
      migrations to SharePoint Online in Office 365. Once there, users will 
      better understand the value of their new environments, fostering 
      maturity and growth in the market for hybrid and cloud environments.&#8221;

      SharePoint customers can use it to aggregate data from across multiple 
      site collections to produce an easy-to-view report which helps them 
      maximize their investment in Office 365.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt; In the constant game of thrones that is the Silicon Valley tech giants battle for dominance, 2012 could be the year that Microsoft comes back from exile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Having lost its beat about a decadeago, the software giant has more recently been plotting an aggressive grab for territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And its getting back in the game with actual innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flush with capital from its steady core businesses of software and servers, the company has been quietly busy with research and development in recent months and years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results are showing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Windows 8, expected to come out in February in beta, is meant to operate at the heart of a Microsoft-wide ecosystem, one that bids to challenge Apples intuitive array of linked devices and functions.In introducing 8 at a developers conference in Anaheimin September, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer (pictured)was expansive, promising, If Windows 8 is Windows re-imagined, were also in the process of re-imagining Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The X Box 360s upgrade, via an improved dashboard and the Kinect add-on, is ahead of the pack as a user-friendly voice- and gesture-controlled device and stokingenthusiasm not only among the early adopters and tech geek websites but on Wall Street. With its inviting user interface, it set a record for Black Friday weekend console sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Story continues after video.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand was so great that the national Black Friday X Box stampede, in which 800,000 units were sold, included what may be the first single-person-shooter shopping brawl, in which a Los Angeles woman pepper-sprayed the competition in a frenzy over half-price X Box 360s at a Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The X Box is optimized for television and already connected to 50 million TV sets, says influential tech consultant and former head of digital for Oprahs network Robert Tercek. If they can get everybody to sign up for their service [no mean feat with an upfront $60 fee to join X Box Gold and monthly charges for access to some channels], they could be as big a player as Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Nor is the company shrinking from a battle for mobile phone -- and tablet -- business now dominated by Apple and Googles Android.The Lumia, which has been out in Europe in the form of the 710 and a fancier 800 model (introducedin London Nov. 30 with Deadmaus deejaying), will be available Jan. 11 in the U.S. at $49.99 with a two-year plan and is aimed at first-time buyers. (Upgraded versions are said to be on the way this spring.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its the first phone since the introduction of the iPhone to give Tercek gadget lust.Have you seen the phone? he asked TheWrap, pointing to the OLED screen thats easily read in sunlight and the tactile response of the touch screen compared to the iPhones hard glass and the operating system. Its a wonder to behold -- a terrific comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently the Lumia runs on Windows Phone, but like the rest of the Microsoft offerings to come, it likely will move to the Windows 8 format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ive talked to people who are on the inside as developers and designers of the phone and theyre pretty excited,Fred Hickey, who writes the widely read newsletter High Tech Strategist, told TheWrap. So even people who were skeptical about Microsoft in the past are excited about these new offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if a report of a leaked internal document is correct, the companys planning to stack the deck for Lumia, combining with its phone partners whats described as a $200 million marketing tsunami in the U.S. alone for Lumia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, reinforcing the sense of companys refreshed zeal to compete in the phone arena, a Wall Street Journalreportcited secret talks that Microsoft and Nokia were holding to acquire struggling competitor and BlackBerry maker Research in Motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Even the search business that some thought Microsoft had largely ceded to Google is beginning to look more robust. Partly thanks to a useful partnership with Facebook and partly to a mandate to give customers more practical -- and fewer unfiltered -- results, its Bing has been growing in market share, mostly at the expense of Yahoo, in some part thanks to a re-energized ad campaign. (Though a Sunday New York Times piece on Googles new ad campaign for search noted, An added incentive is that Googles main rival, Microsofts Bing, also has a new ad campaign.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, so promising is 2012 for Microsoft that Standard  Poors equity analyst Angelo Zino has a Buy rating on the company, based both on the companys core business andthe new initiatives, especially the much revamped new operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Windows 8 is the best thing theyve got out there, and its really going to be critical. Its almost like an all-in kind of approach,and its one of those things where theyve got to get this right, and if they dont theyre going to miss the boat on the whole mobile space, Zino told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But its not just the products. Another change at the company is a more measured approach to going public with its innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, a giant presence at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, recently said next weeks gathering will be its last, claiming the massive conventions timing is not always in sync with its product announcements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And until scattered recent announcements focusing on Windows 8 and mobile, the reinvigoration of the company has been mostly behind the scenes. Not surprising, since Microsoft may have been feeling chastened by some past -- and more ballyhooed -- attempts at rejiggering its profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ironically, though its only three places beneath Apple in the Fortune 500 -- at No. 38, with $62 billion in revenue, thanks mostly to its core software and server businesses -- its steadily strong profits have been overshadowed by the failure of such ancillary products as the Zune MP3 player and the Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The recent acquisition of Skype for a pricey $8.5 billion also drew fire. By the time the Redmond, Wash., giant announced a deal with struggling Finnish phone manufacturer Nokia this past February, Microsoft had pissed away the previous 10 years in mobile with one humiliating failure after another, Tercek told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Mobile was a joke, the Windows phone was a joke, and they were humiliated, he added. So when the Nokia deal was announced the general reaction was, Great, you tie two stones together, they still cant float.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer has been the focus of much shareholder criticism and was eventargetedin May by feared hedge-fund activist David Einhorn, not just for the stolid share price thats long hovered under $30, but for overseeing the companys $2.56 billion loss in their search unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No serious observers believed the fantasy solution that founder Bill Gates would step back in. Instead, it was announcedlast month that Andy Lees, head of the companys Windows Phone division for the past three years, will bemovedinto a time-critical mission to further integrate Windows 8 with mobile devices, in line with what Lees earlier this year described as a single ecosystem integrating phones, televisions and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, all this intuitive gadgetry, is helping people forget the Microsoft of yore with the blue screen of death, Tercek told TheWrap. With all these great user interface advances, theyre showing they can continue to innovate.&lt;/p&gt; Related Articles: Xbox Live Unveils Latest Cable Challenge, Complete With Voice Control&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - The chief executives of BP and ConocoPhillips, two of Alaska's three major oil producers, said on Thursday that the only profitable way to exploit a vast but stranded quantity of Alaska's North Slope natural gas is to export it to Asian Pacific markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a dramatic change from decades-old plans to send North Slope natural gas to domestic U.S. markets by overland pipeline through Canada, the BP and ConocoPhillips CEOs said they will work with Exxon Mobil, the third major North Slope oil producer, to develop an LNG project that would export to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North American producers and LNG shippers are scrambling to develop export plans after a sudden surge in domestic natural gas production, thanks to shale gas, that swamped the market and pushed gas prices way below global levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP CEO Bob Dudley and ConocoPhillips CEO Jim Mulva made the comments to reporters after an unprecedented meeting in Anchorage of the chief executives of all three major North Slope oil producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dudley, Mulva and Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson held a two-hour meeting with Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell, then spoke at a larger closed-door meeting with state legislators and local business leaders. Dudley and Mulva spoke separately to reporters after the second meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My sense is liquefying the gas and marketing the gas is most economic, given where the resources are," Dudley said. "It looks like (with) the economics today, given what has happened with shale gas in the Lower 48 and the high price of gas in Asia, that looks like the most economic way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we see is a strong, good Asian Pacific market and that's where we think Alaska gas should go," Mulva said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exporting Alaska natural gas as LNG to Asia "is the best alternative for commercializing Alaska North Slope natural gas. It's certainly better than any alternative" for shipping gas to U.S. domestic markets, Mulva said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An LNG project would require a pipeline shipping natural gas about 800 miles from Prudhoe Bay to a port in southern Alaska, such as the existing deepwater ports at Valdez in Prince William Sound or Kenai in Cook Inlet. It would require a plant at tidewater to liquefy natural gas and a fleet of LNG tankers to move the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, whose CEO Rex Tillerson also attended the meeting, said the parties are in early discussions on an export plan, but added that the pipeline plan through Canada is still under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor in October announced that he believed further efforts to build a pipeline shipping North Slope natural gas to U.S. markets might be futile. On Thursday, he said he has become more convinced since then that LNG exports to Asia represent Alaska's best option to sell its abundant North Slope natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But TransCanada Corp. Vice President Tony Palmer, that company's executive in charge of Alaska development, said he was not convinced that natural gas markets had changed permanently and that an overland pipeline to North American markets was no longer feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is "no question" that natural gas prices are higher in Asian Pacific markets than in North American markets, things could change, said Palmer, who attended the closed-door meeting with legislators and community leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What will happen in 10 years is an open question, on both sides of the Pacific," Palmer told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TransCanada and Exxon Mobil continue to pursue their plans for a 1,700-mile pipeline, though they have been unsuccessful in attracting shipper commitments, Palmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once expected to be a major importer, the United States now has up to a century's worth of supply, prompting plans to ship the cheap fuel to thirsty markets in Europe and Asia where prices are up to five times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five projects across the United States and two in western Canada have applied for construction and export licenses, seeking long-term deals predominantly with buyers in Asia[ID:nS1E78P0MZ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, critics say that exporting gas may drive prices higher at home and discourage use of a homegrown resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TransCanada Corp and partner Exxon Mobil have been unable to win customers for the 1,700-mile natural gas pipeline they proposed building from Alaska's North Slope to Alberta, at a cost of up to $41 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP and ConocoPhillips in May abandoned a rival natural-gas proposal for a similar route and similar delivery volumes after they also failed to attract shipping commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TransCanada has also floated the concept of a line to the port of Valdez, which would move 3 billion cubic feet of gas a day and cost up to $26 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Bill Rigby, additional reporting by Edward McAllister in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Bob Burgdorfer and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - "Chairman Fu" is stepping on the gas at Sinopec's M machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $2.2 billion deal with U.S. oil and natural gas producer Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) this week is the Chinese group's 11th deal since June and takes spending on acquisitions to $10.4 billion in that time, according to Thomson Reuters - more M volume than Sinopec's two Chinese rivals, Exxon-Mobil (XOM.N), BP (BP.L), Shell (RDSa.L) and Chevron (CVX.N) combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) (600028.SS) (0386.HK), the country's largest oil company by sales, has long been China's most acquisitive energy company, launching 74 deals worth $48.1 billion since 2005, putting it ahead of all oil and gas majors over that period, including Exxon-Mobil, which is credited with 17 deals worth $44 billion, Thomson Reuters data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since last spring, Sinopec and its subsidiaries have accelerated the overseas push, coinciding with the arrival in April of its new chairman, Fu Chengyu, who moved over from China's third-largest oil and gas group, China National Offshore Company (CNOOC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's pretty hands on for a chairman," said an investment banker who has worked with Fu, adding that Fu is a consummate dealmaker. "He's more dynamic, proactive, and Western" than a lot of his peers, the banker noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in 1951, Fu earned a degree in geology from the Northeast Petroleum Institute in China and has a master's degree from the University of South California. He worked in China's vast Daqing oil fields and has accumulated more than three decades of experience in the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than three weeks before the Devon Energy announcement, Sinopec teamed up with Hong Kong's ENN Energy Holdings (2688.HK) in another $2.2 billion deal - an unsolicited offer for China Gas Holdings (0384.HK), a rare move among China's corporates, which tend to strike deals on more friendly terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest profile hostile energy bid by a Chinese company was the $18.5 billion offer by CNOOC in 2005 for U.S.-based Unocal Oil Co. That attempt, which failed after a snowballing of opposition in the U.S. Congress, was led by Fu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China's goal is not to overturn the world order, but to participate in this world order, and to reinforce it and even to profit from it," Fu told a Houston energy conference in 2006 to reassure the oil industry in the wake of CNOOC's bold bid for Unocal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing before executives from his biggest Western competitors, Fu played up what he called the commonalities between his company and its Western counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are bound together with most of the oilmen in this room," he told the conference. "Like you, we must replace our reserves aggressively ... and protect shareholder interests in the face of high risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHIFTING FOCUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu's focus of late has specifically targeted Sinopec's build up of more unconventional assets, such as shale gas exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinopec's deal team is highly respected among Asia's investment bankers, having built a franchise that has become more deal savvy in China's relatively nascent M market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They know what they want and they know how to get what they want," said one source close to Sinopec's strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu, a fit man with thick, parted black hair, oversees the company's overall acquisition strategy, leaving deal execution to his seasoned M team. Xianliang Geng, a general manager at Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corp, the division pursuing the Devon Energy investment, is among the company's top M specialists who, according to one source, led the $3.5 billion acquisition of a Brazilian oil asset in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a strategy guy by title, Fu does not hesitate to get involved in deals himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is certainly the dealmaker in the China Gas situation," one Hong Kong-based M adviser told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Sinopec has pursued, in a matter of weeks, its first U.S. deal and its first hostile offer shows Fu's influence playing out, sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu, who is married and has a daughter, joined CNOOC in 1982 and held several posts before becoming chairman in 2003. He earned a reputation as an energetic trouble-shooter before his elevation to the top job. He also helped lead CNOOC's initial public offering in 2001 after a failed attempt two years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEARNING POINTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also shows more broadly how China has become more experienced in the art of deal making, gathering the tricks of the trade as well as engaging, along the way, savvy financial advisers, lawyers and public relations executives to overcome political, regulatory and shareholder hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu appears to have learned from the foiled Unocal bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the Devon Energy deal is that Sinopec is not buying the company outright, rather taking a one-third stake, which will likely attract less attention from local or government officials, shareholders and residents. The $3.5 billion Brazil deal was also for a 33 percent stake in a unit of Portuguese oil company Galp Energia (GALP.LS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fluent, if heavily-accented, English speaker, Fu meets more frequently with investors and the media than did his CNOOC predecessor Wei Liucheng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are quite effective, managed conversations, whereas most of the time five years back, that was not the case. Decisions then took place in opaque space," one person familiar with the China Gas situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here, you have a team of dealmakers around the table on the phone," the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinopec and local peer China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) raked in more deals than CNOOC during Fu's years there, though CNOOC, as a smaller company in both market value and reserves, was able to seal joint venture deals and acquisitions that bankers say allowed it to keep pace with its larger rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Fu now at the helm of Sinopec, he has a bigger platform to stand on, and the deals are likely to keep coming as Sinopec aims to more than double its equity oil output from overseas projects to over 1 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For investment bankers, Sinopec is a top client and a trusted counterparty to bring into any auction. Sinopec has been splitting the business among global investment banks without relying heavily on any single adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last three deals, Sinopec has used three different advisers: Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) is advising Sinopec on Devon, Citigroup (C.N) on China Gas, and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) on Galp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can sit in an equal position when discussing cooperation with our foreign peers," Fu told the China Daily newspaper last year. "That was hard to imagine a decade earlier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Wan Xu in Beijing; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

			SAVO Honors IBM and Staples for Driving Sales Enablement Innovation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SAVO 
      Group, a market leader in sales 
      enablement solutions and consultative services, announced that both 
      IBM and Staples Advantage are the 2011 recipients of the company&#8217;s 
      annual &#8220;Pioneer Award.&#8221; The award recognizes organizations that have 
      pushed sales enablement innovation, vision and leadership.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IBM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM knew that its sellers spent substantial time managing internal 
      processes, such as developing presentations and finding brand-compliant&#160;proposals, 
      which took time away from selling. Since first piloting a successful 
      SAVO solution&#160;in 2006 with 150 employees, IBM now has more than 40,000 
      SAVO users across the globe and the solution has dramatically improved 
      the efficiency of its sales presentation and proposal generation 
      processes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IBM is pleased to accept the SAVO Pioneer Award. We believe that 
      enabling our global sales force with high quality materials not only 
      helps drive efficiency and sales productivity, but more importantly, 
      allows us to deliver greater value to our clients. We welcome this 
      recognition from SAVO,&#8221; said Steve Rosenberg, Manager of Request 
      Management, Data Mart, Proposal Reuse, and Services Solutions at IBM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Staples Advantage
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Staples Advantage, the business-to-business division of Staples, Inc., 
      first rolled out its SAVO solution to a select group of employees in 
      January 2008. Shortly thereafter the company acquired Corporate Express 
      and relied on SAVO to ramp 
      sellers and effectively manage the communication and change process. 
      By June 2009, Staples extended SAVO&#8217;s solution into various divisions 
      and expanded globally in early 2010. The solution now serves as a 
      platform to connect sales and marketing when rolling out new initiatives 
      to the field to drive consistent messaging and branding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IBM and Staples have pushed sales enablement to evolve from a 
      revenue-generating tool used by individual salespeople, to a revenue 
      management platform directing enterprise growth,&#8221; said Mark O&#8217;Connell, 
      CEO of SAVO. &#8220;Both of these organizations have established best-in-class 
      sales enablement strategies and as collaborative partners have 
      challenged SAVO to stay on top of our game. We&#8217;re honored to recognize 
      them as true pioneers and look forward to strengthening our relationship 
      in the future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sales enablement bridges the gap between the C-suite&#8217;s strategic revenue 
      initiatives and their execution in the field. Effectively managing the 
      implementation of these initiatives requires sales enablement technology 
      and functional alignment to ensure success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About SAVO

      enablement technology and consulting solutions. SAVO&#8217;s on-demand sales 
      enablement platform maximizes the sales team&#8217;s ability to communicate

&lt;p&gt;* Sinopec has racked up deals worth $10.4 bln since June&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Most acquisitive energy major in past 6 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Recent deals are sign of growing China M maturity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Denny Thomas and Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Jan 5 (Reuters) - "Chairman Fu" is stepping
on the gas at Sinopec's M machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A $2.2 billion deal with U.S. oil and natural gas producer
Devon Energy Corp this week is the Chinese group's 11th
deal since June and takes spending on acquisitions to $10.4
billion in that time, according to Thomson Reuters - more M
volume than Sinopec's two Chinese rivals, Exxon-Mobil,
BP, Shell and Chevron combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) ,
the country's largest oil company by sales, has long been
China's most acquisitive energy company, launching 74 deals
worth $48.1 billion since 2005, putting it ahead of all oil and
gas majors over that period, including Exxon-Mobil, which is
credited with 17 deals worth $44 billion, Thomson Reuters data
show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since last spring, Sinopec and its subsidiaries have
accelerated the overseas push, coinciding with the arrival in
April of its new chairman, Fu Chengyu, who moved over from
China's third-largest oil and gas group, China National Offshore
Company (CNOOC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's pretty hands on for a chairman," said an investment
banker who has worked with Fu, adding that Fu is a consummate
dealmaker. "He's more dynamic, proactive, and Western" than a
lot of his peers, the banker noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in 1951, Fu earned a degree in geology from the
Northeast Petroleum Institute in China and has a master's degree
from the University of South California. He worked in China's
vast Daqing oil fields and has accumulated more than three
decades of experience in the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than three weeks before the Devon Energy announcement,
Sinopec teamed up with Hong Kong's ENN Energy Holdings 
in another $2.2 billion deal - an unsolicited offer for China
Gas Holdings, a rare move among China's corporates,
which tend to strike deals on more friendly terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest profile hostile energy bid by a Chinese company
was the $18.5 billion offer by CNOOC in 2005 for U.S.-based
Unocal Oil Co. That attempt, which failed after a snowballing of
opposition in the U.S. Congress, was led by Fu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China's goal is not to overturn the world order, but to
participate in this world order, and to reinforce it and even to
profit from it," Fu told a Houston energy conference in 2006 to
reassure the oil industry in the wake of CNOOC's bold bid for
Unocal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing before executives from his biggest Western
competitors, Fu played up what he called the commonalities
between his company and its Western counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are bound together with most of the oilmen in this
room," he told the conference. "Like you, we must replace our
reserves aggressively ... and protect shareholder interests in
the face of high risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHIFTING FOCUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu's focus of late has specifically targeted Sinopec's build
up of more unconventional assets, such as shale gas exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinopec's deal team is highly respected among Asia's
investment bankers, having built a franchise that has become
more deal savvy in China's relatively nascent M market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They know what they want and they know how to get what they
want," said one source close to Sinopec's strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu, a fit man with thick, parted black hair, oversees the
company's overall acquisition strategy, leaving deal execution
to his seasoned M team. Xianliang Geng, a general manager at
Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corp,
the division pursuing the Devon Energy investment, is among the
company's top M specialists who, according to one source, led
the $3.5 billion acquisition of a Brazilian oil asset in
November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a strategy guy by title, Fu does not hesitate to get
involved in deals himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is certainly the dealmaker in the China Gas situation,"
one Hong Kong-based M adviser told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Sinopec has pursued, in a matter of weeks, its first
U.S. deal and its first hostile offer shows Fu's influence
playing out, sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu, who is married and has a daughter, joined CNOOC in 1982
and held several posts before becoming chairman in 2003. He
earned a reputation as an energetic trouble-shooter before his
elevation to the top job. He also helped lead CNOOC's initial
public offering in 2001 after a failed attempt two years
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEARNING POINTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also shows more broadly how China has become more
experienced in the art of deal making, gathering the tricks of
the trade as well as engaging, along the way, savvy financial
advisers, lawyers and public relations executives to overcome
political, regulatory and shareholder hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu appears to have learned from the foiled Unocal bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the Devon Energy deal is that Sinopec is not buying
the company outright, rather taking a one-third stake, which
will likely attract less attention from local or government
officials, shareholders and residents. The $3.5 billion Brazil
deal was also for a 33 percent stake in a unit of Portuguese oil
company Galp Energia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fluent, if heavily-accented, English speaker, Fu meets
more frequently with investors and the media than did his CNOOC
predecessor Wei Liucheng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are quite effective, managed conversations, whereas
most of the time five years back, that was not the case.
Decisions then took place in opaque space," one person familiar
with the China Gas situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here, you have a team of dealmakers around the table on the
phone," the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinopec and local peer China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC)
raked in more deals than CNOOC during Fu's years there, though
CNOOC, as a smaller company in both market value and reserves,
was able to seal joint venture deals and acquisitions that
bankers say allowed it to keep pace with its larger rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Fu now at the helm of Sinopec, he has a bigger platform
to stand on, and the deals are likely to keep coming as Sinopec
aims to more than double its equity oil output from overseas
projects to over 1 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For investment bankers, Sinopec is a top client and a
trusted counterparty to bring into any auction. Sinopec has been
splitting the business among global investment banks without
relying heavily on any single adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last three deals, Sinopec has used three different
advisers: Credit Suisse is advising Sinopec on Devon,
Citigroup on China Gas, and Societe Generale on
Galp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can sit in an equal position when discussing cooperation
with our foreign peers," Fu told the China Daily newspaper last
year. "That was hard to imagine a decade earlier."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Exxon sued govt over leases last year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Govt says settlement ensures timely development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ayesha Rascoe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and the
U.S. government struck a deal on Friday that would allow the
company to move ahead with development of a field in the Gulf of
Mexico estimated to yield tens of billions of dollars of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon sued the government last year after the Interior
Department canceled three of five leases for what is called the
Julia field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement will allow Exxon Mobil to develop this very
large, but technically challenging resource as quickly as
possible using a phased approach," Exxon Mobil spokesman Patrick
McGinn said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its lawsuit, Exxon argued that the department arbitrarily
deprived the company of its rights under the canceled leases and
took away Exxon's ability to produce a reservoir believed to
hold billions of barrels of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute arose after the government rejected Exxon's
October 2008 request for a "suspension of production".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following several appeals, the Interior Department concluded
in a decision last May that Exxon lacked a "commitment" to
producing oil at the time the leases expired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department said the proposed settlement
preserves the "important regulatory progress" made in the
decision last May that was challenged by Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement "provides incentives for timely and thorough
development of the leases, and secures a fair return on those
resources to the U.S. Treasury," the department said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and its partner Statoil ASA have spent more
than $300 million drilling two "producible" wells on the Julia
prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its development strategy, Exxon was planning to
drill three to six development wells and join them to a planned
production facility operated by Chevron Corp located
about eight miles away, according to the company's lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Brian Beletic, a director of music videos and commercials, will direct a Disney mountain-climbing movie inspired by its Matterhorn theme-park ride, TheWrap has confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referred to now only as "Untitled Explorers Project," it will mark the directorial feature-film debut for Beletic, who has made videos for Cee-Lo and Fatboy Slim, and commercials for Converse and Nike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also the third movie to be named after a Disneyland ride, following "Pirates of the Caribbean" and Eddie Murphy's mostly forgettable "Haunted Mansion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An action-adventure, the plot revolves around a group of young adventurers who trek through the back country of the Pennine Alps, a mountain range in Europe where the Matterhorn is located.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A federal court judge on Friday denied a Chevron Corp bid to prevent Ecuadorean plaintiffs from collecting on an $18 billion damages award against the U.S. oil giant over pollution in the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil company in November had asked Manhattan federal court judge Lewis Kaplan to freeze the plaintiffs' assets in order to be assured payment in the event it were to win its fraud lawsuit in federal court against the Ecuadoreans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorean appeals court on Tuesday upheld a ruling that Chevron should pay the $18 billion damages award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accused Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron in 2001, of dumping oil-drilling waste in unlined pits, polluting the forest and causing illness and deaths among indigenous people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's ruling came in a U.S. case Chevron has been pressing simultaneously with the proceedings in Ecuador. Chevron says the plaintiffs and their lawyers are guilty of racketeering and fraud in obtaining the South American judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Kaplan had previously sought to freeze the original judgment against Chevron, but the decision was overruled on appeal in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his ruling on Friday, Kaplan said that Chevron's move to freeze the assets had come too early because it had not proven its fraud case, nor had Chevron shown that it had already paid any amount to the plaintiffs, and would therefore potentially be entitled to future damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The court ... decided the motion on very narrow grounds and did not question the strength of Chevron's fraud evidence," a Chevron spokesman said in a statement. "Clearly the court has left the door open to a future attachment filing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the Ecuadorean plaintiffs said that Chevron's move was a legal tactic designed to stymie any enforcement of the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision is another rebuke for Chevron and it comes on the heels of a devastating defeat in the appellate court of Ecuador," said spokeswoman Karen Hinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has accused the Ecuadoreans and their long-time legal adviser, Steven Donziger, of illegally pressuring the Ecuadorean legal system to render a judgment in their favor. International arbitrators are expected to decide this month if they will weigh in on what has become a landmark international legal dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v. Steven Donziger et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-0691.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Basil Katz; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - In the constant game of thrones that is the Silicon Valley tech giants' battle for dominance, 2012 could be the year that Microsoft comes back from exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lost its beat about a decade ago, the software giant has more recently been plotting an aggressive grab for territory. And it's getting back in the game with actual innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flush with capital from its steady core businesses of software and servers, the company has been quietly busy with research and development in recent months and years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are showing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Windows 8, expected to come out in February in beta, is meant to operate at the heart of a Microsoft-wide ecosystem, one that bids to challenge Apple's intuitive array of linked devices and functions. In introducing 8 at a developer's conference in Anaheim in September, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was expansive, promising, "If Windows 8 is Windows re-imagined, we're also in the process of re-imagining Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The X Box 360's upgrade, via an improved dashboard and the Kinect add-on, is ahead of the pack as a user-friendly voice- and gesture-controlled device and stoking enthusiasm not only among the early adopters and tech geek websites but on Wall Street. With its inviting user interface, it set a record for Black Friday weekend console sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand was so great that the national Black Friday X Box stampede, in which 800,000 units were sold, included what may be the first single-person-shooter shopping brawl, in which a Los Angeles woman pepper-sprayed the competition in a frenzy over half-price X Box 360s at a Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The X Box is optimized for television and already connected to 50 million TV sets," says influential tech consultant and former head of digital for Oprah's network Robert Tercek. "If they can get everybody to sign up for their service (no mean feat with an upfront $60 fee to join X Box Gold and monthly charges for access to some channels), they could be as big a player as Netflix."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Nor is the company shrinking from a battle for mobile phone -- and tablet -- business now dominated by Apple and Google's Android. The Lumia, which has been out in Europe in the form of the 710 and a fancier 800 model (introduced in London November 30 with Deadmaus deejaying), will be available January 11 in the U.S. at $49.99 with a two-year plan and is aimed at first-time buyers. (Upgraded versions are said to be on the way this spring.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the first phone since the introduction of the iPhone to give Tercek gadget lust. "Have you seen the phone?" he asked TheWrap, pointing to the OLED screen that's easily read in sunlight and the tactile response of the touch screen compared to the iPhone's hard glass and the operating system. "It's a wonder to behold -- a terrific comeback."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently the Lumia runs on Windows Phone, but like the rest of the Microsoft offerings to come, it likely will move to the Windows 8 format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've talked to people who are on the inside as developers and designers of the phone and they're pretty excited," Fred Hickey, who writes the widely read newsletter High Tech Strategist, told TheWrap. "So even people who were skeptical about Microsoft in the past are excited about these new offerings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if a report of a leaked internal document is correct, the company is planning to stack the deck for Lumia, combining with its phone partners what's described as a $200 million "marketing tsunami" in the U.S. alone for Lumia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, reinforcing the sense of company's refreshed zeal to compete in the phone arena, a Wall Street Journal report cited secret talks that Microsoft and Nokia were holding to acquire struggling competitor and BlackBerry maker Research in Motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Even the search business that some thought Microsoft had largely ceded to Google is beginning to look more robust. Partly thanks to a useful partnership with Facebook and partly to a mandate to give customers more practical -- and fewer unfiltered -- results, its Bing has been growing in market share, mostly at the expense of Yahoo, in some part thanks to a re-energized ad campaign. (Though a Sunday New York Times piece on Google's new ad campaign for search noted, "An added incentive is that Google's main rival, Microsoft's Bing, also has a new ad campaign.")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, so promising is 2012 for Microsoft that Standard &amp; Poor's equity analyst Angelo Zino has a "Buy" rating on the company, based both on the company's core business and the new initiatives, especially the much revamped new operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Windows 8 is the best thing they've got out there, and it's really going to be critical. It's almost like an 'all-in' kind of approach, and it's one of those things where they've got to get this right, and if they don't they're going to miss the boat on the whole mobile space," Zino told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not just the products. Another change at the company is a more measured approach to going public with its innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, a giant presence at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, recently said next week's gathering will be its last, claiming the massive convention's timing is not always in sync with its product announcements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And until scattered recent announcements focusing on Windows 8 and mobile, the reinvigoration of the company has been mostly behind the scenes. Not surprising, since Microsoft may have been feeling chastened by some past -- and more ballyhooed -- attempts at rejiggering its profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, though it's only three places beneath Apple in the Fortune 500 -- at No. 38, with $62 billion in revenue, thanks mostly to its core software and server businesses -- its steadily strong profits have been overshadowed by the failure of such ancillary products as the Zune MP3 player and the Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent acquisition of Skype for a pricey $8.5 billion also drew fire. By the time the Redmond, Wash., giant announced a deal with struggling Finnish phone manufacturer Nokia this past February, "Microsoft had pissed away the previous 10 years in mobile with one humiliating failure after another," Tercek told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft Mobile was a joke, the Windows phone was a joke, and they were humiliated," he added. "So when the Nokia deal was announced the general reaction was, 'Great, you tie two stones together, they still can't float.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer has been the focus of much shareholder criticism and was even targeted in May by feared hedge-fund activist David Einhorn, not just for the stolid share price that's long hovered under $30, but for overseeing the company's $2.56 billion loss in their search unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No serious observers believed the fantasy solution that founder Bill Gates would step back in. Instead, it was announced last month that Andy Lees, head of the company's Windows Phone division for the past three years, will be moved into a "time-critical" mission to further integrate Windows 8 with mobile devices, in line with what Lees earlier this year described as "a single ecosystem" integrating phones, televisions and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, all this intuitive gadgetry, is helping people forget "the Microsoft of yore with the blue screen of death," Tercek told TheWrap. "With all these great user interface advances, they're showing they can continue to innovate."&lt;/p&gt;

			Axiometrics 
      Inc., a provider of data and analysis on the multifamily housing 
      sector, announced today that Keith 
      Walters, formerly president and COO of IT managed services provider 
      Sagiss, LLC, has been appointed chief operating officer. Walters was an 
      outside director of Axiometrics prior to becoming the company&#8217;s COO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Founded in 1995, Axiometrics provides the most comprehensive and timely 
      apartment market research available, enabling investors, property 
      owners, and developers to make better and more valuable business 
      decisions. Walters&#8217; primary responsibilities will be to continue growing 
      the company&#8217;s revenue stream, expanding its sales capability, delivering 
      new product offerings, and entering new markets and verticals. He will 
      also be responsible for adding the infrastructure necessary to support 
      Axiometics&#8217; rapid growth plans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Keith has been a key adviser in helping shape Axiometrics&#8217; growth, 
      which has averaged over 30% since 2008 but is up by 40% in 2011,&#8221; said Ron 
      Johnsey, founder and president of Axiometrics. &#8220;His operational 
      talents, technical background, and entrepreneurial spirit will be 
      invaluable in taking us to the next level and helping us pursue new 
      opportunities for the most sophisticated, cost-effective solutions 
      available for making investment and operational decisions in the 
      multifamily market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While at Sagiss, Walters led the company through a complete change in 
      its business delivery model, gaining recognition for the company in the 
      MSPMentor 100 as one of the top IT managed service providers in the U.S. 
      Prior to Sagiss, he served as vice president and general manager of 
      Global Program and Performance Management for Keane, a $1 billion, 
      Boston-based services company for which he was also a member of the 
      executive management team. Walters had previously built another 
      consulting firm into a regional leader prior to its acquisition by 
      Keane. A graduate of the University of Arkansas, Walters also has been 
      involved with numerous community and philanthropic organizations and 
      served on the City of Dallas&#8217; Permit License and Appeal Board.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I have worked as an outside adviser to Axiometrics since 2007 and am 
      excited about joining the company full-time to help build it into the 
      unquestioned leader for multifamily research, information, and 
      consulting services,&#8221; said Walters. &#8220;Ron Johnsey has a well-earned 
      position as of one of the true thought leaders in the multifamily 
      industry and has built a company that delivers excellence in value and 
      service. This existing foundation, along with the long-term prospects 
      for the multifamily market, creates a tremendous amount of potential 
      that I hope to build upon in the coming years.&#8221;

			Disabled Veterans National Foundation Distributed Holiday Gift Cards 
      to Hospitalized Veterans at Walter Reed
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a moving scene, the President of The Disabled Veterans National 
      Foundation (www.dvnf.org 
      ) and Michael McNaughton &#8211; a combat soldier who lost his leg on a 
      mission in Afghanistan- delivered Gift Cards to veterans who are 
      patients in the amputee wing at Walter Reed National Military Medical 
      Center in Bethesda, MD over the holidays.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;I cannot express how wonderful it was for us and Michael to see the 
      faces of these veterans at Walter Reed when they received our Gift 
      Cards,&#8221; said Precilla Wilkewitz, President of DVNF. &#8220;This 
      experience and witnessing first-hand the genuine appreciation veterans 
      have really puts a person in the Christmas and Holiday spirit.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Amputee Care Center at Walter Reed Medical Center opened in 
      September of 2007. This 31,000sf, $10 million center offers some of the 
      most state of the art care found anywhere in the world. The facility 
      combines counseling space with workout facilities, data gathering, high 
      tech simulators and a family lounge with a full kitchen. It&#8217;s designed 
      to bring together all of the hospital&#8217;s elements of advanced amputee 
      care.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Michael McNaughton lost his leg above the knee as well as part of his 
      right calf and two fingers after he stepped on a land mine while on a 
      mission in Afghanistan. He spent six months at Walter Reed where he 
      received a dozen operations and five months of physical therapy. After 
      learning to walk again and after embracing a prosthetic leg, Michael not 
      only recovered but is thriving after running marathons and completing 
      triathlons. Most recently he completed the Ride to Recovery 9/11 
      Challenge which was a 400-mile bike ride from Ground Zero in NY City to 
      Shanksville, PA and finishing at the Pentagon to honor those killed in 
      the attacks on 9/11.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Michael&#8217;s story is one of pure courage and love for his nation and 
      fellow-veterans,&#8221; said Wilkewitz. &#8220;To see him go back to Walter 
      Reed and give these Gift Cards reminds us all at DVNF what our true 
      mission is to help all veterans.
			It is an honor for DVNF to do 
      this each year and we thank our many donors who make this possible.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;* Q4 group gross profit 46.4 mln stg vs 40.6 mln stg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Group net fee income for the year up 18 pct to 183.6 mln
stg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Expects satisfactory outcome for 2011, cautious on 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - British recruitment firm
Robert Walters posted an 18 percent rise in net fees for
2011 and said that it entered this year with caution as tough
economic conditions and weak candidate confidence weigh on the
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white-collar recruiter, which places people in
accountancy, banking, IT and administration jobs, said on Friday
that net fee income, also known as gross profit, for the year to
December 31 was 183.6 million pounds ($284.20 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagnant economic growth and cuts to budgets and staff
headcounts across Europe and beyond have slowed many recruitment
markets around the world. As such, people are less confident to
move jobs, leaving recruiters looking to regions such as Asia
Pacific to drive growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will run the business as we have in previous times of
economic uncertainty, through sensible cost management and long
term investment in those markets offering strong growth
opportunities," Chief Executive Robert Walters said in a
statement, adding that he expected a "satisfactory outcome for
2011 as a whole".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter gross profit was up 14 percent to 46.4
million pounds, helped by a 16 percent net fee rise in the Asia
Pacific region and a 24 percent rise in Europe led by France and
Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters, which makes 74 percent of its income
overseas, said that market conditions in Britain remained
difficult, echoing comments from rivals including Michael Page
 and Hays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the year just ended, analysts on average are expecting a
group pretax profit of 16 million pounds according to Thomson
Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the firm closed at 163 pence on Thursday, down 50
percent on a year ago, valuing the business at around 124
million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and the government struck a deal on Friday that would allow the company to move ahead with development of a field in the Gulf of Mexico estimated to yield tens of billions of dollars of oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon sued the government last year after the Interior Department canceled three of five leases for what is called the Julia field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement will allow Exxon Mobil to develop this very large, but technically challenging resource as quickly as possible using a phased approach," Exxon Mobil spokesman Patrick McGinn said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its lawsuit, Exxon argued that the department arbitrarily deprived the company of its rights under the canceled leases and took away Exxon's ability to produce a reservoir believed to hold billions of barrels of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute arose after the government rejected Exxon's October 2008 request for a "suspension of production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following several appeals, the Interior Department concluded in a decision last May that Exxon lacked a "commitment" to producing oil at the time the leases expired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department said the proposed settlement preserves the "important regulatory progress" made in the decision last May that was challenged by Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement "provides incentives for timely and thorough development of the leases, and secures a fair return on those resources to the U.S. Treasury," the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and its partner Statoil ASA have spent more than $300 million drilling two "producible" wells on the Julia prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its development strategy, Exxon was planning to drill three to six development wells and join them to a planned production facility operated by Chevron Corp located about eight miles away, according to the company's lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ron Popeski)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday that his country would not recognize any ruling by a World Bank tribunal in a multibillion-dollar arbitration case with Exxon Mobil Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon took Venezuela to the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, seeking as much as $12 billion in compensation after Chavez ordered the nationalization of the Cerro Negro oil project in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I tell you now: we will not recognize any decision by ICSID," Chavez said during a televised speech. He has repeatedly accused the U.S. oil major of using unfair deals in the past to "rob" the South American OPEC member of its resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are immoral ... How much could they steal in 50 years? Who would dare launch this madness without any foundation? They wanted $12 billion. From where, compadre?" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not going to bow before imperialism and its tentacles, understand that ... They are trying the impossible: to get us to pay them. We are not going to pay them anything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokesman said the company had no comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some interpreted the president's remarks as meaning Venezuela would reject rulings in any of about 20 other cases that it faces before the World Bank's tribunal, all triggered by a wave of state takeovers in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include separate multibillion-dollar proceedings brought by another U.S. oil major, ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two statements issued later, by Venezuela's Petroleum and Mining Ministry and by its state oil company PDVSA, only referred to Chavez saying the nation would refuse to recognize a verdict in the Exxon case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week another arbitration panel, of the International Chamber of Commerce, awarded Exxon $908 million in a separate case relating to the Cerro Negro nationalization, turning attention to the ongoing World Bank proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESOURCE NATIONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez told Reuters he did not expect a verdict in Exxon's World Bank case before the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is due to start being argued in February, Exxon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both cases have been closely watched by the industry for precedents in future disputes between companies and producing states, which have increasingly sought a greater share of oil revenue as prices soar and new reserves become tougher to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Venezuela's socialist leader has accused foreign oil companies of plundering the nation's reserves, but has also maintained close ties with many of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers consulted by Reuters said the ICC decision only covered a commercial dispute between Exxon and state oil company PDVSA over earnings Exxon lost as a result of the takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon says the World Bank case is for compensation for its assets, and experts say it could yield a larger award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has insisted Exxon receive only slightly more than the $750 million it said is invested in the project. Last September, Venezuela offered to settle for $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Chavez has confronted oil companies with tax hikes and contract changes aimed at increasing revenue from the industry to fund state-led anti-poverty development programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's push to boost control over its oil industry has been followed by similar efforts in other producing nations. Critics say it has scared investors away from the South American OPEC member and left crude production stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some oil companies have remained eager to invest in Venezuela's Orinoco extra heavy oil belt, which is considered one of the world's largest mostly untapped reserves of crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. major Chevron and Spain's Repsol both signed deals in 2010 for new multibillion-dollar projects there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Eric Beech and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS Jan 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
said on Monday sales of its revolutionary Kinect sensing device
for the Xbox game console have hit more than 18 million just
over a year since launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Microsoft's undoubted successes in consumer
electronics, the Kinect allows users to play games and
manipulate their televisions solely through gestures and voice
commands. It was launched in November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popularity of the device has helped Microsoft Xbox recently
outsell Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation
in the United States game console market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, delivering the
opening keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas,
said there are now more than 66 million Xbox units sold and more
than 40 million subscribers to its Xbox Live service, which
offers more real-time, interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's last tally for Xbox and Kinect sales, from about
six weeks ago, were about 59 million and 11 million
respectively, suggesting Microsoft's holiday sales were strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The exit of Disney marketing president MT Carney on Monday creates yet more drama around John Carter, the $250 million sci-fi epic that may be the biggest studio gamble since Avatar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The film doesnt hit theaters until March, but reports are rampant that John Carter has gone over budget and required costly reshoots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lackluster early trailer didnt help the buzz and now, without a marketing executive to lead the global rollout, the pressure on John Carter is more intense than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesnt just have to open big -- it has to be one of the top grossing films of all time, a rival studio executive told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also read:Shes Really Gone: Disney Confirms MT Carneys Exit as Marketing Chief&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A film of this size and scope typically requires a marketing budget of roughly $120 million, adding to the price tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All eyes are on Disney to see if the studio can turn the lead character from Edgar Rice Burroughs once beloved, now largely forgotten 11-volume Mars series into a $700 million blockbuster.Its director, Andrew Stanton, admitted to theNew Yorkerin October, that it will have to gross that much worldwide to justify a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thats more than The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and Iron Man have banked during their theatrical runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also read: Men in Black 3: Delays, Script Problems and Will Smiths Really Big Trailer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only one March release, Alice in Wonderland, has ever exceeded that benchmark, and it was able to rack up over $1 billion globally thanks in no small part to the combined talents of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, John Carter is relying on untested Friday Night Lights star Taylor Kitsch and Stanton, who scored hits with Wall-E and Finding Nemo but is hardly a household name. Stanton has had great success with animation -- winning Oscars for both those movies -- but hes never shot a live-action film before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ironically, Kitsch is also starring in Battleship, a $200-million-plus film from Universal that has set off rumors in the blogosphere of a similarly troubled production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subsequent John Carter trailers and TV spots have received a more favorable reception, and theres still time to build excitement for the outerspace adventure, but theres no denying the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Compounding those challenges isthe ousterof Disneys controversial president of movie marketing Carney, who had been overseeing John Carters rollout. The movie opens in two months, but with Carney out and Disney still searching for her replacement, it will be left to the studios inhouse team to handle the opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studio has not hired an outside marketing consultant for John Carter, nor does it plan to, an individual with knowledge of the situation told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marketing issues aside, some industry observers tell TheWrap that a movie this risky should never have been made -- at least not at this budget. To them, John Carter is evidence of runaway production and profligacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How does something like this get green lit? one film financier told TheWrap. Its insane. The only people who could justify a budget like this are true superstar filmmakers like Peter Jackson, Steven Spieberg, James Cameron and George Lucas. Guys who have a proven history and who have created billions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though the film was greenlit while Dick Cook served as the studios chief, according to an individual with knowledge, it will test the regime of Rich Ross, the man who replaced him in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Ross pulls it off, he will be credited with launching a potential film franchise that has both fascinated and bedeviled the film industry for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The attempts to get the Burroughs story onto screens dates back to 1931, when Looney Tunes director Bob Clampett approached the author about plans to adapt the first book in his John Carter series, A Princess of Mars, into a feature-length animated film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clampetts vision was abandoned over concerns it wouldnt play well to midwestern audiences, but starting in the 1980s, he idea of filming Burroughs story was kicked around at Paramount and Disney. At various points, everyone from Tom Cruise to Jon Favreau was attached to the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the movie, which centers on a Confederate soldier (Kitsch) who is transported to Mars where he tries to put an end to interstellar civil war, has proven notoriously difficult to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theres a great deal of optimism that Stanton may have cracked the code. After all the boyish looking, Pixar dynamo has a reputation for taking films that on their face should never work -- Wall-E is a nearly silent movie about a robot -- and spinning them into celluloid gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One producer who works with Disney said that the studio is bullish about the project, and the New Yorker reports that an early test screening had 75 percent of the audience rating the science fiction epic as good or excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it has a good shot of breaking even or turning a profit, J.C. Spink, a producer on A History of Violence and The Hangover, told TheWrap. At its core, its a really cool story. I remember hearing rumors about X-Men and Avatar, and they turned out to be great movies. You cant make a judgment until a movie comes out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Story continues below trailer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, the early trailers and the studios decision to abbreviate the films title from John Carter of Mars to John Carter left some sensing that Disney doesnt quite know how best to sell what Stanton delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ive seen the trailer and they never explain what the hell is going on, the rival studio executive told TheWrap, adding: Not releasing the film in the summer raises some eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trailer felt weak, a film producer told TheWrap. It felt like Cowboys and Aliens with some guy running around the old west or I guess Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A full trailer and a collection of TV spots were released last month and have received slightly better buzz. The new previews for the outer space epic positions its hunky hero as a freedom fighter in the Gladiator vein and overflows with shots of CGI-created aliens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The geek crowd, which will be key to making the movie a hit, was more impressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cant deny it, Harry Knowles of Aint It Cool News wrote. Little boy in me is being pretty insistent. It isnt my instant inclination to introduce the character in that fashion, but getting to really hear the sound ... it kinda gives me goosebumps.&lt;/p&gt; Related Articles: Shes Really Gone: Disney Confirms MT Carneys Exit as Marketing Chief Rich Ross and His Decentralized Magic Kingdom -- Is It Working?

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Disney confirmed the exit of movie marketing chief MT Carney on Monday after news of her departure spread throughout the media over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her exit ends a tumultuous two-year run for the marketing maven, who never adapted to Hollywood's clubby ways. In late March, TheWrap reported that the studio was activing seeking to replace her while she was still on the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a memo to staff on Monday, Carney said she was exiting her post of president of marketing to spend more time with her family in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After much consideration, I have decided to leave the Disney family to return to my own," Carney wrote. "It is terribly hard to leave, but I have been constantly torn between my kids and my job, and like all good Hollywood movies, the kids have to win."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has been a remarkable journey and I look forward to seeing your continued brilliance everywhere," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As TheWrap reported on Sunday, the exec was already effectively gone from the Burbank studio, where she hadn't been seen for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney presided over a rocky tenure that saw the disappointing box office performance of such films as "Mars Needs Moms" and "Secretariat," as well as a few bright spots such as the widely praised campaign for "The Muppets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney, a Hollywood newcomer, joined Disney from the New York City-based media planning and strategy firm Naked Communications in April 2010. She was seen by studio chief Rich Ross as having the potential to shake up the Disney's marketing culture with fresh ideas and an iconoclastic approach, but her outsider status ended up working against her in cliquish Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't long before the studio began quietly shopping Carney's job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late November, TheWrap reported that Disney aggressively courted Sony's chief of marketing Marc Weinstock to replace Carney, and sounded out Josh Greenstein, a senior marketing executive at Paramount, for the job as well. Both turned it down, sources told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio is now in the unenviable position of recruiting another marketing chief after the very public flameout of Carney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - Disney will launch Disney Junior, a 24-hour basic cable and satellite TV channel targeting kids 2 to 7, on Friday, March 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes as Disney's channels try to close ground on lead kids network Nickelodeon, which slid in the ratings last quarter.

Its ratings are up 26 percent year-over-year in kids ages 2- to 5-years-old and 36 percent among boys in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Junior will air through cable and satellite providers including Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, Bright House Networks and Verizon, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimate Spider-Man" will anchor the new Marvel block, which will debut Sunday, April 1. The block will also feature the series return of "The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Spider-Man" creative team includes Marvel Entertainment chief creative officer Joe Quesada, Paul Dini ("Batman: The Animated Series," "Lost") and Man of Action Studios (creators of "Ben 10" and "Generator Rex.") The series will feature a teenage Peter Parker joining Nick Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. and fighting alongside fellow heroes, including Luke Cage and Iron Fist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voice talent includes Drake Bell ("Superhero," "Drake &amp; Josh") as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Chi McBride ("Boston Public," "Pushing Daisies") as Nick Fury, JK Simmons ("Spider-Man") as J. Jonah Jameson, Stan Lee as Stan the Janitor, Clark Gregg ("Iron Man", "Thor," "The Avengers") as Agent Coulson and Steven Weber ("Wings") as Norman Osborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecasting hard data can be difficult enough. Estimating the forecasts of individual Federal Reserve policymakers is even tougher. But, in advance of the Fed&#8217;s latest effort at policy transparency, that&#8217;s just what Goldman Sachs economists have attempted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed announced last week it would begin publishing policymakers&#8217; own forecasts for the path of interest rates, in addition to the growth, inflation and employment projections they already release on a quarterly basis. Goldman uses the Taylor rule of monetary policy, which governs the relationship between economic slack and inflation, to estimate when individual policymakers would likely perceive the timing of an eventual interest rate hike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are interesting, particularly because they find that, contrary to the view chronicled in this post, the publication of Fed officials&#8217; forecasts might actually have the effect of tightening financial market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a broad range of economic forecasts, the range of participants&#8217; funds rate projections is likely to be wide. Our estimates &#8211; which rely on participants&#8217; economic forecasts and our Taylor rule &#8211; suggest that the central tendency (the range of forecasts by all 17 participants minus the highest and lowest three) might span from zero to 2.75 percent at end-2014, with a mid-point of 1.5 percent. These estimates point to the danger that financial conditions could tighten with the publication of such forecast ranges, as the market is currently pricing only around 75 basis points of rate hikes by the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter this potential consequence, the Fed could choose to offer clarity on participants&#8217; expectations for additional bond purchases. By highlighting the fact that some officials still see the need for further monetary stimulus, the central bank would shift the perceived mid-point of market expectations for official rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be difficult for the FOMC to ease financial conditions significantly by publishing participants&#8217; funds rate projections. But if sufficient detail is provided&#8212;including the distribution of funds rate projections and an indication that several participants are in favor of additional asset purchases&#8212;a modest boost to financial conditions appears likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Oil, gold and base metals are Goldman Sachs' top commodity picks this year, with big upside risk in oil due to tight fundamentals and a potential Iranian conflict, the investment bank said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price increases in Brent crude already in the first weeks of the year mean Goldman's end-year target is only 13 percent away, but it is the commodity with the greatest potential to break above its target, Head of Commodities Research Jeff Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil we like the most from a fundamental basis but at $113 a barrel in the current environment is pretty rich," he told a strategy conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman expects Brent oil to end the year at $127.50 per barrel and trade at an average of $120 in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold and base metals have further to rise from current levels to Goldman's targets, but have scant potential above the targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil on the other hand, given the current environment, tight fundamentals, the current geo-political situation in Iran, creates massive upside price risk relative to our target," Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not say how high oil could spike if an Iranian conflict broke out. Brent crude rose 13 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short of a conflict, an EU embargo on Iranian oil would likely to be neutral for the market because Chinese government reserves would likely absorb excess oil, Currie added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess demand in the market would lead to another drawdown in oil inventories this year, although a more modest one than in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent weekly U.S. data suggests that a downward trend for global inventories was reestablished in December, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite softer Chinese economic growth, demand for oil has continued to be resilient and China is due to overtake the United States as the world's biggest oil importer within 18 months, Currie added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLD, BASE METALS TO REBOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both gold and copper have been sold off to raise cash due to tight credit conditions in Europe, but this is likely to balance itself in coming months and lead to a rebound in both metals, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The way we like to look at the commodities space is that gold and base metals reflect value plays, meaning they have had events that have created a significant disconnect between fundamentals and prices," Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In gold, a historic linkage between interest rates and gold prices broke down from October, but this should reestablish itself and lead to U.S. gold futures rising to $1,940 per ounce by the end of the year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. gold futures were trading at $1,618 per ounce on Monday after rising about 10 percent last year, one of best performing assets after U.S. treasuries and Brent crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold fell by about a quarter after touching a record peak above $1,900 per ounce in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Base metals saw sharp falls in the fourth quarter, mainly due to destocking in Europe linked to reduced trade credit and the European debt crisis, Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think this is mostly behind us," he said, adding that end use consumption was much stronger than appeared due to the destocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LME copper, which slid 21 percent last year, is expected to end the year at $9,500 per tonne, up 27 percent from current levels of $7,500 per tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eric Onstad, editing by William Hardy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Eric Onstad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 9 (Reuters) - Oil, gold and base metals
are Goldman Sachs' top commodity picks this year, with big
upside risk in oil due to tight fundamentals and a potential
Iranian conflict, the investment bank said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price increases in Brent crude already in the first weeks of
the year mean Goldman's end-year target is only 13 percent away,
but it is the commodity with the greatest potential to break
above its target, Head of Commodities Research Jeff Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil we like the most from a fundamental basis but at $113 a
barrel in the current environment is pretty rich," he told a
strategy conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman expects Brent oil to end the year at $127.50
per barrel and trade at an average of $120 in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold and base metals have further to rise from current
levels to Goldman's targets, but have scant potential above the
targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil on the other hand, given the current environment, tight
fundamentals, the current geo-political situation in Iran,
creates massive upside price risk relative to our target,"
Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not say how high oil could spike if an Iranian
conflict broke out. Brent crude rose 13 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short of a conflict, an EU embargo on Iranian oil would
likely to be neutral for the market because Chinese government
reserves  would likely absorb excess oil, Currie added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess demand in the market would lead to another drawdown
in oil inventories this year, although a more modest one than in
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent weekly U.S. data suggests that a downward
trend for global inventories was reestablished in December, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite softer Chinese economic growth, demand for oil has
continued to be resilient and China is due to overtake the
United States as the world's biggest oil importer within 18
months, Currie added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLD, BASE METALS TO REBOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both gold and copper have been sold off to raise cash due to
tight credit conditions in Europe, but this is likely to balance
itself in coming months and lead to a rebound in both metals, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The way we like to look at the commodities space is that
gold and base metals reflect value plays, meaning they have had
events that have created a significant disconnect between
fundamentals and prices," Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In gold, a historic linkage between interest rates and gold
prices broke down from October, but this should reestablish
itself and lead to U.S. gold futures rising to $1,940 per
ounce by the end of the year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. gold futures were trading at $1,618 per ounce on Monday
after rising about 10 percent last year, one of best performing
assets after U.S. treasuries and Brent crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold fell by about a quarter after touching a record peak
above $1,900 per ounce in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Base metals saw sharp falls in the fourth quarter, mainly
due to destocking in Europe linked to reduced trade credit and
the European debt crisis, Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think this is mosly behind us," he said, adding that end
use consumption was much stronger than appeared due to the
destocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LME copper, which slid 21 percent last year, is
expected to end the year at $9,500 per tonne, up 27 percent from
current levels of $7,500 per tonne.&lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Today&#8217;s healthcare organizations are challenged with immense amounts of 
      data and the need to make it available, insightful and actionable to the 
      right people at the right time,&#8221; said Hatzidakis. &#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to have 
      the opportunity to discuss how, in partnership with Perficient and IBM, 
      we&#8217;ve developed an integrated performance platform, which leverages 
      several IBM technologies to help providers and patients collaborate to 
      make faster, better decisions that can save lives and reduce costs.&#8221;

      continued strong commercial performance of its existing multiple

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Biogen Idec had a remarkable year in 2011, which laid important 
      groundwork for our future,&#8221; said Biogen Idec&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer

      deliver on that promise. We are committed to growing our current

      science and pipeline programs with the greatest potential to improve the 
      lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, hemophilia and

      the significant opportunities on the horizon for Biogen Idec through the 
      continued growth of its marketed products as well as the potential 
      launch between now and the end of 2015 of multiple new products in MS, 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hemophilia. To capitalize on 
      those opportunities, Biogen Idec is focused on executing on four key 
      strategic priorities in 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Grow its leadership position in MS by:

        
					
            Advancing its AVONEX
						&#174; (interferon beta-1a) franchise through improvements 
            such as a PEGylated form of interferon beta-1a that could 
            potentially offer patients once-monthly or biweekly dosing.
          
					
            Unlocking the value of TYSABRI&#174; 
            (natalizumab) by helping patients better understand their 
            individual risk-benefit profile through risk stratification.
          
					
            Expanding FAMPYRA&#174;&#8217;s (prolonged-release fampridine 
            tablets) footprint in Europe through additional launches and 
            regulatory filings.
          
				
			
			
        Prepare for potential launch of multiple high-impact therapies by:

        
					
            Filing for approval in the first half of this year for BG-12 in MS 
            and building patient support services and specialty distribution.
          
					
            Building the commercial team and patient services programs in 
            hemophilia for its long-acting factor VIII and factor IX programs, 
            which will both have data readouts this year.
          
				
			
			
        Advance late-stage pipeline by:

        
					
            Delivering the data readout from the first Phase 3 trial of 
            dexpramipexole in ALS by year-end.
          
					
            Continuing to advance the daclizumab Phase 3 program in MS.
          
				
			
			
        Drive innovation and grow early-stage pipeline by:

        
					
            Building world-class scientific teams in its core therapeutic 
            areas.
          
					
            Advancing the company&#8217;s internal early-stage pipeline programs.
          
					
            Advancing existing strategic collaborations, including those with 
            Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and 
            entering into additional collaborations in neurology, immunology 
            and hemophilia.
          
					
            Continuing to focus its research and early discovery efforts.
          
					
            Increasing its emphasis on translational research, including 
            biomarker and imaging technologies, to drive better 
            decision-making.
          
				
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, through its joint venture with Samsung, Biogen Idec expects 
      to leverage its expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell 
      line development and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the 
      company to participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 9, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today announced Invisalign Express 5, a cost-effective treatment option for very minor crowding, spacing, or orthodontic relapse treatments requiring five or fewer stages of Invisalign aligners. Invisalign Express 5 will help doctors treat more patients who could benefit from minor tooth movements, but are reluctant to invest in treatment due to cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Invisalign Express 5 offers the same high-quality features that doctors expect from other Invisalign treatment options, including:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		ClinCheck treatment plan that shows a 3-D virtual representation of the desired final result and the number of aligner stages required;
			
		SmartForce&#174; attachments and aligner features engineered to deliver force systems for predictable tooth movements;
			
		An optional one-time refinement of up to five aligners to help achieve the final tooth position as defined in the original ClinCheck treatment plan.
		&lt;p&gt;
	"Many patients want to correct a little crowding or other minor malocclusions, but don't follow-through because of the perceived high cost of orthodontic treatment," said Timothy A. Mack, Align senior vice president, business development. "Invisalign Express 5 gives doctors a new option for these patients &#8211; one with all the benefits of Invisalign and straighter teeth at a price consistent with minor fixes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Invisalign Express 5 is a shorter-duration option to Invisalign Express 10, Align's treatment option for minor crowding, spacing, or pre-restorative treatments that can be addressed in 10 or fewer stages of aligners. Invisalign Express 5 will be available beginning January 30 to Invisalign doctors in North America at a lab fee of $549 with the optional one-time refinement for an additional lab fee of $125.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 9, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today announced Invisalign Express 5, a cost-effective treatment option for very minor crowding, spacing, or orthodontic relapse treatments requiring five or fewer stages of Invisalign aligners. Invisalign Express 5 will help doctors treat more patients who could benefit from minor tooth movements, but are reluctant to invest in treatment due to cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Invisalign Express 5 offers the same high-quality features that doctors expect from other Invisalign treatment options, including:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		ClinCheck treatment plan that shows a 3-D virtual representation of the desired final result and the number of aligner stages required;
			
		SmartForce&#174; attachments and aligner features engineered to deliver force systems for predictable tooth movements;
			
		An optional one-time refinement of up to five aligners to help achieve the final tooth position as defined in the original ClinCheck treatment plan.
		&lt;p&gt;
	"Many patients want to correct a little crowding or other minor malocclusions, but don't follow-through because of the perceived high cost of orthodontic treatment," said Timothy A. Mack, Align senior vice president, business development. "Invisalign Express 5 gives doctors a new option for these patients &#8211; one with all the benefits of Invisalign and straighter teeth at a price consistent with minor fixes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Invisalign Express 5 is a shorter-duration option to Invisalign Express 10, Align's treatment option for minor crowding, spacing, or pre-restorative treatments that can be addressed in 10 or fewer stages of aligners. Invisalign Express 5 will be available beginning January 30 to Invisalign doctors in North America at a lab fee of $549 with the optional one-time refinement for an additional lab fee of $125.

			Forward-Looking Statement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This news release includes &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the 
      meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private 
      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, 
      but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger 
      between Merck and Schering-Plough, including future financial and 
      operating results, the combined company&#8217;s plans, objectives, 
      expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical 
      facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and 
      expectations of Merck&#8217;s management and are subject to significant risks 
      and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the 
      forward-looking statements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to 
      differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the 
      possibility that the expected synergies from the merger of Merck and 
      Schering-Plough will not be realized, or will not be realized within the 
      expected time period; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation 
      and health care legislation; the risk that the businesses will not be 
      integrated successfully; disruption from the merger making it more 
      difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; Merck&#8217;s 
      ability to accurately predict future market conditions; dependence on 
      the effectiveness of Merck&#8217;s patents and other protections for 
      innovative products; the risk of new and changing regulation and health 
      policies in the United States and internationally and the exposure to 
      litigation and/or regulatory actions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking 
      statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
      otherwise. Additional factors that could cause results to differ 
      materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA Jan 9 (Reuters) - Bangladesh will build a new
gas pipeline to bring output from Chevron Corp fields to
the capital Dhaka and to western regions as it combats
shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-run Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL)on Monday
signed an agreement with MAN Industries (India) Limited to
construct a 137 km (86 miles) gas transmission pipe line, a
senior official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To meet growing gas demand of power plants and
manufacturing firms, we will implement the project by the middle
of 2013 with a cost of $201 million," said Aminur Rahman,
managing director of the GTCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told a news conference that all the resources would be
funded by the Bangladesh government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pipeline will be used to transport additional gas to be
produced by U.S. oil firm Chevron at Bibiyana and Jalalabad gas
fields as well potential new gas reserve at Sunetra," Rahman
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these fields are located at Sylhet region, 280 km (175
miles) north east of Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the Bangladesh energy authority asked Chevron to
raise gas production by 500 million cubic feet (mmcft) a day to
offset shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new pipeline is designed for a total capacity of 850
mmcft and will ensure additional gas supply to Dhaka and Western
regions of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh produces about 2,000 mmcft gas a day against the
demand of more than 2,500 mmcft a day, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to acute shortages the state-run Bangladesh Oil, Gas and
Mineral Corporation, or Petrobangla, has stopped new gas
connections to industrial and manufacturing firms across the
county since July 2009, ultimately affecting the growth of the
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas connections to households also remained
suspended since July 2010. The government is trying to cope with
the supply shortfall by gas rationing and keeping the compressed
natural gas filling stations shut for six hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy official said that Chevron was now carrying out
exploration and drilling activities to enhance gas production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed pipeline will run through several districts, 
river and vast haor (low-lying) areas.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Ace Metrix Awards the Brand of the Year 2011 to Microsoft Kinect
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Most Improved Brand of the Year Awarded to State Farm
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ace Metrix, the authority of television advertising effectiveness, today 
      honors Microsoft 
      Kinect as the 2011 Brand of the Year and State 
      Farm Insurance as the Most Improved Brand of the Year. Microsoft 
      Kinect delivered twelve ads that earned the highest average Ace Score 
      (619) of the nearly 1,000 brands tracked by Ace Metrix in 2011. To be 
      considered for Brand of the Year, a brand must have aired at least 10 
      new television ads during 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is a remarkable achievement to make one great ad, which Microsoft 
      Kinect did with its category award-winning commercial &#8216;Sensor Turned 
      Voice and Movement To Magic.&#8217; It is, however, an entirely different 
      challenge to consistently create great ads &#8211; which is exactly what 
      Kinect was able to do in 2011,&#8221; said Peter Daboll, CEO of Ace Metrix. 
      &#8220;Kinect&#8217;s ability to seamlessly blend innovation, possibility, and 
      storytelling across different lengths resulted in an average Ace Score 
      which fundamentally outperformed the field. To think that Microsoft was 
      able to sustain a strong Kinect launch in 2010 with such a compelling 
      set of ads in 2011 is a testament to their outstanding agencies, brand 
      teams, and production teams.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Joining Kinect as the most compelling brands in 2011 were MM's, Apple&#8217;s 
      iPhone brand, Coca-Cola and Applebee's.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While it is not surprising to see these iconic brands at the top of the 
      list, it is worth noting that each has distinguished itself in highly 
      competitive categories, not only emerging as the brand leader in areas 
      like mobile devices, casual dining, non-alcoholic beverages, candies and 
      snacks, but across the entire advertising landscape,&#8221; Daboll said. 
      &#8220;While being likeable is important for brands, the ability to reach 
      consumers across a variety of dimensions, from emotional to rational is 
      what creates a strong Ace Score, and these brands performed 
      exceptionally well in this regard.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Most 
      Improved Brand: State Farm
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Most Improved Brand of the Year was awarded to State Farm who 
      demonstrated the most significant increase in average Ace Score from 
      2010 to 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a brand, State Farm made extraordinary strides in 2011 compared to 
      2010,&#8221; continued Daboll. &#8220;State Farm increased its average Ace Score by 
      almost 14 percent while airing fewer ads. As a result, they were able to 
      deliver far more value at significantly reduced production costs, making 
      their marketing expenditure work harder in 2011.&#8221;

			*Definition:
			Ace Score is the&#160;measure of ad creative 
      effectiveness based on viewer reaction to national TV ads. Respondents 
      (n=500+) are randomly selected and representative of the U.S. TV viewing 
      audience.
			The results are presented on a scale of 0-950, which 
      represents scoring on creative attributes such as Watchability, 
      Relevance, Desire, Attention, Change, Information and Likeability. Norm 
      for ads over the last 90 days is 536.
			Brand of the Year is 
      calculated from all brands that fielded more than 10 new pieces of 
      creative in 2011.
			Most Improved Brand is calculated from those 
      qualified brands as compared to their Average Ace Score from 2010. 
      Average Ace Score of a brand is determined by totaling all of the Ace 
      Scores earned by a brand in the calendar year of 2011 and dividing by 
      the number of ads aired.
		&lt;/p&gt;

      Ace Metrix will reveal scores for every Super Bowl ad on February 5th.

		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: HGSI) will today announce its 
      priority goals for 2012 and report on progress with the 
      commercialization of BENLYSTA&#174; (belimumab), the first approved drug for 
      systemic lupus in 56 years, during a presentation this afternoon by H. 
      Thomas Watkins, President and Chief Executive Officer, to financial 
      analysts and investors at the 30th Annual JPMorgan Healthcare 
      Conference in San Francisco.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Thousands of patients with systemic lupus are now being treated with 
      BENLYSTA,&#8221; said Mr. Watkins. &#8220;We are pioneering a treatment in a market 
      that has not seen a new option for patients in decades. Although we are 
      still in the early adoption phase of our launch, our experience in the 
      market to date reinforces our belief that BENLYSTA will ultimately play 
      a major role in improving the standard of care for SLE patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During his presentation, Mr. Watkins will discuss the following goals 
      and updates on progress:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BENLYSTA&#174; FOR SLE: APPROVED BY FDA IN MARCH 2011, BY CANADA AND 
      EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN JULY 2011, AND NOW BECOMING AVAILABLE TO 
      INCREASING NUMBERS OF PATIENTS AROUND THE WORLD
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BENLYSTA (belimumab) was approved on March&#160;9, 2011 by the U.S. Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with 
      active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are 
      receiving standard therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Estimated BENLYSTA gross sales totaled $29.1 million in the fourth 
      quarter of 2011. After gross-to-net adjustments of $3.4 million, 
      estimated net sales of BENLYSTA in the fourth quarter totaled $25.7 
      million. During the fourth quarter, estimated BENLYSTA average weekly 
      gross sales for the first four weeks were $2.3 million, followed by 
      average weekly gross sales of $2.1 million and $2.5 million for the 
      second and third four-week periods, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Estimated BENLYSTA gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2011, 
      reflecting three full quarters on the market, totaled $59.2 million. 
      After gross-to-net adjustments of $6.9 million, estimated net sales of 
      BENLYSTA for 2011 totaled $52.3 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With BENLYSTA, we are working to change the paradigm of treatment for 
      systemic lupus,&#8221; said Mr. Watkins. &#8220;This involves significant education 
      on clinical data that are still unfamiliar to many lupus-treating 
      physicians, followed by physicians&#8217; initial trial of BENLYSTA in a few 
      of their real world patients. We have seen good progress with the number 
      of physicians initiating use. As they build their own clinical 
      experience, more and more physicians are considering BENLYSTA for 
      appropriate SLE patients. We believe that BENLYSTA is on its way to 
      becoming an important component of a new standard of care for SLE.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HGS sales data suggest that more than 40% of key accounts have initiated 
      treatment with BENLYSTA as of the end of December 2011, compared with 
      approximately 30% at the end of the third quarter. Among the 
      community-based accounts that are the largest infusing practices, 
      approximately 50% have begun to purchase BENLYSTA. Among key hospital 
      accounts, which are hospitals with very large lupus cohorts, more than 
      40% have begun to purchase BENLYSTA. In market research, more than half 
      of rheumatologists report that they have begun to prescribe BENLYSTA for 
      SLE patients; this is an encouraging leading indicator for further 
      increases in purchasing accounts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BENLYSTA was approved by the European Commission on July 13, 2011, and 
      is now available in Canada and an increasing number of European 
      countries, including Germany, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, 
      Norway and Sweden. HGS has built its own commercialization team to work 
      alongside GSK in Europe, with headquarters in Switzerland and local 
      organizations in Germany, France and Spain. Elsewhere, GSK leads local 
      implementation, with HGS sharing costs and profits equally with GSK.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In December 2011, HGS and GSK announced that the dosing of patients has 
      been initiated in BLISS-SC, a Phase 3 trial of the subcutaneous 
      formulation of BENLYSTA. Assuming that this trial is successful and 
      regulatory authorities agree, the subcutaneous formulation would make it 
      possible for patients to self-administer BENLYSTA by injection once a 
      week. In May 2011, GSK initiated dosing in the BENLYSTA Phase 3 trial in 
      East Asia, which will enroll approximately 630 patients in China, Japan 
      and South Korea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key goals for BENLYSTA in 2012:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Continue to increase sales in the U.S. and elsewhere.
      
			
        Continue to work with GSK to launch BENLYSTA in countries around the 
        world.
      
			
        Enroll Phase 3 trial of subcutaneous formulation throughout 2012; 
        complete enrollment in 2013.
      
			
        Initiate Phase 3 trial in vasculitis.
      
			
        Initiate Phase 3 trial in active lupus nephritis.
      
			
        Enroll Phase 3 trial in East Asia.

			RAXIBACUMAB: DELIVERIES TO U.S. STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE CONTINUE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HGS continues to deliver raxibacumab to the U.S. Strategic National 
      Stockpile for emergency use in treating inhalation anthrax. Raxibacumab 
      is being developed under a contract entered into in 2006 with the 
      Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the 
      Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), 
      U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In July 2009, the 
      U.S. Government exercised its option to purchase an additional 45,000 
      doses of raxibacumab, with delivery to be completed over a three-year 
      period. HGS expects to receive approximately $142 million from this 
      second award as deliveries are completed, including approximately $52.5 
      million recognized in 2011. HGS also continues to work closely with FDA 
      to achieve licensure of raxibacumab, and is entitled to receive $20 
      million under its contract with the U.S. Government upon FDA licensure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key goals for raxibacumab in 2012:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Deliver approximately 8,000 doses to the U.S. Strategic National 
        Stockpile and receive approximately $25 million in revenue as 
        deliveries are accepted.
      
			
        Continue to work with the FDA to achieve licensure of raxibacumab.

			GSK PIPELINE: INITIAL RESULTS OF PHASE 3 TRIALS OF ALBIGLUTIDE FOR 
      TYPE 2 DIABETES EXPECTED MID-2012; ENROLLMENT COMPLETED IN SECOND PHASE 
      3 TRIAL OF DARAPLADIB FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSK&#8217;s Phase 3 program to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety and 
      tolerability of albiglutide as monotherapy and add-on therapy for 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to move forward. GSK 
      announced topline results of the first of eight Phase 3 trials in 
      November 2011. The study, known as Harmony 7, was designed to compare 
      once-weekly albiglutide to once-a-day liraglutide. Results showed a 
      reduction in HbA1c from baseline of 0.78% for patients receiving 
      albiglutide compared to a reduction of 0.99% for liraglutide. Although 
      the pre-specified margin of non-inferiority to liraglutide was not met, 
      albiglutide did show a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c from 
      baseline (p0.001). The most common adverse events observed during this 
      study were nausea (9.9% for abiglutide versus 29.2% for liraglutide) and 
      vomiting (5%for abiglutide versus 9.3% for liraglutide).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSK&#8217;s conclusion after review of the data is that the data support 
      continued progress toward registration as a possible once-weekly 
      treatment for type 2 diabetes. GSK expects initial results from the 
      remaining studies over the course of the next several months, and has 
      stated that it expects to provide an update on albiglutide once a more 
      complete view of the data is available in mid-2012. Albiglutide was 
      created by HGS using its proprietary albumin-fusion technology, and the 
      product was licensed to GSK in 2004. HGS is entitled to fees and 
      milestone payments that could amount to as much as $183 million &#8211; 
      including $33 million received to date &#8211; in addition to single-digit 
      royalties on worldwide sales if albiglutide is commercialized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSK&#8217;s Phase 3 program for darapladib is also progressing and is 
      evaluating whether darapladib can reduce the risk of adverse 
      cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke in patients with 
      chronic coronary heart disease (CHD) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 
      respectively. In October 2011, GSK completed the enrollment of over 
      13,000 patients into the SOLID-TIMI 52 study of darapladib in patients 
      who have suffered an ACS event. The SOLID-TIMI 52 study is one of two 
      pivotal Phase 3 trials in the darapladib clinical program. The other 
      study is STABILITY, which is evaluating darapladib in patients with CHD 
      and in 2010 completed the enrollment of about 15,800 patients. The 
      combined program spans 42 countries and has enrolled more than 28,500 
      patients at more than 1500 clinical sites. Darapladib was discovered by 
      GSK based on HGS technology. HGS will receive 10% royalties on worldwide 
      sales if darapladib is commercialized, and has a 20% co-promotion option 
      in North America and Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MID- AND EARLY-STAGE PIPELINE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A randomized Phase 2 trial is currently evaluating mapatumumab in 
      combination with Nexavar (sorafenib) for the treatment of advanced 
      hepatocellular cancer. Mapatumumab is a human monoclonal antibody to 
      TRAIL receptor 1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In March 2011, HGS and FivePrime Therapeutics announced a collaboration 
      to develop and commercialize HGS1036 (formerly FP-1039) for multiple 
      cancers. HGS1036 is a first-in-class biologic discovered by FivePrime 
      that targets multiple fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands. FGF 
      proteins are growth factors that play important roles in the growth and 
      survival of a number of solid tumors. A Phase 1 study was completed in 
      2011, showing that HGS1036 was safe and well tolerated. In 2012, HGS 
      plans to initiate Phase 1b trials of HGS1036 in combination with 
      chemotherapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HGS has halted development of two early-stage products: HGS1029, an IAP 
      inhibitor in Phase 1 development in patients with advanced solid and 
      advanced lymphoid tumors, and HGS1025, a human monoclonal antibody to 
      the CCR5
			receptor that would have entered Phase 1b development in 
      ulcerative colitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key goals for the HGS mid- and early-stage pipeline in 2012 are:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Complete enrollment of the randomized Phase 2 trial of mapatumumab 
        with sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular cancer.
      
			
        Initiate Phase 1b oncology studies of HGS1036 in combination with 
        chemotherapy agents.

      manufacturing, RD and administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We will continue to make the investments required for the successful 
      worldwide commercialization of BENLYSTA,&#8221; said Mr. Watkins. &#8220;We remain

			SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This announcement includes statements that are forward-looking within 
      the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
      These forward-looking statements include those regarding our 
      expectations for BENLYSTA, business goals for 2012 and financial 
      guidance, among others. These forward-looking statements are based on 
      our current intentions, beliefs and expectations regarding future 
      events. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be 
      accurate. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove 
      inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results 
      could differ materially from our expectations. Investors are, therefore, 
      cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. 
      Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this 
      announcement, and, except as required by law, we do not undertake to 
      update any forward-looking statement to reflect new information, events 
      or circumstances.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ 
      from our expectations in these forward-looking statements include: our 
      lack of commercial experience and dependence on the sales growth of 
      BENLYSTA; any failure to commercialize BENLYSTA successfully; the 
      occurrence of adverse safety events with our products; changes in the 
      availability of reimbursement for BENLYSTA; the inherent uncertainty of 
      the timing, success of, and expense associated with, research, 
      development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our pipeline 
      products and new indications for existing products; substantial 
      competition in our industry, including from branded and generic 
      products; the highly regulated nature of our business; uncertainty 
      regarding our intellectual property rights and those of others; the 
      ability to manufacture at appropriate scale, and in compliance with 
      regulatory requirements, to meet market demand for our products; our 
      substantial indebtedness and lease obligations; our dependence on 
      collaborations over which we may not always have full control; foreign 
      exchange rate valuations and fluctuations; the impact of our 
      acquisitions and strategic transactions; changes in the health care 
      industry in the U.S. and other countries, including government laws and 
      regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing 
      generally; significant litigation adverse to the Company, including 
      product liability and patent infringement claims; our ability to attract 
      and retain key personnel; and increased scrutiny of the health care 
      industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in 
      investigations and prosecutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that 
      could cause actual results to differ from our expectations in any 
      forward-looking statement. Investors should consider this cautionary 
      statement, as well as the risk factors identified in our periodic 
      reports filed with the SEC, when evaluating our forward-looking 
      statements.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACOR) 
      today announced that AMPYRA&#174; (dalfampridine) Extended Release 
      Tablets, 10 mg unaudited net sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 were 
      $57 million and unaudited AMPYRA 2011 full year net sales were $210 
      million. These results are subject to completion of the Company&#8217;s 
      year-end audit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company also provided 2012 guidance for AMPYRA net sales of 
      $255-$275 million, and combined Zanaflex&#174; franchise and 
      ex-U.S. FAMPYRA&#174; royalty revenue of at least $25 million. 
      Guidance for 2012 sales, general and administrative (SGA) expense is 
      $145-$160 million and 2012 research and development (RD) expense is 
      $50-$60 million. Based on this guidance, the Company expects to be cash 
      flow positive in 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      President and CEO Ron Cohen, M.D. will provide a business update on 
      AMPYRA and the Company's clinical development strategy at the 30th 
      Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference today at 10:00 a.m. Pacific 
      Time in San Francisco. The presentation is available via webcast at www.acorda.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased by AMPYRA&#8217;s revenue growth throughout 2011, and believe 
      there is still significant opportunity to expand patient awareness of 
      AMPYRA and drive further growth of the brand," said Dr. Cohen. 
      &#8220;Persistency rates for AMPYRA are very high, and the average duration of 
      therapy across all patients who have tried AMPYRA since launch is now 12 
      months, reflecting the importance of bringing each new patient to 
      therapy. We are encouraged by the positive response to the new 
      commercial initiatives we launched in 2011, and expect that our 
      investments in 2012 will accrue significant value to the AMPYRA 
      franchise over the next several years.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. Cohen continued, &#8220;We are also exploring AMPYRA&#8217;s efficacy in a range 
      of neurological diseases other than MS and other potential indications 
      within MS. These are relatively small studies that can be executed 
      quickly and cost-effectively, providing &#8216;go/no-go&#8217; data that will guide 
      further investments. We are particularly excited about the 
      proof-of-concept study in cerebral palsy that we initiated at the end of 
      2011, and one in chronic stroke that we plan to begin in the second half 
      of this year. We are also funding investigator-initiated studies 
      exploring eight additional disease indications.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA Jan 9 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil and
Petrom have started exploratory drilling on Romania's
first deepwater well in the Black Sea, the Romanian group owned
by Austria's OMV said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Domino-1 well is in the Neptun Block, 170 km offshore in
water about 1,000 metres deep, a statement said. Drilling
operations are expected to take about 90 days, it said, noting
such exploratory drilling may or may not result in a discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Deepwater exploration carries high investment risks and
requires investments of several hundred million U.S. dollars,
yet a potential success would fundamentally change the
perspective of the Romanian energy sector," said Johann
Pleininger, Petrom's exploration and production head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; MT Carney will be exiting The Walt Disney Studio after two years of unstable leadership as the president of marketing, TheWrap has learned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; TheWrap reported exclusively in late November that the studio had courted two senior marketing executives at rival studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney would not comment for that story, and would not comment on insiders confirming on Sunday that Carney had effectively left the studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carney has not been in her Burbank office for several weeks, and has told friends that her children have been struggling with her absence from New York, where she maintains her home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read also: Disney Seeks to Replace Marketing Chief MT Carney (Exclusive)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Times wrote a takedown of the marketing executive on Sunday, which led inside sources to confirm that Carney was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It led with an embarrassing anecdote about the executive showing up on a rural set in fancy white pants, then went on to note that the studio has concluded she would never adapt to Hollywood ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In late November, TheWrap reported that Disney aggressively courted Sonys chief of marketing Marc Weinstock for the position, and sounded out Josh Greenstein, a senior marketing executive at Paramount, for the post as well. Both turned it down, sources told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carney, a likeable media executive of Scottish origin, has faced a decidedly rocky path since leaving her New York City-based media planning and strategy firm Naked Communications, and joining Disney in April 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studio chief Rich Ross chose Carney, who at the time he praised as a unique type of marketing executive, because she brought a perspective from outside the industry. But Carney has struggled as an outsider with no movie marketing experience in Hollywoods clubby community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weak opening of movies like Secretariat, The Sorcerers Apprentice and Prince of Persia did not help her find supporters in 2010.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Jan 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 has appointed Eiji Ueda and James Paradise as co-heads of
its Asia-Pacific Securities Division, according to a memo seen
by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two will fill the role left vacant by the departure of
Yusuf Alireza, who headed the securities division in addition to
being co-president of the firm's overall Asia-Pacific business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ueda and Paradise will relocate to Hong Kong from Tokyo and
London, respectively, and will report to the four co-heads of
the global securities division - David Heller, Edward Eisler,
Pablo Salame and Harvey Schwartz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ueda has been co-head of fixed income, currencies and
commodities in Japan since 2009 and is seen internally as one of
the more internationally-minded of the firm's top Japanese
bankers. Paradise has been co-head of Goldman's prime brokerage
business in London since 2008 and, like Ueda, became a managing
director in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Eddie Naylor confirmed the contents
of the memo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Jan 11 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan has
downgraded Singapore Exchange Ltd (SGX) to underweight
from neutral and lowered its target price to S$5.30 from S$7.00.&lt;/p&gt;

year were exceptionally low at S$1.088 billion ($844.1 million)
per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also noted that the volumes in January have been
tepid so far, belying hopes of a rebound, and the Lunar New Year
period generally sees slow volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGX is slated to report its second-quarter result for its
2012 fiscal year on Jan 16 and J.P. Morgan said it expects the
bourse to post a profit of S$59 million, down 33 percent
quarter-on-quarter and 21 percent year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 0250 GMT, SGX shares were down 0.8 percent at S$6.11.

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday sales of its revolutionary Kinect sensing device for the Xbox game console have hit more than 18 million just over a year since launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popularity of the device has helped Microsoft Xbox recently outsell Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation in the United States game console market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Microsoft's undoubted successes in consumer electronics, the Kinect allows users to play games and manipulate their televisions solely through gestures and voice commands. It was launched in November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, delivering the opening keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, said there are now more than 66 million Xbox units in use and more than 40 million subscribers to its Xbox Live service, which offers more real-time, interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's last tally for Xbox and Kinect sales, from about six weeks ago, were about 59 million and 11 million, respectively, suggesting Microsoft sold about 7 million Xbox and Kinect units over the crucial holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is slightly better than Sony, which said earlier on Monday that it sold 6.5 million game machines over the holiday season, including PlayStations and its new hand-held device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer added that on February 1 Microsoft would unveil some Kinect functions for Windows users -- suggesting hands-free commands for PCs -- but did not give any details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said last month its CEO would not deliver the CES keynote after this year, as Ballmer and his predecessor Bill Gates have done for the last 14 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what to expect in the future from Microsoft, Ballmer said "Windows, Windows, Windows," referring to the release of the latest version of its flagship operating system, which is expected later this year. Microsoft has not said exactly when it will be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also announced a new partnership with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, that will bring Fox News, Wall Street Journal and other content to Xbox Live subscribers some time this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Bill Rigby; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott and Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIMA (Reuters) - Peru on Tuesday replaced its anti-drug czar, a lawyer who had criticized U.S.-backed eradication policies in the world's top coca grower and who had been one of the few progressives to survive a December Cabinet shakeup by President Ollanta Humala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricardo Soberon, who previously worked for a legislator with close links to coca growers, was seen as a risky choice to lead anti-drug efforts in Peru, which experts say could surpass Colombia as the world's leading cocaine producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will be replaced by psychologist Carmen Masias, according to a resolution published by the prime minister's office in Peru's official gazette. She has been subdirector of a government-run agency that works on drug abuse prevention and a board member of the Iberoamerican network working on drug dependency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soberon quit a month after an unexpected Cabinet shakeup in which Humala appointed fellow former army officer Oscar Valdes to be prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humala carried out the changes to give his government a more law-and-order focus and clamp down on anti-mining protests. Critics said he purged leftists from his Cabinet who had supported him during last year's campaign and has drifted to the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soberon suspended Peru's coca eradication efforts for a week in August as it evaluated existing anti-drug programs - surprising the United States, which provides about half of Peru's anti-drug money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a drug policy analyst he had criticized coca eradication programs funded by the United States as short-sighted, and advocated for more emphasis on helping farmers raise alternative crops like coffee and seizing chemicals used to refine cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told Reuters in October that Peru was on track to eradicate its quota of 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) of coca in 2011 but said he had also had some success in persuading U.S. officials to contribute more funding for alternative development initiatives rather than eradication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But William Brownfield, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, told reporters in November that the United States had only begun discussions on anti-narcotics funding with Peru's new government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Embassy in Lima did not immediately respond to request for comment on the appointment of Masias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Terry Wade and Eric Beech)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pascale Witz, President and CEO, GE Healthcare, Medical Diagnostics 
      discussed diagnostics as the future of personalized medicine at the 30th 
      JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, CA. During her 
      presentation, Witz noted that diagnostics and pathology screening are 
      core enablers of personalized medicine, and outlined how GE Healthcare 
      partners with the pharmaceutical industry to support market entry of new 
      therapies via providing complex technologies that can aid in the conduct 
      of clinical trials, potentially expediting time to market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Personalized medicine is at the core of our efforts in medical

      testing for integrated solutions from risk stratification and early 
      detection through prediction and monitoring. The combination of our

      Witz&#8217;s talk focused specifically on GE Healthcare&#8217;s existing work in 
      oncology and the Company&#8217;s commitment to expand its advanced cancer 
      diagnostic and molecular imaging capabilities. With its advanced 
      technologies, GE Healthcare&#8217;s Clarient business is able to provide 
      pathologists and oncologists with accurate and detailed information to 
      help characterize and assess cancer which may lead to more accurate 
      diagnoses and more effective treatment. Witz also discussed Omnyx, a 
      joint venture between GE Healthcare and the University of Pittsburgh,

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - The exit of Disney marketing president MT Carney on Monday creates yet more drama around "John Carter," the $250 million sci-fi epic that may be the biggest studio gamble since "Avatar."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film doesn't hit theaters until March, but reports are rampant that "John Carter" has gone over budget and required costly reshoots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lackluster early trailer didn't help the buzz and now, without a marketing executive to lead the global rollout, the pressure on "John Carter" is more intense than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't just have to open big -- it has to be one of the top grossing films of all time," a rival studio executive told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A film of this size and scope typically requires a marketing budget of roughly $120 million, adding to the price tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All eyes are on Disney to see if the studio can turn the lead character from Edgar Rice Burroughs' once beloved, now largely forgotten 11-volume Mars series into a $700 million blockbuster. Its director, Andrew Stanton, admitted to the New Yorker in October that it will have to gross that much worldwide to justify a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's more than "The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" or "Iron Man" banked during their theatrical runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one March release, "Alice in Wonderland," has ever exceeded that benchmark, and it was able to rack up over $1 billion globally thanks in no small part to the combined talents of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, "John Carter" is relying on untested "Friday Night Lights" star Taylor Kitsch and Stanton, who scored hits with "Wall-E" and "Finding Nemo" but is hardly a household name. Stanton has had great success with animation -- winning Oscars for both those movies -- but he's never shot a live-action film before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Kitsch is also starring in "Battleship," a $200-million-plus film from Universal that has set off rumors in the blogosphere of a similarly troubled production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent "John Carter" trailers and TV spots have received a more favorable reception, and there's still time to build excitement for the outerspace adventure, but there's no denying the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounding those challenges is the ouster of Disney's controversial president of movie marketing Carney, who had been overseeing "John Carter"s' rollout. The movie opens in two months, but with Carney out and Disney still searching for her replacement, it will be left to the studio's inhouse team to handle the opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio has not hired an outside marketing consultant for "John Carter," nor does it plan to, an individual with knowledge of the situation told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing issues aside, some industry observers tell TheWrap that a movie this risky should never have been made -- at least not at this budget. To them, "John Carter" is evidence of runaway production and profligacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How does something like this get green lit?" one film financier told TheWrap. "It's insane. The only people who could justify a budget like this are true superstar filmmakers like Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and George Lucas. Guys who have a proven history and who have created billions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the film was greenlit while Dick Cook served as the studio's chief, according to an individual with knowledge, it will test the regime of Rich Ross, who replaced him in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Ross pulls it off, he will be credited with launching a potential film franchise that has both fascinated and bedeviled the film industry for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attempts to get the Burroughs story onto screens dates back to 1931, when Looney Tunes director Bob Clampett approached the author about plans to adapt the first book in his John Carter series, "A Princess of Mars," into a feature-length animated film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clampett's vision was abandoned over concerns it wouldn't play well to midwestern audiences, but starting in the 1980s the idea of filming Burroughs' story was kicked around at Paramount and Disney. At various points, everyone from Tom Cruise to Jon Favreau was attached to the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the movie, which centers on a Confederate soldier (Kitsch) who is transported to Mars where he tries to put an end to interstellar civil war, has proven notoriously difficult to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a great deal of optimism that Stanton may have cracked the code. After all the boyish looking, Pixar dynamo has a reputation for taking films that on their face should never work -- "Wall-E" is a nearly silent movie about a robot -- and spinning them into celluloid gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One producer who works with Disney said that the studio is bullish about the project, and the New Yorker reports that an early test screening had 75 percent of the audience rating the science fiction epic as "good" or "excellent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it has a good shot of breaking even or turning a profit," J.C. Spink, a producer on "A History of Violence" and "The Hangover," told TheWrap. "At its core, it's a really cool story. I remember hearing rumors about 'X-Men' and 'Avatar,' and they turned out to be great movies. You can't make a judgment until a movie comes out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the early trailers and the studio's decision to abbreviate the film's title from "John Carter of Mars" to "John Carter" left some sensing that Disney doesn't quite know how best to sell what Stanton delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've seen the trailer and they never explain what the hell is going on," the rival studio executive told TheWrap, adding: "Not releasing the film in the summer raises some eyebrows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The trailer felt weak," a film producer told TheWrap. "It felt like 'Cowboys and Aliens' with some guy running around the old west or I guess Mars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full trailer and a collection of TV spots released last month have received slightly better buzz. The new previews for the outer space epic positions its hunky hero as a freedom fighter in the "Gladiator" vein and overflows with shots of CGI-created aliens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geek crowd, which will be key to making the movie a hit, was more impressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can't deny it," Harry Knowles of Aint It Cool News wrote. "Little boy in me is being pretty insistent. It isn't my instant inclination to introduce the character in that fashion, but getting to really hear the sound ... it kinda' gives me goosebumps."&lt;/p&gt;

      broad market acceptance in Australia or Canada; (ii) the Company may be 
      unable to provide the information requested in the FDA&#8217;s post-panel 
      response letter, or any information provided may be insufficient, and 
      (iii) despite other regulatory approvals of Augment, the FDA Advisory 
      Panel&#8217;s votes in favor of Augment, or any further information provided 
      by the Company in answering the post-panel response letter, the FDA may 
      not approve Augment&#8217;s Pre-Marketing Application, may require additional 
      clinical and/or non-clinical studies to approve Augment, or may impose

      actual results and the timing and outcome of events may differ 
      materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking

&lt;p&gt;  AUSTIN, TX, Jan 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Chaotic Moon Labs, a division of Chaotic Moon, the world's most proven
mobile application studio, revealed today the 'Board of Awesomeness,' an
electric skateboard controlled via a Microsoft Kinect powered interface.

    "We created Chaotic Moon to not only be the world's most successful
mobile application studio, but also to be a powerhouse of innovation that
produces unique ideas and inventions that turn heads and demonstrate our
creative thinking," said Ben Lamm, CEO of Chaotic Moon Studios. "The labs
team has clearly demonstrated that with the 'Board of Awesomeness,' we
can transform an interface previously confined to your living room and
make it fun and useful for transportation in the outside world."

    Straight out of Chaotic Labs, the team will introduce the world's first
Xbox Kinect-controlled skateboard. The board is powered by a Samsung
prototype tablet and can reach speeds up to 32 mph. The board will
officially be revealed at CES 2012 in Las Vegas, beginning January 10th,
but you can catch a glimpse of the pimped out skateboard in action here:
http://www.chaoticmoon.com/labs/board-of-awesomeness/

    "Traditionally we've considered mobile computing to simply mean
information provided to us on a device away from our desktops or work
areas," said Phil Wheat, Manager of Chaotic Moon Labs. "But this project
shows that a computing environment can provide additional information and
controls on the move as well as a completely different take on user
experience."

    The skateboard uses video recognition, speech recognition, gesture
recognition, localization data, accelerometer data, and other factors to
determine what the user wants to do and allows the board to follow the
operator's commands without other aid.

    "What whurley has been able to achieve with our labs team in such a short
time, with constrained budget, has been simply phenomenal and our first
project is only the beginning. We are excited to announce that Chaotic
Moon will be investing an additional six million dollars into our labs
division in 2012 to help fuel growth and take future projects to the next
level," continued Lamm.

			XPLORE President To Speak at Microsoft&#174; LINC Event During CES 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Xplore Technologies Corp. (OTCQB: XLRT) (&#8220;Xplore&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a 
      manufacturer of award-winning rugged tablet PCs, announced today that 
      Mark Holleran, President of Xplore, will be a guest speaker at the 
      Microsoft LINC event at the Consumer Electronics Show, January 10, 2012, 
      at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Holleran,a tablet industry expert, has been invited to provide insight 
      into the acceptance of tablets as a form factor, and one that is rapidly 
      gaining popularity among industrial, public service and government 
      sectors. The Microsoft LINC event is expected to focus on tablet 
      computers and their use in government, public safety, healthcare and 
      education. As a result, Holleran&#8217;s presentation is expected to 
      concentrate on rugged tablets and sales into the government and 
      industrial vertical markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The audience for this event, comprised of approximately 50 original 
      equipment manufacturers (OEM) and global partners of Microsoft. The Local 
      Innovation Notebook Circle and LEAP are Worldwide OEM Sales Programs 
      focused on facilitating Partners collaboration to bring new quality 
      product designs to market and developing tailored solutions to meet the 
      needs and criteria of different vertical markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am very honored to be asked to share my experience with this group,&#8221; 
      said Holleran, who noted that Xplore has had a relationship with 
      Microsoft for the past ten years. &#8220;The tablet as a form factor is 
      replacing notebooks as the choice of the enterprise. As a result there 
      is a growing need for tablet computers that can be used by those in the 
      enterprise whose jobs take place in challenging environments. At Xplore 
      we are seeing an increased awareness and acceptance of rugged tablet 
      computers.&#8221; Holleran explains that rugged tablets have been used for the 
      past 15 years by the military, and in industries as broad as 
      warehousing, manufacturing and utilities. &#8220;We have strengthened and 
      improved upon our rugged tablets so that they that exceed industry 
      safety standards as well and offer complete reliability of critical 
      systems.&#8221;

			Ramtron Ships Custom F-RAM Device Built On IBM Manufacturing Line
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. semiconductor maker Ramtron International Corporation (Nasdaq: 
      RMTR), a leading developer and supplier of low energy nonvolatile 
      ferroelectric random access memory (F-RAM) and integrated semiconductor 
      products, today announced that it has made initial customer deliveries 
      of a custom designed F-RAM device built on its new IBM manufacturing 
      line in Burlington, Vermont. In addition to 50,000 devices already 
      shipped, the company expects to ship approximately 1.9 million devices 
      over the next few quarters with a potential for significantly higher 
      volumes in the future. The Ramtron-designed custom F-RAM devices are 
      destined for use in generic printer cartridges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This milestone marks the first commercial shipment of 3-volt F-RAM 
      devices built on our new F-RAM manufacturing line in Burlington,&#8221; said 
      Eric Balzer, Ramtron&#8217;s CEO. &#8220;In recent months, we have made significant 
      progress toward improving the product yield on our new manufacturing 
      line, which also bodes well for our recently introduced standard F-RAM 
      products being built there.&#8221;

      Ramtron International Corporation, headquartered in Colorado Springs, 
      Colorado, is a fabless semiconductor company that designs, develops and 
      markets specialized semiconductor memory and integrated semiconductor 
      solutions used in a wide range of product applications and markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ramtron pioneered the integration of ferroelectric materials into 
      semiconductor products that enabled a class of low energy nonvolatile 
      memory, called ferroelectric random access memory, or F-RAM. Ramtron 
      F-RAM products combine the high-speed performance of Random Access 
      Memory (RAM) with high-integrity nonvolatile data storage, or the 
      ability to save information without power. Since commercializing the 
      technology, Ramtron has sold nearly a half-billion F-RAM devices into 
      demanding applications such as automotive safety and entertainment 
      systems, portable medical devices, industrial process control systems, 
      smart electricity meters, and consumer printer cartridges. As the most 
      power-efficient of any nonvolatile memory technology on the market, 
      F-RAM products promise to pave the way for the development of 
      ultra-efficient battery powered products and energy harvesting 
      applications, among others. For more information, visit www.ramtron.com.

enables a better understanding of each individual and their relationship
with your business -- improving customer service, reducing costs,

      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and Better ATM Services&#174; (www.betteratmservices.com), 
      a technology innovator in the ATM industry, today announced the ability 
      to dispense Visa Gift cards in addition to cash at existing ATMs, 
      expanding the value and services delivered by ATMs. An in-market pilot 
      program is currently underway offering Visa Gift cards at walk-up and 
      drive-through ATMs in select locations throughout Arizona. Credit Union 
      West, MariSol Federal Credit Union, and Pinal County Federal Credit 
      Union are participating in the first pilot programs, and have already 
      begun offering their members this quick and easy way to purchase Visa 
      Gift cards.

      friends the opportunity to choose a gift they really want or need. Our

      card. Cards are available with no activation fee in $25 denominations

      durable yet thinner material, which allows cards to easily pass through 
      the cash mechanisms of ATMs.

      holiday shopping season, according to a survey by BIGresearch and the 
      National Retail Federation (NRF). The study shows to date, gift cards 
      are the most requested holiday gift &#8211; the fifth year in a row they have

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - A hedge fund set up by former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) trader Morgan Sze -- the biggest launched in Asia in 2011 -- lost 6.8 percent last year, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, as it was rattled by a sharp drop in Chinese shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong-based multi-strategy hedge fund, Azentus, which can invest globally but focuses mainly on companies related to Asia, had a blockbuster start with assets of about $1 billion on April 1 last year and now manages $1.9 billion. Its performance is keenly watched in the regional industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the Eurekahedge Asia Multi-Strategy index was down 4.9 percent between April and December last year, while regional hedge funds lost about 9 percent during the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azentus had a good first six months up until the last week of September when it lost money big time, primarily from its exposure to China, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese shares as measured by the MSCI China Index .dMICN00000PUS plunged 20 percent last year on fears of a global downturn, accounting scandals at U.S.-listed Chinese firms and a mountain of local government debt, raising worries on the health of Chinese banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund had a light exposure to China's 'A' shares and most of its losses came from investments in the Chinese stocks listed in the United States, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azentus's Chief Operating Officer Roger Denby-Jones declined to comment. The sources were not authorised to speak to media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S.-listed Chinese firms such as Baidu Inc (BIDU.O), Sohu.com (SOHU.O) and SINA Corp (SINA.O) plunged between 27 percent and 41 percent in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Started by Sze, former head of Goldman's Principal Strategies group, Azentus Capital Management was one of the biggest hedge funds to launch since the onset of the credit crisis and one of the most high-profile in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund lost 1.4 percent in December and 1.7 percent a month earlier and is headed into 2012 with about 120 percent gross exposure, one of the sources said. Gross exposure refers to the sum of long and short positions of a hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FORGETTABLE YEAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds globally recorded one of their worst annual performances ever in 2011, with the average fund down 4.8 percent, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks only the third calendar year since HFR began measuring industry-wide performance in 1990 that hedge funds have finished in the red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the high-profile names in the global industry stumbled, with John Paulson losing more than half of the capital in one of his firm's biggest funds last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Chris Lewis and Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - A hedge fund set up by former Goldman Sachs trader Morgan Sze -- the biggest launched in Asia in 2011 -- lost 6.8 percent last year, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, as it was rattled by a sharp drop in Chinese shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong-based multi-strategy hedge fund, Azentus, which can invest globally but focuses mainly on companies related to Asia, had a blockbuster start with assets of about $1 billion on April 1 last year and now manages $1.9 billion. Its performance is keenly watched in the regional industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the Eurekahedge Asia Multi-Strategy index was down 4.9 percent between April and December last year, while regional hedge funds lost about 9 percent during the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azentus had a good first six months up until the last week of September when it lost money big time, primarily from its exposure to China, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese shares as measured by the MSCI China Index plunged 20 percent last year on fears of a global downturn, accounting scandals at U.S.-listed Chinese firms and a mountain of local government debt, raising worries on the health of Chinese banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund had a light exposure to China's 'A' shares and most of its losses came from investments in the Chinese stocks listed in the United States, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azentus's Chief Operating Officer Roger Denby-Jones declined to comment. The sources were not authorized to speak to media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S.-listed Chinese firms such as Baidu Inc, Sohu.com and SINA Corp plunged between 27 percent and 41 percent in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Started by Sze, former head of Goldman's Principal Strategies group, Azentus Capital Management was one of the biggest hedge funds to launch since the onset of the credit crisis and one of the most high-profile in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund lost 1.4 percent in December and 1.7 percent a month earlier and is headed into 2012 with about 120 percent gross exposure, one of the sources said. Gross exposure refers to the sum of long and short positions of a hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FORGETTABLE YEAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds globally recorded one of their worst annual performances ever in 2011, with the average fund down 4.8 percent, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks only the third calendar year since HFR began measuring industry-wide performance in 1990 that hedge funds have finished in the red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the high-profile names in the global industry stumbled, with John Paulson losing more than half of the capital in one of his firm's biggest funds last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Chris Lewis and Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Jan 10 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
has sued Gome Electrical Appliances Holding, one of
China's largest homegrown electronics distributors, and a
Beijing electronics mall, for allegedly infringing on the
copyright of its software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in a statement it has filed lawsuits in the
Shanghai Huangpu District People's Court and the Beijing Second
Intermediate People's Court against Gome and Beijing Chaoyang
Buynow mall to get both parties to stop infringing on its
copyrights and for a compensation of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it has evidence that a Gome store in
Shanghai installed pirated versions of its Windows and Microsoft
Office software on computers for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope that the lawsuit will serve as a warning call for
computer distributors and sellers to respect intellectual
property rights," said Yu Weidong, general manager for IPR of
Microsoft China, in a statement dated Jan. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gome Vice President Zou Xiaochun said he was not aware of
the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said it has evidence that holds Beijing
Chaoyang Buynow accountable for "lack of supervision or proper
management" that allowed for the installation of illegal copies
of Microsoft Windows and Office products on computers sold by
two PC vendors at the PC market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mall was not immediately reachable for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has struggled to gain a foothold in China's
booming IT industry due to the endemic problem of software
piracy in the country. Last month, China said its government
offices at every level will use legitimate as opposed to pirated
computer software by the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Intellectual Property Alliance, a U.S.
coalition of film, software, music and publishing groups,
estimates that U.S. companies lost more than $15 billion in 2009
due to international copyright theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $14 billion of the total was due to software piracy,
with an estimated $3.5 billion in losses in China and $1.4
billion in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

      smartphones from Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Research In 
      Motion (RIM) have been certified for use with Visa&#8217;s mobile application 
      for payments at the point-of-sale, Visa payWave. The Samsung Galaxy SII, 
      LG Optimus NET NFC, BlackBerry&#174; Bold&#8482; 9900, BlackBerry Bold 9790, 
      BlackBerry&#174; Curve&#8482; 9360 and BlackBerry Curve 9380 have been added to the 
      list of Visa compliant payment products available for commercial 
      deployment by financial institutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All the new devices certified by Visa host the Visa payWave application 
      on a secure SIM card and feature NFC (Near Field Communication) 
      technology, the short range communications standard that enables mobile 
      phones to securely transmit payment information to a contactless payment 
      terminal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is an important step for Visa, its financial institution partners 
      and the mobile industry,&#8221; said Bill Gajda, Global Head of Mobile 
      Product, Visa Inc. &#8220;In addition to issuing plastic magnetic stripe or 
      chip-enabled payment cards, financial institutions can now consider 
      offering their accountholders a way to transform their smartphones into 
      fully functional mobile payment devices.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa&#8217;s certification of these smartphones paves the way for mobile 
      device manufacturers, mobile operators and retailers to partner with 
      financial institutions to offer Visa mobile payment functionality to 
      consumers globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Visa&#8217;s Certification Process
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa has played a leadership role in establishing global standards for 
      mobile payments, making sure that they are aligned with existing 
      technology and security standards for chip payment cards and can easily 
      be integrated into the existing payments ecosystem. For example: Visa 
      payWave on mobile devices is compatible with existing contactless (NFC) 
      payment terminals already installed at retail outlets worldwide, 
      enabling Visa accountholders to simply wave their enabled phone in front 
      of a payment terminal in order to pay.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa has a
			compliance testing process for both mobile devices and 
      the secure elements that host the Visa payWave mobile application. The 
      process includes extensive technical and usability testing with respect 
      to the Visa mobile payment functionality. This helps to ensure reliable 
      and secure Visa transactions which are compatible with the global 
      standard for chip-enabled payments, and establishes a required signal 
      range for all mobile (NFC-enabled) Visa payment devices. Visa&#8217;s 
      compliance testing process helps to ensure the combination of the phone; 
      secure chip and Visa&#8217;s mobile payment application will provide the level 
      of security and user experience Visa accountholders have come to expect 
      from Visa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement is another example of the momentum we are seeing 
      behind NFC as an industry standard for mobile payments,&#8221; said Nick 
      Holland, senior analyst Yankee Group. &#8220;Yankee Group predicts that the 
      value of NFC-based transactions will grow significantly, from $27 
      million in 2010 to $40 billion in 2014.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS Jan 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on
Monday sales of its revolutionary Kinect sensing device for the
Xbox game console have hit more than 18 million just over a year
since launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popularity of the device has helped Microsoft Xbox recently
outsell Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation
in the United States game console market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Microsoft's undoubted successes in consumer
electronics, the Kinect allows users to play games and
manipulate their televisions solely through gestures and voice
commands. It was launched in November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, delivering the
opening keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas,
said there are now more than 66 million Xbox units in use and
more than 40 million subscribers to its Xbox Live service, which
offers more real-time, interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's last tally for Xbox and Kinect sales, from about
six weeks ago, were about 59 million and 11 million,
respectively, suggesting Microsoft sold about 7 million Xbox and
Kinect units over the crucial holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is slightly better than Sony, which said earlier on
Monday that it sold 6.5 million game machines over the holiday
season, including PlayStations and its new hand-held device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer added that on Feb. 1 Microsoft would unveil some
Kinect functions for Windows users -- suggesting hands-free
commands for PCs -- but did not give any details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said last month its CEO would not deliver the CES
keynote after this year, as Ballmer and his predecessor Bill
Gates have done for the last 14 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what to expect in the future from Microsoft, Ballmer
said "Windows, Windows, Windows," referring to the release of
the latest version of its flagship operating system, which is
expected later this year. Microsoft has not said exactly when it
will be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also announced a new partnership with Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp, that will bring Fox News, Wall
Street Journal and other content to Xbox Live subscribers some
time this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group said Wednesday that two high-ranking leaders of its trading business have left the firm as Wall Street executives come under more pressure to cut costs and put less of their money at risk in trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David B. Heller and Edward K. Eisler, two of four co-heads of securities trading at Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), decided to retire, according to internal memos sent. Heller, based in New York, has been with Goldman for 22 years and Eisler, based in London, for 18 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While financial companies worldwide have announced plans to lay off more than 100,000 people in recent months, the Goldman departures still came as a surprise. Goldman has given notice to about 1,000 people, including some of its partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men will continue with the firm as non-employee advisers, according to spokesman Michael DuVally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banks are facing near-term and long-term trading issues that have dispirited many professionals. Profits in recent quarters have been trimmed by volatile world markets while impending regulations known as the Volcker Rule are forcing banks to close their proprietary trading units that have long fueled strong profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms also are cutting jobs and compensation for top executives who oversee units where revenues are falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman last year closed two proprietary trading desks that were part of the securities division in anticipation of the new regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heller, who was based in New York, is a long-time equities trader while London-based Eisler specialized in global interest rate products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's earnings per share for 2011 are estimated to be down 62 percent from 2010, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is scheduled to report financial results next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equities volume across the securities industry fell 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the previous year, and was down 18 percent from this year's third quarter, according to estimates by analyst Brad Hintz of Bernstein Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, firms are under pressure to automate to lower costs for themselves and clients, said analyst Richard Bove of Rochdale Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is becoming a machine-driven business, and traders around Wall Street are vulnerable," said Bove. "It is a battle of who has the best technology and who has scale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heller and Eisler shared oversight of fixed income, currency, commodity and stock trading with credit markets veteran Pablo Salame and fixed-income sales expert Harvey Schwartz, who are staying in their roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman promoted Isabelle Ealet, its global head of commodities and a rising star at the firm, to work alongside Salame and Schwartz as a third co-head of the securities division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman annually goes through two rounds of routine cutting. Early in the year, a so-called 5 percent cull occurs in which the company weeds out the bottom tier of performers. Late in the year, the investment bank asks some of its partners to leave, almost always with lucrative "retirement" packages, in order to make room for an up-and-coming round of talent who compete fiercely for the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman does not say how many partners it has, but the culling in 2011 was exceptionally high and took the number down below 400, people close to the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in November that the average tenure of a partner at the firm was 15.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Edward Forst, 50, a co-head of investment banking retired after 16 years with Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the same time, Milton Berlinski, a partner who oversaw Goldman's relationships with private-equity firms, retired as global head of the financial sponsor group. Berlinski who had been with the firm for 26 years, became a partner in 1996 before the company went public, and at one time was head of firmwide strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry and Jed Horowitz in New York.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) warned that fourth-quarter profit would be significantly below the previous quarter, with production still falling short of prior expectations and its refining operations about breaking even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the second-largest U.S. oil company fell more than 2 percent in after-hours trading to $105.21, or about $5 below the record high they hit last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said "upstream" earnings from oil and gas production would be comparable to the $6.2 billion in the third quarter, but only before accounting for foreign-exchange impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Full third quarter earnings included foreign exchange gains of nearly $450 million, compared to a loss anticipated in the fourth quarter," Chevron said in its quarterly interim update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had previously been looking for an overall fourth-quarter net profit of $6.6 billion, or $3.33 per share, according to the average on Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. This compared with $5.3 billion a year before and $7.8 billion in the third quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's international oil-equivalent production rose to 1.98 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first two months of the quarter from an average of 1.94 million for all of the third quarter, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But U.S. production in October and November fell to 660,000 bpd from 662,000 in the third quarter, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, Chevron had 2.64 million bpd of oil-equivalent production for the first two months of the quarter, up from 2.60 million in the third quarter but sharply below its full-year 2011 forecast of 2.73 million bpd. The only period in 2011 that Chevron has topped the annual estimate was the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the refining side, Chevron said Gulf Coast margins fell "substantially" in the fourth quarter from the three months before, citing industry figures showing they had been cut in half. Downstream margins were also weaker outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, U.S. refinery input fell by about 180,000 bpd to 717,000 bpd, largely because of a major turnaround at its refinery in Richmond, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So downstream earnings overall were expected to be near breakeven, Chevron said, without the help of a $500 million gain recorded the previous quarter from its sale of its UK refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the San Ramon, California-based company said total net charges for the fourth quarter would be "notably higher" than its general guidance range of $250 million to $350 million. Chevron will report earnings on January 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has put its talks with media companies about an online subscription service for TV shows and movies on hold, according to people familiar with the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology giant had been in intense talks with potential programming partners for over a year and was hoping to roll out the service in the next few months. But it pulled back after deciding that the licensing costs were too high for the business model Microsoft envisaged, according to these people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They built Microsoft TV, they demoed it for us, they asked for rate cards but then said 'ooh ah, that's expensive,'" said one senior media executive who had been involved in the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early versions of Microsoft's TV service included a range of advanced features such as being able to change channels with voice and motion control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to Netflix Inc, Microsoft's service also would have allowed users the option of paying a monthly fee for a package of programming from someone other than a local cable or satellite TV company. But unlike Netflix, Microsoft had hoped to offer current shows and live networks on its service, which made it a much higher cost proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is still working closely with the TV business to distribute shows over the Web, but rather than playing a role in helping consumers replace their cable TV packages it is focusing on delivering programming via its Xbox gaming system to existing cable subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Consumer Electronics Show this week, for example, Microsoft and News Corp announced a partnership that will allow Fox Broadcast, Fox News, IGN and The Wall Street Journal to offer apps on its Xbox Live service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media company sources also said that even though talks with Microsoft had cooled off they held out some hope that the tech company would come back to the negotiating table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't mean they won't be back in another iteration. We'll have to wait and see," said the senior media executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Microsoft pulls back from its original ambitions, Google Inc, Amazon.com and others have continued with a push to unravel the $100 billion U.S. cable television ecosystem dominated by major distributors such as Comcast Corp and DirecTV Group and program makers like Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web TV newcomers are all chasing Netflix, whose online video and DVD subscription service has grown to more than 23 million users in the United States and this week debuted in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix's success has left the cable industry conflicted. While program makers welcome the big checks that online video partners offer, they also fear that in the long run cheaper online video services will cannibalize the cable TV subscriptions that generate the vast majority of their revenue and profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid that outcome, programmers, under extra pressure from their cable and satellite TV distribution partners, have asked for costly, long-term commitments from potential online partners who want newer TV shows and movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distributors are also cutting Web TV deals of their own with the program makers. The best recent example is the 10-year programming agreement between Comcast and Disney, a deal that will eventually offer a vast amount of Disney's cable shows online for the first time to paying Comcast TV subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an expensive business," a second media executive with knowledge of the situation said, referring to the cost of producing top quality TV shows and movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Yinka Adegoke; Editing by Peter Lauria)&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Issues Interim Update for Fourth Quarter 2011
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported in its interim update 
      that earnings for the fourth quarter 2011 are expected to be 
      significantly below third quarter 2011 results. Absent foreign exchange 
      impacts, upstream earnings are projected to be comparable with third 
      quarter results. Downstream earnings in the fourth quarter are expected 
      to be near breakeven. Lower margins and refinery input volumes, and the 
      absence of an asset sale gain are expected to reduce downstream earnings 
      significantly compared to third quarter results. Full third quarter 
      earnings included foreign exchange gains of nearly $450 million, 
      compared to a loss anticipated in the fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Basis for Comparison in Interim Update
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The interim update contains certain industry and company operating data 
      for the fourth quarter 2011. The production volumes, realizations, 
      margins and certain other items in the report are based on a portion of 
      the quarter and are not necessarily indicative of Chevron's full 
      quarterly results to be reported on January 27, 2012. The reader should 
      not place undue reliance on this data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Readers should be advised that portions of the commentary below compare 
      results for the first two months of the 
      fourth quarter 2011 to full third quarter 
      2011 results, as indicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			UPSTREAM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The table that follows includes information on production and price 
      indicators for crude oil and natural gas for specific markets. Actual 
      realizations may vary from indicative pricing due to quality and 
      location differentials and the effect of pricing lags. International 
      earnings are driven by actual liftings, which may differ from production 
      due to the timing of cargoes and other factors.

			1 The Avg. Brent Spot Price is based on Platts daily 
      assessments, using Chevron&#8217;s internal formula to produce a quarterly 
      average.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. net oil-equivalent production during the first two months of the 
      fourth quarter was comparable with third quarter results. International 
      net oil-equivalent production increased 42,000 barrels per day during 
      the first two months of the fourth quarter, reflecting the completion of 
      maintenance in Kazakhstan, and resolution of a third party pipeline 
      incident and the ramp up of the Platong II project in Thailand, partly 
      offset by an extended turnaround in Trinidad and reduced natural gas 
      demand in Thailand due to flooding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. crude oil realizations increased $5.14 per barrel during the first 
      two months of the fourth quarter, while international liquids 
      realizations declined $1.04 to $101.78 per barrel. U.S. natural gas 
      realizations decreased $0.43 to $3.71 per thousand cubic feet, while 
      international natural gas realizations remained relatively flat at $5.51 
      per thousand cubic feet during the first two months of the fourth 
      quarter.

      The table that follows includes industry benchmark indicators for

      will differ due to crude and product mix effects, planned and unplanned 
      shutdown activity and other company-specific and operational factors.

      In the United States, Gulf Coast refining margins fell substantially in 
      the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. During the first two 
      months of the fourth quarter, U.S. refinery crude-input volumes 
      decreased by 180,000 barrels per day, largely reflecting a major 
      turnaround at the Richmond, California refinery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Outside the United States, refining and marketing margins fell in the 
      fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. In addition, daily 
      refinery crude-input volumes were down 90,000 barrels per day for the 
      first two months of the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the sale of 
      the Pembroke U.K. refinery completed early in the third quarter.

      The company&#8217;s general guidance for the quarterly net after-tax charges 
      related to corporate and other activities is between $250 million and 
      $350 million. Total net charges for the fourth quarter are expected to 
      be notably higher than the general guidance range.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This interim update of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking 
      statements relating to Chevron&#8217;s operations that are based on 
      management&#8217;s current expectations, estimates and projections about the 
      petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words such as 
      &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; 
      &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;schedules,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;budgets&#8221; and similar 
      expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. 
      These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are 
      subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which 
      are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are difficult to predict. 
      Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what 
      is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The 
      reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking 
      statements, which speak only as of the date of this interim update. 
      Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update 
      publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new 
      information, future events or otherwise.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemical margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s net 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes under existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company&#8217;s future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or 
      impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally 
      accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and 
      the factors set forth under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 32 
      through 34 of the company&#8217;s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 
      addition, such statements could be affected by general domestic and 
      international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or 
      unknown factors not discussed in this interim update could also have 
      material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - David B. Heller and Edward K. Eisler, two of four co-heads of securities trading at Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) are leaving the firm, according to internal memos.&lt;/p&gt;

Heller, based in New York, has been with Goldman for 22 years and Eisler, based in London, 18 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men will continue as non-employee advisers to the firm, according to spokesman Michael DuVally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle Ealet, the firm's London-based global head of commodities, was named to be one of three heads of the securities division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and other investment banking firms are reducing payroll, cutting other costs and making sweeping changes at their top levels in response to a slowdown in trading and investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's earnings per share for 2011 are estimated to be down 62 percent from 2010, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is scheduled to report results next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman adviser says 3 scholars have not endorsed sukuk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Adviser says Goldman's endeavours greater than required&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Some scholars surprised and concerned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Anjuli Davies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' 
controversial $2 billion Islamic bond programme faced a fresh
challenge on Wednesday as it emerged that at least two scholars
named as potential approvers had not even seen the prospectus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asim Khan, an adviser to Goldman on the issue which needs
approval from sharia scholars to proceed, confirmed media
reports that three of the eight scholars listed as potential
approvers had not responded to requests to endorse the issue,
but he said their lack of co-operation had no bearing on its
sharia credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's first sukuk, also the first by any U.S. bank, is
already facing suggestions that it may contravene religious
principles by using proceeds to lend money to clients for
interest, accusations rejected by the bank's
adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adviser Khan named the three who had not responded as Daud
Bakar, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Sulaiman Al Manea and Mohamed Ali
Elgari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given that the issuance was not to take place at that stage
and this was only a preliminary prospectus, it was appropriate
not to pre-judge the eventual outcome or speculate which sharia
scholars would eventually be available to consider, evaluate and
sign off on the sharia compliance of this complex transaction,"
said Khan, who is managing director at Islamic finance advisor
Dar Al Istithmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some of those scholars contacted by Reuters said they
had been both surprised and concerned that their name was on the
prospectus. Two scholars, neither of whom wanted to be
identified, said they had not seen any documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHARIA APPROVAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic
Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) demands at least three sharia
scholars advising on a bond programme give written approval that
a sukuk structure complies with religious principles governing
Islamic finance in order to proceed with issuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the preliminary prospectus filed with the Irish Stock
Exchange on Oct. 18, Goldman Sachs had named eight sharia
scholars on page 21 as expected advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final prospectus has not yet been published, but Khan
maintains that a far greater number of prominent scholars have
been approached, and their sharia approval obtained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We fail to understand what the fuss is about," said Khan.
"It is ironic that Goldman Sachs' extra endeavours in seeking
guidance from a very broad spectrum of Sharia scholars is sought
to perpetuate misgivings about sharia compliance of its
product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murat Unal CEO of Funds@Work, an investment consultant who
has extensively researched the global network of sharia scholars
and their board memberships told Reuters that the reputation of
a sharia scholar is often used by institutions as leverage in
selling a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The worst thing is that they have no idea the company is
mentioning their name in the market," said Unal. "It's (Islamic
finance) an emerging industry and the reputation of the scholars
make up for a lack of governance, so the industry depends on
their reputation to sell the products and therefore the
potential to misrepresent is there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Goldman registered the programme and set up a
Cayman Islands-registered special purpose vehicle called Global
Sukuk Co Ltd to issue a sukuk based on murabaha, a
cost-plus-profit arrangement which complies with Islamic law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a column for Reuters earlier this month, Khan said
Goldman's entry into Islamic finance could help the industry
overcome obstacles hindering its expansion, including a shortage
of tools to help banks manage their liquidity, and a lack of
sufficient involvement by institutional funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The benefits of a large investment bank's foray into
Islamic banking could be significant," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has declined to comment on the planned
timeline for the programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controversies over the permissibility of financial
instruments, which can affect investors' willingness to put
money into them, have characterised Islamic finance since it was
born in its modern form in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A range of scholars and industry bodies set product
standards which are sometimes contradictory and act as
guidelines rather than firm, enforceable rules.&lt;/p&gt;

			Phytel, 
      the leader in provider-led health improvement, announced today that 
      Steve Schelhammer, CEO of Phytel, will make a presentation at the 30th

      Jan. 12, at 1:30 p.m. PST.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Schelhammer will focus on the automation 
      of population health management, illustrating how it is key to 
      improving the quality and lowering the cost of care as the industry 
      moves from fee-for-service to value-based healthcare. He will explain 
      how Phytel's solutions can help provider organizations identify 
      high-risk patients and meet their needs while addressing the care gaps 
      of the rest of the patient population through automated patient 
      monitoring and outreach. In addition, he will describe how healthcare 
      organizations can use Phytel's services to make care managers more 
      efficient and effective, engage patients more fully in their own care, 
      and improve 
      care transitions between hospital and ambulatory care.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are honored to be asked to make a presentation at the 30th

      events of its kind," said Schelhammer. "Leaders in today&#8217;s healthcare 
      environment are recognizing the importance of automating population 
      health management. Organizations that make optimal use of information 
      technology to manage the health of all their patients will achieve the 
      best outcomes at the lowest cost."

			LJPR: Gove Announcement esponse: ComputerXplorers already helping 
      school children as young as 7 to learn computer programming
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key is engaging with children at a very early age with content that 
      enthuses and inspires
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ComputerXplorers, the specialist provider of ICT to primary schools 
      since 2006 welcomes the news that the Government is encouraging schools 
      to bring in specialists providers to teach computer skills to children, 
      but points out that for some forward thinking schools&#160;who already 
      outsource elements of ICT delivery to ComputerXplorers professionals, 
      programming in 3D, designing Smartphone aps and video animation is 
      already a reality.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ComputerXplorers classes are delivered by its own trained teachers who 
      are currently involved in&#160;over 100&#160;schools throughout the UK. For 
      example, in Sutton Coldfield pupils in the New Oscott Primary School's 
      after school club have&#160;programmed and designed their own android apps 
      and children in Belmore Primary in Hayes have been working on creating 
      3D animated video games.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nigel Toplis, managing director of ComputerXplorers&#160;has long been a 
      campaigner for improved technology education in schools and the company 
      will be offering all the assistance&#160;it can&#160;to the Government in the 
      forthcoming consultation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The business specialises in teaching technology to children aged three 
      to 13 and provides fully trained teachers, well designed course content 
      and the use of digital equipment such as microscopes, robots and cameras 
      to schools. Courses combine computer skills with a fun factor helping 
      children to create and use technology as part of their every-day 
      learning from an early age.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Said Nigel Toplis: &#8220;Engaging with children at an early age in the right 
      way is vital to a child&#8217;s understanding of and interest in, technology. 
      We have only a small window to engage children in ICT - get it wrong and 
      we will be back to square one.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Specialist teaching is required and course content has to be 
      entertaining and motivating to capture the attention and imagination of 
      young minds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our courses are designed to give children as young as&#160;three the skills 
      they need to embrace technology with excitement and enthusiasm and the 
      ability to apply the&#160;learning across the whole curriculum - not just ICT 
      classes.

      Fitch Solutions: JP Morgan's CDS Come In 15%; Lennar Rebounds 35%
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With attention on banks likely to remain high, tighter credit default 
      swap (CDS) spreads indicate solid footing for JPMorgan Chase  Co. to 
      start 2012, according to Fitch Solutions in its latest earnings 
      commentary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Spreads on JPMorgan Chase (reporting Friday) have rallied 15% over the 
      past three months, outperforming the broader US banking sector (CDS 7% 
      tighter). 'JP Morgan's CDS are trending tight of their historical 'BBB' 
      trading pattern, indicating credit market improved sentiment,' said 
      Author and Director Diana Allmendinger.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CDS liquidity for JPM has also dropped to the 17th regional percentile 
      to the 13th showing more market certainty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A rebound in market confidence is also evident in tighter spreads for

			JustEnough Software, Columbus and Keyora Launch E2E Retail Powered by 
      Microsoft Dynamics
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Joint Offering Marks the Industry&#8217;s First Comprehensive, 
      End-to-End Solution for Omni-Channel Retailing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JustEnough 
      Software, Columbus 
      and Keyora 
      today announce the launch of their joint offering, E2E Retail Powered 
      by Microsoft Dynamics. Built on Microsoft&#8217;s industry-leading 
      Dynamics AX enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, it is the 
      industry&#8217;s first cohesive, end-to-end solution designed to meet the 
      needs of today&#8217;s omni-channel retailers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      E2E Retail Powered by Microsoft Dynamics brings together powerful 
      e-commerce, financial planning, merchandise and assortment planning, 
      allocation and replenishment, business intelligence, store operations 
      and point-of-sale capabilities. The solution eliminates reliance on 
      disparate and disconnected retail systems, replacing them with 
      real-time, connected workflows. As a result, retailers can unite their 
      people, processes and selling channels in an effort to:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Compete for brand differentiation and customer loyalty
      
			
        Meet and exceed the needs of increasingly demanding consumers
      
			
        Keep pace with the rate of change as new selling channels emerge and 
        the line between social networks and the marketplace continues to blur
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the growing number of selling channels, product choices and 
      unprecedented access to information, retailers are challenged to keep 
      pace with changing consumer buying behaviors,&#8221; said Malcolm Buxton, 
      president and chief executive officer of JustEnough. &#8220;The 
      omni-channel retail environment is making it more difficult for 
      companies to meet increasing service-level expectations while minimizing 
      inventory costs and maximizing margins. E2E Retail Powered by Microsoft 
      Dynamics can help. Users will be able to plan demand-driven assortments 
      and deliver the right products to the right channels to drive up sales 
      and corner market share.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Thomas Hauge, managing director of Columbus North America, added, 
      &#8220;The benefits retailers will realize using E2E Retail Powered by 
      Microsoft Dynamics are numerous. Increased basket size, improved 
      enterprise-wide visibility and enhanced customer service levels combined 
      with the ability to blend sales channels are just some of the tangible 
      results users will enjoy. Ultimately, retailers will gain the 
      flexibility and control needed to deliver a compelling omni-channel 
      shopping experience.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Jan 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 has appointed Eiji Ueda and James Paradise as co-heads of
its Asia-Pacific Securities Division, filling the role left
vacant by the departure of Yusuf Alireza, according to an
internal memo seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alireza, who headed the securities division in addition to
being co-president of the firm's overall Asia-Pacific business,
left the firm in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ueda and Paradise will relocate to Hong Kong from Tokyo and
London, respectively, and will report to the four co-heads of
the global securities division - David Heller, Edward Eisler,
Pablo Salame and Harvey Schwartz, the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two have yet to finalise the allocation of
responsibilities between them, but given Ueda's background in
fixed income and Paradise's experience in equities it is likely
that they will run the unit along this traditional division,
according to a source familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ueda has been co-head of fixed income, currencies and
commodities in Japan since 2009. Paradise has been co-head of
Goldman's prime brokerage business in London since 2008 and,
like Ueda, became a managing director in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Morgan Healthcare Conference Presentation Focused on Three Transformational Programs for 2012</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;  SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Jan 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. presented its strategic business plan for
2012 at this week's J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, which involves
focusing its resources to advance clinical development of its three
pipeline value drivers: betrixaban, a once-daily, oral Factor Xa
inhibitor; PRT064445, a recombinant Factor Xa inhibitor antidote and
companion product to betrixaban; and PRT062607, an oral Syk-specific
inhibitor under development in collaboration with Biogen Idec for
inflammatory diseases. 

    "We've prioritized our early- and late-stage clinical programs to build
an enduring company with proprietary and partnered programs that each has
billion dollar revenue potential," said William Lis, chief executive
officer of Portola. "With cash reserves plus the more than $130 million
in capital we brought into the company in financing and licensing deals
in 2011, we have the resources and capability to take betrixaban and the
antidote, which we fully own, through to approval to address a large
unmet portion of the $15 to $20 billion projected anticoagulant market.
Importantly, betrixaban is positioned to be the first oral Factor Xa
inhibitor to the market for both hospital and post-discharge prevention
of pulmonary embolism in acute medically ill patients. We expect to
initiate trials of both compounds in the first half of 2012."

    He added, "We are developing multiple life-saving medicines in thrombosis
and autoimmune diseases and our partnership with Biogen Idec allows us to
participate in the development and commercialization of a potential
first-in-class agent, while leveraging the resources and outstanding
track record of our partner in the area of autoimmune disease. Across our
portfolio we are accelerating value with efficient use of our capital to
finance multiple inflection points." 

    Aligning with this focused strategy, Portola does not plan to invest its
own resources to advance elinogrel, its i.v. and oral P2Y12 ADP receptor
antagonist partnered with Novartis, which announced in the first quarter
of 2011 that it would not proceed with its planned Phase 3 ECLIPSE trial.
Novartis and Portola are in discussions on ways to potentially move
elinogrel forward under a revised agreement that does not require Portola
funding. 

    Portola recently completed a financing that raised $89 million in cash.
By the end of 2012, the Company expects to: 


--  Initiate a Phase 3 trial of betrixaban in a new indication -- the
    prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acute medically ill
    patients;
--  Initiate a Phase 2 trial of PRT062607 in collaboration with Biogen
    Idec; and
--  Initiate a Phase 1 trial of PRT064445, which is designed to reverse
    anticoagulant activity in patients treated with all Factor Xa
    inhibitors and low molecular weight heparins who are suffering major
    bleeds or requiring surgery.
--  Pursue partnerships for its preclinical JAK and multi-kinase
    inhibitors program.

    

About Betrixaban 
 Betrixaban is an oral small molecule that
directly inhibits the activity of Factor Xa, an important validated
target in the blood coagulation pathway. A Phase 3-ready, once-daily,
oral Factor Xa inhibitor, betrixaban has unique properties compared with
other agents in the Factor Xa class. These include a half-life suitable
for once daily dosing, a low level of clearance through the kidney, and
lack of metabolism through the CYP pathway. Betrixaban also is reversible
with PRT064445, a universal Factor Xa inhibitor. 

    About PRT064445
 Portola is developing PRT064445, a Factor X inhibitor
antidote, to address life-threatening bleeding by reversing the activity
of direct and indirect Factor Xa inhibitors in patients experiencing a
major bleeding event and those undergoing emergency or elective surgery.
Portola has presented in vivo proof of concept data showing that this
novel recombinant protein has the potential to act as a universal
antidote for reversal of anticoagulation of all current Factor Xa
inhibitors, both small molecule and anti-thrombin dependent, including
betrixaban. Preclinical study results have demonstrated that PRT064445
can reverse the pharmacodynamic effects of anticoagulation by enoxaparin,
a low molecular weight heparin, and fondaparinux, both Factor Xa
inhibitors, and reduce blood loss caused by these compounds in an animal
model. Additional preclinical study results have shown that PRT064445
reverses anticoagulant activity of the direct Factor Xa inhibitor
rivaroxaban.

    About PRT062607
 Portola is collaborating with Biogen Idec to develop
PRT062607, an oral Syk-specific kinase inhibitor. PRT062607 has been
shown to be a highly specific inhibitor of Syk in a broad panel of in
vitro kinase and cellular assays. Kinase selectivity may lead to an agent
that is safer and better tolerated than other compounds in development.
PRT062607 reduced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner in a number of
preclinical in vivo models of rheumatoid arthritis. It has also been
effective in killing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia tumor cells. PRT062607 is currently in a Phase 1
program. Results of a Phase 1 single ascending dose study showed
PRT062607 was well tolerated with a profile suitable for once-daily
dosing.

    About Elinogrel
 In February 2009, Portola entered an exclusive worldwide
license agreement with Novartis to develop and commercialize elinogrel.
Elinogrel most recently completed Phase 2 testing in the INNOVATE-PCI
study, which evaluated the efficacy of elinogrel in approximately 650
patients undergoing non-urgent percutaneous coronary intervention.
Results showed the trial achieved its objectives, with the i.v. and oral
elinogrel regimen providing more rapid and greater antiplatelet activity
than Plavix(R) (clopidogrel) without a significant increase in the risk
of TIMI major and minor bleeding. 

    About Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 Portola Pharmaceuticals discovers
and develops innovative therapeutics based on targets with established
proof of concept that are designed to provide significant advances over
current treatments for cardiovascular and autoimmune/inflammatory
diseases. Portola scientists have successfully collaborated for over 15
years on the discovery and development of novel small molecule agents
targeting platelets, coagulation pathways and protein kinases. In
thrombosis, Portola is independently developing betrixaban and its
companion product, PRT064445. In inflammation, Portola is collaborating
with Biogen Idec to develop PRT062607, an oral Syk-specific kinase
inhibitor. In addition to the Syk clinical programs, Portola's broad
chemistry capability has led to the discovery of potent, oral specific
inhibitors of Janus Kinase (JAK), as well as dual inhibitors of Syk and
JAK for chronic autoimmune indications and oncology. For additional

&lt;p&gt;Mandelbaum, 49 years-old and head of strategy and business development, "has decided to leave the firm to focus on entrepreneurial and other interests," Dimon said in a memo to employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jay has been an excellent partner of mine since 1992, and I will miss him tremendously," Dimon wrote. Mandelbaum may serve as a board member of companies in which the bank invests, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon also said that Doug Petno, 46, has been promoted to chief executive of commercial banking and that Todd Maclin who was doing that job will now focus entirely on the consumer and business banking franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, John Hogan, 45, the chief risk officer of the investment bank, has been promoted to be chief risk officer for the entire company. Barry Zubrow, 58, who previously held the post, will take the new role of head of corporate and regulatory affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon Smith, the head of credit cards and auto lending, will now oversee three executives who previously reported to Mandelbaum and are responsible for corporate marketing, mobile and e-commerce, and the corporate internet group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - Shares in Research In Motion climbed nearly 4 percent on Thursday on market speculation the BlackBerry maker had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs to explore strategic options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM has been the target of a steady stream of takeover talk as its market valuation has crawled along at multi-year lows amid product delays and profit warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have largely downplayed the prospects of a sale, saying no natural buyers exist and that current management is focused on turning around the company's fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's up on Goldman, but I wouldn't put too much on that," said one trader who declined to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM stock jumped sharply in September on reports that activist investor Carl Icahn might take a stake, and again a week later on talk it had hired an investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It jumped again in December after Reuters reported that Amazon.com and other potential buyers had considered a bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM was not immediately available to comment. It typically declines to comment on rumor or speculation. Goldman was also not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock was steady at $16.05, a 2.8 percent increase, just after midday on Nasdaq. In Toronto, the shares were up 2.7 percent at C$16.35 after rising as high as C$16.63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock has lost 75 percent of its value in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alastair Sharp in Toronto and Nadia Damouni in New York; editing by Rob Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 12 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp plans to drill
380 new oil wells in Indonesia this year, to add 11,200 barrels
per day (bpd) of oil production, the country's upstream oil and
gas regulator BPMigas said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. firm, the leading oil producer in Indonesia, is
also planning to rework 211 of its existing wells to produce an
additional 4,200 bpd of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPMigas official Lambok Hutauruk said local affiliate
Chevron Pacific Indonesia will produce 350,000 bpd of oil in
2012, higher than an existing company target of 330,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris Djauhari, an official at Chevron Pacific Indonesia,
said the new drilling was key to meet this year's production
level, but the company was concerned about possible land
problems and resistance from local residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's output makes up 40 percent of total national oil
and gas production in Indonesia, though the company's production
dropped by around 35,000 bpd last year due to a pipeline
leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, a former OPEC member, has struggled to attract
new investment to halt a long-term decline in oil output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* U.S. stock index futures pointed to a flat to slightly
lower open on Wall Street on Thursday, with S 500 
futures down 0.14 percent, Dow Jones futures down 0.10
percent and Nasdaq 100 futures up 0.01 percent at 0925
GMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Chevron Corp will be in the spotlight after it
warned that fourth-quarter profit would be significantly below
the previous quarter, with production still falling short of
prior expectations. Shares of the group trading in Frankfurt
 were down 2.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Nervous investors kept the euro currency and
European stocks within narrow ranges on Thursday morning with
the markets focused on any signal from the European Central
Bank's rate meeting about a policy easing and a Spanish bond
sale that will test demand for Europe's debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The ECB was seen taking a breather this month after
cutting interest rates, pausing to assess the impact of a series
of measures it took in late 2011. In a Reuters poll, 56 out of
66 economists expected rates to remain at the current level,
with investor focus on a news conference with ECB President
Mario Draghi, starting at 1330 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Greece may need more funds from European partners bailing
out the country if not enough private creditors sign up for a
voluntary swap of bonds to cut the country's debt burden, its
deputy finance minister said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* China's inflation rate eased to a 15-month low in
December, though food prices are a reminder of the risks the
government is weighing as it tilts policy towards boosting
growth as internal and external demand for Chinese goods
falters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Car sales in China climbed 5.2 percent in 2011, the
slowest pace since the nation's car culture took off at the turn
of the century, as consumers shunned local brands after Beijing
scrapped tax incentives for small cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* China's economy is being weighed down by slowing growth in
the United States and the European Union, but the possibility of
a hard landing should be ruled out, said David Lipton, first
deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Royal Bank of Scotland is to axe 3,500 investment
bank jobs and sell or shut equities and advisory business under
a 3-year plan to further reduce risk and focus more on domestic
retail and corporate banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Big 5 Sporting Goods Corp cut its quarterly
earnings forecast and posted weak sales, as a
warmer-than-expected weather hurt demand for winter merchandise,
sending shares down 13 percent in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Infosys Ltd, the No.2 Indian software exporter,
trimmed its full-year revenue growth outlook for a second time
and warned of lower client spending due to the debt crisis in
Europe, sending its shares down nearly 8 percent to their lowest
in more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Raymond James Financial Inc said on Wednesday it
agreed to acquire Southeast investment bank and brokerage Morgan
Keegan from Regions Financial Corp for $930 million in
stock, concluding a drawn-out auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Morgan Stanley has cut 10 fixed-income jobs, mainly in

&lt;p&gt;* JP Morgan sees takeover play for Echo by rival Crown in
2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Says BHP may bid for Woodside; Woolworths may bid for JB
Hi-Fi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Predicts Aston Resources may attract counter bid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Miranda Maxwell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 12 (Reuters) - Casino owner Echo Entertainment
 is Australia's No. 1 contender to be taken over in 2012
in a year likely to be dominated by acquisitions in resource
companies, according to JP Morgan's hedge fund sales desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woolworths may bid for electronic retailer JB Hi-Fi
, BHP Billiton could consider reviving a tilt
for Woodside Petroleum, and Aston Resources is
in the running to snare a counter bid, the JP Morgan sales desk
team predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since starting the "Specialist Sales Top Takeovers List" two
years ago, JP Morgan has successfully picked 18 Australian
takeover stocks, it said, including Sundance, Extract
Resources, Foster's and Equinox Minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top of its 2012 list was a play for Echo, owner of The Star
casino in Sydney, by James Packer's rival Crown casino
group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Echo is our highest conviction takeover target for 2012,"
JP Morgan said in the report obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now is the time that Crown has to move if it wants to buy
the company at a decent price. Once the (Star casino) capex
benefits start flowing through to the bottom line, the share
price might be out of reach," it said. Crown already owns a 4.9
percent stake in Echo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible 2012 play was a takeover of JB Hi-Fi by
supermarket leader Woolworths, which has almost completed a
strategic review of its Dick Smith consumer electronics
division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a good chance that Woolworths will bid for JB
Hi-Fi. This will lead to Woolworths having the no 1 consumer
electronics business in Australia," the report said. It said a
hedge against buying JB Hi-Fi in the event of further weakness
in retailers would be to short Harvey Norman HVN.AX .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this volatile market, we believe all pre-event
situations should have a good hedge as protection," the note
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aston Resources had a "good chance" of getting a counter bid
as its world class Maules Creek asset was the largest coal
project in Australia by reserves not owned by one of the majors
and this could be the "last opportunity before it becomes part
of a much bigger portfolio of assets," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from buying Echo, Aston and JB Hi-Fi -- while going
short on Crown, BHP and Harvey Norman as a hedge -- JPMorgan
said its other top trade idea was to buy Woodside Petroleum and
go short on Worley Parsons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Woodside trading close to its GFC (global financial
crisis) lows, we believe BHP may finally make a move on it this
year," the report said, noting Shell's remaining 24 percent
stake is for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible takeover targets listed were gaming company
Tabcorp by Tatts Group, building materials
group Adelaide Brighton by Fletcher Building,
possibly with Boral as a joint bidder, Graincorp
 and Transurban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real estate firm FKP Property Group was seen as a
possible target for Stockland, Centro Retail Australia
 or Mirvac for Lend Lease, and IOOF
Holdings for AMP or a top bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resource companies seen as likely targets include Sandfire,
PanAust, Discovery Metals, Oz Minerals
, Bathurst, Santos, Buruenergy
, Senex, Atlas Iron, Aquila Resources
, Ironore, Regis, Perseus,
Medusa, Paladin, Iluka Resources and
Mirabela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - BankUnited Inc's (BKU.N) private equity owners have put the Florida bank up for sale and have hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to run the process, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BankUnited was approached by more than one strategic bidder, prompting the review, and a decision on whether a sale takes place could come in the next two weeks, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private equity owners of BankUnited, which has a market value of about $2.3 billion, include Wilbur Ross's WL Ross &amp; Co, Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and Carlyle Group CYL.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BankUnited has already proven to be a blockbuster deal for the private equity firms. When the company went public in January 2011, the private equity investors saw the value of their initial investment of $900 million nearly triple at the IPO price of $27 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second source familiar with the situation said some of the private equity owners were only too happy to consider a sale, given the extent of scrutiny from U.S. bank regulators and the uncertainty about whether the tax cuts instituted under the Bush administration 10 years ago would be extended beyond 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At BankUnited, regulatory scrutiny translated to the U.S. Federal Reserve asking for an unprecedented amount of disclosure, such as asking for personal financial statements from every partner at all the private equity firms that had invested and not just the executives involved in the deal, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sources, however, warned that there were no guarantees that a deal would be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BankUnited, Goldman, the Fed and all private equity firms declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of BankUnited closed up 5.7 percent at $24.48 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consortium of private equity investors, led by veteran banker John Kanas, bought the assets of a failed Florida bank of the same name during the financial crisis in May 2009. Kanas had earlier run North Fork Bancorp for about 20 years before eventually selling it to Capital One (COF.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, which came with certain protections offered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, led to a rush of other private equity and hedge fund investors looking at investing in the sector and prompted regulators to put in stricter rules to govern such investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BankUnited has more than $11 billion in assets and more than 90 branches and focuses on commercial banking. In June, BankUnited agreed to buy New York-based Herald NationalBank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg earlier reported the news of BankUnited's sale process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal and Greg Roumeliotis in New York, and Jochelle Mendonca in Bangalore; Editing by Bernard Orr and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  BIRMINGHAM, AL, Jan 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walter Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT), the world's leading, publicly
traded "pure play" producer of metallurgical (met) coal for the global
steel industry, today provided guidance that 2012 met coal production
will be between 11.5 million and 13 million metric tons. Also, Walter
Energy, Inc. (Walter) commented on fourth quarter results and announced
that it has made three executive appointments.

    "Our production outlook for 2012 represents very robust growth compared
with 2011, which was a year of solid gains for met coal production," said
CEO Walt Scheller. "This change reflects my evaluation during the first
three months as CEO of our global operations, strategy and timing of
major projects. The executive appointments announced today will help us
accomplish our strategic and operational growth objectives. We will
provide additional insights into operational results during our earnings
call in late February 2012." 

    2012 Production Guidance 

    Walter is resetting the range of expected met coal production in 2012 for
a number of reasons, including the inherent risks of the mining business
and slightly lower expectations from some of the startup developmental
projects like the Aberpergwm mine in Wales. The new projected growth of
11.5 to 13 million metric tons compares with prior expectations for 2012
of 13 to 14 million metric tons of met coal.

    For 2011, Walter produced 8.7 million metric tons of met coal, including
nine months of production from the operations of Western Coal Corp. that
Walter acquired on April 1, 2011. This excludes the 1 million tons of met
coal production Western Coal Corp. had during pre-acquisition first
quarter 2011. Compared with the combined base, Walter's expected 2012
production represents an increase in the range of 19% to 34%. 

    Fourth Quarter 2011 Results 

    Met coal sales volume and production in the fourth quarter of 2011 were
both approximately 2.4 million metric tons. Similarly, for the full year
2011 met coal sales volume matched the above-mentioned actual annual
production rate of approximately 8.7 million metric tons. 

    On a consolidated basis for the fourth quarter of 2011, production was
approximately 400,000 metric tons lower than previous guidance and sales
volume was approximately 130,000 metric tons lower than previous
guidance. The fourth quarter production shortfall was principally due to
equipment issues on the second longwall at Mine No. 7 in Alabama and
unanticipated ventilation issues associated with the startup of the
nearby third longwall. The fourth quarter sales volume had a much smaller
shortfall due to sales from inventory and sales of purchased coal.

    Sales volume from the mines in Canada exceeded 1 million metric tons of
met coal, which was at the high end of our guidance. These Canadian sales
helped to partially offset the Alabama sales shortfall of approximately
280,000 tons but have lower margins than Walter's Alabama mines.
Additionally, the average selling price for Walter's met coal was near
the low end of previous guidance and, due principally to lower production
volumes in the U.S., the average cash cost per ton was near the high end
of previous guidance.

    Given this combination of factors, Walter estimates that fourth quarter
2011 financial results were below the low end of its prior guidance. As
noted above, actual financial results will be disclosed at end of
February 2012. 

    Executive Appointments 

    Dan Cartwright has been named President - Canadian Operations, effective
immediately. Mr. Cartwright, who joined Walter Energy in June 2011, has
more than 37 years of mining experience, mainly with surface mines such
as those operated by Walter in Canada. He was previously Vice President

where he supported six large mines in Wyoming, New Mexico and Arizona.
Prior to that role, Cartwright was Operations Director - North Antelope
Rochelle Operations Unit, Peabody's flagship operation. Cartwright also
worked for Shell Mining Company in various positions for over 15 years,
most recently as President, Shell/Marrowbone Development Company. 

    Rich Donnelly has been named President - Jim Walter Resources (JWR),
effective immediately. Mr. Donnelly was most recently Vice President -
Engineering for JWR and has worked for Walter 34 years. Donnelly has
extensive experience in all aspects of the mining business and has held
numerous operational positions throughout the organization. Donnelly has
served in various Deputy Mine Manager positions, and in various Mine
Manager positions at Walter properties. In addition, Donnelly has
previously served as Vice President - Operations for Jim Walter
Resources. 

    Earl H. Doppelt has been named Senior Vice President-General Counsel and
Secretary, effective immediately. With over 30 years of legal experience,
Mr. Doppelt has served as the senior legal officer of several major
global companies including: The Nielsen Corporation (formerly VNU),

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch: JP Morgan Chase 4Q11 Results In Line with Expectations
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JP Morgan Chase's (JPM) 4Q11 results are in line with Fitch Ratings' 
      expectations. The company reported 4Q11 and full-year earnings of $3.7 
      billion and $19.0 billion respectively, 4Q11 signaled continued 
      sluggishness, mainly in the investment bank (although other business 
      lines were not immune). While reported results were down on both a 
      quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and sequential basis, Fitch estimates that 
      JPM had $5.1 billion of pretax profit vs. $4.5 billion in 3Q11. 
      Nonetheless, JPM reported record full year 2011 earnings of $19.0 
      billion on revenues of $99.8 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investment bank continues to be a source of volatile earnings. 
      Adjusting for the DVA loss of $570 million in the quarter, net revenues 
      and income would have been $4.9 billion and $1.1 billion respectively 
      and up sequentially from 3Q11 allowing for similar DVA adjustment in 
      3Q11. Weakness was manifested mainly in equities, although fixed income 
      was down as well highlighting challenges for the business. Nonetheless, 
      JPM continues to retain top spots in league tables highlighting the 
      continued strength of the franchise relative to peers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company's Asset Management (AM) and Treasury  Securities Services 
      (TSS) business also experienced marginally weaker results in the quarter 
      reflecting slightly higher expenses in TSS, while AM had modestly lower 
      revenue owing to lower performance fees. TSS, along with IB, also 
      incurred higher credit provisions related to large corporate borrowers, 
      a trend that may be seen at other large banks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Broadly, in the consumer businesses -- Retail Financial Services (RFS) 
      and Card Services  Auto (CS) -- showed mixed results as RFS had weaker 
      results which were offset by improving performance in CS. The credit 
      card business had improving transaction volume trends in core portfolios 
      and improved loss rates. However, RFS experienced continued weakness in 
      residential mortgage-related businesses, which remain challenged. The 
      company incurred additional provisions of $770 million for purchased 
      impaired loans as well further charges to its mortgage servicing rights.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corporate/Private Equity swung to a profit of $223 million following the 
      loss incurred in 3Q11 related to the write-down of PE holdings. In 
      addition, JPM added $528 million to its litigation reserve, mainly 
      related to mortgage-related matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM reported aggregate loan growth of 4% during the quarter, which came 
      mainly from wholesale and commercial lending. This is noteworthy against 
      the weak economic backdrop coupled with the continued run-off of 
      non-core lending portfolios. Moreover, JPM was able to grow deposits at 
      a commensurate rate, with over $1.1 trillion at quarter end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM continues to improve its capital ratios in anticipation of Basel III 
      implementation through its earnings power; its estimated that Basel III 
      Tier 1 Common ratio of 7.9% at quarter end, which should allow the 
      company to maintain its capital flexibility into 2012.

&lt;p&gt;By Antony Currie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan deserves a little more love from its shareholders. Granted, its fourth-quarter earnings weren&#8217;t great. But overall, JPMorgan is in a solid position. And yet its stock languishes at around three-quarters of book value. It&#8217;s time for investors to overcome their fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reticence to do so is perhaps understandable. With Europe&#8217;s woes continuing and a lack of clarity on a variety of new industry rules and regulations, it has been hard to regard virtually any bank stock as a screaming buy. And JPMorgan&#8217;s 11 percent return on tangible equity in the three months to December, which relied on a lowly 21 percent tax rate, isn&#8217;t much to write home about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But America&#8217;s largest bank by assets continues to cut loan losses and release more from reserves. It&#8217;s also lending more &#8211; and at a pace that&#8217;s slightly above the industry average. And it&#8217;s likely be in a position to increase its dividend and buy back more shares after the Federal Reserve-administered stress test this March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is even keeping pay in check. The bank only set aside more lucre for its staff when units performed better or, as was the case with retail banking, hired more people. It even delivered almost $1 billion more to shareholders by cutting compensation for its Wall Streeters, a 9 percent drop compared to 2010, even though revenue was flat and profit rose slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, JPMorgan usually earns more than its cost of capital. Bulking up its common equity under Basel III to 9.5 percent of risk-weighted assets shouldn&#8217;t affect that either. All else being equal, the bank needs another $25 billion or so of qualifying equity capital to hit the target. Generating a 15 percent return on that requires $22.5 billion of profit a year, $3.5 billion more than it did in last year&#8217;s dismal markets. Falling mortgage losses should take care of much of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders, however, aren&#8217;t ready to trust projections, preferring to wait till they can verify progress. Perhaps the Fed&#8217;s stress test results will do the trick. That&#8217;ll be bittersweet for Dimon, though. If it makes investors bullish, buying back stock will be considerably more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The drag of the European debt crisis on investment banking weighed on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's fourth-quarter profit, sending financial stocks tumbling even as the bank provided evidence that the domestic economy is strengthening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the New York-based bank was seeing signs of improvement in credit quality as well as loan demand from corporations and consumers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see a mild recovery which actually might be strengthening, and it's broad," Dimon said in a conference call with reporters following the earnings report on Friday. "Hopefully, it will add to more jobs. We have seen jobs growing ... it's not enough but it could be self-sustaining."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loan balances in JPMorgan's commercial division were up 13 percent at the end of December compared with a year earlier, the sixth consecutive quarterly rise in the measure of business borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dimon sounded renewed alarm on the European debt crisis. "I would put myself in the 'increasing worried' category," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His comments came shortly before a senior euro zone government source said credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's was set to downgrade several euro zone countries, not including Germany. The report sent the euro and U.S. markets lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares fell 2.9 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while the KBW banks index was down 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the first major U.S. bank to announce results for the fourth quarter. Its weak investment banking results suggest Wall Street firms Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley will also report tough quarters when they issue results next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others such as Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, which also report results in the coming days, could benefit from the stronger business loan demand that JPMorgan experienced, but could also face problems in investment banking and housing loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, in a conference call with stock analysts, predicted that other banks will also report what he called "good loan growth in commercial banking." Shares of U.S. regional banks seemed to reflect Dimon's view as they traded better during the day, with PNC Financial Services sliding 0.8 percent and US Bancorp rising 0.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dimon also conceded that at least some of JPMorgan's new loans came from taking business from competitors. European banks have been retreating from lending in the U.S. and JPMorgan has been deploying new loan marketers in California and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a discouraging sign for upcoming results from private equity firms such as Blackstone Group LP, JPMorgan's competing unit showed an $89 million loss in the quarter because of a decline in investment values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's results "show that there are major headwinds against the banking industry and it requires a strong management team to battle the headwinds," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm Libertyview Capital Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bigger negatives tend to be the housing and mortgage situation and investors questioning, 'Have we really hit bottom in this sector or is this just a black hole?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon dealings, Goldman Sachs shares were down 2.5 percent, Morgan Stanley was off 2.9 percent, Bank of America fell 2.8 percent, and Citigroup dropped 3.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all knew the fourth quarter would be difficult," said Gary Townsend of Hill-Townsend Capital. "But the overall economic outlook has been improving from an economic standpoint starting in December."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROUGH TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said fourth-quarter net income was $3.72 billion, or 90 cents a share, down from $4.83 billion, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected 90 cents a share, according to surveys by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been some expectation the bank would do better, but that view faded after Dimon warned on December 7 that investment banking was not improving. "He did a great job guiding people down, but people thought he would beat" the estimate, said Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue declined 17 percent to $22.2 billion on an adjusted basis, missing the average Wall Street estimate of about $23 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking revenue fell 30 percent to $4.36 billion, hurt by a 39 percent drop in underwriting and advisory fees, a 13 percent decline in fixed income, and a 31 percent fall in equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were complicated by an accounting adjustment that reduced earnings by 9 cents per share to reflect a change in the market value of JPMorgan debt during the quarter. In the third quarter, the accounting adjustment added 29 cents per share to profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also booked more than half a billion dollars in additional expenses for litigation, primarily for mortgage matters, an amount that totaled 8 cents a share. It said reducing its loan loss reserves added 11 cents per share to earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The earnings show how well JPMorgan can be managed in one of the roughest times," said money manager Michael Holland, founder of Holland &amp; Co. "They were able to pull off a meet-or-beat quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's return on equity, a key measure of shareholder profits, fell to 8 percent from 11 percent a year earlier and 9 percent in the 2011 third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's quarter-end share count declined 4 percent from a year earlier as it bought back stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in three quarters, JPMorgan booked more income and revenue from its credit card and card loan businesses than from any other area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income from the consumer credit areas was $1.1 billion, or 28.2 percent of total profit. Investment banking profit, by far the largest generator of profits in the first three quarters of 2011, fell 52 percent to $726 million, or 19.5 percent of total quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jed Horowitz and Angela Moon in New York, Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Ben Berkowitz in Boston; editing by Alwyn Scott, John Wallace and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - The last time Disney raided its animation library and converted an old movie into 3D, it stunned the industry: the 17-year-old "The Lion King" opened to a startling $30 million in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the studio is hoping to pull off a similar feat. On Friday, Disney breaks out a $10 million 3D-conversion of its 20-year-old "Beauty and the Beast," with high hopes that it will be a box office beast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio has a lot at stake. It wants to re-release "Monsters, Inc.," "Finding Nemo" and "The Little Mermaid" in 3D, and the performance of "Beauty and the Beast" could help gauge the wisdom of that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studios are watching, too. Fox and Paramount are re-releasing a 3D version of James Cameron's "Titanic" on April 6 and Fox is releasing a 3D version of "Star Wars: Episode One - The Phantom Menace" on February 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such re-releases "are new opportunities - found money, if you will," Dave Hollis, Disney's head of distribution, told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with Universal's "Contraband" on track to be the No. 1 picture at the box office this weekend, Disney is tamping down expectations for its G-rated movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio will be happy with $15 million over the four-day Martin Luther King holiday weekend. Tracking has it taking just short of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also opening this weekend is Alcon's "Joyful Noise," which is expected to perform well behind both "Contraband" and "Beauty and the Beast."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among specialty films, Tribeca opens the horror picture "Don't Go In The Woods" and IFC debuts its drama "Albatross."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among holdovers, "Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol" will show, in its fifth week in release, what kind of legs it has. And last weekend's surprise box office king, "The Devil Inside," will show what kind of legs it doesn't have: Paramount's low-budget horror film is expected to see its numbers drop significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most eyes this weekend are expected to be on "Contraband." Mark Wahlberg's first film since "The Fighter" looks to be the movie to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal's R-rated action picture is on track to gross somewhere in the mid-to-high teens in its debut weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikki Rocco, the studio's president of distribution, told TheWrap she hopes that the box office was re-energized by the surprise success of last week's "The Devil Inside," and will see solid numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have high hopes that this will be a good weekend based on last weekend," she said. "And I think that Mark Wahlberg as an action-thriller actor works for audiences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie, which cost about $25 million to make, is about a former smuggler who returns to crime in order to protect his brother-in-law, who has botched a drug deal for a ruthless boss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Baltasar Kormakur made the movie, which has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 59 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience tracking firm NRG Research says the movie has a high level of awareness: 79 percent of men younger than 25 and 82 percent of those older than 25 are aware of the movie - and 46 percent of younger men and 45 percent of the older ones report a "definite" interest in seeing it. The numbers are smaller among women: 53 percent of younger women and 73 percent of older ones are aware of the film, and 28 percent of younger ones and 38 percent of older ones say they are definitely interested in seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Contraband" opens in 2,862 North American locations. "Beauty and the Beast," which is opening at 2,625 locations, has extremely strong awareness, especially among women: 93 percent of women younger than 25 and 89 percent of those older than 25 are familiar with the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, according to NRG, they want to see it: 43 percent of younger women and 30 percent of older ones report "definite" interest in watching "Beauty." The number of men reporting definite interest in seeing the movie is substantially lower: 13 percent of younger men and 14 percent of older ones say they definitely want to see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's hope is that the movie will capture two audiences - families in the daytime and adults on dates at night. The movie's spectacular 91 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating gives Disney hope that the movie can draw adults as well as kiddies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tracking has the movie taking in $12 million over three days and $14.5 over four, it is notoriously hard to accurately predict numbers in the family movie genre, where success often hinges on the "nag factor" of young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other factor working in "Beauty's" favor is the holiday weekend: 15 percent of schools are closed on Friday and 91 percent are closed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is part of the reason we picked the weekend," Hollis said. "Extra time of not having school for the families." That could also drive audiences to "Joyful Noise," which Warner Bros. is releasing for Alcon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to NRG, though, the PG-rated faith-based musical starring Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah has better awareness levels than "Contraband" - but lower numbers of people who report "definite" interest in seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 40 percent of those polled say they definitely want to see "Contraband," only 26 percent said they have "definite" interest in seeing "Joyful Noise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Graff directed the movie about a small-town choir that wants to win a national competition. It had a budget in the low $30 million range and has a Rotten Tomatoes score is 41 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It opens at 2,735 locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With four movies opening in wide release next weekend, this could be the last weekend that DreamWorks' "War Horse" and Fox's "We Bought a Zoo" are in the top 10 at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Chris Michaud)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CLEVELAND, OH, Jan 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Despite recent talks of dropping numerous cases in Immigration Court,
Jonathan A. Bartell, a visa lawyer, hasn't noticed a decrease in his
workload yet, but awaits the changes. 

    The new immigration policy will focus on deporting those with extreme
criminal pasts while alleviating an overcrowded Immigration Court system. 

    "The best way to handle the caseload is to concentrate on the worst of
the bunch," said Bartell, a visa immigration lawyer. "Then get back to
those not causing harm at a later date."

    The immigration court attorney has some clients whose cases are scheduled
several years from now. He said the overburdened immigration courts'
dockets should be reserved for cases involving aliens with extensive
criminal backgrounds and those who pose a national security or public
safety threat.

    However, Bartell said the changes can't come fast enough for the policy
that is expected to allow certain immigration cases to be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis, depending on non-citizens' criminal histories, any
family ties with a spouse and children, and whether they're a productive
member of society before being ordered removed.

    "Department of Homeland Security has pretty much ignored the order from
above and is not dismissing many cases," said Bartell, a Cincinnati, OH
family immigration lawyer. 

    Meanwhile, he continues to help clients with a variety of services from
obtaining an investor visa with a specified monetary amount or providing
jobs to a targeted employment area, to getting a waiver of admissibility
to enter the U.S. legally despite certain disqualifications. 

    Bartell and his staff can assist clients through complicated application
processes of securing limited temporary visas to work in the U.S.,
despite a long waiting period. They represent clients nationwide for
various immigration cases and appear at U.S. embassies in foreign
countries on their behalf.

      dragen aan het instellen en ondersteunen van sportprogramma's voor de

      leidende merken van het bedrijf, waaronder Pampers&#174;, Tide&#174;, Gillette&#174; en 
      Pantene&#174;, zal degenen helpen om wie moeders het meeste geven... 
      kinderen. Daarnaast zal PG ook duizenden moeders van Olympische atleten 
      helpen de Olympische Spelen te ervaren.

      staat,&#8221; aldus Marc Pritchard, PG Global Marketing  Brand Building 
      Officer. &#8220;PG zet zich in om die moeders bij te staan. Door ons

      Olympische atleten ondersteunen, maar iedere moeder die doet wat nodig 
      is om van het leven van haar kind het beste te maken.&#8221;

      Olympische Beweging te zien,&#8221; verklaarde de President van het 
      Internationaal Olympische Comit&#233;, Jacques Rogge. &#8220;Door de ondersteuning

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Dutch bancassurer ING (ING.AS) has hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to handle the sale of its Asian operations, a source close to the matter told Reuters on Friday, as the company seeks options for the division after scrapping its original plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan (JPM.N) is also expected to get an advisory role for the auction, sources said, though they could not confirm if the bank was officially hired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance sector advisers in Asia have been waiting for several years for the ING assets to come on the block, as industry peers are expected to be tempted by the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analyst and banker estimates put the value of ING's Asian businesses at more than $6 billion, which would make it the biggest Asia insurance M deal ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of the banks comes a day after ING CEO Jan Hommen announced that the company had ditched a proposal to list its combined European and Asian insurance and investment operations, and would instead consider other options for its Asian businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, J.P Morgan and ING declined to comment. Sources were not authorized to speak to the media because details were not yet public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S., European and Japanese insurers are expected to show interest in the ING assets, sources say, as the industry sees Asia as a brighter prospect for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life insurance premiums in Asia's emerging economies are forecast to grow by 10.3 percent in 2012, compared with 3.3 percent growth in industrialized nations, according to Swiss Re estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sign of the region's redhot potential is reflected in the premiums Asian insurers are able to command. Asian life insurers typically trade at a price to embedded value of around 1.4 compared with the 0.6 of their European and U.S. peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have pretty solid market positions that would certainly be attractive to some foreign life insurers who want to grow in the region," said Sally Yim, a senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service in Hong Kong who focuses on the insurance industry in Asia Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWO PARTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ING's Asia-Pacific operations had an enterprise value, including debt, of 4.9 billion euros ($6.3 billion) at the end of June last year, an investor presentation on ING's website shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers say that nearly two-thirds of the value was derived from South Korea and Japan, raising the question of whether there will be bidders for the entire Asia business or just parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their sale pitch will be 'it's an Asian business', but in reality it's a Korean business offering slower growth," said a source who advises financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lump sale would probably mean a foreign insurer bulking up on its Asia operations; country-by-country sales could mean that some of ING's assets end up with domestic insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It all depends on pricing. They (ING) want to extract the most value out of the Asia business because that's where the growth is and that's the most attractive to potential buyers," Moody's Yim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's a lump sale, insurance companies AIA (1299.HK) and Prudential (PRU.L), which have a deep presence in Asia, are less likely to be interested because they already have a sizable share of the market. Excluding Japan, the two companies together account for about 7.3 percent of life insurance premiums, according to Credit Suisse estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gilbert Kreijger; Editing by Michael Flaherty)&lt;/p&gt;

industry peers are expected to be tempted by the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analyst and banker estimates put the value of ING's
Asian businesses at more than $6 billion, which would make it
the biggest Asia insurance M deal ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of the banks comes a day after ING CEO Jan
Hommen announced that the company had ditched a proposal to list
its combined European and Asian insurance and investment
operations, and would instead consider other options for its
Asian businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, J.P Morgan and ING declined to comment. Sources
were not authorised to speak to the media because details were
not yet public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S., European and Japanese insurers are expected to show
interest in the ING assets, sources say, as the industry sees
Asia as a brighter prospect for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life insurance premiums in Asia's emerging economies are
forecast to grow by 10.3 percent in 2012, compared with 3.3
percent growth in industrialised nations, according to Swiss Re
estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sign of the region's redhot potential is reflected in
the premiums Asian insurers are able to command. Asian life
insurers typically trade at a price to embedded value of
around 1.4 compared with the 0.6 of their European and U.S.
peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have pretty solid market positions that would
certainly be attractive to some foreign life insurers who want
to grow in the region," said Sally Yim, a senior credit officer
at Moody's Investors Service in Hong Kong who focuses on the
insurance industry in Asia Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWO PARTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ING's Asia-Pacific operations had an enterprise value,
including debt, of 4.9 billion euros ($6.3 billion) at the end
of June last year, an investor presentation on ING's website
shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers say that nearly two-thirds of the value was derived
from South Korea and Japan, raising the question of whether
there will be bidders for the entire Asia business or just
parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their sale pitch will be 'it's an Asian business', but in
reality it's a Korean business offering slower growth," said a
source who advises financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lump sale would probably mean a foreign insurer bulking up
on its Asia operations; country-by-country sales could mean that
some of ING's assets end up with domestic insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It all depends on pricing. They (ING) want to extract the
most value out of the Asia business because that's where the
growth is and that's the most attractive to potential buyers,"
Moody's Yim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's a lump sale, insurance companies AIA and
Prudential, which have a deep presence in Asia, are less
likely to be interested because they already have a sizable
share of the market. Excluding Japan, the two companies together
account for about 7.3 percent of life insurance premiums,
according to Credit Suisse estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Crediamo che dietro a ciascun atleta ci sia una mamma ancora pi&#249;

      globale e del brand building. &#8220;PG si occupa di aiutare le mamme. Con la 
      nostra iniziativa &#8216;Grazie Mamma&#8217; non offriremo sostegno solo alle mamme

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Jan 13 (Reuters) - Dutch bancassurer ING
 has hired Goldman Sachs to handle the sale of
its Asian operations, a source close to the matter told Reuters
on Friday, as the company seeks options for the division after
scrapping its original plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is also expected to get an advisory role
for the auction, sources said, though they could not confirm if
the bank was officially hired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analyst and banker estimates put the value of ING's
Asian businesses at more than $6 billion, which would make it
the biggest Asia insurance M deal ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of the banks comes a day after ING CEO Jan
Hommen announced that the company had ditched a proposal to list
its combined European and Asian insurance and investment
operations, and would instead consider other options for its
Asian businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, J.P Morgan and ING declined to comment. Sources
were not authorised to speak to the media because details were
not yet public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co reported lower fourth-quarter profit as the European debt crisis continued to weigh on trading and corporate deal-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first major U.S. bank to announce results for the period, JPMorgan said net income was $3.72 billion, or 90 cents a share, compared with $4.83 billion, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are comments from analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANTHONY POLINI, EQUITY ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan results bode well for the rest of the industry despite a decline in market-related income."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT OF INVESTMENT FIRM LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because bank stocks have run up tremendously since early this year and heading into this earnings season, some were expecting something better, but overall, the results are in line with the broad expectation. Their results show that there are major headwinds against the banking industry and it requires a strong management team to battle the headwinds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think Europe was such a big issue, especially for a bank this big. The bigger negatives tends to be the housing and mortgage situation and investors questioning, have we really hit bottom in this sector or is this just a blackhole?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GARY TOWNSEND, CEO, HILL-TOWNSEND CAPITAL, CHEVY CHASE, MARYLAND:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investment banking was weak as expected and mortgage continues to hold them back. On the other hand, commercial banking was up. They probably have benefited from the situation in Europe by taking away customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The better way to evaluate JPMorgan is looking forward. We all knew the fourth quarter would be difficult. But the overall economic outlook has been improving from an economic standpoint starting in December. Bank stocks have been improving since the beginning of October."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIKE HOLLAND, FOUNDER, HOLLAND &amp; CO LLC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the earnings show how well JPMorgan can be managed in one of the roughest times. They were lagging in revenues but they were able to manage through that. Investment banking was predictably lousy. Trading was predictably lousy. But they were able to pull off a meet-or-beat quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST AT ROCKWELL GLOBAL CAPITAL, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan results are certainly closely eyed as they set the tone for the financial sector earnings. This time, they didn't have any market surprises so investors will be focused more on other things today like the move in the euro and the result of bond auctions in Spain which the yields came down but saw somewhat of a tepid demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Angela Moon and Rick Rothacker; Compiled by Paritosh Bansal)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Procter  Gamble (NYSE:PG), ein weltweiter olympischer Partner, 
      verk&#252;ndete heute sein Engagement, mit der Kampagne &#8222;Thank You Mom&#8221; im 
      Rahmen der Olympischen Spiele 2012 in London zur Verbesserung des 
      t&#228;glichen Lebens von M&#252;ttern rund um den Globus beitragen zu wollen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mit der Kampagne sollen 5 Millionen US-Dollar zur Einrichtung und 
      F&#246;rderung von Sportprogrammen auf der ganzen Welt gesammelt werden. Mit 
      einem Teil der Ums&#228;tze und Spenden vonseiten der f&#252;hrenden Marken des 
      Unternehmens, darunter Pampers&#174;, Tide&#174;, Gillette&#174; und Pantene&#174;, soll 
      denjenigen geholfen werden, die den M&#252;ttern am meisten am Herzen 
      liegen&#8230;den Kindern. Ferner wird PG auch Tausenden von M&#252;ttern von 
      Olympiateilnehmern zu einem ganz besonderen Erlebnis der Olympischen 
      Spiele verhelfen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Wir sind der &#220;berzeugung, dass hinter jedem Athleten eine noch 
      gro&#223;artigere Mutter steht&#8221;, so Marc Pritchard, Global Marketing und 
      Brand Building Officer bei PG. &#8222;PG macht sich daf&#252;r stark, den M&#252;ttern 
      zu helfen. Mit unserem Programm &#8222;Thank You Mom&#8221; wollen wir nicht nur die 
      M&#252;tter olympischer Athleten unterst&#252;tzen &#8211; sondern jede Mutter, die 
      alles daf&#252;r tut, das Leben ihres Kindes zum Besten zu gestalten.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Ich bin hoch erfreut &#252;ber das gro&#223;e Engagement von PG f&#252;r die 
      Olympische Bewegung&#8221;, so der Pr&#228;sident des Internationalen Olympischen 
      Komitees Jacques Rogge. &#8222;Durch die Unterst&#252;tzung der M&#252;tter von 
      Olympioniken hilft PG den Athleten. Durch die F&#246;rderung des 
      Jugendsports unterst&#252;tzt das Unternehmen Familien und tr&#228;gt dazu bei, 
      Tag f&#252;r Tag Athleten zu f&#246;rdern. Das steht voll und ganz im Zeichen der 
      Olympischen Werte.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG und seine Marken werden zudem &#252;ber 150 Athleten sponsern, die mit 
      Auftritten in Werbe- und Handelskampagnen f&#252;r Ums&#228;tze und Spenden zur 
      F&#246;rderung des Jugendsports sorgen. Zu den von PG und seinen Marken

			Procter  Gamble Launches Global &#8216;Thank You Mom&#8217; Campaignfor 
      London 2012 Olympic GamesPlanning to Raise $5 Million for 
      Youth Sportsand Support More Than 150 Athletes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Procter  Gamble (NYSE:PG), a Worldwide Olympic Partner, today committed 
      to helping improve everyday life for moms around the world through its 
      &#8216;Thank You Mom&#8217; campaign for the London 2012 Olympic Games.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company plans to raise $5 million to help establish and sustain 
      youth sports programs around the world. A portion of sales and donations 
      from the company&#8217;s leadership brands, including Pampers&#174;, Tide&#174;, 
      Gillette&#174; and Pantene&#174;, will help those who moms care about the 
      most&#8230;children. Additionally, PG will also help thousands of moms of 
      Olympians experience The Olympics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe that behind every athlete is an even more amazing mom,&#8221; said 
      Marc Pritchard, PG Global Marketing and Brand Building Officer. &#8220;PG is 
      in the business of helping moms. Through our &#8216;Thank You Mom&#8217; program we 
      will support not just the moms of Olympic athletes &#8211; but every mom who 
      does whatever it takes to make her child&#8217;s life the best it can be.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am delighted to see the strength of PG&#8217;s commitment to the Olympic 
      Movement,&#8221; said President of the International Olympic Committee, 
      Jacques Rogge. &#8220;Through its support of mothers of Olympians, PG is 
      helping athletes. With its support of youth sports, the company is 
      supporting families and is helping to develop athletes every day. It 
      aligns perfectly with the Olympic values.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG and its brands will also sponsor more than 150 athletes, who will be 
      featured in advertising and retail campaigns to generate sales and 
      donations that will help support youth sports. Among the world class 
      athletes sponsored by PG and its brands are:

      &#8220;Sport had a life-changing role in my childhood development,&#8221; said 
      16-time Olympic medalist and Head  Shoulders athlete Michael Phelps, 
      who began swimming at age seven. &#8220;As a child, I was diagnosed with 
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and I used sport as an outlet 
      for all my energy. Having that outlet positively affected my life 
      outside the pool, too.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We hope to create a movement to thank moms everywhere, making a 
      difference to youth sports around the globe,&#8221; added Marc Pritchard.

      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan&#160;Chase  
      Co. (NYSE: JPM), commented: &#8220;Every day, we put the Firm&#8217;s resources to 
      work to help our customers, corporate clients and the communities where 
      we do business. During 2011, the Firm provided credit2 
      and raised capital of over $1.8 trillion for our commercial and consumer 
      clients, up 18% from the prior year. We provided more than $17 billion 
      of credit2 to U.S. small businesses, up 52% over prior 
      year. We raised capital or provided credit2 of 
      $68&#160;billion for more than 1,200 not-for-profit and government entities, 
      including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. We also 
      provided new credit cards to 8.5 million people and originated more than 
      765,000 mortgages. In order to help struggling homeowners, the Firm has 
      offered more than 1.2&#160;million mortgage modifications since 2009, of 
      which 452,000 were completed.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $3.7 billion for the fourth 
      quarter of 2011, compared with $4.8&#160;billion for the fourth quarter of 
      2010. Earnings per share were $0.90 for the fourth quarter of 2011, 
      compared with $1.12 for the fourth quarter of 2010. Full-year 2011 net 
      income was a record $19.0 billion, compared with $17.4&#160;billion for the 
      prior year. Earnings per share were $4.48 for 2011, compared with $3.96 
      for 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on financial results, Dimon said: &#8220;The Firm&#8217;s returns on 
      tangible common equity1 for the fourth quarter of 2011 and 
      the full year 2011 were 11% and 15%, respectively. We believe these 
      returns were reasonable given the environment, although the return for 
      the fourth quarter was modestly disappointing. Several significant items 
      affected the Firm&#8217;s fourth-quarter results, including a $567 million 
      pretax DVA loss which reflected the tightening of the Firm&#8217;s credit 
      spreads. As we have consistently said, whether positive or negative, we 
      do not consider DVA reflective of the underlying operations of the 
      company.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We were pleased that the Investment Bank continued to rank #1 in Global 
      Investment Banking Fees for 2011. Consumer  Business Banking opened 260 
      new branches and increased deposits by 8% in 2011. In our Card business, 
      credit card sales volume2 was up 10% for 2011. Treasury  
      Securities Services reported record deposits2, up 28% for 
      2011. Commercial Banking reported record deposit2 balances, 
      up 26%, and record net income for 2011.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon added: &#8220;As the economy continues to recover, we are gratified to 
      see signs of improvement in loan demand and credit quality. Commercial 
      Banking had its sixth consecutive quarter of loan growth, including a 
      17% increase in middle-market loans over the prior year. In Treasury  
      Securities Services, trade loans were up 73% over the prior year. 
      Business Banking loans were up 5% over the prior year reflecting a 24% 
      increase in origination volume during 2011. Mortgage originations 
      through the Firm&#8217;s retail channel were strong. Finally, the Card 
      business had continued loan growth in the fourth quarter as the Chase 
      credit card portfolio1 ended the year with outstandings of 
      $120.0&#160;billion.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Firmwide, net charge-offs were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 
      43% compared with the prior year, and nonperforming assets declined by 
      33%. Mortgage net charge-offs and delinquencies modestly improved, but 
      both remained at elevated levels. With respect to our credit card 
      portfolio, the net charge-off rate1 improved to 3.93%, down 
      from 4.34% in the prior quarter and 7.08% in the prior year. Wholesale 
      credit performance remained stable.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the balance sheet, Dimon said &#8220;We maintained our fortress 
      balance sheet, ending the year with a strong Basel I Tier 1 Common1 
      ratio of 10.0%. Our capital position allowed us to repurchase $9 billion 
      of common stock2 during 2011, including $950&#160;million during 
      the fourth quarter. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 Common1 
      ratio was approximately 7.9% at the end of the fourth quarter. Our total 
      firmwide credit reserves were $28.3&#160;billion, resulting in a firmwide 
      coverage ratio of 3.35% of total loans1. The Firm&#8217;s total 
      deposits increased to $1.1&#160;trillion, up 21% compared with the prior 
      year.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon concluded: &#8220;I am proud of the work our 260,000 employees have done 
      this past year to continue the Firm's 200-year tradition of showing 
      leadership and responsibility during challenging times. JPMorgan Chase 
      has a positive impact on the lives of millions of people and the 
      communities in which they live. All of the Firm&#8217;s accomplishments and 
      our success in the future rest on a foundation of capital strength and 
      careful stewardship of the Firm through this challenging economy and a 
      new, complex regulatory environment. We are working hard to help our 
      clients thrive, economies grow and communities prosper.&#8221;

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $726&#160;million, down 52% from the prior year. These results 
      reflected lower net revenue and an increased provision for credit 
      losses, predominantly offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue 
      included a $567 million loss from debit valuation adjustments (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on 
      certain structured and derivative liabilities resulting from the 
      tightening of the Firm&#8217;s credit spreads. Excluding the impact of DVA, 
      net revenue was $4.9 billion and net income was $1.1 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $4.4&#160;billion, compared with $6.2&#160;billion in the prior 
      year. Investment banking fees were down 39% to $1.1 billion, consisting 
      of debt underwriting fees of $553&#160;million (down 40%), equity 
      underwriting fees of $169&#160;million (down 65%), and advisory fees of $397 
      million (down 6%). Fixed Income Markets revenue was $2.5 billion, down 
      13% (down 9% excluding the impact of DVA) from the prior year, with 
      solid client revenue. Equity Markets revenue was $779 million, down 31% 
      (down 26% excluding the impact of DVA) from the prior year, primarily 
      reflecting lower market volumes. For the current quarter, DVA losses 
      were $135 million in Fixed Income Markets and $27 million in Equity 
      Markets. Credit Portfolio recorded a loss of $31 million due to DVA 
      losses of $405 million, offset by net interest income and fees on 
      retained loans, as well as net CVA gains.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $272 million, driven by net 
      charge-offs of $199 million and an increase in the allowance for loan 
      losses due to portfolio activity, compared with net recoveries of $23 
      million and a reduction of the allowance in the prior year. The ratio of 
      the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 2.11%, 
      compared with 3.51% in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $3.0 billion, down 29% from the prior year, 
      driven by both lower compensation and noncompensation expense.

      Net income was $533 million, compared with $459&#160;million in the prior 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $6.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 17%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $4.0 billion, down 
      by $298 million, or 7%, reflecting lower loan balances due to portfolio 
      runoff and narrower loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was $2.4&#160;billion, 
      down by $1.0&#160;billion, or 29%, driven by lower mortgage fees and related 
      income and lower debit card income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $779&#160;million, a decrease of 
      $1.6&#160;billion from the prior year and a decrease of $248 million from the 
      prior quarter, and included a $230 million net reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses.&#160;The net change in the allowance reflects a 
      reduction of $1.0 billion in the allowance related to the 
      non-credit-impaired portfolio, as estimated losses in that portfolio 
      declined, predominantly offset by an increase of $770 million reflecting 
      additional impairment of the Washington Mutual purchased credit-impaired 
      portfolio due to higher-than-expected default frequency relative to 
      modeled lifetime loss estimates. The prior-year provision reflected a 
      higher impairment on the purchased credit-impaired portfolio and higher 
      net charge-offs. The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans 
      retained, excluding purchased credit-impaired loans, was 5.71%, compared 
      with 5.86% in the prior year and 6.26% in the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $4.7&#160;billion, an increase of $251&#160;million, or 
      6%, from the prior year, driven by investments in sales force, new 
      branch builds and higher mortgage production costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Consumer  Business Banking reported net income of $802

		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $4.3 billion, down 2% from the prior year. Net interest 
      income was $2.7 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year, 
      as the impact of lower deposit spreads was offset by the effect of 
      higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $1.6 billion, a 
      decrease of 7%, driven by lower debit card revenue reflecting the impact 
      of the Durbin Amendment, partially offset by increased deposit-related 
      fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $132 million, compared with $69 
      million in the prior year. The prior year reflected a $100 million 
      reduction to the allowance for loan losses. Net charge-offs were $132 
      million (3.02% net charge-off rate), compared with $169 million (4.04% 
      net charge-off rate) in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, up 6% from the prior year, due to

      Mortgage production pretax income was $161 million, a decrease of $392

      excluding repurchase losses, was $1.1&#160;billion, a decrease of $269 
      million, or 20%, from the prior year, reflecting narrower margins and 
      lower volumes. Production expense was $518 million, an increase of $82 
      million, or 19%, reflecting a shift to higher-cost originations within 
      the retail channel as well as enhanced underwriting processes. 
      Repurchase losses were $390 million, compared with repurchase losses of 
      $349 million in the prior year. The higher losses were primarily driven 
      by an acceleration of Agency demands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mortgage servicing resulted in a pretax loss of $586 million, compared 
      with pretax income of $14&#160;million in the prior year, largely due to 
      mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSR&#8221;) risk management loss. 
      Servicing-related revenue was $1.1 billion, a decline of 9% from the 
      prior year, as a result of the decline in third-party loans serviced. 
      MSR asset amortization was $406 million, compared with $555&#160;million in 
      the prior year; this reflected reduced amortization as a result of a 
      lower MSR asset value. Servicing expense was $925 million, a decrease of 
      $33 million, or 3% from the prior year. The prior-year servicing expense 
      included $374 million related to foreclosure-related matters. MSR risk 
      management was a loss of $377 million, down $667 million compared with 
      the prior year. The current-quarter MSR risk management loss included an 
      $832&#160;million decrease in the fair value of the MSR asset, partially 
      offset by $460 million of net gains on the associated derivative hedges.

			Real Estate Portfolios reported a net loss of $11 million,

      improvement was driven by a lower provision for credit losses, partially 
      offset by lower net revenue.

      Net revenue was $1.1&#160;billion, down by $269&#160;million, or 20%, from the 
      prior year. The decrease was driven by a decline in net interest income 
      as a result of lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $646 million, compared with $2.3 
      billion in the prior year, and included a net reduction of the allowance 
      for loan losses of $230 million. The net change in the allowance 
      reflected a reduction of $1.0 billion in the allowance related to the 
      non-credit-impaired portfolio as estimated losses declined, 
      predominantly offset by an increase of $770 million reflecting 
      additional impairment of the Washington Mutual purchased credit-impaired 
      portfolio due to higher-than-expected default frequency relative to 
      modeled lifetime loss estimates. The prior-year provision reflected a 
      higher impairment of the purchased credit-impaired portfolio and higher 
      net charge-offs. Home equity net charge-offs were $579&#160;million (2.90% 
      net charge-off rate1), compared with $792&#160;million (3.48% net 
      charge-off rate1) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net 
      charge-offs were $143&#160;million (5.74% net charge-off rate1), 
      compared with $429&#160;million (14.42% net charge-off rate1). 
      Prime mortgage, including option ARMs, net charge-offs were $151&#160;million

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $497 million, or 32%, 
      compared with the prior year. The decrease was driven by a $1.7 billion 
      lower reduction in the allowance compared with the prior year, 
      predominantly offset by lower net charge-offs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $4.8 billion, a decrease of $258 million, or 5%, from 
      the prior year. Net interest income was $3.5&#160;billion, down $438 million, 
      or 11%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by narrower loan 
      spreads and lower average loan balances, partially offset by lower 
      revenue reversals associated with lower net charge-offs. Noninterest 
      revenue was $1.3 billion, an increase of $180&#160;million, or 16%, from the 
      prior year. The increase was driven by lower partner revenue-sharing 
      reflecting the impact of the Kohl&#8217;s portfolio sale, higher net 
      interchange income, and the transfer of the Commercial Card business to 
      Card from Treasury  Securities Services in the first quarter of 2011; 
      these factors were partially offset by lower revenue from fee-based 
      products. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, 
      noninterest revenue increased 10%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $1.1&#160;billion, compared with 
      $709&#160;million in the prior year and $1.3&#160;billion in the prior quarter. 
      The current-quarter provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a 
      reduction of $500 million to the allowance for loan losses due to lower 
      estimated losses. The prior-year provision included a reduction of $2.2 
      billion to the allowance for loan losses. The net charge-off rate was 
      3.27%, down from 5.73% in the prior year and 3.47% in the prior quarter; 
      the 30+ day delinquency rate was 2.32%, down from 3.23% in the prior 
      year and 2.36% in the prior quarter. Excluding the Washington&#160;Mutual and 
      Commercial Card portfolios, the Credit Card net charge-off rate1 
      was 3.93%, down from 7.08% in the prior year and 4.34% in the prior 
      quarter; and the 30+ day delinquency rate1 was 2.54%, down 
      from 3.66% in the prior year and 2.64% in the prior quarter. The Auto 
      net charge-off rate was 0.37%, down from 0.58% in the prior year and up 
      from 0.36% in the prior quarter. The Student net charge-off rate was 
      3.69%, up from 3.22% in the prior year and 2.66% in the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $2.0&#160;billion, an increase of $158&#160;million, or 
      8%, from the prior year, due to higher marketing expense and the 
      inclusion of the Commercial Card business. Excluding the impact of the 
      Commercial Card business, noninterest expense increased 4%.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $643&#160;million, an increase of $113&#160;million, or 21%, from 
      the prior year. The improvement was driven by a decrease in the 
      provision for credit losses and higher net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Record net revenue of $1.7&#160;billion increased $76 million, or 5%, from 
      the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1&#160;billion, up by 
      $112&#160;million, or 11%, driven by growth in liability and loan balances, 
      partially offset by spread compression on liability products. 
      Noninterest revenue was $571&#160;million, down by $36 million, or 6%, 
      compared with the prior year. The prior year reflected higher gains on 
      sales of loans and other real estate owned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $810 million, an increase of $29 
      million, or 4%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term 
      Lending was $299&#160;million, a decrease of $2 million, or 1%, compared with 
      the prior year. Revenue from Corporate Client Banking was $326&#160;million, 
      an increase of $24 million, or 8%, from the prior year. Revenue from 
      Real Estate Banking was $115&#160;million, a decrease of $2&#160;million, or 2%, 
      from the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $40&#160;million, compared with 
      $152&#160;million in the prior year. Net charge-offs were $99&#160;million (0.36% 
      net charge-off rate), compared with net charge-offs of $286&#160;million 
      (1.16% net charge-off rate) in the prior year and $17&#160;million (0.06% net 
      charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. The allowance for loan losses to 
      end-of-period loans retained was 2.34%, down from 2.61% in the prior 
      year and 2.50% in the prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans were $1.1&#160;billion, 
      down by $947&#160;million, or 47%, from the prior year, largely as a result 
      of commercial real estate repayments and loan sales; and were down $390 
      million, or 27%, from the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $579&#160;million, an increase of $21&#160;million, or 4%, 
      from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher regulatory deposit 
      assessments and headcount-related2 expense.

      Net income was $250 million, a decrease of $7 million, or 3%, from the 
      prior year. Compared with the prior quarter, net income decreased by $55 
      million, or 18%, primarily driven by higher Global Corporate Bank 
      (&#8220;GCB&#8221;) credit allocation expense and provision for credit losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $2.0 billion, an increase of $109 million, or 6%, from 
      the prior year. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, 
      net revenue was up 9%. Treasury Services (&#8220;TS&#8221;) net revenue was $1.1 
      billion, an increase of $98 million, or 10%. The increase was driven by 
      higher deposit balances and higher trade loan volumes, partially offset 
      by the transfer of the Commercial Card business to Card in the first 
      quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, 
      TS net revenue increased 17%. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue 
      was $971&#160;million, an increase of 1% compared with the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TSS generated firmwide net revenue2 of $2.7 billion, 
      including $1.7 billion by TS; of that amount, $1.1 billion was recorded 
      in TS, $600 million in Commercial Banking, and $69 million in other 
      lines of business. The remaining $971 million of firmwide net revenue 
      was recorded in Worldwide Securities Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $19 million, reflecting growth in 
      trade loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $1.6 billion, an increase of $93 million, or 6%, 
      from the prior year. The increase was mainly driven by expenses related 
      to exiting unprofitable business, partially offset by the transfer of 
      the Commercial Card business to Card. Excluding the Commercial Card 
      business, TSS noninterest expense increased by 11%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results for the quarter included a $60 million credit allocation 
      expense, primarily driven by net charge-offs related to the traditional 
      credit portfolio for GCB clients that are managed jointly by IB and TSS.

      Net income was $302&#160;million, a decrease of $205 million, or 40%, from

      Net revenue was $2.3&#160;billion, a decrease of $329&#160;million, or 13%, from 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1.8&#160;billion, down by 
      $394&#160;million, or 18%, due to lower performance fees, lower loan-related 
      revenue, the effect of lower market levels and lower valuations of seed 
      capital investments. Net interest income was $446&#160;million, up by 
      $65&#160;million, or 17%, due to higher deposit and loan balances, partially 
      offset by narrower deposit spreads.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Revenue from Private Banking was $1.2 billion, down 12% from the prior

      were due to net inflows to long-term and liquidity products, partially 
      offset by the impact of lower market levels. Custody, brokerage, 
      administration and deposit balances were $585&#160;billion, up by 
      $43&#160;billion, or 8%, due to deposit and custody inflows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The provision for credit losses was $24&#160;million, compared with $23 
      million in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $25 million, or 1%, 
      largely resulting from lower performance-based compensation, 
      predominantly offset by higher headcount-related2 expense.

      Private Equity reported a net loss of $89 million, compared with net 
      income of $178&#160;million in the prior year. Net revenue was negative $113 
      million, driven by write-downs on private investments. Net revenue 
      declined by $468 million compared with the prior year due to the absence 
      of prior-year gains on sales. Noninterest expense was $28&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $49&#160;million from the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corporate reported net income of $312 million, compared with a net loss 
      of $149 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $811&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $465 million, reflecting lower securities gains, partially 
      offset by higher net interest income, reflecting higher securities 
      balances and active deployment of the Firm's excess cash position. 
      Securities gains were $54 million in the current quarter, compared with 
      $1.2 billion in the prior year. Noninterest expense of $902 million was 
      down from $1.6 billion in the prior year, primarily reflecting lower 
      litigation expense. The current quarter included $528 million of 
      additional litigation reserves, predominantly for mortgage-related 
      matters, compared with $1.5 billion of litigation reserves in the prior 
      year.

      (*) Presented on a managed basis. See notes on page 14 for further

      quarter of 2011, third quarter of 2011, and fourth quarter of 2010,

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $3.7 billion, down by $1.1 billion, or 23%, from the 
      prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by lower net revenue, 
      largely offset by lower noninterest expense and a lower provision for 
      credit losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $22.2 billion, down by $4.5 billion, or 17%, compared 
      with the prior year. Net revenue included a $567 million loss from DVA 
      on certain structured and derivative liabilities resulting from the 
      tightening of the Firm&#8217;s credit spreads. Noninterest revenue was $9.9 
      billion, down by $4.6 billion, or 32%, from the prior year. The decrease 
      was driven by lower securities gains, lower principal transactions 
      revenue, lower mortgage fees and related income and lower investment 
      banking fees, partially offset by higher lending and deposit-related 
      fees. Net interest income was $12.3 billion, flat to the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $2.2 billion, down by $859&#160;million, 
      or 28%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit 
      losses was $1.8 billion, compared with $3.1 billion in the prior year. 
      The decrease in the provision reflected improved delinquency trends 
      across most consumer portfolios compared with the prior year, partially 
      offset by the impact of a larger net reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses in the prior year. Consumer net charge-offs1 were $2.6 
      billion, compared with $4.8&#160;billion in the prior year, resulting in net 
      charge-off rates of 2.74% and 4.89%, respectively. The wholesale 
      provision for credit losses was $353 million, an increase of 
      $439&#160;million when compared with a benefit of $86 million in the prior 
      year, primarily related to loan growth. Wholesale net charge-offs were 
      $346 million, compared with $271 million in the prior year, resulting in 
      net charge-off rates of 0.52% and 0.49%, respectively. The Firm&#8217;s 
      allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained1 
      was 3.35%, compared with 4.46% in the prior year. The Firm&#8217;s 
      nonperforming assets totaled $11.0 billion at December 31, 2011, down 
      from the prior-year level of $16.6 billion and from the prior-quarter 
      level of $12.2 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $14.5 billion, down 9% from the prior year, 
      driven by lower noncompensation expense.

          In addition to analyzing the Firm&#8217;s results on a reported basis, 
          management reviews the Firm&#8217;s results and the results of the lines 
          of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP financial 
          measure. The Firm&#8217;s definition of managed basis starts with the 
          reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to 
          present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business 
          segments) on a fully tax equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. Accordingly, 
          revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax 
          credits are presented in the managed results on a basis comparable 
          to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial 
          measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue 
          arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding 
          income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within 
          income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income 
          as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.

          The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans 
          excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans 
          held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans; and the 
          allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real 
          Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI 
          loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the purchased 
          credit-impaired portfolio totaled $5.7 billion, $4.9 billion and 
          $4.9 billion at December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011, and December 
          31, 2010, respectively.

          The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common divided by 
          risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common is defined as Tier 1 capital 
          less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, 
          such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in 
          subsidiaries and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 
          common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, 
          investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and 
          composition of the Firm&#8217;s capital with the capital of other 
          financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common along with 
          other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. 
          On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued the final version 
          of the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; 
          The Firm&#8217;s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is a 
          non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firm&#8217;s current 
          understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such 
          rules to its businesses as currently conducted. The Firm&#8217;s estimates 
          of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the 
          Firm&#8217;s businesses change, and as a result of further rule-making on 
          Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. 
          Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the 
          Firm&#8217;s capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under 
          Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, investors and 
          analysts to compare the Firm&#8217;s capital under the Basel III capital 
          standards with similar estimates provided by other financial 
          services companies.

          Treasury  Securities Services firmwide metrics include certain TSS 
          product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of 
          business related to customers who are also customers of those other 
          lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS 
          products and revenue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as 
          liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing 
          financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary, in 
          management&#8217;s view, in order to understand the aggregate TSS business.

          Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by

          all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another 
          basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM

&lt;p&gt;* U.S. stock index futures pointed to a mixed open on Wall
Street on Friday, with futures for the S 500 down 0.05
percent, Dow Jones futures down 0.1 percent and Nasdaq
100 futures up 0.16 percent at 1039 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* European shares were up 0.5 percent on Friday morning,
extending the week's gains, led by euro zone banking stocks in
the wake of successful bond sales by Spain and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Italy's three-year debt costs fell below 5 percent at its
first bond auction of the year on Friday spurring hopes the
troubled borrower would be able to make it through a refinancing
hump in the first months of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Investors were relieved on Thursday after Spain's solid
debt auction at sharply lower borrowing cost, helped by
ultra-cheap funding from the European Central Bank which
provided banks with nearly half a trillion euros of three-year
money late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Banking stocks will be in the spotlight on Friday ahead of
results from JPMorgan Chase, the first Wall Street firm
to post fourth-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* On the macro front, international trade figures will be
released at 1330 GMT, while the preliminary reading for the
Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index will be
released at 1445 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank
by assets, has informed U.S. regulators that it is willing to
draw back from some parts of the country if its financial
problems worsen, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday,
citing people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* US Airways Group, Delta Airlines and
private equity firm TPG Capital are among several
parties interested in potential bids for AMR Corp,
the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, people familiar with
the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Target Corp will soon have exclusive shops selling
everything from candy to clothing as the discount chain tries to
stand out among the growing ranks of retailers offering trendy,
often low-priced merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Novartis AG is cutting nearly 2,000 jobs in the
United States ahead of the patent loss of top-selling blood
pressure drug Diovan as it braces for tough market conditions
and a slump in sales of another key drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Enraged Chinese shoppers pelted Apple Inc's 
flagship Beijing store with eggs and shoving matches with police
broke out when customers were told the store would not begin
sales of the popular iPhone 4S as scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Goldman Sachs and Cerberus have exited
German property company GSW Immobilien AG by placing a
20 percent stake late on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* U.S. fast food chain McDonald's has extended its
sponsorship of the Olympics for a further eight years, making it
the official restaurant at Olympics venues until the 2020 Summer
Games. McDonald's is one of 11 top sponsors who contribute an
estimated $100 million each for every two-Games package of one
winter and one summer Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The S 500 closed at a five-month high for the third day
on Thursday but had difficulty extending gains in the face of
lackluster economic data and another European bond market test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.57
points, or 0.17 percent, to 12,471.02. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index added 3.02 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,295.50.
The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 13.94 points, or 0.51
percent, to 2,724.70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* FTSE up 0.5 percent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Banks gain on Europe debt hopes, RBS gets upgrades&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* BG rises as JPMorgan lifts target&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Brett&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 13 (Reuters) - Banks led Britain's top
share index higher early on Friday, as concerns surrounding the
euro zone debt crisis were seen easing ahead of an Italian debt
auction, although the FTSE 100 was rangebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's benchmark index was up 26.98 points, or 0.5
percent at 5,689.40 by 0902 GMT, having closed marginally lower
on Thursday, as investors were spooked by downbeat data out of
the U.S., which had been a beacon of recovery in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks were the main drivers on the index on
Friday, as the cost of debt in Europe's distressed nations was
driven down, fuelled by cheap funds from the European Central
Bank, raising hopes an economic disaster in the region, which
would be cataclysmic for banks' earnings, could be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased appetite for euro debt, following Spain's
successful bond auction on Thursday, is expected to drive
Italian three-year costs down at the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland, which announced dramatic
restructuring plans on Thursday, extended gains up 6.5 percent,
as Seymour Pierce double-upgraded the lender to "buy" from
"reduce".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that management has finally grasped the nettle,
and though not guaranteed to generate rewards for shareholders,
we believe there is now greater potential for gains," said Bruce
Packard, analyst at Seymour Pierce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peers Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays 
rose 2.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors were also waiting for results from JPMorgan Chase
, the first of the U.S. lenders to post fourth-quarter
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London's blue chip index, however, remained stuck in a
range, desperately fighting to breakthrough and hold above the
level of resistance seen around the 5,700 level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The FTSE 100 continues to balk at resistance in the form of
its October highs, at 5713 or so, although yesterday's 8.4-point
decline hardly constitutes a major reversal," said Bill
McNamara, technical analyst at Charles Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In fact, you might argue that the fact that the UK index is
sticking so close to this critical level implies that it is
simply getting ready for another push higher. A close above 5750
would suggest that such a move is underway," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAYIN' ALIVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FTSE 100 has rallied more than 11 percent since its late
November lows, when sentiment was crippled by the worries over
Europe's debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gains have come as economic data from the world's
largest economy, the U.S., has shown improvement and there are
signs that China might take steps to ease monetary policy and
boost flagging growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That and political uncertainty in oil-producing nations has
helped lift the oil price above $110 a barrel, helping 
boost demand in integrated oils, a sector which has
also been liked for its defensive qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BG Group led the oil firms higher on Friday as
JPMorgan lifted its target price to 1,900 pence from 1,455 pence
 and nominated it as a key name to play because of its positive
outlook for global LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Its portfolio of supply contracts is also ideally
structured to benefit from the wide Henry Hub - oil price
spread," the broker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With risk appetite back on among investors, miners
 were higher too, as Kazakhmys led the
sector gainers, up 2.3 percent with traders citing an upgrade
from Societe Generale, which follows on from recent bullish
comment on the miner from analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the telecom sector, BT Group gained 1.3, after
Nomura double upgraded BT to "buy" from "reduce".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, Tesco continued to struggle after
Thursday's first ever profit warning, down 1.6 percent as
brokers began cutting recommendations and forecaasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among them, UBS cut the British food retailer to "neutral
from "buy", while Credit Suisse downgraded the world's largest
stores group to "neutral" from "outperform".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British business supplies distributor Bunzl slipped
0.7 percent as UBS cut its rating on the firm to "neutral" from
"buy", and chip designer ARM Holding was off 0.4 percent
as investors continued to worry over its outlook given the
competition on smart phones and tablets from Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS also turned negative on FTSE 100 earnings per share
(EPS) growth forecasts, predicting -5 percent EPS growth in
2012, down from 0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also now estimates the FTSE will end 2012 at around
5,800, down from 6,100 in a previous estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings worries caused a rupture in mid-cap firm Invensys's
 share price, which fell 21 percent to a two-year low as
the British engineer said its profit will be hit by higher costs
in its rail division and in work on Chinese nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the data front, British wholesale inflation numbers for
December will be released at 0930 GMT, with PPI input figures
forecast down 0.1 percent on the month, after a 0.1 percent rise
in November, and PPI output numbers seen flat after a 0.2
percent increase in the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;

      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM), working in partnership with ATT 
      Business Solutions and EMC, along with The King Center, today announced 
      that The King Center Imaging Project's website &#8211; www.thekingcenter.org/archive 
      &#8211; will go live on Monday, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The King Center 
      Imaging Project is a digitization effort to preserve and make publicly 
      available the tens of thousands of documents from Dr. Martin Luther 
      King, Jr. and other key figures and organizations from the Civil Rights 
      Movement housed at The King Center. As of Monday, January 16, this 
      unprecedented effort will be showcased on The King Center's website, 
      which was completely redesigned by JPMorgan Chase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The King Center Imaging Project pairs JPMorgan Chase's technology 
      expertise with The King Center Archive to preserve and share Dr. King's 
      works in a new more accessible way. JPMorgan Chase, through its 
      Technology for Social Good program, committed its technology expertise 
      to digitize more than one million pieces of history related to Dr. King. 
      ATT and EMC Corporation donated advisory support as well as technology 
      solutions and services, including ATT Synaptic Storage as a ServiceSM, 
      powered by EMC Atmos&#174; cloud-enabled storage. This on-demand storage 
      service enables The King Center to store, manage and make available 
      unprecedented online global access to its digitized archive from any 
      location, anytime, using any Web-enabled device.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the past 9 months, JPMorgan Chase built a team of over 200 
      individuals to execute the Project. The team consisted of imaging and 
      archival experts, U.S. military veterans from The Veterans Curation 
      Program, students from Morehouse and Spelman Colleges (the alma maters 
      of the King Family), Kennesaw State University and Emory University, 
      Civil Rights Scholars, as well volunteers from JPMorgan Chase. Project 
      members focused on digitizing close to 200,000 documents associated with 
      Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King's most famous speeches and 
      correspondence, such as his I Have a Dream speech, Letter from 
      Birmingham Jail, and his Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech, can now be 
      viewed around the world at any given moment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Our valued relationship with JPMorgan Chase and their innovative 
      Technology for Social Good program is helping to preserve and extend my 
      father's important message to sustain the momentum of nonviolent social 
      change around the world," said Martin Luther King, III, President, The 
      King Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "It's important for JPMorgan Chase to support Dr. King's legacy because 
      of the important values he committed his life to promoting, such as 
      equality, equal opportunity, and quality education for all. People like 
      Dr. Martin Luther King are what made America what it is today. The 
      values he espoused are the values that JPMorgan Chase also tries to 
      stand for around the world," said Jamie Dimon, Chairman  CEO, JPMorgan 
      Chase  Co.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Dr. King was a tireless champion of equality and inclusiveness. We are 
      proud and honored to contribute our technologies and know-how to bring 
      his legacy to life for the digital, connected world of today and 
      tomorrow," said John T. Stankey, President  CEO, ATT Business 
      Solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "EMC is proud to be a Philanthropic Technology Provider to the Dr. 
      Martin Luther King Jr. Center's digital archiving project. By digitizing 
      Dr. King's words on human dignity, equality and non-violence, future 
      generations will have greater chances to be inspired by his courage and 
      appreciate the ways he shaped our history and society," said Joe Tucci, 
      Chairman  CEO, EMC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This innovative project includes the creation of a global educational 
      website based on a comprehensive collection of Dr. King's papers and 
      other audio-visual materials. Along with Dr. King's documents, the 
      Project also includes originals from other key figures and groups 
      involved in the Civil Rights movement. The website, for the first time, 
      makes historical materials such as Dr. King's speeches, sermons and 
      correspondence, readily available to anyone across the world with access 
      to the internet.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Jan 15 (Reuters) - Europe is the biggest
threat to the global economy, JP Morgan's chief
executive Jamie Dimon told German newspaper Die Welt in its
Sunday edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought Europe would muddle through. I still believe
that," Dimon is quoted as telling the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. executive said he now thought there was a chance of
over 60 percent that Europe could make it, and no longer a 90
percent chance, as he had previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We urgently need a solution. The longer the problem drags
on, the less likely it is we get off lightly," he told the
paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The longer the crisis drags on, the more intense the
pressure from markets will get," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon still thinks it is unlikely that the euro will break
up completely but no longer rules out a Greek exit from the
common currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be that some countries like Greece, contrary to
rational reason, opt out. This would be bad, but manageable,"
Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve the crisis Euro zone countries need to implement
credible austerity measures and the European Central Bank (ECB)
needs to pledge liquidity support for countries like Spain and
Italy indefinitely, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the ECB has pledged liquidity support for only
a limited period of time is prolonging insecurity in the
markets, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insecurity on the markets is worse than in the aftermath of
the Lehman crisis, Dimon told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the worst case scenario JP Morgan could see losses of
about $5 billion on its $16-billion Southern Europe portfolio,
Dimon said, adding the bank would not withdraw from the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the crisis forced the bank to re-evaluate all
contracts with European partners. Because all banks and insurers
are doing the same thing this could result in a "snowball"
effect, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reports that its subsidiary, Chevron 
      Nigeria Limited, is working to contain a fire that ignited early this 
      morning aboard the K.S. Endeavor, a drilling rig offshore Nigeria 
      operated by FODE Drilling Nigeria Limited. The rig was drilling a 
      natural gas exploration well, located in the Funiwa Field approximately 
      six miles (10 kilometers) offshore and in approximately 40 feet (12 
      meters) of water.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One hundred and fifty-four personnel were on the rig and an associated 
      barge. Two contractors are still unaccounted for while all others are 
      safe and undergoing medical examinations at an adjacent production 
      platform. Aggressive search and rescue activities continue for the two 
      missing personnel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Every effort is being made to find the missing workers. They are our 
      utmost priority,&#8221; said Andrew Fawthrop, managing director, Chevron&#8217;s 
      Nigeria/Mid-Africa Strategic Business Unit. &#8220;We do not know what caused 
      the incident. We are working diligently to contain the fire, which is 
      restricted to the rig. Substantial resources have been deployed 
      including well control specialists and drilling experts. We continue to 
      work in full cooperation with Nigerian authorities and are committed to 
      providing additional information as it becomes known.&#8221;

      Production from Chevron&#8217;s North Apoi platform was shut in due to its 
      proximity to the incident.

company that currently controls 22.64 percent of Shanghai
Pudong's shares, will purchase between 5 percent and 20 percent
of the new shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Pudong has a contract to build all of the roads

government has agreed to buy the roads from the company once
they are completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SugarCRM Enables Best Practices in Social Business for Clients around 
      the World with IBM Integrations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Latest Sugar Technology Integrations Include Enhanced Support for IBM 
      DB2 and IBM SmartCloud Enterprise; SugarCRM iExtensions Acquisition 
      Results in Improved Collaboration for Customers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SugarCRM, 
      the world&#8217;s fastest-growing customer relationship management (CRM) 
      company, today announced enhanced technology integrations with IBM 
      that enable organizations to leverage best practices for creating social 
      businesses. In addition, SugarCRM announced that its customers, 
      RealConnections and Virosafe are embracing the integrated technology to 
      enhance collaboration and customer relationship management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ways businesses connect with colleagues, customers and partners 
      changed significantly over the last year as more mid-to-large 
      enterprises began adopting social business applications. According to IBM&#8217;s 
      2011 Tech Trends Report, &#8220;The majority of respondents reported that 
      their organizations have embraced social business to some degree to 
      benefit from increased efficiency and collaboration.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Every competitor is just one online search away from getting to your 
      next customer, so sales teams need to be armed with the right tools that 
      help them work more effectively,&#8221; said Clint 
      Oram, CTO and co-founder of SugarCRM. &#8220;We believe IBM is a leader in 
      social business and delivers a best-in-class technology platform for 
      collaboration. By adding CRM to the mix, organizations have the ability 
      to easily access and aggregate pertinent customer data from social media 
      sites like Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook so they can make more informed 
      business decisions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Product Integrations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SugarCRM integrations with IBM expand the company&#8217;s breadth of offerings 
      for social businesses, and new enhancements include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			1) SugarCRM on IBM DB2: Sugar now supports IBM DB2 database 
      software on Linux, Unix and Windows systems. Support for DB2 provides 
      users with industry-leading performance across multiple workloads, while 
      lowering administration, storage, development, and server costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2) SugarCRM 
      on IBM SmartCloud Enterprise: In October 2011, SugarCRM 
      became the first and only CRM application to run on IBM 
      SmartCloud Enterprise. The integration is designed to provide 
      businesses across all industries greater visibility into sales, 
      marketing and support to gain and retain customers while offering a 
      scalable cloud infrastructure to grow as the business grows. SugarCRM 
      will brand this deployment option as SugarCRM 
      Private Cloud, Powered by IBM. As of today, SugarCRM Private Cloud, 
      Powered by IBM is generally available through a select group of SugarCRM 
      and IBM business partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SugarCRM Private Cloud users will benefit from the quality, reliability 
      and security gained from IBM&#8217;s years of managing and operating data 
      centers for enterprises and public institutions around the world. The 
      SugarCRM platform is simple and easy to customize, providing the needed 
      functionality for global deployments, including native language support 
      for 25 languages. The combined solutions enable IBM and SugarCRM channel 
      partners to easily create tailor-made xRM solutions for mid-market and 
      enterprise customers at an affordable price point.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Social Business Customer Momentum Through iExtensions Acquisition
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In April 2011, SugarCRM acquired 
      iExtensions CRM from iEnterprises, Inc., the award-winning CRM 
      solution built entirely for IBM collaborative technologies including IBM 
      SmartCloud for Social Business, IBM 
      Lotus Notes and Lotus 
      Domino. The acquisition further extends SugarCRM&#8217;s product portfolio 
      for IBM customers who have the goal of becoming social businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Erik Vos, founder and co-owner of RealConnections, 
      a cloud services aggregator and IT consulting company, said, &#8220;By moving 
      from Salesforce.com to SugarCRM, we have realized immediate cost 
      benefits as well as improved ease of use and ease of integrations with 
      social business applications, like IBM&#8217;s SmartCloud for Social Business. 
      As a result of the integration with IBM SmartCloud for Social Business, 
      we have improved collaboration with employees and customers and have 
      greater visibility into opportunity management. Overall data quality, 
      CRM functionality and reliability have improved significantly.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another customer, Steinar L. Eriksson, CEO, of IT security company, Virosafe, 
      said, &#8220;The SugarCRM integration with IBM SmartCloud for Social Business 
      enables us to start online meetings with customers in just a few clicks 
      and run presentations directly from the system. The implementation was 
      quick and easy. And since both solutions are in the cloud, we can sell 
      anytime, anywhere.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      See all of these integrations on display at IBM 
      Lotusphere in Orlando, Fla. from Jan. 16 - 19. The SugarCRM exhibit 
      is located at pedestal 635.

			Now Shipping, Samsung SUR40 For Microsoft Surface Dazzles Retailers 
      at National Retail Federation (NRF) Conference 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New PixelSenseTM Technology Enables SUR40 to 
      See and Respond to Touch and Objects, Creating New Possibilities for 
      Interactive Displays in a Variety of Settings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Samsung Electronics America Inc., a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics 
      Corporation and the number one worldwide brand of professional 
      commercial display LCD products, is demonstrating its digital solutions 
      leadership at a showcase event featuring the Samsung SUR40 for Microsoft 
      Surface and a variety of applications from development partners at the 
      National Retail Federation (NRF) conference, being held Jan. 16 and 17 
      at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York in Room 1A17 (on 
      Level One of the convention center).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Available now through Samsung channel and reseller partners, a CES Best 
      of Innovations 2012 award-winner, the Samsung-Microsoft collaboration 
      incorporates Microsoft Surface 2.0 software and touch technology into an 
      interactive and engaging 40-inch Full HD LCD that can be used 
      horizontally as a table, mounted vertically on a wall or embedded in 
      other fixtures and furniture.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Both retailers and consumers are adapting to ever-evolving ways of 
      interacting with information and merchandise and have expressed a desire 
      for technology that delivers information in an engaging and visually 
      dynamic way,&#8221; said Todd Bouman, vice president of product marketing for 
      Samsung Electronics America, Enterprise Business Division. &#8220;With the 
      availability of the Samsung SUR40 for Microsoft Surface, Samsung is 
      energizing the retail space and anticipates an all-new approach to 
      customer engagement.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Superior Screen, Smart Device
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Samsung SUR40 is an interactive, collaborative multi-touch device, 
      offering a thin, 4-inch profile and a large screen size. It integrates 
      Samsung&#8217;s LCD panel capability with touch technology, combining 
      Microsoft&#8217;s massive multi-touch and object recognition software to 
      maximize the performance of a brand new type of touch screen technology 
      &#8211; PixelSense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s PixelSense technology &#8211; which gives LCD panels the power to 
      see without the use of cameras &#8211; and the Microsoft Surface 2.0 software, 
      the premier touch-first experience for end users, have been combined 
      with Samsung&#8217;s display leadership to create an industry-changing 
      information display device. The new SUR40 makes it possible for people 
      to share, collaborate and explore together using a large, thin display. 
      Not only can the SUR40 recognize fingers and hands, but it can also 
      detect other objects placed on the screen supporting up to 50 points of 
      contact at one time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SUR40 features a 40-inch Full HD 1080p (1920x1080) LCD LED panel 
      combined with one of the world&#8217;s largest piece of Gorilla protection 
      glass for optimized screen durability and to protect from external shock 
      and liquid ingress. It provides highly accurate touch interaction from 
      multiple people at the same time and superior object recognition as each 
      pixel has a camera element. Its natural interaction enables users to 
      &#8216;grab&#8217; digital information with their hands and interact with content 
      through touch and gesture.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SUR40 also provides developers with the opportunity to build apps 
      that are specialized to vertical user-case scenarios as diverse as 
      hospitality, retail, public sector, professional services, healthcare 
      and finance to name a few. It offers a rich sound experience and can 
      connect to a wide range of peripherals such as bar code scanners, 
      cameras and printers through WiFi (802.11.n), Bluetooth or Ethernet 
      connections to create a seamless digital entertainment environment. 
      Surface 2.0 developers will showcase several never-before-seen solutions 
      for the new device at NRF this week, with an emphasis on innovative 
      retail experiences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Major consumer brands and other technology partners such as FUJIFILM, 
      Industrial Color, Le M&#233;tier de Beaut&#233; and Pepsico Beverages Canada have 
      near-term plans to use the Samsung SUR40 to support immersive retail 
      scenarios, professional tools and/or marketing efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Samsung SUR40 for Microsoft Surface is an intelligent, specialized 
      device, that can deliver highly-customized, engaging experiences for 
      retailers and their customers,&#8221; said Somanna Palacanda, director, 
      Microsoft Surface. &#8220;We&#8217;re eager to see the impact this innovative 
      technology will have on a variety of industries and to continue to learn 
      about and address customer needs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Availability and Pricing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shipments to customers will begin in January 2012. Estimated Street 
      Pricing for the SUR40 for Microsoft Surface for U.S. customers will 
      start at $8,400 (display only) and $9,049 (tabletop unit with matching 
      stand). Pricing for other countries and/or regions may differ.

			Amazon Web Services Adds Microsoft Windows Server Instances to Free 
      Usage Tier
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Amazon Web Services LLC (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), 
      today announced that customers can now run their Microsoft Windows 
      Server applications within the AWS Free Usage Tier &#8211; a program designed 
      to help new AWS customers get started in the cloud. Developers and 
      businesses with Windows Server applications can take advantage of 750 
      hours of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Micro Instance usage 
      per month, at no charge for a one year period. With the expansion of the 
      AWS Free Usage Tier, Windows developers now have access to the same free 
      resources on AWS as Linux developers -- providing the ability to launch 
      new applications, test existing applications in the cloud, or gain 
      hands-on experience with AWS. For more details and information on 
      getting started with Windows on AWS, visit http://aws.amazon.com/windows/.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our customers want the flexibility to choose how they build their 
      applications without being locked into a particular programming model, 
      language, or operating system. We continue to focus on increasing that 
      flexibility,&#8221; said Peter De Santis, General Manager of Amazon EC2. 
      &#8220;Through our continued work with Microsoft, Windows developers now have 
      an opportunity to see, at no cost, how they can leverage Amazon Web 
      Services&#8217; scalable and cost-effective computing environment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Organizations of all sizes are taking advantage of the breadth and 
      capabilities of running Windows Server applications on AWS. For example, 
      when redesigning Treasury.gov, which is powered by AWS, the United 
      States Department of Treasury integrated their current Microsoft 
      SharePoint 2010 workloads to improve technology efficiencies, provide 
      increased collaboration capabilities, and comply with the Federal Cloud 
      First Initiative. Knovolo, a mobile marketing firm, runs their Windows 
      Server 2008 R2 and SQL Server applications on AWS. Integrating these 
      applications with Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudFront services to develop, 
      manage and deploy their mobile marketing application has allowed them to 
      reduce costs and scale as needed by paying only for the capacity used.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The AWS Free Usage Tier addition joins a number of recent AWS service 
      extensions to support Windows customers, including Microsoft Windows 
      Server 2008 R2 on the high power Cluster Compute instances, Microsoft 
      SQL 2012 beta preview on AWS, Microsoft BizSpark Licenses on AWS, and 
      support for Microsoft Windows HPC clusters using Amazon EC2 instances.

      Launched in 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began exposing key 
      infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now 
      widely known as cloud computing. The ultimate benefit of cloud 
      computing, and AWS, is the ability to leverage a new business model and 
      turn capital infrastructure expenses into variable costs. Businesses no 
      longer need to plan and procure servers and other IT resources weeks or 
      months in advance. Using AWS, businesses can take advantage of Amazon's 
      expertise and economies of scale to access resources when their business 
      needs them, delivering results faster and at a lower cost. Today, Amazon 
      Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost 
      infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands 
      of enterprise, government and startup customers businesses in 190 
      countries around the world. AWS offers over 21 different services, 
      including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple 
      Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Relational Database Service 
      (Amazon RDS). AWS services are available to customers from data center 
      locations in the U.S., Brazil, Europe, Japan and Singapore.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is starting the new year much as it did the one just ended - grappling with weak computer sales tearing a hole in its core Windows business, while it gropes its way slowly into the faster-growing mobile phone and tablet markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the world's largest software company are pretty much where they were a year ago too, and few expect much to change after the latest results are announced on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(It is) clear that investors will continue to need to be patient," Barclays Capital analyst Raimo Lenschow said in a research note on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There could be positive short-term momentum ... but we first need to see proper evidence of mobile/tablet success rather than just signs of hope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which just wrapped up its last Consumer Electronics Show, gave a taste of the tough times it is facing last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with analysts on Tuesday, the head of marketing for the Windows unit flagged the most recent decline in PC sales and warned that the floods in Thailand disrupting crucial disk-drive shipments would put a drag on numbers for a while, making sales hard to foresee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just think it's going to take a couple of quarters to work itself out," said Tami Reller, speaking about the effect of the shortages. "It would be naive to believe otherwise. The level in each of the quarters, I think that's hard to exactly predict."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reller's cautious outlook was confirmed by industry numbers released a day after, when Gartner reported a 1.4 percent decline in global PC sales for the fourth quarter. The research firm predicted that the disk-drive shortages would be most felt in the first half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More worryingly for Microsoft, Gartner noted "continuously low consumer PC demand" over the normally buoyant holiday shopping season in the United States, and a lack of excitement so far over the newest lightweight laptops championed by Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's bad news for Microsoft, whose financial success is still closely bound to computer sales, despite its forays into gaming, servers, Internet search and phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street expects sales of $20.9 billion for the fiscal second quarter - which would be a 5 percent increase from a year ago and its biggest quarterly sales on record - but a net profit of only 76 cents per share, a slight dip from 77 cents last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WAITING FOR 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares have moved higher in the past six weeks - as they often do before earnings - but they tend to fall after its numbers are released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock has fluctuated aimlessly between $23 and $29 since May 2010, the last time they topped $30, despite hitting sales records and increases in the dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointing to the stock's 9.7 price to earnings ratio - just over half its 10-year average - most Wall Street analysts have 'buy' ratings on the stock and target prices in the $30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the good news that is meant to propel the stock afresh never arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest hopes are pinned on Microsoft's new phones - pushed aggressively at CES last week - and on Windows 8 later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Steve Ballmer was very visible at CES, jumping from one place to the next promoting phones that use the latest Windows software. Nokia's Lumia 900 looked slick and attracted a lot of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 900 in the United States will have a front-facing camera and work on wireless firms' new high-speed networks, said Bill Koefoed, Microsoft's head of investor relations at CES. "We will put plenty of marketing muscle behind it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, no date was set for its U.S. launch with AT Likewise, Microsoft would not be tempted into announcing any release date for the mobile-friendly, touch-enabled Windows 8, which will provide its entry into the exploding tablet market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the company has said is that a beta test version will come out in February, which generally means a full release is at least six months down the road from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some industry watchers forecast that machines running Windows 8 will not be on sale until early 2013, by which time Apple Inc's iPad will have almost three years' head start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dale Hudson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore Jan 18 (Reuters) - JP Morgan downgraded
Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), which has a near
monopoly of newspaper publishing in the city-state, to neutral
from overweight, but retained its target price at S$3.80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 0245 GMT, SPH shares were down 1.3 percent at S$3.66, and
have lost about 8 percent since the start of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STATEMENT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage said a top bid for a commercial property
development site in the north-east of Singapore is a potential
risk to dividends due to immediate capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan has cut its fiscal 2012-2014 earnings estimate by
2 percent to factor in potential costs for the acquisition and
development of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winning bid for the site was 30 percent higher than
expectations for the cost of the land, JP Morgan said,
explaining that such a move made SPH deviate further from its
core publishing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While SPH shares outperformed the broader market by 13
percent last year, JP Morgan said a limited cash dividend would
mean there will be no positive catalyst for the stock in the
near term.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - IBM Corp is expected to report solid fourth quarter results on January 19 under new chief executive Virginia Rometty as investors look for news about the potential impact of the Eurozone crisis and currency headwinds in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For IBM, a bellwether stock due to its global reach and wide range of corporate and federal customers, analysts on average expect operating earnings per share of $4.62, a more than 10 percent increase from the quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth quarter revenue is seen at $29.7 billion compared with $29.0 billion in the last quarter of 2010, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays was expecting a modest EPS upside for IBM's fourth quarter, but that "aging product cycles in hardware, currency headwinds and decelerating global economies should likely limit any upside to IBM's top-line" in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro hit a 16-month low last week, but rose against the dollar after two days of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor results from software maker Oracle Corp last month and a cautious quarterly outlook by consulting firm Accenture Plc have spooked investors already worried about the ramifications of economic problems in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last week, SAP AG, the biggest maker of business software, cheered investors with better than expected sales and profits thanks to strong demand for software and data analytics products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will also be keen to get a feel for new chief executive Rometty, a long-time IBM manager who succeeded Sam Palmisano on Jan 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rometty is credited with the smooth integration of PriceWaterhouseCoopers' consulting arm, which IBM bought nearly a decade ago in June 2002 as it transformed itself to focus on higher-margin businesses such as data analytics and services that help customers solve business problems with technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rometty is expected to continue to implement Palmisano's growth strategy aimed at reaching an operating EPS of at least $20 by the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will also be looking for the number of signings of services contracts, an early indicator of future business revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares of the Armonk, N.Y.-based company, closed with a 0.84 percent gain on Tuesday at $180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to equity research firm StarMine, which gives more weight to forecasts from the historically most accurate analysts, IBM trades at 12.3 times its estimated 12-month forward earnings, a premium to peers Oracle and Hewlett Packard Co, which are valued at multiples of 10.8 and 6.4 times, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Nicola Leske; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Provides Update on Rig Incident Offshore Nigeria
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) said that an extensive search and rescue 
      effort continues for two contractors who remain missing after 
      yesterday&#8217;s fire aboard the K.S. Endeavor, a drilling rig offshore 
      Nigeria operated by FODE Drilling Nigeria Limited. While Chevron&#8217;s 
      highest priority remains the rescue of the missing contractors, the 
      company continues to devote the necessary resources to resolve the rig 
      incident in a responsible and timely manner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously reported, the K.S. Endeavor was drilling a natural gas 
      exploration well for Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL). The well is located 
      in the Funiwa Field approximately six miles (10 kilometers) offshore and 
      in approximately 40 feet (12 meters) of water.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron reports that 152 workers on the rig and an associated barge were 
      safely evacuated. They are now onshore and have been given medical 
      examinations. Two remain hospitalized due to minor burns, while others 
      are being held for further observation. .
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While a full investigation is still underway, Chevron said initial 
      indications point to the possible failure of surface equipment during 
      drilling operations that led to a loss of well control. The well 
      continues to burn and the rig has partially collapsed. At this time, the 
      company cannot estimate how long the fire will continue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron has contracted with and is mobilizing the Transocean rig Baltic 
      to commence drilling a relief well. Chevron said the time required to 
      complete the relief well is uncertain, but could extend for some period. 
      Chevron is deploying additional drilling experts and well control 
      specialists to Nigeria to assist with well control efforts and the 
      relief drilling process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A small sheen is visible in close proximity to the well, which the 
      company continues to evaluate. The sheen is estimated at approximately 
      13 barrels. Production from Chevron&#8217;s North Apoi platform remains shut 
      in since it is situated in close proximity to the incident. Total 
      production from the platform was approximately 2,000 barrels per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CNL owns a 40 percent interest in the well and the Nigerian National 
      Petroleum Corporation has a 60 percent interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional updates on the incident are available at Chevron 
      Updates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

were below the low end of its prior guidance," the company said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Birmingham, Alabama-based company cut its 2012 met coal
production outlook, citing inherent risk in mining and
lower-than-expected production from start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company now expects met coal production at 11.5 million
metric tons to 13 million metric tons, compared with its
previous forecast of 13 million metric tons to 14 million metric

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh are setting up shop in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co plans to open 25 to 40 stores in China over the next three years, with its first shop on track to open in the world's most populous country this fall, a top company executive told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes as the world's largest media conglomerate, home to iconic brands that also include Donald Duck and Snow White, looks beyond mature markets such as the United States and Europe for new sources of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is very important to overall Disney company plans, obviously with the launch of the Shanghai Disneyland Park. So, it is probably the newest country that is getting the most focus," Jim Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said in an exclusive interview. Disney broke ground on the Shanghai Disneyland theme park in April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Disney characters are not new to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the licensing division has had a presence in China already, there is affinity for the brand and affinity for characters," he said. "The market is ready."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has signed a lease for its first store in Shanghai and is looking at sites in other cities such as Beijing, Fielding said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are focusing on tier-one cities in very high population and tourist locations, very similar to what we look at around the world," Fielding explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference will be in Disney's strategy to woo the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The product assortment is definitely localized to Chinese consumers and Chinese knowledge because they don't know all the Disney characters that people know in America and in Europe," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, he expects Disney's China stores to carry more products under the Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh labels and fewer of the Princess dolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney refused to say how much it planned to invest in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising consumer wealth and a huge population make China an attractive destination for many companies, but cracking the Chinese market has not been an easy task, with challenges ranging from counterfeiting to cultural differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, U.S. electronics chain Best Buy closed all of its namesake stores in China last year to cut costs. Toy maker Mattel shut its six-story flagship Barbie store in Shanghai early last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the top of the list of problems many U.S. businesses face in China is the protection of their intellectual property rights," Mark Zandi, analyst at Moody's. The rising cost of doing business in China is also becoming more of an issue for some U.S. businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EUROPE STILL CHALLENGED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Disney is excited about its prospects in China, it is not as optimistic about other markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The European business is extremely challenging right now," Fielding said citing economic pressures in the region. "The North American and Japanese markets are ... stable for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which opened its first store in 1987, made a push in the past year to take its interactive, retail format to upscale malls in newer markets, on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans to open 13 new and remodeled Disney Store locations in North America this year, with Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Utah and Virginia, all on tap to get their first new concept stores. In Europe, Disney plans to open its newly designed store in Milan, Italy next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's new stores have more features to entertain shoppers, such as a table where kids can assemble cars from the Disney-Pixar "Cars" movie to a two-story princess castle that kids can enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which already has more than 200 North American stores, more than 40 locations in Japan and more than 100 stores in Europe, has said it aims to convert all of its current stores to the new format as part of a five-year plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MutualMind Partners with IBM to Launch Next Generation Social 
      Business Enterprise Applications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			From the 2012 IBM Lotusphere Conference, MutualMind, Inc., an 
      industry innovator in social media intelligence and management 
      technologies announced today the company&#8217;s partnership with 
      International Business Machines (IBM). MutualMind is demonstrating its 
      OpenSocial 2.0 compatible Social Business Enterprise application with 
      executives from IBM for attendees at the Lotusphere 
      2012 annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Traditionally, social media monitoring products have been offered in the 
      cloud to marketing and communications specialists as 
      software-as-a-service and have remained outside the realm of enterprise 
      applications and workforce productivity. The new IBM/MutualMind Social 
      Business Enterprise solution changes this by embedding in-context, 
      relevant and actionable social media intelligence with IBM&#8217;s 
      enterprise-level platforms including Lotus Notes and IBM Connections. 
      This work addresses the following problems:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        How to integrate relevant and personalized insights for the enterprise 
        workforce within products such as collaboration tools, email or 
        activity streams
      
			
        How to provide secure, embedded experiences so that consumers of such 
        information can interact with it without having to a) navigate to a 
        separate app/window and b) go through a separate login
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Market researches currently expect that social monitoring and analytics 
      continues to be a rapidly growing area with many newer applications 
      predicted for the enterprise workforce. It is estimated that enterprise 
      social business will become a $47B+ market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Building in-context collaboration into the application workflow is 
      one of the fastest growing opportunities in the IT industry. The IBM 
      social business framework, and its supporting programs, can help unlock 
      these opportunities for its business partners.&#8221; &#8211; Excerpt from IBM 
      Business Partner Session, Lotusphere 2012.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Using the OpenSocial 2.0 standard, MutualMind has successfully 
      integrated social technologies with enterprise workflow for the IBM 
      enterprise customer. There are two key elements leveraged in the 
      collaboration between MutualMind and IBM:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Embedded Experiences: An embedded experience (EE) is a way of 
        interacting with events, notifications, and business processes 
        dynamically and in context directly from a Lotus Notes inbox, 
        corporate social home page, or other container without having to log 
        in or switch to another application or service.
      
			
        OpenSocial Gadgets: A Gadget is dynamic web content that can be 
        embedded on a web page, in a social network, or any OpenSocial-enabled 
        application; a mini social application.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re excited about sharing our work with IBM this week at Lotusphere 
      2012,&#8221; stated Babar Bhatti, MutualMind CEO and co-founder. &#8220;We are big 
      believers in the potential of collaboration between start-ups and 
      corporations and truly value the industry leadership that IBM is 
      providing to promote much needed new standards.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;SOFIA (Reuters) - The Bulgarian government, preparing a full ban on shale gas drilling due to environmental concerns, on Tuesday cancelled a exploration permit for the unconventional energy source that it granted to U.S. energy major Chevron in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centre-right government decided Chevron can still prospect for oil and gas in northeastern Bulgaria but only by using conventional drilling techniques and not hydraulic fracturing, which involves injecting water mixed with sand and chemicals at high pressure into shale formations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea is that they can still have the right to test for oil and gas, but without using the controversial technology hydraulic fracturing," Economy and Energy Minister Traicho Traikov told reporters after a cabinet meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traikov said Chevron had not been informed and talks with the company were pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision comes a day before the parliament debates a total ban on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the Balkan country and its Black Sea territorial waters - a proposal drafted by the ruling GERB party which is expected to be passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government in June granted a 5-year permit to Chevron to prospect for shale gas at the 4,400-square-km Novi Pazar field for which initial estimates, based on similar rock formations, showed potential reserves of between 300 billion and 1 trillion cubic meters of shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It hoped to reduce the country's almost complete dependence on gas imports from Russia's Gazprom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other former Soviet-bloc states such as Poland are aggressively pursuing unconventional gas to help ensure future energy security. The Czech Republic and Hungary are two other countries exploration companies see as potentially promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Bulgaria there have been widespread calls for a moratorium on shale gas exploration over concerns it may poison underground waters and trigger earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics worry that fracking fluids might get into groundwater-holding aquifers and contaminate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of shale gas exploration, which has revolutionized the U.S. natural gas industry, has been under scrutiny globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France banned fracking in July, while Britain suspended the deep-excavation practice near Blackpool after minor tremors in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova; Editing by Anthony Barker)&lt;/p&gt;

			Bloomberg Vault Adds Cloud Archiving for IBM Message Software
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New service lowers compliance costs for financial services firms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bloomberg announced today that financial services firms using IBM's 
      messaging and collaboration software can reduce costs and streamline 
      e-mail archiving and compliance by using Bloomberg 
      Vault.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bloomberg Vault simplifies cloud-based message archiving by taking 
      advantage of native features unique to the IBM Lotus Domino server in 
      order to improve security and reliability, while lowering cloud 
      integration costs. A demo of Bloomberg Vault is available at booth #815 
      Tuesday and Wednesday at IBM's 
      Lotusphere conference in Orlando, FL.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Financial institutions are moving to hosted e-mail compliance and 
      archiving services to deal with rising costs, risks and industry 
      regulations, an April 
      2010 study by Forrester Consulting, commissioned by Bloomberg Vault, 
      has found. Today, more than 390 financial service companies have adopted 
      Bloomberg Vault to manage growing legal and regulatory mandates 
      governing corporate data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Growing compliance requirements and an increase in digital 
      communications is driving up the cost of compliance, archiving, and 
      eDiscovery processes, especially for financial services firms," said 
      Harald Collet, Global Business Manager for Bloomberg Vault. "We designed 
      Bloomberg Vault to integrate with IBM Lotus Domino in a secure cloud 
      environment, so we can start to reduce unnecessary IT costs by making 
      the message management, archiving, and compliance process much more 
      efficient."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Michael Waxenberg, the chief technology officer at WestLB AG, the German 
      commercial bank, commented, "We are pleased that Bloomberg Vault 
      supports a fully native integration with IBM Lotus Domino that can 
      assist regulatory and e-discovery processes."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Bloomberg Vault solution for IBM Lotus Domino provides:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Superior security for IBM Lotus Notes communications through support 
        for transport-level encryption and IBM Safe ID Technology,
      
			
        Automated replication, transport and reconciliation of archived 
        message data in IBM's NSF data format and configured via native Lotus 
        Domino journaling features,
      
			
        Message file export capabilities and specialized export template for 
        Lotus Notes communications, Internet e-mail, Bloomberg messages and 
        instant messaging.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The market for cloud-based archiving services is estimated to reach 
      over $1B in spending in 2012, and is expected to grow at a 24.8 percent 
      compounded growth rate from 2010 to 2015," said Laura DuBois, Program 
      Vice President at IDC. "Companies tell us they are under a tremendous 
      pressure to reduce the cost of compliance, and Bloomberg Vault&#8217;s Lotus 
      Notes support offers companies an uncomplicated solution that also helps 
      to reduce IT costs."

      Previously, he was principal lead program manager for Microsoft's 
      Enterprise Storage Division. During his tenure at Microsoft, Malhotra

&lt;p&gt;  PALO ALTO, CA, Jan 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Leading software and product engineering services firm, Symphony
Services, today announced that Microsoft has chosen its SymTest service
to provide validation services for independent software vendors (ISVs)
seeking Windows Server 2008-R2 Platform Ready Test for their
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or Hosted applications.

    Today's announcement, on the heels of Symphony Services celebrating five
years of Microsoft Gold Partner status, advances Symphony's partnership
with Microsoft in successfully delivering software test toolkits and
other Microsoft platform solutions.

    SymTest portal is a sophisticated solution to longstanding problems that
ISVs have been facing in efficiently managing their applications'
validation and certification process. SymTest is a simple, secure,
easy-to-use, real-time status tracking portal. The portal enables
Symphony to offer quick turnaround time (less than five business days),
and it accepts both Gold and Silver requests. 

    Also, available today for ISVs seeking Gold validation is SymTest's
Pass-Assist service that helps ISVs confidently prepare for the
validation program. As part of the service, the SymTest team verifies the
SaaS application's readiness by pinpointing where the application is
failing to meet validation criteria. Providing the ISV with a Pass-Assist
test report, the SymTest team's analysis helps ISVs understand and
correct the issues to help them confidently face the validation process. 

    As an inaugural offer for ISVs seeking Gold validation, the Pass-Assist
service will be delivered at no additional cost (a total retail value of
U.S. $3,000) to the first 50 ISVs that register their applications and
pay for Gold validation by March 31, 2012.

    "Microsoft is very pleased to work with Symphony Services on tools and
solutions that help our joint partners continue to drive innovation and
quality solutions into the market. Microsoft was looking for a validation
partner for SaaS Platform Ready Tests and found Symphony as a best fit
based on its track record in successfully delivering self-test toolkit
solutions, and its proven broad and deep understanding of the Microsoft
platform and products," said Karl Noakes, general manager, Worldwide
Partner Group, Microsoft Corporation.

    "Our launch of the Microsoft Validation Program for SaaS applications
enables Symphony -- in partnership with Microsoft -- to define the
industry standard for world-class software validation services," said
Sanjay Dhawan, CEO, Symphony Services Corp. "We look forward to continued
collaboration with Microsoft to deliver the strongly differentiated,
best-in-class engineering services our clients expect from us."

    The validation program recognizes ISVs' SaaS solutions that are
independently validated to meet Microsoft Corporation's highest standards
for security, stability, reliability and platform compatibility. Some of
the benefits of the program for ISVs, include:


--  Enables development of "Windows Server 2008-R2" compatible Software as
    a Service (SaaS) solutions
--  Increases customer confidence
--  Quickens time to market of the solutions
--  Increases quality and reduced support costs
--  Required for Microsoft Gold and Silver Competencies*
--  Increases global market visibility and stand out from the competition

    

* Note: Applicable to ISVs developing SaaS solutions and are not yet
certified for Gold and Silver competencies

    Unidev was one of the first ISVs to complete the validation program's
pilot. Commenting on the experience, Derek Bemis, Application Systems
Architect of Unidev Development Inc., said, "Unidev's experience with
Symphony Services has been excellent. Throughout the process we have been
kept in the loop as to how our test was progressing." 

    Bemis added, "The validation program drove tremendous value for our
organization. Not only did we gain the competency that allows our
organization to remain as a featured Gold Partner, but we gleaned
strategic insight and confidence from Symphony that our application meets
and/or exceeds the highest of standards. I was thoroughly impressed with
how quickly Symphony learned our application and began the testing
process. This efficiency not only underscore's Symphony's expertise but
also validates for Unidev that our flagship application 'Auctori' is
easy-to-use."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Govt says Chevron may explore for conventional gas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Parliament prepares to ban hydraulic fracturing fully&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Opposition to technology high due to environment concerns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOFIA, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The Bulgarian government,
preparing a full ban on shale gas drilling due to environmental
concerns, on Tuesday cancelled a  exploration permit for the
unconventional energy source that it granted to U.S. energy
major Chevron in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centre-right government decided Chevron can still
prospect for oil and gas in northeastern Bulgaria but only by
using conventional drilling techniques and not hydraulic
fracturing, which involves injecting water mixed with sand and
chemicals at high pressure into shale formations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea is that they can still have the right to test for
oil and gas, but without using the controversial technology
hydraulic fracturing," Economy and Energy Minister Traicho
Traikov told reporters after a cabinet meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traikov said Chevron had not been informed and talks with
the company were pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision comes a day before the parliament debates a
total ban on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the Balkan
country and its Black Sea territorial waters - a proposal
drafted by the ruling GERB party which is expected to be passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government in June granted a 5-year permit to Chevron to
prospect for shale gas at the 4,400-square-km Novi Pazar field 
for which initial estimates, based on similar rock formations,
showed potential reserves of between 300 billion and 1 trillion
cubic metres of shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It hoped to reduce the country's almost complete dependence
on gas imports from Russia's Gazprom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other former Soviet-bloc states such as Poland are
aggressively pursuing unconventional gas to help ensure future
energy security. The Czech Republic and Hungary are two other
countries exploration companies see as potentially promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Bulgaria there have been widespread calls for a
moratorium on shale gas exploration over concerns it may poison
underground waters and trigger earthquakes. {ID:nL6E8CD1YP]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics worry that fracking fluids might get into
groundwater-holding aquifers and contaminate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of shale gas exploration, which has
revolutionized the U.S. natural gas industry, has been under
scrutiny globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France banned fracking in July, while Britain suspended the
deep-excavation practice near Blackpool after minor tremors in
the spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MANCHESTER, NH, Jan 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Scribe, the leader in CRM data integration solutions, announced that
Sabert Corporation, a global leader and innovator in the food packaging
industry, is using the Scribe Data Integration Platform for
bi-directional connectivity between its SAP enterprise resource planning
(ERP) system and Microsoft Dynamics CRM. Providing employees with
industry-leading tools like Microsoft CRM is a contributing factor to
Sabert's success. Despite the recession, Sabert has continued to
experience double-digit sales growth.

    "When we were evaluating CRM solution providers for sales force
automation, Microsoft CRM had what we needed: a native Outlook interface,
which our field sales already used on their laptops, and the ability to
work offline," said Mike Freeman, director of information technology at
Sabert Corporation. "We knew there would be heavy integration
requirements, and we didn't want to add staff, so we turned to a trusted
partner and integration platform."

    Sabert brought in CustomerEffective, a leading national Microsoft CRM
consulting firm, to implement CRM three years ago, including integration
with Sabert's SAP ERP system. CustomerEffective recommended Scribe as the
integration provider of choice because of its proven integration between
CRM and SAP. After deployment, Sabert IT assumed responsibility for
support and maintenance of CRM and any future integration projects
without an increase in IT staffing. 

    "Without Scribe's adapter and connector solutions, the Sabert project
would have been difficult to implement and to maintain after deployment,"
said Mike Rogers, vice president of business development and marketing at
CustomerEffective. "Scribe's built-in functionality makes it quick to
learn and easy to use. We implemented 35 interfaces from SAP to CRM and
several back into SAP. Then the Sabert IT team familiarized themselves
with CRM and Scribe and assumed all support and maintenance with no
problems and no increase in staffing."

    Every day, Sabert pushes all of the customer data from SAP to CRM using
Scribe. Sabert's 70 field sales representatives report that they are
saving hours a night per person on clerical tasks now that they can get
the information they need -- such as order status reports -- from CRM
through Outlook on their laptops. 

    In addition to information for the sales team, Microsoft CRM gives
Sabert's executive management team access to information on the sales
pipeline, including forward-looking trends in various channels. As deals
close in the field, timely and accurate data feeds back into the planning
system through Scribe, optimizing Sabert's forecast-based manufacturing.

    "The collaboration between Sabert and CustomerEffective demonstrates the
efficiency and resulting productivity of Scribe's data integration
platform and Microsoft Dynamics CRM," said Lou Guercia, president and CEO
of Scribe. "Working with trusted partners and proven technologies
guarantees that businesses realize the full value of their investments in
the latest enterprise applications whether on premise or in the cloud."

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA and NEW YORK, NY, Jan 17 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Medivation, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDVN) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today
announced results from the CONCERT trial, which is a Phase 3 trial that
evaluated dimebon (latrepirdine) when added to ongoing treatment with
donepezil HCL tablets in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's
disease. Dimebon did not achieve statistically significant results for
either of the two co-primary endpoints, the Alzheimer's Disease
Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), which measures
cognitive ability, or the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study -
Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), which measures self care and daily
function.

    "We are disappointed in the CONCERT results and the implications for
Alzheimer's disease patients and their caregivers," said David Hung,
M.D., president and CEO of Medivation. "I would like to extend my sincere
thanks to the patients, their physicians and study teams involved in this
trial." 

    Dimebon was generally well tolerated in the study. A full analysis of the
results from CONCERT will be conducted and submitted for presentation at
an upcoming scientific congress. 

    Medivation and Pfizer will discontinue development of dimebon for all
indications and will terminate the ongoing open label extension study in
Alzheimer's disease. The companies also announce that they will terminate
their collaboration to co-develop and market dimebon pursuant to the
terms of their Collaboration Agreement.

    "We recognize Alzheimer's is a very complex disease," said Steven J.
Romano, M.D., senior vice president, head, Medicines Development Group,
Global Primary Care Business Unit, Pfizer Inc. "Despite this
disappointing result, Pfizer remains committed to advancing the science
of Alzheimer's disease, with the ultimate goal of delivering innovative
and meaningful new treatment options to patients." 

    The Phase 3 CONCERT trial was a 12-month global randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 1,003 patients with Alzheimer's
disease. Patients on a stable dose of donepezil for at least four months
were randomized to one of three treatment groups: dimebon 20 mg three
times per day, dimebon 5 mg three times per day or placebo.

			JPT Peptide Technologies, IUCT and LEITAT Announce Collaboration on 
      the Development of Novel Biofocused Anticancer Therapies (NOBITAN)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH (JPT), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
      BioNTech AG (Mainz, Germany), IUCT and LEITAT (Barcelona, Spain) 
      announced today their collaboration on the joint development of an 
      enhanced anticancer therapy based on the biofocused targeting of 
      nucleoside analogs linked to small cyclic peptidomimetics. The goal of 
      the partnership is to create novel chemotherapeutic products exhibiting 
      an enhanced safety and efficacy profile by selectively targeting 
      inactive cytotoxic compounds toward tumor cells. The collaboration 
      combines JPT&#8217;s proven and long term track record in executing peptide 
      based hit identification and hit-to-lead projects with IUCT&#8217;s and 
      LEITAT&#8217;s key expertise in biotechnological synthesis of nucleoside 
      analogs and activity screening studies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IUCT and Leitat have been successfully working on the development of 
      new therapies against neoplastic diseases for several years. With JPT we 
      have found a reputable and strong partner that complements our own 
      expertise in creating new targeted anticancer compounds&#8221;, stated Josep 
      Castells, Executive President at IUCT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Holger Wenschuh, Managing Director at JPT adds, &#8220;The previous scientific 
      work at LEITAT and IUCT lays a solid basis to apply our peptide focused 
      medicinal chemistry experience and capabilities to systematically amend 
      physicochemical properties of the target compounds creating optimized 
      functional profiles.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collaborative project is funded in part by the EuroTransbio 
      Initiative.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh are setting up shop in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is on track to open its first store in China in Fall 2012, and is committed to opening 25 to 40 stores in the world's most populous country over the next three years, a top company executive told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes as the world's largest media conglomerate, home to iconic brands such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh, looks beyond mature markets such as the United States and Europe for new sources of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is very important to overall Disney company plans, obviously with the launch of the Shanghai Disneyland Park. So, it is probably the newest country that is getting the most focus," Jim Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said in an exclusive interview. Disney broke ground on the Shanghai Disneyland theme park in April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the Chinese are not new to the Disney brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the licensing division has had a presence in China already, there is affinity for the brand and affinity for characters," he said. "The market is ready."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has signed a lease for its first store in Shanghai and is looking at sites in other top tier cities such as Beijing, Fielding said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are focusing on tier-one cities in very high population and tourist locations, very similar to what we look at around the world," Fielding explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference will be in Disney's strategy to woo the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The product assortment is definitely localized to Chinese consumers and Chinese knowledge because they don't know all the Disney characters that people know in America and in Europe," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, he expects Disney's China stores to carry more products under the Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh labels and fewer of the Princess dolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney refused to shed light on how much it planned to invest in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising consumer wealth and a huge population make China an attractive destination for many global companies, but cracking the Chinese market has not been an easy task, with challenges ranging from counterfeiting to cultural differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, U.S. electronics chain Best Buy (BBY.N) closed all of its namesake stores in China last year to cut costs. Toy maker Mattel (MAT.O) shut its six-story flagship Barbie store in Shanghai early last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EUROPE STILL CHALLENGED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Disney is excited about its prospects in China, it is not as optimistic about other markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The European business is extremely challenging right now," Fielding said citing economic pressures in the region. "The North American and Japanese markets are ... stable for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which opened its first store in 1987, launched a new retail format in 2010 and has been making a push in the past year to take its highly interactive, retail format to upscale malls in newer markets, on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans to open 13 new and remodeled Disney Store locations in North America this year, with Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Utah and Virginia, all on tap to get their first new concept stores. In Europe, Disney plans to open its newly designed store in Milan, Italy next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's new retail format sports more features to entertain shoppers, such as a table where kids can assemble cars from the popular Disney-Pixar "Cars" movie to a two-story princess castle that kids can enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which already has more than 200 North American stores, more than 40 locations in Japan and more than 100 stores in Europe, has said it aims to convert all of its current stores to the new format as part of a five-year plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

			AURA Releases iAMP PHP Solution Stack for IBM i Web Developers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			iAMP Server Solution Stack Includes All That Developers Need 
      for IBM i
			Web Applications, with Reasonable 
      Support Fees
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All components needed for IBM&#174; i PHP web application 
      development are included in a new Solution Stack, iAMP 
      Server, from AURA Equipements.
			iAMP stands 
      for IBM i + Apache 
      + MySQL + PHP.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The new iAMP Server
				solution stack can 
      be downloaded free from AURA
				(www.easycom-aura.com) 
      and partners. AURA&#8217;s annual support licenses for iAMP 
      Server are priced very reasonably.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			iAMP Server is based on common and standard 
      packages: Apache (HTTP server V2.2.21), MySQL (5.1.59) and PHP 
      (5.3.8, with common extensions).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			To complete the solution stack, AURA added its robust Easycom 
      V4 for native access to IBM i data and programs. Formerly 
      known as the &#8220;i5 Toolkit,&#8221; Easycom was packaged with Zend&#8217;s PHP solution 
      from 2006 to 2011. Easycom V4 accesses all IBM i specific objects 
      and features: Native Program and Procedures calls, System commands and 
      APIs, database access, queues and lists, spool files, etc.
			The 
      Easycom extension can be loaded from any PHP server on Linux, Windows 
      and IBM i, including Zend Server.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Features and benefits of iAMP Server include:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Full compliance with web technology standards, so all the 
        components on the IBM i behave exactly as they do on any other 
        Unix and Linux platform
			
			
				Easy, fast installation process and very light system footprint
			
			
				Multiple installs can run concurrently
			
			
				Multiple instances of the applications can run concurrently
			
			
				Efficient and scalable
			
			
        For IBM i versions V7R1, V6R1, V5R4
      
			
				Premium annual support licenses from $1,500
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Support and consulting services are available worldwide from AURA 
      and partners, including, in North America, IBM i expert Chris 
      Hird from Shield 
      Advanced Solutions (www.shieldadvanced.ca).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			With an installed base of more than 20,000 users and 10,000 
      developer licenses, AURA is the leader in interoperability between the 
      IBM i and the new technology tools in the Windows/AIX/Linux 
      worlds. Thousands of users are connected today to IBM i and 
      AS/400 systems through AURA's Easycom and LAUNCHER/400 solutions. AURA 
      has been offering development tools that provide simplicity, efficiency, 
      security and portability since 1986.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh are setting up shop in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co is on track to open its first store in China in Fall 2012, and is committed to opening 25 to 40 stores in the world's most populous country over the next three years, a top company executive told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes as the world's largest media conglomerate, home to iconic brands such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh, looks beyond mature markets such as the United States and Europe for new sources of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is very important to overall Disney company plans, obviously with the launch of the Shanghai Disneyland Park. So, it is probably the newest country that is getting the most focus," Jim Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said in an exclusive interview. Disney broke ground on the Shanghai Disneyland theme park in April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the Chinese are not new to the Disney brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the licensing division has had a presence in China already, there is affinity for the brand and affinity for characters," he said. "The market is ready."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has signed a lease for its first store in Shanghai and is looking at sites in other top tier cities such as Beijing, Fielding said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are focusing on tier-one cities in very high population and tourist locations, very similar to what we look at around the world," Fielding explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference will be in Disney's strategy to woo the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The product assortment is definitely localized to Chinese consumers and Chinese knowledge because they don't know all the Disney characters that people know in America and in Europe," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, he expects Disney's China stores to carry more products under the Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh labels and fewer of the Princess dolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney refused to shed light on how much it planned to invest in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising consumer wealth and a huge population make China an attractive destination for many global companies, but cracking the Chinese market has not been an easy task, with challenges ranging from counterfeiting to cultural differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, U.S. electronics chain Best Buy closed all of its namesake stores in China last year to cut costs. Toy maker Mattel shut its six-story flagship Barbie store in Shanghai early last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EUROPE STILL CHALLENGED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Disney is excited about its prospects in China, it is not as optimistic about other markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The European business is extremely challenging right now," Fielding said citing economic pressures in the region. "The North American and Japanese markets are ... stable for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which opened its first store in 1987, launched a new retail format in 2010 and has been making a push in the past year to take its highly interactive, retail format to upscale malls in newer markets, on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans to open 13 new and remodeled Disney Store locations in North America this year, with Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Utah and Virginia, all on tap to get their first new concept stores. In Europe, Disney plans to open its newly designed store in Milan, Italy next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's new retail format sports more features to entertain shoppers, such as a table where kids can assemble cars from the popular Disney-Pixar "Cars" movie to a two-story princess castle that kids can enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which already has more than 200 North American stores, more than 40 locations in Japan and more than 100 stores in Europe, has said it aims to convert all of its current stores to the new format as part of a five-year plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Jan 18 (Reuters) - Mexico's competition
regulators will decide next Tuesday whether to approve
broadcaster Televisa's proposed acquisition of half
of cellphone company Iusacell, a $1.6 billion tie-up that would
combine the muscle of two of the country's top media moguls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The planned date is the 24th," Eduardo Perez Motta, head of
competition commission Cofeco, said in an interview with Radio
Formula on Wednesday. "The decision will have to be taken next
week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Televisa-Iusacell deal, announced in April last year, 
has been under scrutiny by regulators as Televisa's chief
executive, Emilio Azcarraga, and Iusacell's owner Ricardo
Salinas, seek to offer a one-stop shop for fixed and mobile
phone services, Internet and cable television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint effort between the two would also create a stronger
competitor in the phone market to the world's richest man,
Carlos Slim. His cellphone giant, America Movil 
, dominates the market and its Telmex unit, the top
fixed-line phone and Internet provider in the country, was
banned in 2011 from tapping the TV market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the main producer of Spanish-language shows in the
world, already has cable, fixed-line telephone and Internet
services in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salinas owns the country's No.2 broadcaster, TV Azteca
, and is expanding fast with its fiber-optic
system, Totalplay, which offers the same three services as
Televisa, plus Iusacell's cellphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the high-profile case is studied by regulators,
analysts and other market watchers have said three outcomes are
possible; it could be blocked, approved as originally proposed
or approved with restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's fourth-quarter profit fell 56 percent as trading and investment banking revenue plunged, but the bank did better than expected thanks to cost-cutting and lower taxes, sending its shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said Goldman is targeting $1.4 billion in annual cost savings, up from an earlier goal of $1.2 billion, and has a "small amount" left to do in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar, speaking on a conference call with analysts, also said profit growth must come from higher revenue and not cost cuts. But he added that Goldman was investing in operations at a "more moderate pace" due to a weak business environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is adjusting and continuing to operate reasonably well in a difficult environment," said Gary Townsend, president of Hill-Townsend Capital. "I would prefer to see them investing more in their operations, but clearly right now they have to right-size their staffing to be consistent with the revenues the market is allowing them to generate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares were up nearly 8 percent at $105.29 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman earnings graphic: link.reuters.com/hac26s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit and compensation: link.reuters.com/byc26s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's results on Wednesday reflected the weakest year for Wall Street since the financial crisis. As politicians and policymakers battled over ways to handle Europe's sovereign debt burden, market volatility surged and Wall Street's clients pulled back on risk-taking, held off on acquisitions and delayed stock and bond offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lull in business, as well as the prospect of reduced profitability amid tighter regulation, has forced major banks to cut more than 100,000 jobs globally and slash bonus pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's payroll declined by 2,400 employees during 2011, reflecting job cuts across trading, banking and back-office operations. The bank slashed compensation 21 percent to $12.2 billion, or $367,057 per employee, from $15.4 billion, or $430,700 per employee, in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street rivals including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Citigroup Inc and Jefferies &amp; Co have reported similar weakness in capital markets revenue, and also responded with job and pay cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is due to report results on Thursday. Analysts expect Goldman's rival to report a loss, due largely to a $1.8 billion settlement with the bond insurer MBIA Inc. But Goldman's explanation of its own weak performance suggests Morgan Stanley faced revenue challenges as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, macroeconomic concerns, heightened market volatility, lower corporate activity and decreased risk appetite among our institutional clients translated into fundamentally lower level of revenue opportunities over the course of the year, hampering our returns," said Viniar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, U.S. banks that focus more on business and consumer lending did better in the fourth quarter. US Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc, two of the largest U.S. regional banks, said on Wednesday that demand for loans from business was increasing, a positive sign for the economy that has turned up in reports from the biggest banks as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROFIT FALLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman earned $978 million, or $1.84 per share, during the last three months of 2011, down from $2.2 billion, or $3.79 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.24 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's profit for the full year was $2.5 billion, its weakest year since 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of Goldman's business lines -- investment banking, trading, investment management and investing and lending -- reported double-digit revenue declines during the fourth quarter. All but investment management reported lower revenue for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's return-on-equity, a key measure of profitability, was a meager 3.7 percent for 2011. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, it boasted returns of more than 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The returns are a stark sign of how higher capital requirements and a pullback in risk-taking after the financial crisis are hurting investment banks and raising questions about Wall Street's business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like nothing's working right now," said Jack Kaplan, portfolio manager at Carret Asset Management. "They were below expectations on virtually everything on the revenue side."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman's fourth-quarter revenue dropped 30 percent to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$6 billion, the bank took steps to reduce expenses and reported lower taxes than in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating expenses declined 7 percent to $4.8 billion, while the bank's tax provision of $234 million was down 78 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower tax rate stemmed from the type of profit Goldman earned on a lower revenue base. The bank, which reported a loss in the third quarter, took big write-downs on some securities for the year, which helped lower taxes. Its tax advantage on holdings like municipal bonds was also more prominent in a year when its overall revenue pool was shallower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's effective income tax rate for 2011 was 28 percent, compared with 35.2 percent for 2010. Viniar said he expected the rate to go back up to the more typical low 30 percent range in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower expenses in 2011 allowed Goldman to report a better profit than dour estimates released by analysts in the weeks leading up to the earnings report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-December Barclays analyst Roger Freeman lowered his fourth-quarter profit estimate for Goldman to 75 cents per share, calling 2011 "another year to forget" for Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Henry; editing by John Wallace and Paritosh Bansal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit of $978 million, or $1.84 per share, compared with a gain of $2.2 billion one year earlier. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.24 a share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are comments from analysts, traders and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JACK KAPLAN, Carret Asset Management, New York: They did a decent job on the cost side but at the end of the day I think Goldman's becoming more and more difficult to analyze. You can no longer count on all the different groups to be doing well at the same time. It looks like nothing's working right now. They were below expectations on virtually everything on the revenue side. That's pretty rare for Goldman. With regulation and post-credit crisis it's a different business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOE SALUZZI, co-head of equity trading, Themis Trading LLC, Chatham, New Jersey: "The thing about Goldman is that I don't think you can compare this to some of the disappointing results we saw from banks like Citi because this is more of a Wall Street firm than a bank. That is why analysts always have a hard time getting the numbers right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GARY TOWNSEND, President, Hill-Townsend Capital, Chevy Chase, Maryland: "Goldman is adjusting and continuing to operate reasonably well in a difficult environment. I would prefer to see them investing more in their operations, but clearly right now they have to right-size their staffing to be consistent with the revenues the market is allowing them to generate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WAYNE KAUFMAN, chief market analyst, John Thomas Financial, New York: "Earnings were very nice. They're citing cost-cutting, though they missed on revenue. This is just another good piece of information. Even though Citigroup missed, we've had some good data regarding loan demand. This is not the huge upside we'd all love to see, but it does point to a bottoming, or a lifting off the bottom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry, Angela Moon and Ryan Vlastelica)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch: Goldman Sachs' 4Q'11 Results Generally Consistent With Fitch 
      Expectations
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s (Goldman) fourth quarter 2011 (4Q'11) 
      results were improved from particularly weak 3Q'11 results. Performance 
      in 4Q'11 was modest when compared to the company's historical 
      performance, but generally consistent with Fitch expectations given the 
      challenging markets. Debt value adjustments (DVA) had no material impact 
      on earnings in 4Q'11.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman reported soft trading results, like many of its peers. 
      Generally, global markets have been characterized by measured client 
      activity, with a focus on expense management and capital preservation. 
      The seasonally slow fourth quarter notwithstanding, market conditions 
      were exacerbated by geo-political uncertainties. In the near term, 
      capital markets are likely to remain challenged by tempered client 
      activity and evolving regulatory action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both equity and fixed income underwriting revenues improved 
      quarter-over-quarter though down for the year compared to 2010. Advisory 
      and client trading revenues declined both from 3Q'11 and for the year. 
      Investing  Lending results were driven by positive contributions from 
      ICBC and other equity investments, in contrast to significant reported 
      losses in the previous quarter. Losses on relationship loans in 4Q'11 
      reflect the mark-to-market accounting treatment of unfunded, committed 
      lending facilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Compensation expense was up in the quarter, but the compensation ratio 
      declined to 36.5%, down from the 44% ratio reported in the first three 
      quarters of fiscal year 2011 (FY11). For the year, the ratio increased 
      to 42.4%, compared to FY10. The firm's $1.4 billion cost-cutting 
      initiative appears to be on track to yield benefits in future quarters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquidity remains sound. The global core excess (GCE) averaged $167 
      billion in 4Q'11, up slightly from the prior quarter. Total assets 
      declined slightly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Average value at risk (VaR) rose quarter-over-quarter due primarily to 
      the rise in interest rate VaR reflecting increased volatility in the 
      markets. Throughout 2011, interest rate risk has increased absolutely 
      and proportionately compared to other risk asset categories.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Basel I capital ratios were essentially unchanged quarter-over-quarter. 
      Tier 1 common under Basel III is approximately 8%. Fitch expects Goldman 
      to achieve Basel III final standards - including the SIFI buffer - 
      before the stated deadline. The firm repurchased an additional 9.2 
      million shares during 4Q'11, for a total cost of $908 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The resignations of Securities Division co-heads Edward Eisler and David 
      Heller were announced January 2012. Going forward, there will be three 
      co-heads instead of four. Fitch believes Goldman has developed 
      sufficient management breadth and depth to readily address such changes 
      in its senior ranks. The Board of Directors was expanded to 12 with the 
      addition of Michele Burns.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks surged on Wednesday after better-than-expected earnings from Goldman Sachs eased worries about U.S. banks' profits in the fourth quarter, while the euro rallied on the IMF's move to increase its ability to fight the European crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors will keep a watchful eye on Europe, though, with the outcome of Greek debt restructuring talks unknown. A deal with the private sector is vital to cash-strapped Athens if it is to gain its next batch of international aid and avoid going bankrupt when 14.5 billion euros ($18.5 billion) of bond redemptions fall due in late March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's too early to get excited about Europe, but the IMF news is clearly a positive and a sign Europe is on its way to stabilizing," said Jerome Heppelmann, chief investment officer at Old Mutual Focused Fund in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 and Nasdaq stock indexes both rose more than 1 percent, responding to the International Money Fund's fund-raising efforts and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) earnings -- which topped analysts' expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IMF said it is seeking to boost its funding base by $600 billion to lend money to countries struggling with the fallout from the euro zone debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro rose for a third straight session against the dollar. Indications that Fitch Ratings may not downgrade Italy after all - versus earlier comments by a director of the rating agency that a two-notch downgrade was an option - also lifted the common currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although very few people will argue that the European sovereign debt crisis will intensify in the coming months, euro/dollar is rallying on the hope of additional support from inside or outside of Europe," said Kathy Lien, director of FX research at GFT in Jersey City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copper futures in New York and London steadied from early losses. Gold also rose on the euro's strength versus the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher appetite for risk weighed on bonds. Thirty-year U.S. Treasuries prices lost a point, trading down 1-14/32 in price to yield 2.96 percent, up from 2.89 percent late on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed up 96.88 points, or 0.78 percent, at 12,578.95. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 14.37 points, or 1.11 percent, at 1,308.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 41.63 points, or 1.53 percent, at 2,769.71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares (GS.N) rose nearly 7 percent to close at $104.31 after Wall Street's biggest bank by assets exceeded analysts' expectations for earnings per share by nearly 50 percent through cost cutting and lower taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is adjusting and continuing to operate reasonably well in a difficult environment," said Gary Townsend, president of Hill-Townsend Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman earned $978 million, or $1.84 per share, during the last three months of 2011, down from $2.2 billion, or $3.79 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.24 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World stocks, as measured by the MSCI All World index .MIWD00000PUS, rose 0.8 percent, touching a two-month high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An index of pan-European shares .FTEU3 ended flat, paring early gains, on worries about the Greek debt restructuring talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International creditors and the Greek government are meeting later on Wednesday over the interest rate that Athens will offer on new bonds and its plan to enforce private investor losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Greek bond negotiations could trigger more euro weakness as they have to close a deal soon, before Greek debt repayments are due in March," said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about Greece led investors to stock up on other European debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A German sale of 3.44 billion euros ($4.4 billion)of two-year bonds spurred strong demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A widely watched sale of 2.5 billion euros of Portuguese treasury bills also benefited from ample liquidity in the financial system. Portugal is the only country in the euro zone, apart from Greece, that is rated at junk levels by all the major rating agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said euro zone debt auctions will continue to be a major driver of investor sentiment this week, with several governments lining up to refinance their debt. The French and Spanish bond auctions are expected to attract the most attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ryan Vlastelica in New York, and Richard Hubbard, William James and Naomi Tajitsu in London; Editing by Padraic Cassidy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Antony Currie
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers at Goldman Sachs rank ahead of its shareholders again. The firm is paying less in 2011 for compensation and benefits than it did the previous year. But the chop falls short of the decline in most other metrics investors use to judge investment banks. Deeper compensation cuts would show some respect for its public shareholders while keeping Goldman from wearing a dubious league-table crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pay tumbled 21 percent, revenue fell by 26 percent and earnings applicable to shareholders 67 percent. Goldman stock, meanwhile, tanked by 46 percent over the course of the year. Compensation needn&#8217;t come down in line with the worst number a firm produces, but even after trimming its fourth-quarter staffing bill, Goldman still distributed 42 percent of the year&#8217;s revenue to employees  more than most, if not all, its U.S. rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s travails produced a sad return on equity of 3.7 percent for 2011. If it had rewarded the underwhelming efforts of its bankers and traders with the same ratio of compensation to revenue as the combination of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank and asset management divisions did, Goldman would have boosted returns by half, or $1.2 billion. Adding back in the $1.6 billion the firm paid to redeem Warren Buffett&#8217;s preferred shares would push the figure to almost 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s hardly stellar and probably still short of Goldman&#8217;s cost of capital. But it wouldn&#8217;t have been as bad, especially considering the tough environment. It also would have bested the return earned by JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank in 2011 and shown a willingness to put shareholders first without treating its employees any more harshly than peers. If Goldman can&#8217;t perform any better than its rivals, premium wages can no longer be justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  PARIS, Jan 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Lectra, the world leader in integrated technology solutions dedicated to
industries using soft materials-textiles, leather, industrial fabrics and
composite materials-is pleased to announce the renewal of its global
partnership with Walter Wilhelm Associates (WWA) for a three year period.

    "Our customers in the fashion world are increasingly aware of the
strategic importance PLM plays and the immediate benefits a fashion and
apparel-specific solution can bring to their development process. It is
also critically important to find a partner who grasps the subtleties of
this industry. With close to forty years of expertise and countless
technology implementation projects between us, Lectra and WWA both
understand the economic realities and challenges unique to fashion
companies. Lectra's strength-and the strength of our partnership with
Walter Wilhelm Associates-lies in an exhaustive knowledge of the tasks
essential to apparel development, from design through product development
and production," explains Daniel Harari, Lectra CEO.

    Initiated in February 2009, this partnership and its renewal signify how
well aligned the Lectra and WWA teams are. In an increasingly mature
market focused on achieving greater profitability and reducing time to
market, Lectra and WWA have been able to successfully complete a range of
PLM initiatives, thanks to their combined expertise in fashion.

    Lectra Fashion PLM is the only fashion-specific PLM solution on the
market. It combines management tools such as flexible workflow and
sourcing functions, tailored to the needs of the fashion sector, with
applications and features specific to job roles found in the fashion
industry, such as textile and fashion design and product development. The
arrival of this break-through technology in today's economy presents an
opportunity for apparel companies to look at how they do business,
re-assess their priorities and, quite simply, improve how they make what
they sell.

    "Deploying PLM in an unstable economic context demands quick
implementation - often in no more than six months. At every stage of
collection development, fashion companies want immediate proof of hard
and soft ROI, regardless of whether project implementation is complete.
This agile way of working requires knowledgeable process analysis based
on industry standards and best practices, which Lectra Fashion PLM
incorporates. Thanks to their respective industry experience, Lectra and
WWA experts master this methodology," explains Walter Wilhelm, founder
and CEO of Walter Wilhelm Associates.

&lt;p&gt;

			Full Monte&#8482; Cost and Schedule Risk Analysis Adds Critical 
      Functionality to Microsoft&#174; Project
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Users of Microsoft Project&#174; 2007 and 2010 can now analyze the likely 
      effects of uncertainty on the timely completion of their projects thanks 
      to Full Monte&#8482; cost and schedule risk analysis software from Barbecana, 
      now available for a free 30-day trial or purchase at Barbecana.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While Microsoft Project and other project management systems give users 
      single-point estimates of when projects will be complete and how much 
      they will cost, these deterministic estimates can be misleading.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The only sure thing about the results of a deterministic approach to 
      scheduling is that they will be proven wrong,&#8221; says Tony Welsh, 
      president of Barbecana and developer of Full Monte. &#8220;The quantitative 
      assessment of risk is a vital part of project planning, and I am excited 
      to be bringing it to Microsoft Project users in such a user-friendly and 
      integrated way.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full Monte addresses cost and schedule risk analysis using Monte Carlo 
      simulation, providing a much more realistic assessment of likely project 
      outcomes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Instead of saying that the project will be finished on June 15, Full 
      Monte allows you to make statements such as &#8216;there is a 95 percent 
      chance that the project will be completed between July 15 and August 
      31,&#8217;&#8221; explains Welsh. &#8220;And because of the way parallel paths interact, 
      it is often the case that the June 15 date is not even remotely 
      achievable.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fast and easy to use, Full Monte&#8217;s features include support for five 
      families of probability distribution (normal, lognormal, uniform, beta, 
      and triangular), correlations between task durations, and branching 
      based upon dates or chance. Output includes expected values, standard 
      deviations, percentile points, histograms, and S-curves of early and 
      late dates, slack values, and cost for each task and for the project as 
      a whole. Data can be migrated automatically from Risk+&#174;.

Gain market insight with full analysis and research downloads available
at www.BrightonMarkets.com/index.php?coa=GS=LMT.

    Economic fundamentals leading into 2012 have set a generally positive
pace with GDP growth likely to pick up through the coming year. However,
there are several important caveats to note as the world economy
continues to face headwinds and risks weigh to the downside. Positive
outlooks are conditional on fiscal policy in payroll taxes and
unemployment insurance benefits and upon the easing of the European debt
situation. A repeat of volatility experienced in 2011 is likely in 2012,
as perceptions about the strength of the U.S. economy and the euro zone
will vary over time as events unfold.

    Despite the current situation, our team continues to identify high
momentum situations with growth potential -- there remains strong
opportunity within careful discretion.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Upgraded online system provides a variety of detailed views of 
      cash transactions and analytical dashboards
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan Treasury Services (NYSE: JPM), a full-service provider of 
      cash management, trade finance, treasury solutions and escrow services, 
      today launched an enhanced and redesigned web portal, Web Currency 
      Services. The new portal provides a single, online solution for clients' 
      currency needs, improved internal controls, and enhanced expense and 
      non-earning asset management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Web Currency Services (replacing a previous cash portal, WebOrder) 
      provides a variety of detailed views of cash transactions through J.P. 
      Morgan&#8217;s nationwide vault network and user-friendly analytical 
      dashboards. Clients will now be able to gain further visibility into the 
      following areas of cash management:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Online Ordering  History: Clients will experience ordering 
        flexibility and viewing of historical activity, which may be used to 
        resolve internal inquiries and provide a holistic view of ordering 
        transactions. The new currency ordering interfaces with organizations 
        in real time for orders placed with J.P. Morgan&#8217;s nationwide network 
        of more than 100 vaults to optimize funds availability.
      
			
				Deposit Details: Clients will be able to view denominational 
        and adjustment information for each cash deposit made through the J.P. 
        Morgan nationwide vault network to help reconcile transactions and 
        understand adjustments posted.
      
			
				Cash Forecasting: The new platform uses market-leading software 
        to help reduce cash inventory providing clients an opportunity to 
        invest once-idle balances. Additionally, combining state-of-the art 
        intelligent forecasting algorithms with preset parameters and daily 
        activity transmission data, the system will calculate and recommend 
        cash orders and/or deposits automatically for multiple locations.
      
			
				Vault Trend Reports and Dashboards:&#160;Clients can view monthly 
        reports in an online library. Dashboards are comprehensive and dynamic 
        with graphic illustrations to visually assess deposit and order trends 
        and analysis. Flexible reporting allows clients to see both individual 
        and specific locations as well as a consolidated historical view.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to offer clients market-leading software to provide a 
      comprehensive online tool, with key analytical capabilities,&#8221; said Paul 
      Jarrett, Senior Product Manager, J.P. Morgan Treasury Services. &#8220;The new 
      functionality demonstrates our continuous investment into this product 
      set, featuring state-of- the-art cash-forecasting technology along with 
      our nationwide vault network for completely integrated end-to-end cash 
      supply chain management.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The enhanced Web Currency Services portal joins a family of robust coin

			JPMorgan Chase Achieves LEED&#174; Platinum Green Building Certification 
      for Newly Renovated Global Headquarters in New York City
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			World&#8217;s largest LEED Platinum renovation to date
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Will cut electric consumption by 50% and save more than 1 million 
      gallons of water a year
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase announced today that it has achieved the highest possible 
      rating, LEED&#174; Platinum, from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for 
      the renovation of its global headquarters at 270 Park Avenue in 
      Manhattan, making it the world&#8217;s largest renovation project to achieve 
      Platinum status.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the United States, existing buildings contribute 50 to 80 percent of 
      urban greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Building Owners and 
      Managers Association. The renovation will allow the 50-story building to 
      cut its electricity consumption in half compared to pre-renovation 
      levels. In addition, the building will save more than 1 million gallons 
      of water a year by installing new, highly efficient systems and an 
      innovative draining and filtering system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This was the largest &#8216;green&#8217; renovation of a headquarters building in 
      the world, and we completed it while operating in the building,&#8221; said 
      Frank Bisignano, JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Chief Administrative Officer and CEO 
      of Mortgage Banking. &#8220;We are extremely proud of the improvements made at 
      270 Park, which will substantially cut consumption and reduce greenhouse 
      gas emissions. Achieving LEED Platinum status is not just a source of 
      pride, it is very sound business.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earning the Platinum rating meant upgrading and modernizing every system 
      and feature in the 50-year-old building &#8211; from heating, air conditioning 
      and lighting, to insulation, plumbing fixtures, flooring and outside 
      views &#8211; all while the building remained occupied. To minimize 
      disruptions, an average of 400 construction workers a day completed the 
      renovation in phases, working on up to 10 floors at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With each new LEED-certified building, we get one step closer to 
      USGBC&#8217;s vision of a sustainable built environment for everyone within a 
      generation,&#8221; said Rick Fedrizzi, President, CEO and Founding Chair, U.S. 
      Green Building Council. &#8220;The work of innovative, forward-thinking 
      building projects such the Park Avenue headquarters of JPMorgan Chase is 
      a fundamental driving force in the green building movement.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LEED Platinum certification of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s global headquarters was 
      based on a number of green design and construction features, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        New systems to improve energy efficiency, including: heating and air 
        conditioning equipment; lighting with occupancy sensors and daylight 
        dimming controls; Energy Star kitchen appliances, computers and 
        monitors; new building insulation and window tint to reduce glare, 
        heat gain and air conditioning load.
      
			
        A 54,000 gallon tank in the cellar that collects rain water from 
        drains on the roof and plaza, which is stored and filtered, and then 
        used in landscaping and to flush toilets in the lower part of the 
        building &#8211; saving more than 1 million gallons of water a year. 
        Combined with other plumbing upgrades the building will use half as 
        much water as pre-renovation.
      
			
        Nearly 16,500 square feet of new landscaping, including green roofs, 
        that feature low-maintenance plants to help lower building 
        temperatures in the summer while reducing stress on the city&#8217;s sewer 
        system on rainy days. Soil in the planters acts as a filter to remove 
        pollutants from rainwater. In addition, an herb garden was planted on 
        the 11th floor roof to provide fresh herbs and vegetables 
        for client dining.
      
			
        Reusing over 99 percent of the original building and recycling more 
        than 85 percent of construction waste including 990,000 square feet of 
        carpeting. Over 12,000 tons of construction waste was diverted from 
        landfills.
      
			
        New floor designs and layout to give 85 percent of employees natural 
        daylight at their desks, with more than 92 percent having exterior 
        views.
      
			
        266 bicycle racks to encourage employee well being and greener 
        commutes.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Jan 18 (Reuters) - EU regulators are
readying a formal complaint against Visa Europe over its credit
card fees, the EU's antitrust chief said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are preparing a statement of objections. We don't know
yet when to send it," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin
Almunia told Reuters late on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa Inc, runs
the largest card network in the 27-country European Union. The
European Commission is now investigating its consumer credit and
deferred debit card charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe agreed to cut its debit card fees in December
2010 to settle the Commission's antitrust probe into that part
of its business.&lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;This past year was dominated by global macro-economic concerns which 
      significantly affected our clients&#8217; risk tolerance and willingness to 
      transact,&#8221; said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive 
      Officer. &#8220;While our results declined as a consequence, I am pleased that 
      the firm retained its industry-leading positions across our global 
      client franchise while prudently managing risk, capital and expenses. As 
      economies and markets improve &#8211; and we see encouraging signs of this &#8211;

      Banking were $4.36 billion for 2011, 9% lower than 2010. Net revenues in 
      Financial Advisory were $1.99 billion, 4% lower than 2010. Net revenues 
      in the firm&#8217;s Underwriting business were $2.37 billion, 14% lower than 
      2010, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in equity 
      underwriting, principally due to a decline in industry-wide activity. 
      Net revenues in debt underwriting were essentially unchanged compared 
      with 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fourth QuarterNet revenues in 
      Investment Banking were $857 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, 43% 
      lower than the fourth quarter of 2010 and 10% higher than the third 
      quarter of 2011. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $470&#160;million, 
      25% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting a 
      significant decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. 
      Net revenues in the firm&#8217;s Underwriting business were $387&#160;million, 56% 
      lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. Net revenues in both equity 
      underwriting and debt underwriting were significantly lower than the 
      fourth quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting a significant decline in 
      industry-wide activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog increased compared 
      with the end of 2010, and decreased compared with the end of the third 
      quarter of 2011.&#160;(7)

			Institutional Client Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Full YearNet revenues in 
      Institutional Client Services were $17.28&#160;billion for 2011, 21% lower 
      than 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution 
      were $9.02 billion for 2011, 34% lower than 2010. Although activity 
      levels during 2011 were generally consistent with 2010 levels, and 
      results were solid during the first quarter of 2011, the environment 
      during the remainder of 2011 was characterized by broad market concerns 
      and uncertainty, resulting in volatile markets and significantly wider 
      credit spreads, which contributed to difficult market-making conditions 
      and led to reductions in risk by the firm and its clients. As a result 
      of these conditions, net revenues across the franchise were lower, 
      including significant declines in mortgages and credit products, 
      compared with 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Equities were $8.26&#160;billion for 2011, 2% higher than 
      2010. During 2011, average volatility levels increased and equity prices 
      in Europe and Asia declined significantly, particularly during the third 
      quarter. The increase in net revenues reflected higher commissions and 
      fees, primarily due to higher transaction volumes, particularly during 
      the third quarter of 2011. In addition, net revenues in securities 
      services increased compared with 2010, reflecting the impact of higher 
      average customer balances. Equities client execution net revenues were 
      lower than 2010, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues 
      in shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The net gain attributable to the impact of changes in the firm&#8217;s own 
      credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected 
      was approximately $600&#160;million for 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fourth QuarterNet revenues in 
      Institutional Client Services were $3.06&#160;billion for the fourth quarter 
      of 2011, 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010 and 25% lower than 
      the third quarter of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution 
      were $1.36&#160;billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, 17% lower than the 
      fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in net revenues compared with the 
      fourth quarter of 2010 reflected lower results in mortgages and credit 
      products as continued global economic uncertainty contributed to 
      difficult market-making conditions. These decreases were partially 
      offset by higher net revenues in interest rate products and, to a lesser 
      extent, commodities and currencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Equities were $1.69&#160;billion for the fourth quarter of 
      2011, 15% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting 
      lower net revenues in equities client execution, as well as lower 
      commissions and fees. The decline in equities client execution compared 
      with the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily reflected lower net revenues 
      in derivatives. Securities services net revenues were higher compared 
      with the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of 
      changes in the composition of customer balances. Although global equity 
      prices generally increased during the quarter, Equities operated in an 
      environment characterized by lower activity levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The net gain attributable to the impact of changes in the firm&#8217;s own 
      credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected

			Full YearNet revenues in Investing  
      Lending were $2.14&#160;billion for 2011. Results for 2011 included a loss of 
      $517&#160;million from the firm&#8217;s investment in the ordinary shares of 
      Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and net gains of 
      $1.12 billion from other investments in equities, primarily in private 
      equity positions, partially offset by losses from public equities. In 
      addition, Investing  Lending included net revenues of $96&#160;million from 
      debt securities and loans. This amount includes approximately $1&#160;billion 
      of unrealized losses related to relationship lending activities, 
      including the effect of hedges, offset by net interest income and net 
      gains from other debt securities and loans. Results for 2011 also 
      included other net revenues of $1.44&#160;billion, principally related to the 
      firm&#8217;s consolidated entities held for investment purposes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fourth QuarterNet revenues in 
      Investing  Lending were $872&#160;million for the fourth quarter of 2011. 
      Results for the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily included a gain of 
      $388&#160;million from the firm&#8217;s investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, 
      net gains of $384&#160;million from other investments in equities, primarily 
      in public equities, and other net revenues of $321&#160;million, principally 
      related to the firm&#8217;s consolidated entities held for investment 
      purposes. These results were partially offset by net losses of 
      $221&#160;million from debt securities and loans, primarily reflecting 
      approximately $450&#160;million of unrealized losses related to relationship 
      lending activities, including the effect of hedges, partially offset by 
      net interest income.

			Investment Management

		&lt;p&gt;
			Full YearNet revenues in Investment 
      Management were $5.03&#160;billion for 2011, essentially unchanged compared 
      with 2010, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting 
      favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, offset by lower 
      incentive fees. During the year, assets under management decreased 
      $12&#160;billion to $828&#160;billion, reflecting net outflows of $17&#160;billion, 
      partially offset by net market appreciation of $5&#160;billion. Net outflows 
      primarily reflected outflows in fixed income and equity assets, 
      partially offset by inflows in money market assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fourth QuarterNet revenues in 
      Investment Management were $1.26&#160;billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, 
      16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010 and 3% higher than the third 
      quarter of 2011. The decrease in net revenues compared with the fourth 
      quarter of 2010 was primarily due to lower incentive fees. During the 
      quarter, assets under management increased $7&#160;billion to $828&#160;billion, 
      reflecting net market appreciation of $15&#160;billion in equity and fixed 
      income assets, partially offset by net outflows of $8&#160;billion. Net 
      outflows primarily reflected outflows in fixed income and equity assets, 
      partially offset by inflows in money market assets.

      Operating expenses were $22.64&#160;billion for 2011, 14% lower than 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Compensation and Benefits
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, discretionary 
      compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as 
      benefits) were $12.22&#160;billion for 2011, a 21% decline compared with 
      $15.38&#160;billion for 2010. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net 
      revenues for 2011 was 42.4%. Total staff&#160;(8) decreased 
      7% compared with the end of 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Non-Compensation Expenses

		&lt;p&gt;
			Full YearNon-compensation expenses 
      were $10.42&#160;billion for 2011, essentially unchanged compared with 2010. 
      Non-compensation expenses for 2011 included higher brokerage, clearing, 
      exchange and distribution fees, increased reserves related to the firm&#8217;s 
      insurance business and higher market development expenses compared with 
      2010. These increases were offset by lower other expenses during 2011. 
      The decrease in other expenses primarily reflected lower net provisions 
      for litigation and regulatory proceedings (2010 included $550&#160;million 
      related to a settlement with the SEC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fourth QuarterNon-compensation 
      expenses were $2.59&#160;billion, 15% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010 
      and 5% lower than the third quarter of 2011. The decrease compared with 
      the fourth quarter of 2010 was primarily due to the impact of an 
      impairment of the firm&#8217;s New York Stock Exchange Designated Market Maker 
      rights of $305&#160;million during the fourth quarter of 2010 and higher 
      charitable contributions during the fourth quarter of 2010. These 
      decreases were partially offset by the impact of impairments on 
      consolidated investments of approximately $170&#160;million during the fourth 
      quarter of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fourth quarter of 2011 included $47&#160;million of net provisions for 
      litigation and regulatory proceedings and $78&#160;million of charitable 
      contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives. Compensation was reduced to fund 
      the charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. This amount is in 
      addition to prior year contributions made to Goldman Sachs Gives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Provision for Taxes

      The effective income tax rate for 2011 was 28.0%&#160;(9), 
      down from 30.3% for the first nine months of 2011. The decrease in the 
      effective income tax rate was primarily due to an increase in permanent 
      benefits as a percentage of earnings and the earnings mix.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capital
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of December&#160;31,&#160;2011, total capital was $243.93&#160;billion, consisting

      and both approximately 1% lower compared with the end of the third 
      quarter of 2011. Book value and tangible book value per common share are 
      based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units 
      granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 
      516.3&#160;million at period end.

            Management believes that presenting the firm&#8217;s results excluding 
            the impact of the $1.64&#160;billion preferred dividend related to the 
            redemption of the firm&#8217;s Series&#160;G Preferred Stock (calculated as 
            the difference between the carrying value and the redemption value 
            of the preferred stock) is meaningful, as it increases the 
            comparability of period-to-period results. Diluted earnings per 
            common share and ROE excluding this dividend are non-GAAP measures 
            and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by 
            other companies. The tables below present the calculation of net 
            earnings applicable to common shareholders, diluted earnings per 
            common share and average common shareholders&#8217; equity excluding the 
            impact of this dividend:

            The Tier&#160;1 common ratio equals Tier&#160;1 common capital divided by 
            risk-weighted assets. As of December&#160;31,&#160;2011, Tier&#160;1 common 
            capital was $55.16&#160;billion, consisting of Tier&#160;1 capital of 
            $63.26&#160;billion less preferred stock of $3.10&#160;billion and junior 
            subordinated debt issued to trusts of $5.00&#160;billion. Management 
            believes that the Tier&#160;1 common ratio is meaningful because it is 
            one of the measures that the firm and investors use to assess 
            capital adequacy and, while not currently a formal regulatory 
            capital ratio, this measure is of increasing importance to 
            regulators. The Tier&#160;1 common ratio is a non-GAAP measure and may 
            not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other 
            companies. This ratio represents a preliminary estimate as of the

            The effective income tax rate for 2011 was 28.0%, compared with 
            35.2% for 2010. Excluding the impact of the $465&#160;million U.K. bank 
            payroll tax for the full year and the $550&#160;million SEC settlement, 
            substantially all of which was non-deductible, the effective 
            income tax rate for 2010 was 32.7%. The decrease from 32.7% to 
            28.0% was primarily due to an increase in permanent benefits as a 
            percentage of earnings and the earnings mix. Management believes 
            that presenting the firm&#8217;s effective income tax rate for 2010 
            excluding the impact of these items is meaningful as excluding 
            them increases the comparability of period-to-period results. The 
            effective income tax rate excluding the impact of these items is a 
            non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP 
            measures used by other companies. The table below presents the 
            calculation of the effective income tax rate excluding the impact

&lt;p&gt;ROMA, 17 gennaio (Reuters) - L'Antitrust ha deciso
oggi una multa da 10,6 milioni per il gruppo farmaceutico Pfizer
 che ha abusato di una posizione dominante nel mercato
della commercializzazione di farmaci a base del principio attivo
latanoprost per la cura del glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo riferisce una nota dell'Autorit&#224; in cui si aggiunge che
alla societ&#224; &#232; stato imposto di cessare il comportamento
illegittimo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Il ritardo dell'immissione dei farmaci generici, spiega il
comunicato, "&#232; costato al Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, che
rimborsa il medicinale utilizzato per il glaucoma ai pazienti,
circa 14 milioni di euro in termini di mancato risparmio: la
presenza sul mercato dei produttori del farmaco equivalente ha
infatti comportato l'immediata riduzione del prezzo, che si &#232;
sostanzialmente dimezzato".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La colpa di Pfizer &#232; consistita, secondo l'Autorit&#224;,
"nell'aver prolungato artificiosamente la protezione
 dal settembre 2009 al luglio 2011 e,
successivamente, al gennaio 2012, per allinearla a quella in
vigore negli altri Paesi europei".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In questo modo la multinazionale &#232; riuscita a ritardare
l'ingresso sul mercato di farmaci generici prodotti da
concorrenti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sul sito www.reuters.com altre notizie Reuters in italiano. Le

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Sinopec has racked up deals worth $10.4 bln since June&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Most acquisitive energy major in past 6 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Recent deals are sign of growing China M maturity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Denny Thomas and Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Jan 5 (Reuters) - "Chairman Fu" is stepping
on the gas at Sinopec's M machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A $2.2 billion deal with U.S. oil and natural gas producer
Devon Energy Corp this week is the Chinese group's 11th
deal since June and takes spending on acquisitions to $10.4
billion in that time, according to Thomson Reuters - more M
volume than Sinopec's two Chinese rivals, Exxon-Mobil,
BP, Shell and Chevron combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) ,
the country's largest oil company by sales, has long been
China's most acquisitive energy company, launching 74 deals
worth $48.1 billion since 2005, putting it ahead of all oil and
gas majors over that period, including Exxon-Mobil, which is
credited with 17 deals worth $44 billion, Thomson Reuters data
show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since last spring, Sinopec and its subsidiaries have
accelerated the overseas push, coinciding with the arrival in
April of its new chairman, Fu Chengyu, who moved over from
China's third-largest oil and gas group, China National Offshore
Company (CNOOC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's pretty hands on for a chairman," said an investment
banker who has worked with Fu, adding that Fu is a consummate
dealmaker. "He's more dynamic, proactive, and Western" than a
lot of his peers, the banker noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in 1951, Fu earned a degree in geology from the
Northeast Petroleum Institute in China and has a master's degree
from the University of South California. He worked in China's
vast Daqing oil fields and has accumulated more than three
decades of experience in the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than three weeks before the Devon Energy announcement,
Sinopec teamed up with Hong Kong's ENN Energy Holdings 
in another $2.2 billion deal - an unsolicited offer for China
Gas Holdings, a rare move among China's corporates,
which tend to strike deals on more friendly terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest profile hostile energy bid by a Chinese company
was the $18.5 billion offer by CNOOC in 2005 for U.S.-based
Unocal Oil Co. That attempt, which failed after a snowballing of
opposition in the U.S. Congress, was led by Fu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China's goal is not to overturn the world order, but to
participate in this world order, and to reinforce it and even to
profit from it," Fu told a Houston energy conference in 2006 to
reassure the oil industry in the wake of CNOOC's bold bid for
Unocal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing before executives from his biggest Western
competitors, Fu played up what he called the commonalities
between his company and its Western counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are bound together with most of the oilmen in this
room," he told the conference. "Like you, we must replace our
reserves aggressively ... and protect shareholder interests in
the face of high risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHIFTING FOCUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu's focus of late has specifically targeted Sinopec's build
up of more unconventional assets, such as shale gas exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinopec's deal team is highly respected among Asia's
investment bankers, having built a franchise that has become
more deal savvy in China's relatively nascent M market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They know what they want and they know how to get what they
want," said one source close to Sinopec's strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu, a fit man with thick, parted black hair, oversees the
company's overall acquisition strategy, leaving deal execution
to his seasoned M team. Xianliang Geng, a general manager at
Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corp,
the division pursuing the Devon Energy investment, is among the
company's top M specialists who, according to one source, led
the $3.5 billion acquisition of a Brazilian oil asset in
November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a strategy guy by title, Fu does not hesitate to get
involved in deals himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is certainly the dealmaker in the China Gas situation,"
one Hong Kong-based M adviser told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Sinopec has pursued, in a matter of weeks, its first
U.S. deal and its first hostile offer shows Fu's influence
playing out, sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu, who is married and has a daughter, joined CNOOC in 1982
and held several posts before becoming chairman in 2003. He
earned a reputation as an energetic trouble-shooter before his
elevation to the top job. He also helped lead CNOOC's initial
public offering in 2001 after a failed attempt two years
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEARNING POINTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also shows more broadly how China has become more
experienced in the art of deal making, gathering the tricks of
the trade as well as engaging, along the way, savvy financial
advisers, lawyers and public relations executives to overcome
political, regulatory and shareholder hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fu appears to have learned from the foiled Unocal bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the Devon Energy deal is that Sinopec is not buying
the company outright, rather taking a one-third interest in the 
company's five fields, which will likely attract less attention
from local or government officials, shareholders and residents.
The $3.5 billion Brazil deal was also for a 33 percent stake in
a unit of Portuguese oil company Galp Energia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fluent, if heavily-accented, English speaker, Fu meets
more frequently with investors and the media than did his CNOOC
predecessor Wei Liucheng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are quite effective, managed conversations, whereas
most of the time five years back, that was not the case.
Decisions then took place in opaque space," one person familiar
with the China Gas situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here, you have a team of dealmakers around the table on the
phone," the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinopec and local peer China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC)
raked in more deals than CNOOC during Fu's years there, though
CNOOC, as a smaller company in both market value and reserves,
was able to seal joint venture deals and acquisitions that
bankers say allowed it to keep pace with its larger rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Fu now at the helm of Sinopec, he has a bigger platform
to stand on, and the deals are likely to keep coming as Sinopec
aims to more than double its equity oil output from overseas
projects to over 1 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For investment bankers, Sinopec is a top client and a
trusted counterparty to bring into any auction. Sinopec has been
splitting the business among global investment banks without
relying heavily on any single adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last three deals, Sinopec has used three different
advisers: Credit Suisse is advising Sinopec on Devon,
Citigroup on China Gas, and Societe Generale on
Galp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can sit in an equal position when discussing cooperation
with our foreign peers," Fu told the China Daily newspaper last
year. "That was hard to imagine a decade earlier."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore Jan 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs started
coverage of Singapore-listed logistics company, Global Logistic
Properties (GLP), with a buy recommendation and set a
12-month price target of S$2.34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 0220 GMT, GLP shares were up 1 percent at S$1.865. The
stock fell 13 percent since the start of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STATEMENT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said GLP's size and depth of its network in
China and Japan displayed key competitive advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage said GLP's operations in China are supported
by structural growth in domestic consumption and limited supply
of existing logistics facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japan, its businesses provide annuity-like income streams
which serve as an internal funding source for its expansions in
China, Goldman Sachs said, explaining that GLP's fundamentals
look compelling with self-funded growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expects the company to outperform the sector
over the next three years with an estimated compounded average
growth rate of 16 percent in its earnings per share.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A strong outlook from IBM and decent results from Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp suggest that corporate decision makers are shaking off nervousness about economic growth and boosting spending on technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world's largest technology services company, easily beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter profit expectations and promised earnings growth of 10 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel, the leading microchip maker, announced ambitious spending plans after reporting quarterly results that topped scaled-back analyst forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's results were largely in line with expectations, with growth in its servers and tools business offsetting weakness in Windows sales to PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those results look largely favorable," said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna. "So far what we have seen in technology, looks like we are turning the corner and things are getting better. Turning the corner in terms of cleaning the excess inventory in the channel and seeing a better demand outlook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, IBM and Intel have a combined market capitalization of about $580 billion, representing 15 percent of the Dow Jones industrial index. Shares of IBM shares rose 3 percent in extended trading after its results, while Microsoft shares rose 2 percent and Intel shares rose 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only downer in the tech world on Thursday was Google Inc, whose quarterly results fell far short of high expectations set by strong online shopping during the holiday season, sending its shares down 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Expectations had got ahead of themselves for Google, largely because investors don't have a good feel for what happens outside the U.S.," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jordan Rohan. "North America has remained strong, but there are parts of the world where there's a lot of economic pressure," he said, pointing to austerity measures in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT SPENDING HOLDING UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Thursday's results, other technology giants had sent mixed messages about global IT spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software maker Oracle Corp, for example, missed expectations last month and outsourcing company Accenture Plc spooked investors with its cautious quarterly outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Oracle rival SAP AG pleased the market last week with sales and profits that beat estimates, signaling global companies were confident enough to spend more on technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, a tech bellwether because of its global reach and scale, said strong signings of services contracts and its services backlog put the company in a solid position as it starts the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you look at the overall pipeline going into 1Q for software and services ... I think they look pretty good," IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a call with analysts on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if, like Oracle, IBM was seeing longer approval times for tech spending by companies, Loughridge said: "As far as lengthening of the sales cycles, more approvals, I do think people and CFOs are cautious about their business and they want to make sure they have the right processes engaged and we did see that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSUMER VS CORPORATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales at Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, were strong even though its profit slipped as slower personal computer sales to consumers hurt its Windows software business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as consumers fled to cheaper tablet computers from rivals, Microsoft boasted strength from business customers and in emerging markets where computer demand was healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all expected the PC market to be weak and the Windows business was down because of that. But the server and tools business is growing well," said Sunit Gogia, an equity analyst at Morningstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Forrest, a senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh said that all the tech results showed strong demand for products from which corporations expect a future benefit, such as improving employee productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It means despite a slowing economy in Europe and other places there's companies still spending on productivity-enhancing technologies," Forrest said. "There has been a lot of M in the past years and the companies that made smart investments are seeing them pay out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nicola Leske, Noel Randewich, Bill Rigby, Alexei Oreskovic, Poornima Gupta, Jim Finkle, Yinka Adegoke, Sarah McBride and Alistair Barr; Writing by Sinead Carew; Editing by Tiffany Wu, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's fiscal second-quarter profit fell very slightly as lagging computer sales to cash-strapped consumers in the United States and Europe hurt its core Windows business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies and emerging markets are still hungry for new PCs, according to the latest data, but customers in mature markets are ditching their Windows-powered netbooks in favor of Apple Inc's iPad, Amazon.com Inc's Kindle or postponing a PC purchase until the economy improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's really three things that impacted the consumer side," said Peter Klein, Microsoft's chief financial officer, reflecting on the dip in computer sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The supply chain from Thailand, there's some macro (economic factors) and certainly some competition from alternative form factors such as tablets and readers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech research firm Gartner reported a 1.4 percent decline in global PC sales for the fourth quarter, aggravated by a shortage of hard disk drives caused by recent floods in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft went further, estimating the PC market fell between 2 percent and 4 percent in the quarter, almost entirely due to the collapse in the market for netbooks, the small laptops which accounted for one in 12 PC sales last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Microsoft's key Windows unit reported a 6 percent dip in sales to $4.7 billion. The situation shows no immediate signs of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company warned that the disruptions in Thailand will continue to affect PC sales in the first part of this year, while it has yet to feel the benefit of new lightweight laptops -- dubbed "Ultrabooks" by chipmaker Intel Corp -- which are just starting to hit stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also uncertainty over Windows 8, Microsoft's new, tablet-friendly operating system, which is expected later this year but has no firm arrival date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The PC environment is tough and this is reflected in the results," said Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry. "The question remains, what is going to be the growth catalyst? It's still too early to say whether Windows 8 will be the answer because it won't be released until later this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEATS STREET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the world's largest software company reported net profit of $6.624 billion, or 78 cents per share, compared with $6.634 billion, or 77 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The per share figure rose as Microsoft had fewer shares outstanding in the most recent quarter. It beat Wall Street's average forecast of 76 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 5 percent to $20.9 billion, in line with analysts' forecasts, helped by its Office, server software and Xbox businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure was also boosted by the first inclusion of revenue from Skype, the online phone firm Microsoft bought last year, and a one-time gain of $225 million from favorable foreign currency rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results are pretty much in line with my expectations. We all expected the PC market to be weak and the Windows business was down because of that. But the server and tools business is growing well," said Sunit Gogia, an equity analyst at Morningstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 3 percent after hours to $28.95 after closing at $28.12 on Nasdaq. The shares are level with their price a year ago, compared with a 3 percent gain in the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XBOX, SERVERS GROW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's other major units performed much better than Windows. The Office unit increased sales 3 percent to $6.3 billion, helped by relatively strong business tech spending, which is holding up much better than consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server and tools unit, which provides the software and services behind Microsoft's "cloud" -- or Internet-centric computing platform -- posted an 11 percent rise in sales to $4.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainment and devices unit reported 15 percent higher sales, largely due to booming sales of the Xbox game console, which has been rejuvenated by its hands-free Kinect sensor add-on. Microsoft has yet to see any jump in revenue from the new range of Windows phones made by Nokia and others, which it is now rolling out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's perennially money losing online services unit posted a 10 percent gain in sales, as the Bing search engine grabbed more market share, now taking 15 percent of U.S. Internet searches, just ahead of Yahoo Inc but still well behind market leader Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online unit managed to cut its losses 18 percent in the latest quarter to $458 million, helped by higher advertising sales. But Microsoft has lost more than $5 billion in the unit since it launched Bing in mid-2009, as it invests heavily to catch up with Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Corrects sales growth in entertainment and devices unit in paragraph 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Alistair Barr; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - State Street Corp (STT.N), JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Ameriprise Financial (AMP.N) are among the finalists in the bidding process for Deutsche Bank AG's DBKGN.UL asset management division, according to sources familiar with discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt-based bank said in November that it was considering the sale of many of its global asset management businesses due to new regulation, rising costs and increasing competition expected to weigh on future earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche expects the unit could fetch more than $2.58 billion (2 billion euros), two sources told Reuters last Thursday. [ID:nL6E8CC1RJ] Final bids are due by late February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Ameriprise, State Street and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale would include all of Deutsche's institutional investor business, DB Advisers, its alternative asset business, RREEF, an insurance asset management business; and its DWS Investments mutual fund business in the Americas. DB Advisers has $209 billion in assets under management. The insurance asset management unit has $193 billion and RREEF has $59 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DWS Investments Americas has about $54.15 billion under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the final bidders are expected to bring proposals to buy the asset management units together, sources said it is likely that Deutsche Bank will end up breaking up the businesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and selling them separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They might make more money breaking it up than selling it as a whole," one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Jessica Toonkel in New York; Additional reporting by Philipp Halstrick and Edward Taylor in Frankfurt)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) raised its commodity trading risks by a third in the final quarter of 2011, the only major U.S. bank to sharply raise its exposure to the sector that swung wildly in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other major banks, Goldman Sachs raised its exposure marginally and Morgan Stanley actually lowered its commodities exposure in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts noted that Goldman and Morgan Stanley had turned in bullish price predictions for commodities in 2012, suggesting that they would follow JPMorgan's lead in boosting their exposure to the sector this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd expect the Value at Risk in commodities to kind of increase at these firms from here on, as a natural component of their position," said Oliver Pursche, president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're bullish, you're going to upgrade your exposure and your risk is going to increase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value-at-Risk, or VaR, is a industry parlance for the maximum amount of money a financial institution is willing to lose on a day for trading a particular asset class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Wall Street's giant broker and biggest bank by assets, kept its commodities risk virtually unchanged in the three months to December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS.N) cut back on the money it was willing to lose on oil, metals and crops trading as prices remained treacherous for a second straight quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which transformed its commodities business by buying RBS Sempra in 2010, gaining access to lucrative oil and metals trading in both the physical and futures markets, was the only big financial firm to sharply raise its commodities risk in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three are the world's largest investment banks and commodity trading houses, and analysts said Morgan Stanley and Goldman could take a leaf out of their rival's book based on their higher price estimates for key raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pursche said Goldman had been particularly bullish on oil at a recent strategy meeting he had with the firm, whose stock his company owned. "It echoes a similarly strong position on oil and energy markets which I've heard from Morgan Stanley."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While essentially a function of volatility, VaR is also the only publicly available measure of the risk appetite a bank shows towards a certain market, especially when it doesn't break down numbers for that business -- like in the case of commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's VaR for commodities rose to $26 million in the fourth quarter from $25 million in the third quarter and $23 million from the fourth quarter of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's VaR slid to $28 million from $32 million in the prior quarter. It was $26 million a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported a $20 million commodities VaR for the latest quarter, up 33 percent from the previous three months and 43 percent from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodity markets saw some of their sharpest price swings in the fourth quarter last year. The 19-commodity Thomson Reuters-Jefferies CRB index .CRB, a global benchmark, rose 2.4 percent during the quarter--recovering modestly from sharp declines in two prior quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As prices began declining in the second half of the year, most banks and trading firms cut their forecasts for major commodities such as oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman trimmed its 2012 forecast for London-traded Brent to $120 a barrel from $130, citing financial stress in Europe. Morgan Stanley cut its Brent outlook to $100 from $130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As 2012 dawned, the projections for oil improved, boosted by stronger U.S. economic data and geopolitical tensions and other conditions favorable to energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An end-December poll of global banks by Reuters forecast U.S. crude oil to average $97 per barrel in 2012, up from $96.50 in November. London's Brent crude was expected to average $105.20, down from $107 previously but still above the $100 mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive economic data and geopolitics aside, the outlook for commodities -- and, consequently, risk appetite -- could rise sharply this year if the U.S. Federal Reserve hints at another big round of monetary easing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a $600 billion bond purchase program by the Fed -- dubbed Quantitative Easing 2, or QE2 -- ended in the middle of last year, markets have been yearning for an equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A QE3 would naturally drive commodities, and there'd be strong chances for risk and VaR numbers to rise in such an environment," said Matt McCormick, banking analyst at Bahl &amp; Gaynor in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Barani Krishnan; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAN 19 - IBM Corp, the world's largest technology services company, aims to grow earnings by 10 percent this year after it beat fourth quarter profit estimates, underderscoring signs of confidence in global tech spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We had a strong fourth-quarter performance, capping a year of record earnings per share, revenue, profit and free cash flow," Ginni Rometty, who took over as chief executive on January 1, said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are well on track toward our long-term roadmap for operating earnings per share of at least $20 in 2015."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, IBM plans to increase full year earnings per share, excluding items, by 10.5 percent to at least $14.85 after reporting fourth-quarter profit, excluding items, was $4.71 per share above average expectations of $4.62 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines, a tech bellwether because of its global reach and scale, brought in revenue of $29.5 billion, up from $29.0 billion in the same period last year and just below average estimates of $29.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said its services backlog was $141 billion, up $5 billion adjusting for currency, while signings of services contracts in the fourth quarter were $20.4 billion versus expectations of $20.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors view signings as a key indicator of future profits. But IBM says the focus should be more on total backlog of business because it is a better sign of revenue to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, IBM reported a 3 percent revenue gain in the Americas and 1 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region fell 1 percent adjusted for currency effects, while revenue in the BRIC countries was up 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Forrest, senior analyst for Fort Pitt Capital Group said: "They are bullish for the next quarter, so I am pretty happy as a holder of IBM." She added she was "unbelievably encouraged by their margins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM share were up 2.7 percent at $185.50 in extended trade after closing at $180.52 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software titan Microsoft beat Wall Street expectations with record second quarter revenues of $20.9 billion, a 5 percent increase from the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We delivered solid financial results, even as we prepare for a launch year that will accelerate many of our key products and services,&#8221; said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, in a statement. &#8220;Coming out of the Consumer Electronics Show, we&#8217;re seeing very positive reviews for our new phones and PCs, and a strong response to our new Metro style design that will unify consumer experiences across our phones, PCs, tablets, and television in 2012.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Q2 2012, Microsoft&#8217;s operating income was $7.99 billion compared to $8.17 billion in the year-before quarter. Net income was virtually unchanged at $6.62 billion versus $6.63 billion in the year-before quarter. Diluted earnings per share amounted to $.78 per share against $.77 per share a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company barely beat Wall Street&#8217;s revenue estimates, as some analysts were expecting earnings of $.76 per share. Microsoft beat that by two pennies per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Business Division had an especially strong quarter with $6.28 billion in revenue, a 3 percent increase from the prior-year period. The company was fueled by sales of Microsoft Office 2010 licences, of which it has sold about 200 million since its launch 18 month ago. Revenue generated from SharePoint and Exchange also grew by 10 percent (or more) versus the year-before quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that strong business-focused performance, Microsoft&#8217;s Server &amp; Tools category posted $4.77 billion in second quarter revenue, an 11% increase from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We saw strong demand for our business products and services, despite the soft PC market and continuing economic uncertainty in key parts of the world,&#8221; said Peter Klein, chief financial officer at Microsoft, in a statement. &#8220;We delivered record earnings per share by continuing to manage our costs while investing for future growth.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s only major drop in revenues by division appeared in its Windows/Windows Live Division with revenue of $4.74 billion, a 6 percent decline from the year-before period. The Online Services Division reported revenue of $784 million, a 10 percent increase from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Microsoft&#8217;s Entertainment &amp; Devices Division posted revenue of $4.24 billion, an increase of 15 percent from the year before. That highlights the success of its Xbox 360 game console and the motion-controlled Kinect sensor. Microsoft has sold 66 million Xbox 360 consoles and 18 million Kinect sensors to date. And the Xbox Live service now has 40 million members, a massive increase of 33 percent from the prior-year period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: deals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Google Inc's quarterly results fell short of Wall Street's heightened expectations for the crucial holiday-shopping period, wiping almost 10 percent off its shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet giant leads results from some of the technology sector's largest corporations on Thursday, including International Business Machines, Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sector bellwether IBM rode a 3-percent share-gain after its own results beat targets. Intel's first-quarter forecast was in line with expectations, relieving some investors who had feared the chipmaker would pare back its guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft offset weakness in its Windows business -- the result of poor PC sales -- with strengthing server and tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commentary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE INC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM FORREST, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google got hit with the ugly stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm surprised at the level by which they missed both on revenue and earnings.

Q4 is typically their time to shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Click pricing was down. It declined 8 percent, we were expecting it be up 3 percent, and this is due to the economy.

They are pretty big numbers, as is the amount of spending and depreciation. So they clearly see a very large opportunity for sales. You have to think that they think unit growth can be high single-digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last quarter they underestimated the flood impact.

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered the streamlining of applications for foreign tourist visas to the United States, focused on increasingly affluent Chinese and Brazilian visitors, in an effort to boost tourism and create jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama announced the modest package of reforms at the Disney World theme park in Florida, a state whose economy is heavily dependent on the tourist industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state, closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, will be a crucial battleground in November, when Obama faces a re-election vote that may hinge on Americans' perceptions of his handling of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American tourism industry and business groups have long advocated an easing of visa restrictions that were tightened in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing on "Main Street" in Disney's Magic Kingdom with Cinderella's castle in the background, Obama said he was making the visa changes to try to help spur American job growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want America to be the top tourist destination in the world," Obama said. "The more folks who visit America, the more Americans we get back to work. It is that simple."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He joked that the visit to Disney World was one of the rare instances that his daughters, Sasha and Malia, envied him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe, for once, they will actually ask me at dinner how my day went," Obama said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visa changes were the latest measures rolled out by Obama to show voters he is serious about boosting the still-sluggish labor market and will act on his own whenever possible in the face of election-year gridlock in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama said the new steps would help cut through red tape and make it easier for foreign tourists to come to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House estimated that more than 1 million U.S. jobs could be created in the next decade if the country increased its share of the international travel market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign visitors generated $134 billion in 2010, making it the largest U.S. service export industry, the Commerce Department said. The number of tourists from emerging economies with growing middle classes like China, Brazil and India is projected to grow sharply in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the steps announced on Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* An order for the government to increase non-immigrant visa processing capacity in China and Brazil by 40 percent in 2012, ensuring that 80 percent of applicants are interviewed within three weeks and expanding visa waiver programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* A pilot program to simplify and speed the visa process for applicants from China and Brazil, including the ability to waive interviews for low-risk applicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Addition of Taiwan to the list of so-called visa-waiver countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Creation of an interagency task force to develop recommendations for expanding international tourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Spetalnick and Caren Bohan; Editing by Will Dunham)&lt;/p&gt;

      IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced fourth-quarter 2011 diluted earnings of 
      $4.62 per share, compared with diluted earnings of $4.18 per share in 
      the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 11 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $4.71 per share, compared with 
      operating diluted earnings of $4.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 
      2010, an increase of 11 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fourth-quarter net income was $5.5 billion compared with $5.3 billion in 
      the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 4 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) net income was $5.6 billion compared with $5.4 billion in the 
      fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 5 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $29.5 billion increased 
      2 percent (1 percent, adjusting for currency) from the fourth quarter of 
      2010. While currency provided a benefit to revenue growth of 
      approximately 25 basis points in the quarter, currency movements since 
      the company announced its third-quarter earnings in October impacted 
      fourth-quarter revenue by approximately one point of growth, or $300 
      million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We had a strong fourth-quarter performance, capping a year of record 
      earnings per share, revenue, profit and free cash flow," said Ginni 
      Rometty, IBM president and chief executive officer. "We delivered 
      outstanding results in all four of our strategic initiatives for the 
      quarter and the year, as we continued to realize the benefit of our 
      long-term investments in growth markets, business analytics, Smarter 
      Planet solutions and cloud. We are well on track toward our long-term 
      roadmap for operating earnings per share of at least $20 in 2015.&#8221;

      Fourth-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.09 per 
      share of net charges: $0.10 per share for the amortization of purchased 
      intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, offset by 
      ($0.01) per share for retirement-related items driven by changes to plan 
      assets and liabilities primarily related to market performance.

      share of at least $14.16; and operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share of 
      at least $14.85. The 2012 operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude $0.69 
      per share of charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets,

    &lt;/p&gt;

      IBM ended 2011 with $11.9 billion of cash on hand and generated free 
      cash flow of $16.6 billion excluding Global Financing receivables, up 
      approximately $300 million year over year. The company returned $18.5 
      billion to shareholders through $3.5 billion in dividends and $15.0 
      billion of share repurchases. The balance sheet remains strong, and the 
      company is well positioned to support the business over the long term.

      Presentation of Information in this Press Release
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding 
      the company&#8217;s results as determined by generally accepted accounting 
      principles (GAAP), the company has also disclosed in this press release 
      the following non-GAAP information which management believes provides 
      useful information to investors:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM results and expectations &#8211;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        presenting operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share amounts and related 
        income statement items;
      
			
        presenting non-global financing debt-to-capitalization ratio;
      
			
        adjusting for free cash flow;
      
			
        adjusting for currency (i.e., at constant currency).
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rationale for management&#8217;s use of non-GAAP measures is included as 
      part of the supplementary materials presented within the fourth-quarter 
      earnings materials. These materials are available on the IBM investor 
      relations Web site at www.ibm.com/investor 
      and are being included in Attachment II (&#8220;Non-GAAP Supplementary

			NRF Welcomes Obama Plan to Boost Tourism, Reduce Visa Delays
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The National Retail Federation welcomed President Obama&#8217;s expected 
      announcement today of plans to boost travel and tourism, saying efforts 
      to process visa applications more quickly will help U.S. stores make 
      more sales to foreign tourists and business travelers who want to come 
      here to shop.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In a global economy, importing customers is a key component in the 
      balance of trade,&#8221; NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said. &#8220;Speeding up 
      the visa process is one of the quickest ways to boost the U.S. economy. 
      There are millions of citizens of nations with growing economies who 
      want to come to the United States to shop for brands that are known 
      around the world. We shouldn&#8217;t let long lines at U.S. embassies and 
      consulates make them decide to take their shopping dollars elsewhere.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Obama is scheduled to outline his plans during an appearance today at 
      the Disney World amusement park in Orlando. The announcement comes two 
      days after the President&#8217;s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness issued a 
      report that included faster processing of visa applications among its 
      wide-ranging recommendations on how to boost job creation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NRF has spent much of the past year encouraging Congress and the 
      Administration to find ways to reduce visa delays. NRF joined the 
      Discover America Partnership visa reform coalition last spring and 
      rallied retailers&#8217; support for legislation in both the House and Senate. 
      Shay raised the issue with officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing 
      during a visit to China in October, and visa reform is a key component 
      of NRF&#8217;s Retail Means Jobs campaign.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Those efforts helped convince Congress to include language requiring the 
      State Department to add additional staff and other resources to reduce 
      the wait time for visa interviews at embassies and consulates in China, 
      India and Brazil in a $1 trillion omnibus spending bill signed into law 
      in December. A time limit was not specified, but the language was 
      similar to earlier legislation that set a 30-day limit. Applicants 
      currently wait 120 days or more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      NRF has led the retail industry&#8217;s fight on the issue because newly 
      affluent citizens from emerging economies like China and India often 
      spend lavishly while in the United States and are highly valued as 
      customers by U.S. retailers. A recent U.S. Travel Association studies 
      found that reducing visa waits to 10 days could create 1.3 million more 
      U.S. jobs and add more than $850 billion to the U.S. economy by 2020.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - In late October, as MF Global Holdings Ltd teetered toward bankruptcy, Jon Corzine phoned his close-knit circle of Wall Street friends for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His firm, facing demands from customers and other firms for cash, needed to sell billions of dollars in securities to raise the money. As the week progressed, MF Global executives came to believe that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., one of MF Global's primary bankers and a middleman moving that cash, was dragging its feet in forwarding the funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corzine phoned Barry Zubrow, then JPMorgan's chief risk officer, to question the slow payments. Corzine also called William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to update him on MF Global's status and told him that payments were slow to arrive from JPMorgan and others. Dudley said he'd monitor the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delays contributed to a serious cash shortage at MF Global, according to people familiar with the matter. These people say the firm started trading one day in late October with $600 million in cash and spent the whole day selling securities, only to end with just $200 million in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adhering to procedure and not cutting MF Global any slack, these people say, JPMorgan was able to slow the delivery of funds, worsening MF Global's distress. As a result, they note, hundreds of millions of dollars of MF Global money may be still stuck in accounts at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of MF Global's trading, based on court documents and multiple interviews with people familiar with the situation, shed light on what could have happened to more than $600 million in customer funds at MF Global, which are still being sought by regulators nearly three months after the firm filed for bankruptcy protection on October 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early sign that money was missing came as auditors from the CME Group Inc., which audited MF Global, combed through the company's books in Chicago and New York, according to congressional testimony by CME executive chairman Terrence Duffy. After MF Global reported a quarterly loss on October 25, the CME had dispatched two auditors to the Chicago office to review customer accounts on October 27 - the first of several confusing days as auditors and regulators, working in Chicago and New York, tried to understand whether funds were intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement last week , a JPMorgan spokeswoman said, "Our firm lost money because of MFG's failure, and we are cooperating with the regulators with full transparency to assist their investigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a spokesman, Corzine declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, regulators have made no allegation of wrongdoing against JPMorgan, and there is no evidence that JPMorgan did anything improper. Indeed, it seems to have been simply following banking procedure, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futures trading firms and brokers like MF Global are heavily dependent on borrowing, which then exposes the big banks that lend to them was well as their trades. That gives banks like JPMorgan the ability to protect themselves in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transactions that JPMorgan handled are drawing increased scrutiny from regulators, a bankruptcy trustee and MF Global because understanding MF Global's money flow could aid in identifying customer money flows, according to people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They made things that are in normal times quite plain vanilla, easy things to do very difficult to do," said a person involved in MF Global's struggle, referring to JPMorgan. "What normally works well was taking forever because JPMorgan was dotting every 'i' and crossing every 't,' and they were holding on to as much money as they possibly could under the law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMORGAN'S DUAL ROLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role that JPMorgan played as both a lender and middleman to MF Global illustrates the procedures banks can deploy to protect their own interests when dealing with weaker counterparties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one side of its ledger, JPMorgan and a syndicate of banks had lent MF Global $1.3 billion in its final week through a loan commitment the firm could draw down at any time. JPMorgan also was a primary banker for MF Global, a role that gave it significant insight into, and control over, MF Global's accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side, JPMorgan was clearing some of the asset sales MF Global was making. In this role, its job was to take the securities from MF Global and the cash from the buyer and pass them along to the other party when the deal was complete .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally such trades can settle within a day or two, if the back-office mechanics function smoothly. But that week, the money didn't arrive when MF Global executives expected, according to people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, a major lender to rival firms as well as one of Wall Street's biggest middlemen in settling trades, has previously drawn scrutiny for protecting its own interests when rival firms ran aground. In 2008, a week before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sought bankruptcy protection, JPMorgan demanded collateral to protect its role as counterparty to Lehman. While the request was not improper, Lehman's bankruptcy estate later claimed Lehman posted the collateral because JPMorgan had threatened to withhold funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Congressional panel that looked at the 2008 crisis, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, investigated the events surrounding Lehman's fall in a 2011 report. A JPMorgan official told the FCIC that the bank didn't believe "the request put undue pressure on Lehman," the report said. The FCIC didn't draw a conclusion about the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLOW ON THE TRADE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Corzine took the helm in 2010, MF Global was a little-known boutique futures trading firm. Corzine, who joined Goldman Sachs as a bond trader in 1975 and ultimately became chairman, also was a former U.S. Senator and former governor of New Jersey. He brought star power to the CEO role, and sought to increase MF Global's profits. Among his trades was a series of purchases of deeply discounted European government debt. European Union leaders, he reasoned, would never allow the countries to default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, MF Global said the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority had required the firm to bolster its capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, October 24, things took a turn for the worse when Moody's Investors Service downgraded MF Global's credit rating to one level above junk. A day later, MF Global reported its largest-ever quarterly loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Wednesday, October 26, customers were demanding millions of dollars from accounts held at MF Global. To meet the sudden outflow, MF Global during the week of October 24 tapped the $1.3 billion loan commitment from a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MF Global also decided to sell $1.3 billion of IOUs known as commercial paper. The short-term debt was part of some $7 billion of securities the firm sold that week. But this sale was critical, people familiar with the situation said, because MF Global had used customer funds to invest in the short-term debt and now badly needed to liquidate the IOUs and move cash into the customer accounts to meet their demands. The investments in the IOUs were allowed by industry regulations, these people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For help, Corzine turned to his old employer, Goldman Sachs, which specializes in trading the short-term paper. Corzine phoned Goldman President Gary Cohn to ask him to buy the IOUs, offering a slight discount, according to people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn agreed, and Goldman traders made the purchases, these people said. Because it needed the cash immediately, MF Global sought to settle the deal that day, according to Corzine's testimony in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, in its role as middleman, was able to control the speed with which MF Global's asset sales were processed, according to people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people familiar with the transaction say that JPMorgan was slow to process the trade. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said the bank was not able to confirm the information about that specific trade. It remains unclear exactly whether cash from the sale was ultimately routed to MF Global.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday October 27, Moody's downgraded MF Global again, this time to junk. At that point, "we were finished," said a former employee in MF Global's New York office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While MF Global waited for the funds from JPMorgan, it frenetically tried to avoid a second cash demand generated by the second Moody's downgrade. The downgrade sparked margin calls from trading partners. The New York Fed at one point issued its own margin calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet those demands, MF Global on October 28 undertook yet another set of asset sales totaling $4.5 billion. It sold the securities to JPMorgan, yet the bank was slow to settle this trade as well, according to people familiar with the situation. JPMorgan declined to confirm whether it bought the securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOST CONFIDENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thread regulators are now examining is how MF Global got hold of enough funds to cover an overdrawn account at JPMorgan. Corzine told a congressional panel that during the morning of October 28, "I was trying to sell billions of dollars of securities to JPMorgan Chase in order to reduce our balance sheet and generate liquidity. JPMorgan Chase told me that they would not engage in those transactions until overdrafts in London were cleaned up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clear that hurdle, Corzine contacted MF Global's back office in Chicago and told them to resolve the problem-ostensibly by routing money to JPMorgan. JPMorgan then asked whether a transfer of funds violated industry regulations. Corzine said that the Chicago office "explicitly confirmed to me that the funds were properly transferred." Corzine said he assumed JPMorgan signed off because the bank then executed billions of dollars in trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People familiar with JPMorgan say that the bank had to contend with numerous issues in assisting MF Global with the asset sales, including the fact that some MF Global assets couldn't immediately be sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As MF Global tried to complete the sales, MF Global officials and regulators, who were trying to untangle customer accounts in Chicago and New York, discovered a shortfall of cash in the customer accounts -- including those that had once held MF Global's commercial paper holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite our best efforts to sell assets and generate liquidity, the marketplace lost confidence in the firm," Corzine said at a congressional hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may appear that records for the trades would be clear, regulators say they have been stymied in tracing the money flowing to and from MF Global.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are circuitous money trails," said Bart Chilton, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the agencies probing MF Global. "They are not simple linear transactions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were an extraordinary number of transactions during MF Global's last few days and I do not know, for example, whether there were operational errors at MF Global&#65533;or whether banks and counterparties have held onto funds that should rightfully have been returned to MF Global," Corzine told a congressional panel in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concern for a clearing bank like JPMorgan is over exposure when it is extending a lot of credit, according to Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, as a clearing bank, has the ability to take some actions to protect itself, but the bank "is going to undergo a lot of scrutiny," Pirrong said. "Any action it takes to reduce its exposure comes into question when a bankruptcy is involved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"STOCK WAS TOAST"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MF Global, during the weekend before it filed bankruptcy proceedings, made one final push to sell more assets. In London, it tried to sell off short-term European bonds, according to one trader at a London bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by then, MF Global had run out of time, this trader said. Tagged with a junk credit rating and unable to meet margin calls, the firm could no longer effectively function in the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's stock, which hit $7.74 at the end of June, fell from $3.87 at the beginning of October to $1.20 on October 28, its final day of trading before it filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their stock was toast," the trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What remains unclear is whether JPMorgan held on to the funds, and where the funds are now. People familiar with the situation suggest that the funds are still at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators and the bankruptcy trustee have not said. They say they are still trying to verify which customer accounts may have been tapped for funds during MF Global's final hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting Paritosh Bansal; Editing by Alwyn Scott and Edward Tobin)&lt;/p&gt;

announced a strategic alliance with Microsoft Corp., a worldwide leader
in software, services and solutions, whereby Geminare will deliver its
award-winning RaaS Solution Suite through the Windows Azure cloud from
Microsoft. 

    Geminare enables the transition of premises-based software to
cloud-enabled solutions through its patented Cloud CORE Platform, a
proven, mature, multi-tiered service delivery vehicle that is the
foundation of Geminare's entire RaaS data protection suite. Beginning
with a scheduled 2012 release of its Cloud Storage Assurance (CSA) email
and file archiving service, Geminare will provide access to its RaaS data
protection suite within the Windows Azure Marketplace, rendering it
widely available through the extensive Microsoft Partner Network
community.

addition to the Windows Azure partner community," said Walid Abu-Hadba,
Corporate Vice President, Developer and Platform Evangelism, at Microsoft

(RaaS), to support IT operations recovery, up from just over 1 percent
today." 

    John Morency, Gartner's Research Vice President covering the management
of disaster recovery and IT resiliency, stated, "RaaS has been hailed as
a 'killer' app for DR in the Cloud, but the true 'killer' app stems from
rapidly enabling the global partner community to provide RaaS solutions
to their customers, easily and efficiently." Morency added, "The Geminare
and Microsoft Strategic Alliance does just that. Geminare's RaaS
portfolio delivered from the Windows Azure cloud eliminates the barriers
to entry to the emerging RaaS market for resellers worldwide, setting the
stage for the explosive growth we project." 

    Joshua Geist, Geminare's CEO, said, "Geminare is ecstatic to have been
chosen by Microsoft for Recovery as a Service enablement on the Windows
Azure cloud. There is no better cloud provider than Microsoft to optimize
the power of RaaS through its comprehensive cloud strategy, massive
partner network and best-in-class technology and market experience."
Geist added, "This alliance delivers the foundation through which RaaS
can scale to the market penetration levels projected by Gartner and
beyond." Geist further added, "The public cloud marketplace has exploded
virtually overnight, offering businesses the choice of low-cost compute
and storage services never before seen in the industry and signalling a
shift in the underlying requirements for the delivery and support
infrastructure." Geist continued, "However, in order for businesses to
truly capitalize on this evolution, there is a need for access to a wide
range of applications and services which provide businesses with direct
support and functionality."

    Geminare's Recovery as a Service Suite will be delivered through the
global Windows Azure marketplace as a highlighted solution and will allow
OEM channel partners to offer Windows Azure-backed RaaS solutions

			Satyr-3 marks Chevron&#8217;s thirteenth offshore discovery in Western 
      Australia since mid-2009
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) today announced a natural gas discovery by its

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      gas pay. The well is located 113 miles (182 kilometers) north of Exmouth 
      in the WA-374-P permit area, and was
			drilled&#160;in 3,688 feet 
      (1,124 meters) of water to a depth of 13,369 feet (4,075 meters).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron Corporation, said, &#8220;Satyr-3 
      represents our thirteenth offshore discovery in Australia since 
      mid-2009. This recent discovery reinforces the quality and value of our 
      Australian exploration lease holdings in the Carnarvon Basin.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Melody Meyer, president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production 
      Company, said, &#8220;The Satyr-3 discovery adds to our Australian resource 
      base, further supporting our long-term plans to position Chevron as one 
      of the world's leading LNG suppliers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      area and holds a 50 percent interest, with Exxon Mobil and Shell each 
      holding 25 percent.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Jan 19 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase 
named Jeff Zajkowski as head of Asia Pacific equity capital
markets, as the U.S. bank looks to expand into one of the
fastest-growing capital markets, a source with direct knowledge
of the move told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zajkowski, who previously headed equity-linked origination
for the Americas, moved to Hong Kong from New York this month,
said the source, who could not speak publicly on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He takes over the position from Kester Ng and Doug Howland,
who shared the post as co-heads of equity capital markets for
Asia Pacific, the source said. Ng and Howland will report to
Zajkowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ng will become chairman of Asia ECM and focus on winning
more business in China. Howland will retain his post as head of
capital markets origination for Japan, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief Executive Bob Iger's compensation rose 13 percent in fiscal 2011, boosted by an increase in his annual cash bonus and incentive plan, according to a company filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, 60, who has run Disney since October 2005, saw his total compensation including pension benefits top $33.4 million in the 12 months to September 2011, when the company's financial year ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which generates some $40 billion in annual revenue, is grappling with global economic uncertainty and its impact on its three largest divisions: media, its movie studio and theme park resorts. Its various brands include Disney, ABC and ESPN among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger will take on the additional title of chairman in March at Disney's annual shareholder meeting. He is expected to step down as CEO in March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the company has not mentioned possible successors, industry speculation has centered on Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and the head of Disney's huge theme parks and resorts division Tom Staggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasulo was paid a total of $11.1 million in fiscal 2011, an increase of just over 5 percent from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Yinka Adegoke; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - While IBM's rivals have suffered through earnings misses, massive executive upheaval or seismic strategic shifts, Big Blue has been the technology world's most consistently performing company since narrowly avoiding bankruptcy 19 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, IBM lacks an obvious wow factor. Indeed, the company is to the technology world what vanilla is to ice cream: plain. But in the business world, plain is simply another word for dependable, and IBM has grown into one of the few companies analysts and investors can count on to deliver on its promises each quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With IBM, once they lay out a strategy, they stick to it, they don't tend to shift direction," Chris Ambrose, an analyst at research firm Gartner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi, commitment, consistency and a predictable flow of revenue are the ingredients of IBM's secret sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They derive about 90 percent of their profits from services and software ... that tends to be higher margin and has recurrent revenue streams," Seyrafi said. "They have been able to execute well on the bottom line and that includes share buybacks ... even if they are not growing top line that well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's reliability over the years is even more remarkable when juxtaposed against the problems plaguing some its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software maker Oracle, for instance, shocked investors last month with a rare quarterly miss. Oracle, like IBM, benefits from steady and predictable long-term contracts, leaving investors to question its powers of execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canaccord analyst Richard Davis said that much of the miss was company-specific "because some buyers waited for a new hardware upgrade, and on the software front the firm is behind the curve in cloud applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM rival Hewlett Packard has been flip-flopping on its PC strategy and is vulnerable to the decline of PC shipments. It also has a larger exposure to Europe than IBM, which has squarely set its sights on emerging growth markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM has effectively used acquisitions to gain footholds in strategic end markets, broaden its customer footprint and improve growth," ISI group analyst Brian Marshall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has also managed to avoid the executive-suite turmoil that has gripped HP, which has fired three CEOs in a row. By contrast, IBM without fanfare or drama late last year named Ginny Rometty as new CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consistent execution has become a hallmark of IBM management and we saw no signs of disruption as former CEO Sam Palmisano passed on the reigns to longtime IBM veteran Ginni Rometty," Marshall said, adding that IBM was as automatic as the mailman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another giant in the tech sector, Cisco, moved too aggressively into consumer products, neglecting its core strengths. Now, that company is at pains to prove to investors that it can return to its former glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FACED THE ABYSS AND CAME BACK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, founded in June 1911, is best known for its mainframe and personal computers but it also made coffee grinders, typewriters and invented the magnetic stripe technology used on the back of credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1993, the company, based in Armonk, New York, had turned into a bloated fragmented organization that was bleeding money as smaller, more nimble competitors took away its business. IBM nearly went out of business before embarking on a gut-wrenching turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a bold strategic move, IBM first bought PriceWaterhouse's consulting. Next, the company decided in 2004 to exit the PC business, betting that its future was in finding solutions to business problems with the help of software and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is currently in the second year of a five-year strategic plan that began in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of the plan is to focus on what IBM perceives as growth areas - data analytics; "smarter planet," or making things like traffic, power grids or food production work better; cloud computing; and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also plans to deliver earnings of $20 per share by 2015. This year it aims to reach at least $14.85 despite ongoing macro-economic concerns in Europe and expected currency headwinds. Its earnings in 2011 were $13.44 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Gartner's Ambrose, IBM does not sell products so much as offer software, technology and services that solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The portfolio of services that IBM offers - unlike General Electric, for example - is focused on one area, the IT sector.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/QUITO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has filed an appeal with Ecuador's Supreme Court to review a judgment that the U.S. oil company pay $18 billion in damages for polluting the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorian judge ordered the U.S. major to pay the damages after a fraught legal battle that has lasted nearly two decades and looks like it will run even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California oil company inherited the case when it bought Texaco a decade ago. Its appeal on Friday argued that the lower courts violated Ecuador's constitution by refusing to take corrective action in response to what Chevron calls "extensive fraud and corruption" committed by the plaintiffs' lawyers and representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said the original judgment, delivered last February by an Ecuadorian court in the jungle city of Lago Agrio, was based on faulty evidence and retroactive application of a law, while ignoring releases of liability granted to Texaco by Ecuador in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's appeal gives (the Supreme Court) an opportunity to correct the grave injustices that have occurred in this case," Hewitt Pate, Chevron's general counsel, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is being watched closely by the oil industry for precedents that could influence other claims against companies accused of pollution in the countries where they operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs have responded to the accusations by citing Chevron's own test data in documenting the pollution and arguing that Ecuador's release for Texaco did not prevent third parties from suing for damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related litigation in New York, the plaintiffs also accuse the company of mishandling soil and water samples during the Lago Agrio trial by maintaining two different laboratories, based on testimony from a Chevron expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the appeal in Ecuador, Chevron asked that it not be required to post a bond to prevent enforcement of the judgment during the appeal process, arguing that such a payment would violate Ecuador's obligations under an order issued last February by an international arbitration tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pablo Fajardo, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the next step would be to see whether the Lago Agrio appeals court requires Chevron to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it asks (Chevron) to pay a bond, and if it pays the bond, then only the bond can stop us from carrying out the sentence," Fajardo told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if the plaintiffs were looking at any country in particular where it could seek to collect the damages, he said they would first await the decision on the bond. "We haven't done anything, we don't have any plans yet," Fajardo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron no longer has assets in Ecuador, so questions surround the enforcement of the original ruling. A lawyer for the company accused the plaintiffs last May of planning to seek enforcement in countries hostile to Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire case may be reheard far from both Ecuador and the United States. The arbitration tribunal in The Hague, operating under a U.S.-Ecuador treaty, ordered Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend enforcement of the Lago Agrio judgment until the arbitrators have their say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tribunal is expected to rule any day on the question of whether or not it has jurisdiction in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco, Swetha Gopinath in Bangalore and Eduardo Garcia in Quito; editing by Andre Grenon, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) anunci&#243; hoy que ha presentado un recurso 
      de casaci&#243;n buscando que la Corte Nacional de Justicia del Ecuador 
      revise la sentencia de segunda instancia emitida contra la compa&#241;&#237;a a 
      principios del 2012 por un panel de tres jueces temporales en la demanda 
      ambiental en Ecuador.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      El recurso de casaci&#243;n detalla los m&#250;ltiples fundamentos legales para 
      revertir la decisi&#243;n tomada por la corte de segunda instancia en enero. 
      El recurso de Chevron establece que las cortes de instancias inferiores 
      violaron la constituci&#243;n ecuatoriana al rehusar tomar cualquier acci&#243;n 
      correctiva en respuesta del amplio fraude y corrupci&#243;n cometidos por los 
      abogados de los demandantes y sus representantes. El recurso contiene 
      varios puntos adicionales, incluyendo: que la sentencia de la corte 
      inferior se fundamenta ileg&#237;timamente en evidencia fraudulenta y sin 
      fundamento cient&#237;fico; que la sentencia se basa ilegalmente en la

      injusticias, en lugar de corregirlas&#8221;, dijo Hewitt Pate, vicepresidente 
      y consejero general de Chevron. &#8220;El pedido de casaci&#243;n realizado el d&#237;a 
      de hoy le da a la Corte Nacional de Justicia una oportunidad para

      En el proceso de arbitraje promovido por Chevron en contra del Ecuado, 
      en la Corte de La Haya bajo el Tratado Bilateral de Inversiones entre 
      Ecuador y Estados Unidos, el tribunal emiti&#243; una orden el 9 de febrero 
      de 2011 requiriendo que Ecuador tome todas las medidas a su alcance para 
      detener la ejecuci&#243;n de la sentencia de Lago Agrio hasta nuevo aviso de 
      ese tribunal. El tribunal tambi&#233;n se&#241;al&#243; que si se estableciera que 
      cualquier sentencia de una corte ecuatoriana en el caso de Lago Agrio 
      violara una obligaci&#243;n del Ecuador con Chevron de acuerdo al derecho 
      internacional, entonces el Ecuador podr&#237;a ser responsable de cualquier

      Tribunal, incluyendo la suspensi&#243;n de cualquier requerimiento de que 
      Chevron deposite una garant&#237;a para prevenir que se ejecute la sentencia

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/QUITO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has filed an appeal with Ecuador's National Court of Justice to review a judgment that the U.S. oil company pay $18 billion in damages for polluting the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 20 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has filed an
appeal with Ecuador's National Court of Justice to review a
judgment that the U.S. oil company pay $18 billion in damages
for polluting the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron was ordered by an Ecuadorian judge to pay the

Ecuador's constitution by refusing to take corrective action in
response to what Chevron calls "extensive fraud and corruption"
committed by the plaintiffs' lawyers and representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said the original judgment, delivered last February
by a lower Ecuadorian court in Lago Agrio, was based on faulty
evidence and retroactive application of a law, while ignoring
releases of liability granted to Texaco by Ecuador in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's appeal gives the National Court of Justice an
opportunity to correct the grave injustices that have occurred
in this case," Hewitt Pate, Chevron's general counsel, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs respond to the accusations by citing Chevron's
own test data in documenting the pollution and arguing that
Ecuador's release for Texaco did not prevent third parties from
suing for damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related litigation in New York, the plaintiffs also
accuse Chevron of mishandling soil and water samples during the
Lago Agrio trial by maintaining two different laboratories,
based on testimony from a Chevron expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the entire case may be reheard far from both Ecuador and
the United States. An arbitration tribunal in The Hague last
February ordered Ecuador, under a U.S.-Ecuador treaty, to take
all measures at its disposal to suspend enforcement of the Lago
Agrio judgment until further order from the arbitrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tribunal is expected to rule soon on the question of
whether or not it has jurisdiction in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has asked that it not be required to post a bond to
prevent enforcement of the judgment during the appeal in
Ecuador, since such a bond would violate Ecuador's international
obligations under the tribunal's order.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Donald Mullen, a senior bond executive at Goldman Sachs (GS.N) who oversaw controversial subprime mortgage trades leading up to the financial crisis, has retired, according to an internal memo distributed on Friday and obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His is the latest in a string of high-profile departures from the Wall Street bank, which has been struggling to maintain profits by cutting staff and bonuses in a weak business environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mullen, a veteran bond trader who was most recently head of the credit and mortgage business inside Goldman's securities division, joined the bank as a partner in July 2001 to head leveraged finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He previously held senior positions at Bear Stearns, Salomon Brothers, Drexel Burnham Lambert and First Boston and leaves Goldman as a member of several influential internal groups, including the management committee and firmwide risk committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo, which was signed by Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a senior mortgage executive at Goldman, Mullen was actively engaged in derivative trades that became known as "the big short." Goldman constructed those collateralized debt obligations in 2007 to profit from declines in the value of subprime mortgage bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mullen was one of a handful of senior Goldman executives whose emails were publicly released by a Senate committee that investigated Goldman's actions leading up to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sounds like we will make some serious money," Mullen said when a ratings agency downgraded a group of mortgage-backed securities Goldman was betting against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such trades allowed Goldman to avoid major losses from the collapse of the mortgage market, but also brought much public scrutiny after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman of fraud related to one of its subprime CDOs. The bank paid $550 million to settle the charges in 2010 without admitting or denying wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of top Goldman executives have departed over the last year, as Wall Street faces difficult market conditions and new financial reform regulations that have already started to curb profitability. Last week, two co-heads of the securities division that housed Mullen's group also stepped down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman 2011 earnings of $2.5 billion were the weakest since 2008 and down 47 percent from the previous year. In response, the bank cut its payroll by 2,400 employees, or 7 percent, and reduced compensation expenses by 21 percent. The average Goldman employee received $367,057 in 2011, down from $430,700 the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mullen's retirement announcement came the day after Goldman employees were informed of their 2011 bonuses, and few were spared from the bank's newfound frugality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some employees in weak-performing areas received no bonus at all, according to one source in the bank's fixed-income trading division. Compensation consultants have estimated that senior Wall Street executives, particularly in fixed-income divisions, were sure to see bonus cuts of 30 percent or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mullen's departure may also reflect a change in the type of businesses that will drive earnings for Wall Street banks going forward. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which also reported muted 2011 profitability this week, has cut staff from divisions that will be treated less favorably under new capital regulations, such as subprime debt securitization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call with analysts to discuss Goldman's results on Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the recent string of high-profile departures have occurred because senior executives stayed longer than usual to help Goldman cope with the financial crisis and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Through both what I would call a financial crisis and reputational issues, the senior people at Goldman Sachs did not leave," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The normal tenure of a Goldman partner is about eight years, Viniar said, with 15 to 20 percent of partners retiring bi-annually to make room for new arrivals. But there was "far less" turnover during the past four years, Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lauren Tara LaCapra; Additional reporting by Katya Wachtel; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Appeals Illegitimate Ruling in Ecuador

		&lt;p&gt;
			Filing Asks National Court of Justice to Review and Overturn 
      Appellate Judgment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that it has filed an 
      appeal seeking review by Ecuador&#8217;s National Court of Justice of the 
      adverse appellate judgment issued against the company in early 2012 by a 
      panel of three temporary judges in the environmental lawsuit in Ecuador.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s appeal, called a petition for cassation, details multiple 
      legal grounds for reversal of the January appellate court decision. The 
      appeal establishes that the lower courts violated the Ecuadorian 
      constitution by refusing to take any corrective action in response to 
      the extensive fraud and corruption committed by plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers and 
      their representatives. The filing goes on to outline several other 
      fundamental points, including: that the lower court&#8217;s judgment is 
      unlawfully premised on fraudulent and scientifically baseless evidence; 
      that the judgment is illegally based upon the retroactive application of 
      law; that it ignores the releases of liability granted to Texaco 
      Petroleum Co. (Tex Pet) by the government of Ecuador following a cleanup 
      of Tex Pet&#8217;s share of remediation sites in the 1990s; and that the 
      judgment awarded punitive and other damages never requested in 
      plaintiffs&#8217; complaint and not allowed under Ecuadorian law.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Throughout the course of this litigation, judges corruptly operating in 
      concert with the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers have created, rather than 
      corrected, injustice,&#8221; said Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice president and 
      general counsel. &#8220;Today&#8217;s appeal gives the National Court of Justice an 
      opportunity to correct the grave injustices that have occurred in this 
      case.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the cassation appeal filing today, Chevron continues to 
      seek recourse through legal proceedings outside of Ecuador. In the 
      arbitration proceedings Chevron instituted against Ecuador in The Hague 
      under the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), the Tribunal 
      issued an order on February 9, 2011, requiring Ecuador to take all 
      measures at its disposal to suspend enforcement of the Lago Agrio 
      judgment until further order of the Tribunal. The Tribunal also recorded 
      that if it were established that any judgment made by an Ecuadorian 
      court in the Lago Agrio case was a breach of an obligation Ecuador owed 
      to Chevron as a matter of international law, any loss arising from the 
      enforcement of such judgment (within and without Ecuador) may be losses 
      for which Ecuador would be responsible to Chevron under international 
      law.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on the Tribunal&#8217;s order, Chevron has asked that the Ecuadorian 
      appellate court take all steps to suspend enforcement of the Lago Agrio 
      judgment until further order of the Tribunal, including suspension of 
      any requirement that Chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement of the 
      judgment during the cassation appeal. Any demand that Chevron post a 
      bond in this case would be a violation of Ecuador&#8217;s international 
      obligations under the order of the BIT Tribunal, and Chevron has no 
      obligation to post such a bond.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The plaintiffs have indicated that they will seek to have Ecuador defy 
      the BIT Tribunal&#8217;s order by pursuing enforcement of the corrupt 
      judgment outside of Ecuador before the BIT Tribunal has an 
      opportunity to review the merits of the case. In the event the 
      plaintiffs carry through on their threats to file enforcement actions 
      against Chevron affiliates in other countries, Chevron will take 
      appropriate steps to defend against this fraud.

&lt;p&gt;  MINNEAPOLIS, MN, Jan 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NetEx(R), a leading company providing a WAN optimization virtual
appliance solution, today announced that it is co-hosting a Microsoft
Office Live Meeting webinar with IBM Tivoli Storage Software addressing
the acceleration of disaster recovery via a complementary solution from
the two companies at 1 p.m. EST January 25.

    The "Accelerating DR with Tivoli Storage Management and HyperIP" event
discusses the new replication features in Tivoli Storage Manager 6.3 that
enable a disaster recovery solution for a company's TSM-managed
infrastructure and how NetEx's HyperIP WAN Optimization Virtual Appliance
can accelerate those efforts by getting LAN-like speeds over a WAN to
reduce the replication window from hours to minutes. Presenters include
Rich Vining, Product Marketing Manager for IBM Tivoli Storage Software,
and Steve Thompson, Director of Strategic Accounts and Technical
Marketing at NetEx.

    "With Tivoli Storage Manager 6.3, customers have a powerful tool in
native replication of backup data that helps reduce the costs of
maintaining a separate DR point solution and effectively simplifies
overall management of the backup environment," said Thompson. "And while
TSM replication is efficient in sending only incremental, deduplicated
data between sites, transfer times can still be impacted by network
latency over long distances. Pairing the TSM replication feature with
NetEx HyperIP can accelerate data transfer by as much as 12x with
HyperIP's block-level compression. This webinar will give attendees a
better understanding of how utilizing WAN acceleration solutions such as
HyperIP in conjunction with TSM can help overcome the issues of moving
data over distance between physical DR locations."

    HyperIP has been validated as Ready for IBM Tivoli. This is an exclusive
IBM designation for validating the integration of Independent Software
Vendor and / or Business Partner solutions with Tivoli systems management
technology.

      Fitch Downgrades JPMCC 2007-LDP10; Affirms Super Senior Classes at 'AAA'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings downgrades seven classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Mortgage 
      Securities Trust, series 2007-LDP10 (JPMCC 2007-LDP10), commercial 
      mortgage pass-through certificates, due to increased loss expectations 
      on the specially serviced loans and further deterioration of loan 
      performance. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades are due to greater certainty of losses associated with 
      specially serviced loans and increased loss expectations on several 
      performing loans with performance declines. Fourteen of the top 15 loans 
      have Fitch stressed loan to value ratios greater than 95%. Fitch modeled 
      losses of 15.6% for the remaining pool; expected losses of the original 
      pool are at 15.3%, including losses already incurred to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the December 2011 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has decreased 6.9% to $4.96 billion from $5.33 billion 
      at issuance. As of December 2011, there are cumulative interest 
      shortfalls in the amount of $30.4 million, affecting classes F through 
      NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The deal consists of two loan groups, Group R and Group S. Loans are 
      grouped according to whether they have a five- to seven-year term, or 
      10-year and greater term. Principal proceeds, including unscheduled 
      proceeds from liquidations, are distributed according to their 
      respective loan group; Group S pays down the class S certificates and 
      Group R pays down the certificates not noted with an 'S.' Losses are 
      allocated reverse sequentially, then pro rata to each loan group's 
      corresponding class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In total, there are 41 loans (17.8% of the pool) in special servicing 
      including two of the top 15 loans (5.2%) and five assets (1.2%) that are 
      real estate owned (REO). Realized losses as of December 2011 were $40.1 
      million (0.8% of the original pool balance) and have partially depleted 
      the non-rated class NR. One loan (0.2%) was liquidated recently with a 
      $10.6 million loss to the trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected loss is the largest specially 
      serviced loan (2.8% of the pool), secured by the Solana office complex 
      located in Westlake, TX. The pari passu loan was transferred to special 
      servicing in March 2009 for imminent default and has since been modified 
      to change the terms of the cash management agreement. One of the largest 
      tenants at the property vacated their space prior to their lease 
      expiration in 2011. A reported appraisal from April 2011 indicates a 
      value significantly below the loan amount.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to modeled loss is the StratREAL 
      Industrial Portfolio II (3.7%). The collateral consists of a portfolio 
      of 10 industrial properties located in Tennessee, Ohio, and California. 
      During 2010 and 2011, the portfolio lost several major tenants due to 
      tenant lease expiries and termination options. The loan is current and 
      not specially serviced; however, the loan's debt service coverage ratio 
      (DSCR) is expected to decrease as the recent increase in vacancy is 
      reflected in the financials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to modeled loss is the Long Island 
      Marriott and Conference Center (2.1%). The loan is current and not 
      specially serviced; however, the most recent servicer-reported DSCR as 
      of the year-end (YE) 2010, was 0.78 times (x). The reported trailing 12 
      month (TTM) occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), and revenue per 
      available room (RevPAR) as of November 2011 were 75%, $147, and $111, 
      respectively. The issuer originally underwrote the loan assuming a 
      stabilized RevPAR over $130 to be achieved by January 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has downgraded and assigned Recovery Estimates (REs) to the 
      following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$359 million class A-M to 'BBBsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--$174.1 
      million class A-MS to 'BBBsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--$200.7 
      million class A-J to 'CCCsf' from 'B-sf'; RE 30%;--$145.8 million 
      class A-JS to 'CCCsf' from 'B-sf'; RE 30%;--$100 million class 
      A-JFL to 'CCCsf' from 'B-sf'; RE 30%;--$40.4 million class E to 
      'CCsf' from 'CCCsf', RE 0%;--$19.6 million class E-S to 'CCsf' 
      from 'CCCsf', RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$242.1 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$627.6 
      million class A-2S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$118.4 million

      Outlook Stable;--$502.9 million class A-1A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$71.8 million class B at 'CCCsf; RE 0%;--$34.8 
      million class B-S at 'CCCsf', RE 0%;--$26.9 million class C at 
      'CCCsf', RE 0%;--$13.1 million class C-S at 'CCCsf', RE 0%;--$49.4 
      million class D at 'CCCsf', RE 0%;--$23.9 million class D-S at 
      'CCCsf', RE 0%;--$44.9 million class F at 'CCsf', RE 0%;--$21.8 
      million class F-S at 'CCsf', RE 0%--$44.9 million class G at 
      'Csf', RE 0%;--$21.8 million class G-S at 'Csf', RE 0%;--$40.4 
      million class H at 'Csf', RE 0%;--$19.6 million class H-S at 
      'Csf', RE 0%;--$20 million class J at 'Csf', RE 0%;--$20 
      million class K at 'Csf', RE 0%;--$13.3 million class L at 'Csf', 
      RE 0%;--$6.7 million class M at 'Csf', RE 0%;--$6.7 million 
      class N at 'Csf', RE 0%;--$13.3 million class P at 'Csf', RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Classes A-1 and A-1S have paid in full. Fitch does not rate class NR. 
      Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      vintage U.S. CMBS is available in the Dec, 21, 2011 report,

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Google Inc's quarterly results fell short of Wall Street's heightened expectations for the crucial holiday-shopping period, wiping almost 10 percent off its shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet giant leads results from some of the technology sector's largest corporations on Thursday, including International Business Machines, Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sector bellwether IBM rode a 3-percent share-gain after its own results beat targets. Intel's first-quarter forecast was in line with expectations, relieving some investors who had feared the chipmaker would pare back its guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft offset weakness in its Windows business -- the result of poor PC sales -- with strengthing server and tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commentary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE INC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM FORREST, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google got hit with the ugly stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm surprised at the level by which they missed both on revenue and earnings. They haven't missed on both before; they've missed on one before, but made it up on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've got to ask yourself, 'where is the money going? What are they spending it on?' I have a feeling it is on platforms like Chrome and Android, and things like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JORDAN ROHAN, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Expectations had got ahead of themselves for Google, largely because investors don't have a good feel for what happens outside the U.S. North America has remained strong but there are parts of the world where there's a lot of economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would have to assume Europe, particularly Germany and some others undergoing austerity measures. The underlying demand in those countries is weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The margins were pretty good, on a percentage basis they show a decent uptick. Google is a company where investors get it wrong every other quarter, because they doesn't provide guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are many parts of the Google income statement that are difficult to forecast."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC PARTNERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even though the earnings came in line with expectations the tax rate was higher than expected, while interest and other income was also negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not a disastrous report but it shows you expectations were high because it's typically their strongest quarter. Q4 is typically their time to shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Click pricing was down. It declined 8 percent, we were expecting it be up 3 percent, and this is due to the economy. It's not a positive outlook for macro earnings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICROSOFT CORP:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUNIT GOGIA, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results are pretty much in line with my expectations.

But the server and tools business is growing well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTEL CORP:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOUG FREEDMAN, ANALYSTM RBC CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Revenue is clearly better than expected. I am surprised they are not guiding to slightly lower revenues. I thought it could be slightly worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The full-year forecast is pretty bullish when they talk about gross margin and revenue. They are pretty big numbers, as is the amount of spending and depreciation. So they clearly see a very large opportunity for sales. You have to think that they think unit growth can be high single-digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last quarter they underestimated the flood impact. I am wondering if they are still underestimating the Thailand flood impact, and the market's ability to ramp back up to get to these&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;numbers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM FORREST, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are bullish for the next quarter, so I am pretty happy as a holder of IBM.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. would pay more than $2 million in penalties and cleanup costs to Montana for a pipeline rupture in July that spilled an estimated 1,500 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River, according to a proposed legal settlement unveiled on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the negotiated agreement between Exxon and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, the Texas-based oil company would pay a fine of $1.6 million, the largest penalty ever levied in Montana for violations of its water quality regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon also would reimburse Montana $760,000 for state cleanup expenses and cover any future costs should the state incur them, according to the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal is open for public comment through February 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Silvertip pipeline burst on July 1 at a crossing beneath the flood-swollen Yellowstone River near Billings, Montana, about 150 miles downstream from Yellowstone National Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company originally put the size of the spill at 1,000 barrels of crude but has since revised the volume of oil released into the river at 1,500 barrels, Montana environmental officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal represents only part of Exxon's liability stemming from the pipeline rupture, Montana Department of Environmental Quality Director Richard Opper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon in November estimated its overall response to the spill, including cleanup, would cost $135 million and said it had reached compensation agreements with more than 95 percent of riverside property owners affected by the accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Exxon must still settle with the state for any damages assessed by the Montana attorney general under the state's natural resource laws, Opper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of the accident, which occurred amid historically high water levels on the pristine river, remains under investigation by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said in a statement on Thursday that it regretted the incident and took full responsibility for the cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Steve Gorman and Dan Burns)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  HONG KONG, Jan 20 (MARKET WIRE) --

    Economic fundamentals leading into 2012 have set a generally positive
pace with GDP growth likely to pick up through the coming year. However,
there are several important caveats to note as the world economy
continues to face headwinds and risks weigh to the downside. Positive
outlooks are conditional on fiscal policy in payroll taxes and
unemployment insurance benefits and upon the easing of the European debt
situation. A repeat of volatility experienced in 2011 is likely in 2012,
as perceptions about the strength of the U.S. economy and the euro zone
will vary over time as events unfold.

    Despite the current situation, our team continues to identify high
momentum situations with growth potential -- there remains strong
opportunity within careful discretion.

&lt;p&gt;  HONG KONG, Jan 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today, www.BollingerReport.com introduced featured coverage of TOTAL S.A.
(ADR) (NYSE: TOT) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM). Full research
reports are available to readers at:
www.BollingerReport.com/index.php?sm1=TOT=XOM.

    Economic fundamentals leading into 2012 have set a generally positive
pace with GDP growth likely to pick up through the coming year. However,
there are several important caveats to note as the world economy
continues to face headwinds and risks weigh to the downside. Positive
outlooks are conditional on fiscal policy in payroll taxes and
unemployment insurance benefits and upon the easing of the European debt
situation. A repeat of volatility experience in 2011 is likely in 2012,
as perceptions about the strength of the U.S. economy and the euro zone
will vary over time as events unfold.

    Despite the current situation, our team continues to identify high
momentum situations with growth potential -- there remains strong
opportunity within careful discretion.

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered the streamlining of applications for foreign tourist visas to the United States, focused on increasingly affluent Chinese and Brazilian visitors, in an effort to boost tourism and create jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama announced the modest package of reforms at the Disney World theme park in Florida, a state whose economy is heavily dependent on the tourist industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state, closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, will be a crucial battleground in November, when Obama faces a re-election vote that may hinge on Americans' perceptions of his handling of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American tourism industry and business groups have long advocated an easing of visa restrictions that were tightened in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing on "Main Street" in Disney's Magic Kingdom with Cinderella's castle in the background, Obama said he was making the visa changes to try to help spur American job growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want America to be the top tourist destination in the world," Obama said. "The more folks who visit America, the more Americans we get back to work. It is that simple."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He joked that the visit to Disney World was one of the rare instances that his daughters, Sasha and Malia, envied him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe, for once, they will actually ask me at dinner how my day went," Obama said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visa changes were the latest measures rolled out by Obama to show voters he is serious about boosting the still-sluggish labor market and will act on his own whenever possible in the face of election-year gridlock in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama said the new steps would help cut through red tape and make it easier for foreign tourists to come to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House estimated that more than 1 million U.S. jobs could be created in the next decade if the country increased its share of the international travel market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign visitors generated $134 billion in 2010, making it the largest U.S. service export industry, the Commerce Department said. The number of tourists from emerging economies with growing middle classes like China, Brazil and India is projected to grow sharply in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the steps announced on Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* An order for the government to increase non-immigrant visa processing capacity in China and Brazil by 40 percent in 2012, ensuring that 80 percent of applicants are interviewed within three weeks and expanding visa waiver programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* A pilot program to simplify and speed the visa process for applicants from China and Brazil, including the ability to waive interviews for low-risk applicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Addition of Taiwan to the list of so-called visa-waiver countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Creation of an interagency task force to develop recommendations for expanding international tourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Spetalnick and Caren Bohan; Editing by Will Dunham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Jan 20 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil group
Japan-based oil refiner TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK said on
Friday it will terminate its 50-50 lithium-ion battery separator
film joint venture with Toray Industries Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral said it would be best for the venture to become
a wholly owned unit of Toray, adding that the move was unrelated
to its parent Exxon's recent announcement that it is considering
a change in its capital relationship with TonenGeneral, in which
it has a 50.02 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral said the venture would be terminated on Jan. 31
and it expects to post special profit of about 16.4 billion yen
($213 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil is in talks to sell most of its 50 percent stake
in Japanese refiner TonenGeneral in a deal that could be worth
as much as $5 billion, sources have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced fourth-quarter 2011 diluted earnings of 
      $4.62 per share, compared with diluted earnings of $4.18 per share in 
      the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 11 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $4.71 per share, compared with 
      operating diluted earnings of $4.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 
      2010, an increase of 11 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fourth-quarter net income was $5.5 billion compared with $5.3 billion in 
      the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 4 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) net income was $5.6 billion compared with $5.4 billion in the 
      fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 5 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $29.5 billion increased 
      2 percent (1 percent, adjusting for currency) from the fourth quarter of 
      2010. While currency provided a benefit to revenue growth of 
      approximately 25 basis points in the quarter, currency movements since 
      the company announced its third-quarter earnings in October impacted 
      fourth-quarter revenue by approximately one point of growth, or $300 
      million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We had a strong fourth-quarter performance, capping a year of record 
      earnings per share, revenue, profit and free cash flow," said Ginni 
      Rometty, IBM president and chief executive officer. "We delivered 
      outstanding results in all four of our strategic initiatives for the 
      quarter and the year, as we continued to realize the benefit of our 
      long-term investments in growth markets, business analytics, Smarter 
      Planet solutions and cloud. We are well on track toward our long-term 
      roadmap for operating earnings per share of at least $20 in 2015.&#8221;

      Fourth-Quarter GAAP - Operating (non-GAAP) Reconciliation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fourth-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.09 per 
      share of net charges: $0.10 per share for the amortization of purchased 
      intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, offset by 
      ($0.01) per share for retirement-related items driven by changes to plan 
      assets and liabilities primarily related to market performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full-Year 2012 Expectation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM said that it expects to deliver full-year 2012 GAAP earnings per 
      share of at least $14.16; and operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share of 
      at least $14.85. The 2012 operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude $0.69 
      per share of charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets, 
      other acquisition-related charges, and retirement-related items driven 
      by changes to plan assets and liabilities primarily related to market 
      performance.

      Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa were $9.6 billion, up 1 percent 
      (1 percent, adjusting for currency). Asia-Pacific revenues increased 2

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - When Disney shareholders vote to re-elect directors at its annual meeting in March, neither Steve Jobs' wife nor a representative from his trust will be on the ballot, even though the trust is the media company's largest shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Walt Disney Co's proxy, filed on Friday, directors standing for re-election include Robert Iger, Disney's president and chief executive; Aylwin Lewis, the president and CEO of Potbelly Sandwich Works and a former executive at Sears and Kmart; and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jobs' wife, Laurene, is absent from the list and none of the members standing for re-election represents his estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jobs, who passed away in October, had been on Disney's board since May 2006, when Disney bought his company Pixar. Jobs, best known for founding Apple Inc, passed away at the age of 56 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was enlisted for the Disney board to help provide guidance and help steer the media company through the digital disruption that was wreaking havoc on its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which generates some $40 billion in annual revenue, is grappling with global economic uncertainty and its impact on its three largest divisions: media, its movie studio and theme park resorts. Its brands include Disney, ABC and ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its proxy filing on Friday, Disney said that 10 of its 11 current board members would stand for re-election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Disney did not immediately respond to inquiries about whether Jobs' wife or a member of his trust was offered a seat on its board. Apple declined to comment about whether they were offered or turned down a position in Steve Jobs' absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Steven P. Jobs Trust is Disney's largest shareholder, owning nearly 137.3 million shares, or 7.7 percent of the company's common stock, according to the proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney closed at $39.31 on Friday, valuing the Jobs Trust's stake at roughly $5.37 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proxy, as it has in past years, showed that Jobs did not receive any compensation for his role on the Disney board, per his request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only Disney board member not up for re-election, Chairman John Pepper Jr., announced back in October that he plans to step down from the board at the upcoming annual meeting, set to be held on March 13 in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger, who has run Disney since October 2005, will take on the additional title of chairman at the meeting. He is expected to step down as CEO in March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger's compensation rose 13 percent in fiscal 2011, boosted by an increase in his annual cash bonus and incentive plan, according to Disney's proxy. Iger, 60, saw his total compensation including pension benefits top $33.4 million in the 12 months to September 2011, when Disney's financial year ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has been expanding the scope of its computers, iPhones and iPad tablets in the months since Jobs' death. The iPad appeared to be a hot seller during the recent holiday season, and Apple's quarterly results are due to be released on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, the company took a big jump into the digital textbooks market with the launch of its iBooks 2 software, aiming to revitalize the U.S. education market and quicken the adoption of its market-leading iPad in that sector. The move pits Apple against Amazon.com Inc and other content and device makers that have made inroads into the estimated $8 billion market with their electronic textbook offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terry McGraw, CEO of McGraw-Hill Cos Inc, one of the textbook publishers working with Apple, said he had been talking to Jobs and his team since last June about recreating textbooks as applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago; Editing by Peter Lauria and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States confirmed on Sunday it had issued a visa for Yemen's outgoing President Ali Abdullah Saleh, but said it expected him to remain in the country only for a limited time to undergo medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ali Abdullah Saleh's request to travel to the U.S. for medical treatment has been approved," the U.S. State Department said in a statement. "As we have indicated, the sole purpose of this travel is for medical treatment and we expect that he will stay for a limited time that corresponds to the duration of this treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Andrew Quinn, editing by Jackie Frank)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Chevron's bid to re-impose a worldwide injunction barring Ecuadorean plaintiffs from acting to enforce the $18 billion environmental contamination judgment that an Ecuadorean appellate panel upheld earlier this month. That's Chevron's second big rebuff in its U.S. campaign to knock out the Ecuadorean judgment, which the oil company contends was fraudulently obtained. Two weeks ago U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan -- theretofore a reliable backstop for Chevron -- refused the oil company's motion for an attachment order in its racketeering suit against the Ecuadorean plaintiffs and some of their lawyers and experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron counsel Randy Mastro of Gibson, Dunn  Crutcher painted Kaplan's ruling as a temporary setback, since Kaplan said the oil company could try again for a pre-trial attachment.  But it's impossible to spin the Second Circuit's order Thursday as anything but bad news for Chevron. The appellate judges, you'll recall, lifted Kaplan's injunction on enforcement of the Ecuadorean judgment last September. They also stayed Chevron's declaratory judgment case before Kaplan, in which the oil company sought to prove its fraud allegations against the Ecuadoreans and their lawyers. At the time of those rulings by the Second Circuit, the $18 billion judgment was still under consideration by the Ecuadorean appeals court, and the Ecuadoreans asserted that there was no need for an injunction because the judgment couldn't be enforced while the Ecuadorean appellate process was underway. When Chevron went back to the Second Circuit this month, Gibson Dunn argued that since the Ecuadoreans are poised to enforce their judgment, the oil company now needs the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second Circuit's denial of Chevron's motion suggests that the U.S. appellate panel (which still hasn't issued an opinion explaining its September orders) had bigger problems with Kaplan's injunction than mere timeliness. Although there's a chance the appeals judges based Thursday's decision on ripeness, which was one of the issues both sides briefed, it seems likelier -- both from the denial of Chevron's motion and last September's oral argument -- that the U.S. judges are concerned about undercutting the authority of another country's judiciary. If that's the case, the Second Circuit simply isn't going to permit Chevron to use the U.S. courts to block enforcement of the Ecuadoreans' judgment around the world. Chevron's racketeering case is still alive and kicking before Kaplan, but without an injunction or pre-trial attachment order, the RICO suit can only provide an after-the-fact remedy. (In an email statement, a Chevron spokesman said the company is "disappointed that the Second Circuit did not grant our motion to lift the stay, and we await the court's opinion.")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Chevron can't use the U.S. courts to bar the Ecuadoreans from collecting, it has three ways to attempt to evade the $18 billion judgment: the Ecuadorean courts; enforcement disputes elsewhere in the world; and the bilateral treaty arbitration between the Republic of Ecuador and Chevron over the scope of the release the Republic granted Chevron predecessor Texaco more than 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador is fraught with danger for Chevron. On Friday , the oil company filed a notice that it is appealing the $18 billion judgment to Ecuador's highest court. Under Ecuador's procedures, the intermediate appeals court that just affirmed the judgment can set a bond that Chevron must pay if it wants to stay enforcement during the high court appeal. But according to the plaintiffs, if Chevron loses the appeal, it loses whatever it posts as a bond in addition to the judgment. Even if that's not the case, Chevron has taken great pains to move all attachable assets out of Ecuador. Posting bond there puts money within easy reach of the Ecuadorean plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also faces a deadline on a decision that affects almost half of the $18 billion judgment, which was imposed as a penalty for Chevron's ongoing refusal to apologize for allegedly contaminating the Lago Agrio region of the rainforest. The penalty was first imposed by the trial court, after Chevron failed to meet its deadline for apologizing. The Ecuadorean appeals panel has given Chevron a new deadline to apologize and thereby eliminate about $8 billion of the $18 billion judgment. In a clarification the plaintiffs requested, the appeals panel said any apology would not be regarded as an admission of liability elsewhere in the world. But I seriously doubt Chevron will rely on the credibility of the Ecuadorean court system -- which it has been calling corrupt for the last three years -- as it opposes enforcement of the judgment in courts around the world. There's almost no chance Chevron will apologize and risk the possibility that other courts will interpret the apology as an admission of liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron made an interesting strategic decision before the intermediate Ecuadorean appellate panel that the plaintiffs believe gives them an edge in the international enforcement litigation that's sure to follow any high court endorsement of the $18 billion judgment. There was some ambiguity in the Ecuadorean appellate ruling on the court's consideration of Chevron's fraud allegations. The plaintiffs requested clarification; Chevron did not, but was permitted to respond to the plaintiffs' request. In the clarification issued last week, the Ecuadorian appeals panel said it had reviewed Chevron's fraud allegations but hadn't based its decision on them. The appellate judges said Chevron's fraud case could be adjudicated in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs believe that the Ecuadorean court's clarification -- confirming that it reviewed Chevron's fraud allegations and upheld the judgment despite them -- will carry weight with other courts as they consider attachment motions by the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. Chevron, on the other hand, apparently intends to argue to judges around the world that there's been no final determination on its fraud allegations. The oil company will also assert that the clarification is further evidence to support its claim that the Ecuadorean courts are in the pocket of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. ("Any attempt to enforce this fraudulent Ecuadorian judgment will be met with a mountain of fraud evidence these plaintiffs and their counsel cannot surmount or even contest because it comes largely from their own admissions," said Chevron counsel Mastro.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's perceived ace card, meanwhile, is the bilateral treaty arbitration. Last year, in a preliminary decision that didn't get nearly as much attention as Kaplan's worldwide injunction, the arbitration panel ruled that the Republic of Ecuador must act to bar enforcement of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' judgment. On Jan. 4, Chevron lawyers at King  Spalding sent an emergency letter to the arbitration panel, requesting that the panel demand a showing that the Republic is complying with its 2011 order. The Republic of Ecuador's lawyers at Winston  Strawn responded on Jan. 9 with a 15-page letter explaining that the panel's order would require an impermissible violation of Ecuador's separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches. The panel has scheduled private hearings to take place in Washington, D.C., in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the first time in years, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are beginning to talk with some swagger about prevailing against an embattled Chevron. They're asserting their own fraud claims against Chevron before the Second Circuit and the BIT arbitration panel, and their lawyers at Patton Boggs and Smyser Kaplan  Veselka can point to a $18 million fee legal award the Ecuadorean appeals court imposed on Chevron for vexatious litigation tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case has already achieved epic status, but there's still a long way to go. And the ultimate result seems harder than ever to predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  PALATINE, IL, Jan 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACUR), a specialty pharmaceutical
company, announced today that it has been informed by Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:
PFE) that OXECTA(R) (oxycodone HCl, USP) Tablets CII is now commercially
available. OXECTA, which utilizes Acura's AVERSION(R) Technology, will be
sold in bottles of 100 tablets in 5mg and 7.5mg dosage strengths. 

    "The commercial availability of OXECTA is an important milestone and we
are pleased Pfizer continues to advance the commercialization plan for
OXECTA," said Bob Jones, chief executive officer of Acura
Pharmaceuticals. 

    Acura has exclusively licensed the AVERSION Technology to Pfizer in the
United States, Canada and Mexico for use in four opioid-based pain
products. Acura receives tiered royalties ranging from 5% to 25% on net
sales (gross sales less discounts, if any) of OXECTA commencing on the
first anniversary of the first commercial sale of OXECTA. Pfizer has an
option to license the use of the AVERSION technology with additional
opioids. 

    About OXECTA

    OXECTA is indicated for the management of acute and chronic moderate to
severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. OXECTA
is the first immediate-release oxycodone HCl tablet that applies
technology designed to discourage some common methods of tampering
associated with opioid abuse and misuse. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved OXECTA in June 2011.

    OXECTA Important Safety Information
 OXECTA is contraindicated in
patients with respiratory depression in unmonitored settings and in the
absence of resuscitative equipment, in any patient who has or is
suspected of having paralytic ileus, in patients with acute or severe
bronchial asthma or hypercarbia, and in patients with known
hypersensitivity to oxycodone, oxycodone salts, or any components of the
product.

    Respiratory depression is the primary risk of OXECTA. This is more common
in elderly or debilitated patients, in those suffering from conditions
such as COPD, severe asthma, or upper airway obstruction, or following
large initial doses of opioids given to non-tolerant patients.

    OXECTA contains oxycodone HCl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II
controlled substance. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people
with addictions. OXECTA can be abused in a manner similar to other
opioids and narcotics. This should be considered when prescribing or
dispensing oxycodone HCl in situations where the physician or pharmacist
is concerned about an increased risk of misuse or abuse. OXECTA may be
abused by crushing, chewing, snorting or injecting the product. These
practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in
overdose and death. OXECTA should not be given to anyone other than the
individual for whom it was prescribed. Keep OXECTA in a locked cabinet,
drawer or medicine safe so that it will not be stolen. 

    There is no evidence that OXECTA has a reduced abuse liability compared
to immediate-release oxycodone. 

    Take each OXECTA tablet with enough water to ensure complete swallowing
immediately after placing in the mouth, and OXECTA must be swallowed
whole. As OXECTA is not amenable to crushing and dissolution, do not use
OXECTA in nasogastric, gastric or other feeding tubes as it may cause
obstruction of feeding tubes.

    Patients who have not been receiving opioid analgesics should start on
OXECTA in a dosing range of 5 to 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for
pain. The dose should be titrated based upon the individual patient's
response to their first dose of OXECTA. Patients with chronic pain may
need to be dosed at the lowest dosage level that will achieve acceptable
pain relief and tolerable adverse reactions, on an around-the-clock basis
rather than on an as needed basis. When a patient no longer needs
treatment with OXECTA after long-term use, it is important to gradually
taper OXECTA over time to prevent withdrawal symptoms.

    Patients taking OXECTA in combination with other medicines like
sedatives, anesthetics or narcotics may have serious problems such as
respiratory depression, low blood pressure, profound sedation, or coma.
Do not drink alcoholic beverages or take any medicines containing alcohol

    Description: The Coca-Cola Company is driving global growth. For that
reason, business leaders scrutinize every investment for alignment with
growth goals. Nowhere is this felt more than in IT. When Coca-Cola IT

transparency would help align IT investments with business priorities and
address concerns of the business. In this session, Scholefield will share
The Coca-Cola Company's journey to financial transparency and the key
insights gleaned from the initiative. This session will cover topics such
as understanding the true cost of information technology, changing the
conversation between IT and the rest of the business, and rebalancing the
IT investment portfolio toward growth.

overall conference. To learn more about the Atlanta CIO Executive Summit,

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Jan 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The six SuperMajors posted the best group performance among companies
returning to this year's PFC Energy 50 list. ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch
Shell, Chevron, BP, TOTAL and ConocoPhillips increased their combined
market capitalization 8% during 2011 to $1.2 trillion. Chevron (#4 at
$211.9 bn) increased its valuation by 15% from $183.6 bn one year ago --
the largest percentage increase of any returning company. 

    ExxonMobil (#1 at $406.3 bn) kept the first place position it has held
every year except 2007 and 2009, when the list was headed by PetroChina,
this year at #2 with a market valuation of $276.6 bn. 

    "At higher oil prices than four years ago the combined $3.6 trillion
valuation of the PFC Energy 50 companies still falls short of the peak
$5.2 trillion in December 2007," commented PFC Energy's Chairman and CEO,
Robin West. "Several factors drive the lower valuation, including
significantly lower North American gas prices and less buoyant global
equity markets." 

    Marathon ended its six-year run on the PFC Energy 50 when it spun off
downstream operations in July as Marathon Petroleum. Marathon Oil (+30%)
and Marathon Petroleum (+14%) led the Exploration &amp; Production and
Refining &amp; Marking segments in share price performance. The combined
market value of the two companies increased 24%.

    Underperforming on the overall list were National Oil Companies and
companies located in emerging markets. With investors viewing these
companies more critically due to country risk exposure and lack of
portfolio diversification, the groupings posted value declines of 14% and
16%, respectively. 

    The combined value of the four service sector companies on the PFC Energy
50 list (Schlumberger, Halliburton, National Oilwell Varco and Tenaris)
declined by 16% as the global energy industry achieved high activity
levels with no significant tightness in services and equipment markets. 

    A major story of 2011 has been the expanding oil and gas potential of the
North American onshore, which has created an intense demand for
infrastructure. In recognition of their growing importance, this year's
PFC Energy 50 list includes midstream and pipeline companies. Four
companies from that segment made the list -- Enterprise (#25),
TransCanada (#37), Enbridge (#40) and Kinder Morgan (#41). As a group,
these new entrants to the PFC Energy 50 posted the year's largest value
gains. 

    Notes to the Editor:

    The PFC Energy 50 is the definitive ranking of the world's leading
publicly traded energy companies by market capitalization. The listing
includes companies from nine sectors: International Oil Companies;
National Oil Companies; Exploration &amp; Production; Gas/Utilities; Oilfield
&amp; Drilling Services; Equipment, Engineering &amp; Construction;
Midstream/Infrastructure; Refining &amp; Marketing; and Alternative
Technologies. The full report is available at www.pfcenergy50.com, which
also provides the PFC Energy 100 listing including power and coal
companies.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican regulators on Tuesday said they have reached a decision on broadcaster Televisa's planned purchase of half of cell-phone company Iusacell, but would not yet disclose that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico's competition commission, which began its closed-door meeting around 1200 local times (1800 GMT), said in a statement that its officials cannot comment on the decision until the companies involved have been notified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulators met on Tuesday to debate the merits of the $1.6 billion tie-up that could reshape the nation's telecom and media markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decision will be announced by antitrust agency Cofeco no later than February 7, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iusacell has just 4.5 percent of the Mexican mobile market, but the five-member board of antitrust agency Cofeco had to consider television industry competition and other factors in deciding whether to give the deal the go-ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cofeco website crashed for several hours due to an unusually high number of visitors on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At face value, the purchase would create a stronger competitor to Carlos Slim's America Movil (AMXL.MX) and its commercial brand Telcel. Slim's two companies control 75 percent of the cell phone market in Latin America's second-largest economy and helped propel the tycoon to the top of the Forbes magazine list of the world's richest people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deal would also merge the interests of the country's two biggest television moguls, creating an empire that could potentially fix advertising prices for anyone trying to sell products or services through their channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iusacell affiliate TV Azteca (AZTECACPO.MX), run by Ricardo Salinas, is Mexico's No. 2 broadcaster behind Televisa. Forbes said his family controlled Mexico's fourth-largest fortune, worth an estimated about $8.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV Azteca and Televisa, owned by fellow mogul Emilio Azcarraga, control nearly all of the open-air television market in the country and have considerable influence in elections. Mexico will vote for a new president in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If approved ... the transaction would inevitably yield even more economic and political power to the two TV networks which already share more than 90 percent of the national TV audience," said a report from risk analysis firm Eurasia Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azcarraga also ranks among Mexico's richest men, with a personal fortune of more than $2 billion. Televisa shares ended down 1.62 percent on Tuesday while its New York-traded stock fell 1.22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa and TV Azteca receive 58 percent of the country's advertising -- valued at some $8 billion -- and hold 88 percent of all open-air licenses in Mexico, according to Amedi, an association that defends the right to information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santander analyst Gregorio Tomassi said regulators could approve the transaction, with some conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They could impose content conditions," he said, preventing Televisa and Azteca from giving Iusacell customers a preferential price to download television and other content on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will also have to consider the implications of an alliance between Azcarraga and Salinas in other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa also owns broadband network Bestel, football teams and a massive stadium in Mexico City, a publishing house, one of Latin America's biggest magazine distribution networks, cable television companies and a direct-to-home satellite operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides TV Azteca, Salinas runs retailer Elektra (ELEKTRA.MX), cell phone company Unefon, U.S. Spanish-language network Azteca America, motor-bike and scooter maker Italika, a bank, an insurer and a pension fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV Azteca lost 1.32 percent in Tuesday trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Elinor Comlay; Editing by Bob Burgdorfer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Six of Snow White's seven dwarves have them, along with Merlin the Magician and Aladdin's genie, and now men working at Disneyland and Walt Disney World can sport one too -- a beard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From next Friday, front line male employees at Disney's parks and resorts will be allowed to grow a beard in the biggest change to the company's conservative, clean-cut dress code since pantyhose became optional for female employees in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change came during the company's periodic review of employee requirements, and had been requested by some "cast members," which is what Disney calls employees who work face-to-face with the public, Disney spokeswoman Andrea Finger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're careful to maintain our heritage and the integrity of our brand," Finger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brand includes the "Disney Look," described as fresh, clean, neat and approachable. The dress code governs everything from hair color and style to jewelry and fingernail length. The rules will require beards to be short and neat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facial hair had been banned at the Disney company since the 1950s opening of Disneyland in California, but that was relaxed in 2000 when the company allowed moustaches with strict rules on bushiness, width and length, said Eric Clinton, a Disney union leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton said the response by younger workers to the change was: "Finally, I can take a vacation and grow a beard." However, some of the more senior Disney employees "tend to be a little more traditional and consider this a departure from the heritage we've been taught by Disney," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is also instituting "casual Fridays" when behind-the-scenes workers may wear neat jeans and polo shirts, and female workers may wear sandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Michelle Nichols and Paul Thomasch)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This version corrects to reference the genie in Aladdin in the first paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TreeHouse Interactive&#8482; (www.treehousei.com), 
      the technology leader in on-demand partner 
      relationship management (PRM) and marketing 
      automation solutions, today announced the release of its Reseller 
      View&#8482; PRM system for Microsoft Dynamics CRM. The new integrated offering 
      puts enterprise-class partner management capabilities in the hands of 
      Microsoft Dynamics CRM users for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reseller View is the most complete PRM solution available, offering a 
      password protected enterprise-class web portal that can be customized to 
      include any navigation desired and match any corporate branding 
      guidelines including a company-branded URL. Its unmatched feature set 
      automates partner on-boarding and enables partner information to flow 
      seamlessly between Dynamics CRM and Reseller View. Once in the system, 
      partners can register opportunities or receive leads directly from 
      Microsoft Dynamics CRM while logged into the Reseller View portal. Some 
      of the available features include: deal registration, lead distribution, 
      automated training and certification, partner marketing enablement, 
      automated contract management, MDF/co-op management, automated partner 
      on-boarding, partner locator, advanced document management, and partner 
      marketing automation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have relied on TreeHouse Interactive Reseller View PRM to help 
      manage our critical partner relationships for nearly five years,&#8221; said 
      Mike Stinson, vice president worldwide marketing for Motion Computing. 
      &#8220;TreeHouse Interactive&#8217;s Reseller View is tightly integrated with our 
      CRM data, so when we looked at transitioning CRM platforms, we had to 
      ensure that our partners would not be negatively impacted. TreeHouse 
      made this possible by supporting both platforms&#8212;making the transition to 
      Microsoft Dynamics CRM seamless for our partners worldwide while 
      maintaining important features such as deal registration and lead 
      distribution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We were seeing channel organizations begin to use Microsoft Dynamics 
      CRM in the marketplace, so it made sense to integrate,&#8221; said Erich 
      Flynn, CEO, TreeHouse Interactive. &#8220;One of our primary goals has always 
      been to give channel teams what they need to make their partners 
      successful. Being first to offer a PRM solution for Microsoft Dynamics 
      CRM is part of that philosophy. We expect to see more and more PRM 
      integrations with Microsoft as they continue to increase market share.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Reseller View for Microsoft Dynamics is available now. To see a

Lyons Magnus will utilize Junction Solutions' JunctionFB&#8482;, the company's end-to-end solution set for the food and beverage industry, to streamline operations and visibility throughout the organization from inventory to production scheduling to distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Like many well-established food and beverage companies, Lyons Magnus had outgrown its disparate legacy systems, and was still using manual order processes," said Christian Hutter, senior vice president of manufacturing and distribution for Junction Solutions.&#160;"With the introduction of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, the time is right for the company to maximize the increased functionality offered by the latest platform, and to utilize the JunctionFB solution set to customize a single, end-to-end solution that will provide visibility throughout all operations as well as adapt easily to future growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Lyons Magnus is among a select group of industry leaders who have already recognized the competitive advantage of implementing Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 and JunctionFB," said Michael Shoemaker, Microsoft's North America Dynamics distribution and consumer goods industry manager.&#160;"The powerful, agile and simple solution is unparalleled for its industry-specific ability to streamline and integrate current business functions and adapt to future needs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Lyons Magnus has selected the JunctionFB solution set, as well as Junction Solutions' Genetic Optimizer (GO) for Production Scheduling Optimization, Trade Promotions Management (TPM), Wireless Warehouse and Direct Store Delivery to support the entire financial, operational, product manufacturing, packaging and distribution lifecycle and to streamline processes.&#160;And because the solution operates in the familiar Microsoft touch-screen format, staff training is minimized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We realized we needed to partner with an organization with a proven track record of success in the food and beverage industry, and we also identified Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 as the preferred platform," said Jon Parker, Lyons Magnus vice president of information technology. "Junction Solutions was actually referred to us by Microsoft and we were impressed with their knowledge of our industry as well as the functionality of JunctionFB.&#160;Not only can JunctionFB meet our current business requirements and integrate information from all of our manufacturing and sales locations, but it can easily be adapted as our company continues to grow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			DriveCam Awarded NJPA National Contract for Fleet Safety Solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Contract Provides Best-in-Class Pricing While Eliminating RFPs and 
      Competitive Bids
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DriveCam, 
      Inc., a global Driver Risk Management Company, today announced it 
      had been awarded a contract to provide its video-based safety solution 
      for passenger cars and light, medium and heavy duty trucks by the National 
      Joint Powers Alliance&#174; (NJPA). This is now available nationally to 
      NJPA members under contract #102811-DCI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As the leading provider of video-based safety solutions to fleets 
      across the country, DriveCam is uniquely positioned to exceed the needs 
      and expectations of our members,&#8221; said Mike Hajek, NJPA&#8217;s director of 
      business development and marketing. &#8220;DriveCam&#8217;s solution has resulted in 
      reductions of up to 80% in collision-related costs and 12% in fuel 
      consumption in over 170,000 commercial and government vehicles. We are 
      excited about the value this contract and the solution will offer our 
      35,000 member agencies.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DriveCam addresses the causes of poor driving by combining data and 
      video analytics with real-time driver feedback and coaching, resulting 
      in reductions in collision-related costs, fuel consumption and 
      maintenance costs. This is accomplished using DriveCam&#8217;s Driver Science 
      Engine, a classification model that assists in identifying the riskiest 
      drivers within a fleet. Through a patented, iterative process of 
      scoring, prioritizing and tracking the results of driving behaviors, 
      this model identifies those behaviors that will most likely lead to a 
      collision and has provided significant savings by helping fleets more 
      effectively manage their drivers. When risky driving occurs, driving 
      behaviors are captured through in-cab video, which is objectively 
      reviewed and scored and then passed on to the fleet manager for use in 
      coaching drivers; these short 12-second video clips provide the 
      objective context for discussion with drivers about their behavior. 
      Fleets manage the DriveCam Program through DriveCam Online&#174;, a web-based 
      online portal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted to work with NJPA and its member organizations,&#8221; 
      commented DriveCam CEO Brandon Nixon. &#8220;By making it easier to purchase 
      our driver risk management solution, NJPA will help local governments 
      save money, while protecting their drivers and communities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      agency established through legal statute in 1977. NJPA serves over 
      35,000 member agencies throughout the United States with competitively

      WageWorks Names Visa as Preferred Brand for Prepaid Employee Benefit 
      Programs
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Visa is designated the preferred payment solution for 1.5 million 
      employee benefit accounts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and WageWorks Inc., a leading on-demand provider of 
      tax-advantaged programs for consumer-directed health, commuter, and 
      other employee spending account benefits, today announced a new, 
      multi-year agreement naming Visa as WageWorks&#8217; preferred brand for 
      prepaid employee benefit and health spending cards. Spanning a myriad of 
      consumer directed benefit accounts, the relationship provides employers 
      and their employees with the convenience, security, and reliability of a 
      Visa prepaid card when accessing tax deferred money for qualified 
      purchases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;By partnering with one of the most highly recognized brands in the 
      world, we are strengthening our commitment to become a world-class 
      provider of benefits services,&#8221; said Edgar Montes, SVP of Service 
      Delivery for WageWorks, Inc. &#8220;With this arrangement, we are maximizing 
      merchant coverage for all of our products through the use of the Visa 
      product.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WageWorks provides nearly 10,000 employers with a broad array of 
      consumer-directed benefit accounts, representing 24 percent of Fortune 
      500 companies and 40 percent of Fortune 100 companies across the U.S. 
      Working with employers, WageWorks helps consumers stay ahead of the 
      rising cost of living, by spending less of the household budget on 
      healthcare and transportation through tax deferred savings programs. 
      WageWorks&#8217; participants can set aside pre-tax money each month, and use 
      a Visa-branded FSA or transportation card for eligible expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Visa-branded employee benefits cards can increase 
      efficiencies and lower the cost of administering employee benefit 
      programs, while providing a more convenient and secure way for 
      participants to access funds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Through our relationship with WageWorks, Visa is delivering the 
      convenience of digital currency to organizations and their employees,&#8221; 
      said Hyung Choi, Head of US Prepaid, Visa Inc. &#8220;Our relationship with 
      WageWorks delivers the value of the Visa payment network to thousands of 
      employers and millions of consumers through more efficient electronic 
      payment tools. Enhancing benefit accounts with payment card access helps 
      reduce the costs and paperwork for employers and administrators &#8211; and 
      helps increase employee satisfaction.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For more than a decade, Visa has invested in growing the prepaid 
      category in the U.S. and around the world. Visa&#8217;s flexible platform 
      enables a diverse set of prepaid products meeting highly specific needs. 
      With a focus on migrating paper-based programs and processes to 
      electronic payments, Visa has established more than 11,000 Visa prepaid 
      programs in 110 countries, delivering greater convenience, choice and 
      security to consumers, businesses, and governments.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Hires Mark Godridge from JP Morgan Cazenove&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Liberum aiming to make 10 more senior hires this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* 2011 revenues 38 mln stg, pre-bonus profits 10 mln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Liberum Capital, one of
several investment banks linked with a possible bid for Royal
Bank of Scotland's Hoare Govett unit, poached a leading
banker from rival JP Morgan Cazenove and said it planned
to hire more staff this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said Mark Godridge had joined from JP Morgan
Cazenove to become chief executive of its U.S. subsidiary
Liberum Capital Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that it planned a further 10 senior hires this
year, bringing the number of employees at the British bank to
160.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Godridge had run the JP Morgan Cazenove European and
Emerging Market sales team since 2010, and had also been
president of Cazenove's New York office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of Britain's smaller, independently-owned investment
banks such as Liberum Capital and Oriel Securities have grown as
their larger rivals have been forced to scale back in the
aftermath of the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Oriel Securities had hired three new
bankers from former rival Evolution following Evolution's
takeover by South Africa's Investec .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no denying that 2011 was a tough year for the
markets and, as a result, we have seen an unprecedented level of
consolidation and change in the broking sector," Liberum Chief
Executive Simon Stilwell said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is creating significant opportunities for us on an
individual, team and business level," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS, 83-percent owned by the British government after a
state rescue during the 2008 credit crisis, is considering
selling its Hoare Govett stockbroking arm as part of plans to
slash back its investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources involved in the process have said that Jefferies
, Bank of China, Oriel Securities and Liberum
Capital are among those casting an eye on the Hoare Govett
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberum Capital also posted 2011 revenues of 38 million
pounds ($59.3 million) and pre-bonus profits of 10 million
pounds. It did not disclose comparative figures for its 2010
results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Hires Mark Godridge from JP Morgan Cazenove&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Liberum aiming to make 10 more senior hires this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* 2011 revenues 38 mln stg, pre-bonus profits 10 mln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Liberum Capital, one of
several investment banks linked with a possible bid for Royal
Bank of Scotland's Hoare Govett unit, poached a leading
banker from rival JP Morgan Cazenove and said it planned
to hire more staff this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said Mark Godridge had joined from JP Morgan
Cazenove to become chief executive of its U.S. subsidiary
Liberum Capital Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that it planned a further 10 senior hires this
year, bringing the number of employees at the British bank to
160.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Godridge had run the JP Morgan Cazenove European and
Emerging Market sales team since 2010, and had also been
president of Cazenove's New York office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of Britain's smaller, independently-owned investment
banks such as Liberum Capital and Oriel Securities have grown as
their larger rivals have been forced to scale back in the
aftermath of the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Oriel Securities had hired three new
bankers from former rival Evolution following Evolution's
takeover by South Africa's Investec .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no denying that 2011 was a tough year for the
markets and, as a result, we have seen an unprecedented level of
consolidation and change in the broking sector," Liberum Chief
Executive Simon Stilwell said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is creating significant opportunities for us on an
individual, team and business level," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS, 83-percent owned by the British government after a
state rescue during the 2008 credit crisis, is considering
selling its Hoare Govett stockbroking arm as part of plans to
slash back its investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources involved in the process have said that Jefferies
, Bank of China, Oriel Securities and Liberum
Capital are among those casting an eye on the Hoare Govett
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberum Capital also posted 2011 revenues of 38 million
pounds ($59.3 million) and pre-bonus profits of 10 million
pounds. It did not disclose comparative figures for its 2010
results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  POWAY, CA, Jan 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BridgeSTOR, LLC, redefining the cost per terabyte equation through a
family of advanced data reduction products, today released its
Deduplication ROI (Return on Investment) Calculator for Microsoft Data
Protection Manager 2010 and 2012. The DPM ROI Calculator employs a
pre-programmed Microsoft Excel workbook that enables storage managers to
quickly and easily predict the storage cost savings made possible by
installing a BridgeSTOR DPM Appliance or BridgeSTOR Dedupe Card for DPM. 

    The BridgeSTOR ROI Calculator asks you to enter some basic information
about your DPM storage capacity and expected rate of growth in capacity,
your cost of capacity and an estimate of your operating expenses (your
estimated cost of power and cooling for DPM storage). Information to
assist you in building the operating expense estimate is included as part
of the Calculator. 

    The DPM ROI Calculator processes the data you supplied and develops a
detailed five-year financial analysis of the costs that can be displaced
by BridgeSTOR's deduplication and compression. You can then compare the
savings information generated by the ROI Calculator against your
anticipated BridgeSTOR deduplication product costs to make an informed
decision about the net benefits of implementing advanced data reduction
technology.

    "Our customers are looking to Microsoft's DPM to protect their
business-critical application data and they are looking to BridgeSTOR to
supply deduplication and compression to manage DPM storage capacity,"
said John Matze, BridgeSTOR founder and CEO. "The DPM 2010 and 2012 ROI
Calculator gives the storage manager insight into the business case for
size-reducing DPM capacity to save both capital and operating dollars.
BridgeSTOR's Advanced Data Reduction is the only technology that fits the
missing pieces into the Microsoft DPM storage capacity puzzle." 

    The DPM 2010 and 2012 ROI Calculator is available now, at no charge and
with no obligation, from the BridgeSTOR website.

    BridgeSTOR products are available through select channel partners and
directly through the BridgeSTOR website. Please see www.bridgestor.com

43 days from Feb. 17 as the plant undergoes planned maintenance,
an official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first two weeks all production units at the Cape
Town refinery will be down, although the company says it has
taken contingency measures to obviate any shortages in Africa's
largest economy which relies on imported crude fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have put measures in place to ensure an adequate supply
of fuel and other products during this period," Steven Parker,
general manager at Chevref, said in a statement.

			Industrial Defender, IBM, and NitroSecurity Score Highest in New 
      Pike Research Assessment of Smart Grid Cyber Security Threat Management 
      Vendors
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			While the market for smart grid cyber security is still 
      nascent, the competitive landscape includes established smart grid 
      specialists, niche players, and well-known enterprise security vendors.
			Paradoxically, although the larger cyber security market is 
      often considered quite mature, this niche &#8211; smart grid cyber security &#8211; 
      is not mature at all.
			For the moment, in fact, size 
      and scale actually appear to be somewhat of a disadvantage, and 
      specialist companies have thus far fared well.
			The 
      ability to react quickly has so far prevailed over the advantages of 
      larger, more established providers.
			However, that is 
      unlikely to be the case going forward.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			According to a new Pike Pulse report published by Pike 
      Research, the vendors best positioned in the rapidly 
      evolving threat management market, a key segment within the larger smart 
      grid cyber security sector, are Industrial Defender, IBM, and 
      NitroSecurity.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Smart grid cyber security remains a new market with an intriguing 
      mix of innovators, control system specialists, and multinational 
      security vendors,&#8221; says senior analyst Bob Lockhart.
			&#8220;There 
      are few enforceable regulations and many utilities have not yet deployed 
      a full security solution.
			There is much to play for in this 
      market, and success is likely to require a mix of innovation, utility 
      operations knowledge, and financial resources.
			No one 
      vendor has all of these yet.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The highest-scoring company in this Pike Pulse report, Industrial 
      Defender, has a detailed suite of industrial control system 
      (ICS)-specific offerings for network security, event management, 
      correlation, and compliance.
			Unlike most of the companies 
      pioneering this field, Industrial Defender has good political capital 
      with utilities&#8217; operations teams.
			To date, the company has 
      been the strongest innovator in developing solutions that are specific 
      to smart grid cyber security.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The only large multinational to rank in Pike Research&#8217;s Leaders 
      category, IBM is perhaps the only vendor taking a big picture view of 
      the smart grid and cyber security markets going forward.
			This 
      could work against the company in the short term when it comes to 
      specific product sales, but the vision is compelling.
			The 
      third company to score in the Leaders category of this Pike Pulse, 
      NitroSecurity, was until recently an independent startup.
			McAfee, 
      itself owned by Intel, completed its acquisition of NitroSecurity on 
      November 30, 2011.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The &#8220;Pike 
      Pulse Report: Smart Grid Cyber Security Threat Management&#8221; 
      evaluates 15 of the leading cyber security threat management vendors in 
      the smart grid market and rates them on 12 criteria for strategy and 
      execution, including vision, go-to-market strategy, partnerships, 
      product strategy and roadmap, technical innovation, geographic reach, 
      market share, sales and marketing, product performance and features, 
      product portfolio, control system focus, and staying power.
			Using 
      Pike Research&#8217;s proprietary Pike Pulse methodology, vendors are 
      profiled, rated, and ranked with the goal of providing industry 
      participants with an objective assessment of these companies&#8217; relative 
      strengths and weaknesses in the emerging smart grid cyber security 
      threat management marketplace.

      report is available for free download on the firm&#8217;s website.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 26 (Reuters) - Jones Lang LaSalle Inc said
on Thursday that it has hired Toshinobu Kasai, previously Japan

brokerage's business in Japan for the last 12 years, was
stepping down and would take on the role of chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kasai launched Goldman Sachs Realty in Asia, having joined
Goldman Sachs Group Inc in 1999 from Daiwa Securities
Group Inc, and became a Goldman partner in 2004. He
takes up his new role from April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kasai is well known and respected in the Japanese banking
and real estate markets and is the ideal candidate to build on
the legacy that Hamaoka leaves us with," said Alastair Hughes,
Asia chief executive for Jones Lang LaSalle. "I am confident
that Kasai's extensive experience in financial services and real
estate will enable him to successfully drive our business
forward."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COATESVILLE, New Zealand (Reuters) - Kim Dotcom, the founder of file-sharing site Megaupload.com who faces a lengthy jail term in the United States if convicted of racketeering, money laundering and Internet piracy, seems to have a mischievous sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after arriving in New Zealand in 2010 and moving into a sprawling luxury estate near Auckland, Dotcom emailed a neighbor who had raised questions about his character, having previously been convicted as a hacker in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The email was addressed to the local Neighborhood Watch, a community group aimed at stopping crime in the Coatesville area, a nouveau riche community of hobby farms and wealthy city workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First of all, let me assure you that having a criminal neighbor like me comes with benefits," Dotcom, also known as Kim Schmitz, wrote in the email, which was sent to Reuters by neighbor France Komoroske.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"1. Our newly opened local money laundering facility can help you with your tax fraud optimization. 2. Our network of international insiders can provide you with valuable stock tips. 3. My close personal relations with other (far worse) criminals can help you whenever you have to deal with a nasty neighbor," Dotcom quipped in the email, which Reuters has not been able to corroborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komoroske said the email startled her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dotcom did try to allay his neighbor's concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In all seriousness: My wife, two kids and myself love New Zealand and 'We come in peace'," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fifteen years ago I was a hacker and 10 years ago I was convicted for insider trading. Hardly the kind of crimes you need to start a witch hunt for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since then I have been a good boy, my criminal records have been cleared, and I created a successful Internet company that employs 100+ people," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dotcom then asked his neighbor to choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now you can make a choice: 1: Call Interpol, the CIA, and the Queen of England and try to get me on the next plane out of New Zealand. 2: Sit back, relax and give me a chance to do good for New Zealand and possibly the neighborhood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctom then invited his neighbor over for coffee, adding "... and don't forget to bring the cocaine (joke). All the best, Kim."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komoroske said she replied to Dotcom, saying, "We'd love to come over for coffee. How's tomorrow?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the invitation was never taken up, after Dotcom demanded Komoroske bring another neighbor, calling the two of them "leaders of the Coatesville Inquisition movement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was unable to contact Dotcom, who is in custody, and an email to his lawyer was not answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other neighbors spoken to by Reuters said Doctom lived almost a reclusive life in his rented 30-acre estate, occasionally seen driving on the local winding roads, but getting his entourage to organize any jobs on the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Zealand judge on Wednesday ordered Dotcom - who stands 2 meters (6 ft 6 inches) tall and weighs more than 130 kg (285 lbs) - to be held in custody for another month, saying the suspected Internet pirate posed a significant flight risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dotcom, a German national also known as Kim Tim Jim Vestor, faces a February 22 hearing of an extradition application by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say Dotcom was the ringleader of a group that netted $175 million by copying and distributing music, movies and other copyrighted content without authorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyers say his company, megaupload.com, simply offered online storage, and that he will fight extradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Perry, Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Scouts for housing, office space; considers seismic tender&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* France's Total may be next to follow Exxon into Kurdistan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Acquisitions, relinquishment, consolidation expected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jon Hemming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARBIL, Iraq, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil,
the first oil major to move into Iraqi Kurdistan, is quietly
mobilising in Arbil despite strenuous objections from the
central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the bold play came to light in November, the company
has kept silent - fueling speculation that it froze the deal and
bowed to Baghdad, which has long held that all foreign oil deals
signed with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) are illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kurdish officials insist that investment is going ahead
and movement on the ground supports their claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Exxon) are definitely here and they are definitely
assessing living and working accommodation," said a Western
industry source in Arbil, at the heart of Iraq's northern
Kurdish region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are around 10 individuals here at any one time
looking at what it takes to fully mobilise here - office space,
housing space, these types of things. No oil company comes in in
a day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon executives met the region's Natural Resources Minister
Ashti Hawrami last week, sources in Arbil said, and are
preparing to issue a tender for seismic work for some, if not
all, of the six exploration blocks acquired in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move north sparked fury in Baghdad, which is threatening
to take action against Exxon - in charge of developing the
supergiant West Qurna-1 oil field in southern Iraq. Exxon has
been summoned to the oil ministry for final talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the discussions would take place
before the U.S. major's fourth quarter results on Jan. 31 - when
it is also expected to go public with its Kurdistan investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, however, it is business as usual -
production at West Qurna-1 has risen to about 390,000 barrels
per day and Exxon continues to lead a multi-billion dollar water
injection project that is crucial to boosting output in the
south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSOLIDATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before signing the deal with Kurdistan, Exxon was sure to
have weighed any possible legal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm sure Exxon has more lawyers than probably there are
Ministry of Oil officials in Baghdad," said the industry source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such calculations are likely to influence other oil majors
who may be considering moving into Kurdistan, and the lack of
concrete action from Baghdad as yet is sure to reinforce the
belief that it could prove a sound investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KRG's Hawrami told Reuters this month the KRG was in
talks with other oil majors and he expected further agreements
to be signed in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of security, political instability, bureaucracy and the
relatively unattractive oil deals in the rest of Iraq are
driving international oil majors towards following Exxon's lead
and signing exploration and production contracts with Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Exxon snapped up the last unclaimed Kurdish
territory, new arrivals will be looking to farm into existing
blocs.  France's Total is keen to move into the north,
sources said, and a link up with Anglo-French explorer Perenco
in the Sindi-Amedi block along the Turkish border is one
scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total also has a minority stake in the Halfaya oil field in
southern Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other names frequently mentioned are Eni and Lukoil
- that are also involved in the south of Iraq. Chevron 
and Conoco Phillips, which have nothing at stake, may
also be interested, said the Western industry source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Lukoil spokesman dismissed the possibility of the Russian
company heading north. "Lukoil does not want to work in
Kurdistan," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ashti Hawrami was very clever in the way he set up the oil
industry here, starting with small companies to get things off
the ground," said an Western oil executive who declined to be
named. "It was almost designed to lure in the oil majors, and
that is what we are seeing now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the KRG estimating it has 45 billion barrels of oil
reserves, oil executives continue to mill around the luxury
five-star Rotana hotel in the Kurdish capital Arbil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the calculation and hard-bargaining goes on behind the
blast walls of ministries and the smoked glass of swanky hotels,
the city of Arbil is showing all the signs of an oil boom town
in the making, a far cry from the dusty backwater before 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the latest Porsches, Maseratis and Range Rovers jostle
with the albeit largely new pick-up trucks preferred by the
masses on the still pot-holed roads. Five-star hotels are
swiftly springing up and Kurdish shoppers buy designer brands at
swish shopping malls with an air of confidence in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Six of Snow White's seven dwarves have them, along with Merlin the Magician and Aladdin's genie, and now men working at Disneyland and Walt Disney World can sport one too -- a beard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From next Friday, front line male employees at Disney's parks and resorts will be allowed to grow a beard in the biggest change to the company's conservative, clean-cut dress code since pantyhose became optional for female employees in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change came during the company's periodic review of employee requirements, and had been requested by some "cast members," which is what Disney calls employees who work face-to-face with the public, Disney spokeswoman Andrea Finger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're careful to maintain our heritage and the integrity of our brand," Finger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brand includes the "Disney Look," described as fresh, clean, neat and approachable. The dress code governs everything from hair color and style to jewelry and fingernail length. The rules will require beards to be short and neat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facial hair had been banned at the Disney company since the 1950s opening of Disneyland in California, but that was relaxed in 2000 when the company allowed moustaches with strict rules on bushiness, width and length, said Eric Clinton, a Disney union leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton said the response by younger workers to the change was: "Finally, I can take a vacation and grow a beard." However, some of the more senior Disney employees "tend to be a little more traditional and consider this a departure from the heritage we've been taught by Disney," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is also instituting "casual Fridays" when behind-the-scenes workers may wear neat jeans and polo shirts, and female workers may wear sandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Michelle Nichols and Paul Thomasch)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Must-Have Credit Card For Disney Fans Offers The Ability to Earn

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      Disney Rewards LLC, announced today the launch of Disney&#8217;s Premier Visa&#174; 
      Card from Chase. The new card offers customers ways to earn rewards 
      twice as fast, the opportunity to now redeem toward airline travel in 
      addition to most everything Disney, plus access to special 
      Cardmember-only perks when visiting Walt Disney World&#174; 
      and the Disneyland&#174; Resorts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      stores, gas stations and most Disney locations at Walt Disney World&#174;

      Cruise Line&#174; and Disney Store. Cardmembers earn 1%

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We developed Disney&#8217;s Premier Visa Card with one simple objective in 
      mind &#8211; to deliver what Disney&#8217;s customers told us was most important in 
      a rewards credit card &#8211; earning rewards faster,&#8221; said Robert Belan, 
      General Manager, Chase Card Services. &#8220;The ability to earn 2% on every 
      day card purchases &#8211; specifically at restaurants, gas stations and 
      grocery stores &#8211; was a key theme from our research and we're pleased to 
      offer that as a benefit on this new card.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to being able to redeem Disney Dream Reward Dollars 
      toward Disney hotel stays, Theme Park tickets, cruises, movie tickets 
      and merchandise, Disney&#8217;s Premier Visa Cardmembers can also redeem 
      toward airline travel on any airline to any destination, with no 
      block-out dates. Cardmembers simply buy airline tickets with their card 
      and then pay themselves back by redeeming reward dollars for a credit on 
      their monthly statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since we first launched the Disney Rewards&#174; 
      Visa Card in 2003, our priority has been providing a rewards program our 
      customers can really use &#8211; including a huge variety of rewards and easy, 
      flexible redemption,&#8221; said Jennifer Cohen, Senior Vice President of 
      Customer Relationship Management for The Walt Disney Company. &#8220;For 
      example, we have never had block-out dates and Cardmembers can redeem 
      toward just about anything Disney from Theme Park tickets, hotel stays, 
      dining and cruises to toys, apparel, movies, games, books and more. 
      Offering more rewards on everyday purchases and the option to redeem 
      toward Disney or airline travel are two more features intended to 
      deliver on the Disney promise of high quality at good value.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney&#8217;s Premier Visa Cardmembers also enjoy access to amazing perks 365

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE Jan 25 (Reuters) - Infosys Ltd,
India's No. 2 software services provider, said it was being
investigated in Texas over its sponsorship and use of short-term
U.S. business visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infosys said it received a subpoena last May from the U.S
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas to provide
documents to a grand jury related its use of B1 visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on
Wednesday, the company said it has now been told by the U.S.
Attorney's Office that it and some employees are targets of the
investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B1 visas allow companies to send their employees to the
United States for short-term business purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want reiterate that we are cooperating with the
investigation and that we've never had a policy of visa misuse,"
Infosys spokeswoman Sarah Vanita Gideon said by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gideon said she could not immediately say how many B1 visas
Infosys had applied for or been granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COATESVILLE, New Zealand (Reuters) - Kim Dotcom, the founder of file-sharing site Megaupload.com who faces a lengthy jail term in the United States if convicted of racketeering, money laundering and Internet piracy, seems to have a mischievous sense of humour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after arriving in New Zealand in 2010 and moving into a sprawling luxury estate near Auckland, Dotcom emailed a neighbour who had raised questions about his character, having previously been convicted as a hacker in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The email was addressed to the local Neighborhood Watch, a community group aimed at stopping crime in the Coatesville area, a nouveau riche community of hobby farms and wealthy city workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First of all, let me assure you that having a criminal neighbour like me comes with benefits," Dotcom, also known as Kim Schmitz, wrote in the email, which was sent to Reuters by neighbour France Komoroske.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"1. Our newly opened local money laundering facility can help you with your tax fraud optimization. 2. Our network of international insiders can provide you with valuable stock tips. 3. My close personal relations with other (far worse) criminals can help you whenever you have to deal with a nasty neighbour," Dotcom quipped in the email, which Reuters has not been able to corroborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komoroske said the email startled her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dotcom did try to allay his neighbour's concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In all seriousness: My wife, two kids and myself love New Zealand and 'We come in peace'," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fifteen years ago I was a hacker and 10 years ago I was convicted for insider trading. Hardly the kind of crimes you need to start a witch hunt for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since then I have been a good boy, my criminal records have been cleared, and I created a successful Internet company that employs 100+ people," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dotcom then asked his neighbour to choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now you can make a choice: 1: Call Interpol, the CIA, and the Queen of England and try to get me on the next plane out of New Zealand. 2: Sit back, relax and give me a chance to do good for New Zealand and possibly the neighborhood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctom then invited his neighbour over for coffee, adding "... and don't forget to bring the cocaine (joke). All the best, Kim."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komoroske said she replied to Dotcom, saying, "We'd love to come over for coffee. How's tomorrow?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the invitation was never taken up, after Dotcom demanded Komoroske bring another neighbour, calling the two of them "leaders of the Coatesville Inquisition movement".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was unable to contact Dotcom, who is in custody, and an email to his lawyer was not answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other neighbours spoken to by Reuters said Doctom lived almost a reclusive life in his rented 30-acre estate, occasionally seen driving on the local winding roads, but getting his entourage to organise any jobs on the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Zealand judge on Wednesday ordered Dotcom - who stands 2 metres (6 ft 6 inches) tall and weighs more than 130 kg (285 lbs) - to be held in custody for another month, saying the suspected Internet pirate posed a significant flight risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dotcom, a German national also known as Kim Tim Jim Vestor, faces a February 22 hearing of an extradition application by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say Dotcom was the ringleader of a group that netted $175 million by copying and distributing music, movies and other copyrighted content without authorisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyers say his company, megaupload.com, simply offered online storage, and that he will fight extradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Perry, Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Six of Snow White's seven dwarves have them, along with Merlin the Magician and Aladdin's genie, and now men working at Disneyland and Walt Disney World can sport one too -- a beard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From next Friday, front line male employees at Disney's parks and resorts will be allowed to grow a beard in the biggest change to the company's conservative, clean-cut dress code since pantyhose became optional for female employees in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change came during the company's periodic review of employee requirements, and had been requested by some "cast members," which is what Disney calls employees who work face-to-face with the public, Disney spokeswoman Andrea Finger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're careful to maintain our heritage and the integrity of our brand," Finger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brand includes the "Disney Look," described as fresh, clean, neat and approachable. The dress code governs everything from hair color and style to jewelry and fingernail length. The rules will require beards to be short and neat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facial hair had been banned at the Disney company since the 1950s opening of Disneyland in California, but that was relaxed in 2000 when the company allowed moustaches with strict rules on bushiness, width and length, said Eric Clinton, a Disney union leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton said the response by younger workers to the change was: "Finally, I can take a vacation and grow a beard." However, some of the more senior Disney employees "tend to be a little more traditional and consider this a departure from the heritage we've been taught by Disney," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is also instituting "casual Fridays" when behind-the-scenes workers may wear neat jeans and polo shirts, and female workers may wear sandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Michelle Nichols and Paul Thomasch)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COATESVILLE, New Zealand Jan 25 (Reuters) - Kim
Dotcom, the founder of file-sharing site Megaupload.com who
faces a lengthy jail term in the United States if convicted of
racketeering, money laundering and Internet piracy, seems to
have a mischievous sense of humour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after arriving in New Zealand in 2010 and moving
into a sprawling luxury estate near Auckland, Dotcom emailed a
neighbour who had raised questions about his character, having
previously been convicted as a hacker in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The email was addressed to the local Neighborhood Watch, a
community group aimed at stopping crime in the Coatesville area,
a nouveau riche community of hobby farms and wealthy city
workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First of all, let me assure you that having a criminal
neighbour like me comes with benefits," Dotcom, also known as
Kim Schmitz, wrote in the email, which was sent to Reuters by
neighbour France Komoroske.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"1. Our newly opened local money laundering facility can
help you with your tax fraud optimization. 2. Our network of
international insiders can provide you with valuable stock tips.
3. My close personal relations with other (far worse) criminals
can help you whenever you have to deal with a nasty neighbor,"
Dotcom quipped in the email, which Reuters has not been able to 
corroborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komoroske said the email startled her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dotcom did try to allay his neighbour's concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In all seriousness: My wife, two kids and myself love New
Zealand and 'We come in peace'," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fifteen years ago I was a hacker and 10 years ago I was
convicted for insider trading. Hardly the kind of crimes you
need to start a witch hunt for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since then I have been a good boy, my criminal records have
been cleared, and I created a successful Internet company that
employs 100+ people," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dotcom then asked his neighbour to choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now you can make a choice: 1: Call Interpol, the CIA, and
the Queen of England and try to get me on the next plane out of
New Zealand. 2: Sit back, relax and give me a chance to do good
for New Zealand and possibly the neighborhood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctom then invited his neighbour over for coffee, adding
"... and don't forget to bring the cocaine (joke). All the best,
Kim."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komoroske said she replied to Dotcom, saying, "We'd love to
come over for coffee. How's tomorrow?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the invitation was never taken up, after Dotcom demanded
Komoroske bring another neighbour, calling the two of them
"leaders of the Coatesville Inquisition movement".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was unable to contact Dotcom, who is in custody, and
an email to his lawyer was not answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other neighbours spoken to by Reuters said Doctom lived
almost a reclusive life in his rented 30-acre estate,
occasionally seen driving on the local winding roads, but
getting his entourage to organise any jobs on the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Zealand judge on Wednesday ordered Dotcom - who stands
2 metres (6 ft 6 inches) tall and weighs more than 130 kg (285
lbs) - to be held in custody for another month, saying the
suspected Internet pirate posed a significant flight risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dotcom, a German national also known as Kim Tim Jim Vestor,
faces a Feb. 22 hearing of an extradition application by the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say Dotcom was the ringleader of a group that
netted $175 million by copying and distributing music, movies
and other copyrighted content without authorisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyers say his company, megaupload.com, simply offered
online storage, and that he will fight extradition.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 24 (Reuters) - Chinese real estate
investor Gaw Capital Partners is in talks to buy Goldman Sachs'
 London HQ for about 300 million pounds ($468 million),
the latest deal underlining the safe haven appeal of the city's
property market, a source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaw, through its Downtown Properties vehicle, is in the

office campus development the bank is planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 370,526 square foot property was put on the
market after the former owner, Canadian developer Jesta Group,
defaulted on debt repayments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of high-profile City office properties came on to
the market in the autumn months as their owners looked to
capitalise on prices that rose 34 percent between June 2009 and
September 2011, fuelled by demand from cash rich overseas
investors looking for a safe haven investment, said Investment
Property Databank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sellers also sought to cash in before a potential downwards
lurch in the UK economy as a result of the euro zone sovereign

&lt;p&gt;CAMPOS, Brazil (Reuters) - A Brazilian prosecutor plans to file criminal charges against Chevron Corp and some of its local managers within weeks, adding the threat of prison sentences to an $11 billion civil lawsuit as punishment for a November offshore oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing in federal court in Campos, Brazil, will likely include a request for criminal indictment of George Buck, chief executive of Chevron's Brazil unit, as well as other staff, three Brazilian government officials involved in the case told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd, whose rig was used in the operation, and some of its employees in Brazil are also expected to be charged, according to the officials, who requested anonymity because the case has not been presented to a judge. It is up to a judge to determine whether to accept the charges and proceed with indictments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backlash against the Chevron spill has highlighted the risks that energy companies face as they rush to get a piece of Brazil's oil bonanza. Chevron's legal troubles come as new oil rules give Brazil's government more control over the country's vast oil wealth. The regulatory overhaul has also delayed investment projects and new drilling licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buck and Chevron acted in a "careless and irresponsible way," an official who investigated the 2,400-barrel spill told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official said it is unlikely that people facing charges will be arrested in the near term or be barred from leaving Brazil. As the case advances and more evidence is collected, however, such measures could be applied, the official added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Reuters informed Chevron that charges were pending, company spokesman Kurt Glaubitz said "Chevron believes that the charges are without merit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron is confident that once all the facts are fully examined, they will demonstrate that Chevron responded appropriately and responsibly to the incident," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean spokesman R. Thaddeus Vayda declined to comment. Transocean is the world's biggest offshore oil rig operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian prosecutors have become more active in going after alleged polluters, sometimes bringing aggressive charges to encourage offenders to settle cases. They are moving far more swiftly than their U.S. counterparts: BP's 2010 spill in the Gulf of Mexico, more than 1,000 times larger in terms of oil, has not yet resulted in any criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, charges in cases such as these can take a decade before all appeals are exhausted. That could saddle Chevron and Transocean with years of costly litigation, said Paulo Augusto Silva Novaes, a lawyer with the Rio de Janeiro firm of Benjo, Garcia, Souto &amp; Novaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charges would come more than a month after a Federal Police investigator submitted a report saying Chevron and Transocean took "unacceptable" risks in the Frade oil field off Brazil's southern coast, and recommended that 17 individuals be indicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 12 of those people are from Chevron, according to legal documents reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is also fighting a separate 20-billion-real ($11 billion) lawsuit brought by the same Brazilian federal prosecutors. Chevron also is contesting an $18 billion judgment in Ecuador related to environmental contamination from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRESSURE KICK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 7, a well drilled by Chevron using a Transocean rig 107 kilometers (73 miles) from the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, experienced a pressure "kick" after tapping into an oil reservoir in Frade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emergency blow-out preventer was activated, plugging the well 1,200 meters (3,937 feet) below the ocean surface. But days later, Chevron discovered oil seeps from the seafloor hundreds of meters from the plugged well. Pressure caused a breach of the well wall far beneath the seabed, allowing oil to infiltrate surrounding rock and work its way into the ocean, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police and prosecutors allege that Chevron knew it was drilling in a high pressure area and that rock structures above the reservoir were fragile, factors that resulted in the spill and should have prompted more caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This well could not and should not have been drilled," the Federal Police said in a December 20 report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies taking any undue risk and says Brazilian authorities approved its drilling plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pressure was estimated using complex modeling and the data obtained from the 50 wellbores previously drilled at the Frade project," Chevron's Glaubitz said in a statement. "However, it is not uncommon to experience different conditions or pressures during drilling operations than those previously experienced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it acted quickly and correctly to stanch the leak from the seafloor within four days. Its operations and spill response adhered to the "best practices" of the oil industry, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian prosecutors have independence to file criminal and civil charges against companies and their employees for environmental damages, said Gustavo Trindade, who was chief legal advisor to Marina Silva, a former Brazilian Environment Minister and presidential candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cases rarely result in convictions, large fines or prison sentences, said Novaes, a corporate law expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, state-run oil company Petrobras, a partner with Chevron at Frade, is still appealing convictions and more than 100 million reais of damages resulting from an offshore oil platform accident in 2001 and a giant oil spill in Rio in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil from the recent Chevron leak did not reach shore and was less than 0.1 percent of BP's 4.9 million barrel Gulf of Mexico spill in 2010. The Frade leak was also much smaller than several previous spills in Brazil by Petrobras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrobras owns 30 percent of Frade. Chevron own 52 percent and is responsible for field management. The rest is owned by Frade Japao, a unit of Japan's Inpex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's oil regulator, the ANP, has suspended Chevron's drilling license at Frade. The ANP and Brazil's environmental protection agency Ibama have fined Chevron more than $50 million as a result of the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says that there is no evidence the Frade leak, which prosecutors estimate was closer to 3,000 barrels, has had any impact on aquatic life or on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil is still leaking from the sea floor, government officials said. The oil has leaked at an average rate of 1.4 liters a day for the last week and is being captured by undersea traps, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent flyovers have not detected oil on the ocean surface, Chevron added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's newfound oil wealth - including at least 15 billion barrels of deepwater discoveries since 2007 - puts the country among the world's most promising oil frontiers. Since the new finds, the government has stopped auctions of oil concessions in its richest offshore areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrobras will be the operator and hold a minimum 30 percent stake in all future oil projects in those areas. Under a new system, oil producers must share their production with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, California-based Chevron has operated in Brazil for nearly 100 years. It has invested around $2 billion in the country and has plans to spend several billion more on future projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares were up 0.37 percent at $108.10 on Thursday in New York. Transocean shares rose 3.62 percent to 44.39 Swiss francs ($46.73) in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Todd Benson, Alix Freedman, Jonathan Leff and Bob Burgdorfer)&lt;/p&gt;

			Robbins Geller Rudman  Dowd LLP Files Class Action Suit against 
      Walter Energy, Inc.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Robbins Geller Rudman  Dowd LLP (&#8220;Robbins Geller&#8221;) (http://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases/walterenergy/) 
      today announced that a class action has been commenced in the United 
      States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama on behalf of 
      purchasers of the common stock of Walter Energy, Inc. (&#8220;Walter&#8221; or the 
      &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NYSE: WLT) between April 20, 2011 and September 21, 2011, 
      inclusive (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later 
      than 60 days from today. If you wish to discuss this action or have any 
      questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please 
      contact plaintiff&#8217;s counsel, Samuel H. Rudman or David A. Rosenfeld of 
      Robbins Geller at 800/449-4900 or 619/231-1058, or via e-mail at djr@rgrdlaw.com. 
      If you are a member of this class, you can view a copy of the complaint 
      as filed or join this class action online at http://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases/walterenergy/. 
      Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead 
      plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing 
      and remain an absent class member.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint charges Walter and certain of its officers and directors 
      with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Walter, through 
      its consolidated subsidiaries, mines and exports hard coking coal for 
      the global steel industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued 
      materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company&#8217;s 
      business and prospects. Specifically, defendants misrepresented and/or 
      failed to disclose the following adverse facts: (i) that the Company was 
      experiencing so-called &#8220;squeeze&#8221; events in Alabama and lower coal 
      transportation rates in Canada that significantly reduced Walter&#8217;s coal 
      production; (ii) that the Company&#8217;s commitment to ship more than 700,000 
      tons of coal in the second quarter at first quarter sales prices would 
      result in a material adverse effect on Walter&#8217;s average sales prices and 
      operating results during the second quarter; (iii) that Walter was 
      experiencing a significant decline in its margins and profitability; and 
      (iv) that, based on the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis

&lt;p&gt;Attention everyone whos suing or planning to sue JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns, or Bears onetime mortgage unit EMC over mortgage-backed securities gone bad: Those indefatigable bond insurers are busy amassing whistleblower evidence for you. Last Friday, Patterson Belknap Webb  Tyler  which represents the monolines Syncora, Assured Guaranty, and Ambac in fraud and breach-of-contract suits stemming from EMC mortgages  began deposing witnesses from outside companies that evaluated the underlying loans in Bears mortgage-backed offerings. (The Nov. 18 amended complaint in Assureds Manhattan federal court case against EMC and JPMorgan outlines the whistleblower assertions Patterson has come up with.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first deposition was of a former employee of Watterson Prime, a contractor that re-underwrote mortgages in EMC securitizations. The employee has claimed that Watterson simply rubber-stamped the loans; even mortgages that the contractor rejected, she has said, were nevertheless placed in MBS loan pools. Assured and the other monolines argue, of course, that they were deceived about the supposedly independent review of the underlying mortgage loan pools in the securities they agreed to insure. Whistleblower deposition testimony could be powerful evidence to support their arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We only know about the whistleblower depositions because of a letter JPMorgans lawyers at Greenberg Traurig sent to Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos, who is overseeing the Ambac case in state court, and to U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty, whos presiding over Syncoras Manhattan federal court case against EMC. (JPMorgan isnt a defendant in that action.) The Jan. 18 letter identified the Watterson confidential witness by name, accused Patterson Belknap of ambush litigation tactics, and asked the judges to order Patterson to turn over a signed affidavit from her in advance of the Jan. 20 deposition. Greenberg also asked for affidavits from three other whistleblowers whose depositions have been scheduled. Despite a Jan. 19 Patterson letter claiming privilege for the whistleblower affidavits it has obtained, the monolines were ordered to turn over the witness statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blogger named Teri Buhl got wind of the scuffle over the whistleblower affidavits and published a post accusing JPMorgan and Greenberg Traurig of attempting to intimidate the monolines whistleblower witnesses. The banks lawyers promptly responded with a letter to Crotty, complaining that Patterson Belknap was leaking non-public information. We do object to plaintiffs counsels repeated use of reporters such as this one to generate articles like this, the letter said. We would appreciate the court directing plaintiffs counsel to refrain from this activity in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterson countered Greenbergs assertion in a fiery Jan. 23 letter to Crotty. (All of the correspondence in the flap is here.) [EMC's] letter falsely asserts that our firm disclosed non-public information to the press, the Patterson response said. That simply is not true. Patterson pointed out that all of the factual information in Buhls post came from public-record documents  in a flap EMC itself precipitated when it disclosed the Watterson witnesss name in its demand for her affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterson also took the opportunity to needle EMC about the whistleblowers depositions: EMC seeks to divert attention from the fact that the testimony the whistleblower gave on Friday (as well as testimony offered by a Georgia law enforcement officer on Saturday) confirmed the statements in the affidavits that EMC knowingly misrepresented in its due diligence process, which was fundamentally and deliberately deficient, the Jan. 23 letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crotty  who still hasnt issued the loss-causation summary judgment ruling that was expected by the end of last month  denied Greenbergs request for a gag order on Tuesday, writing that as to talking to the press about public judicial events, the parties should be guided by the code of conduct and related opinion on ethics, concerning good behavior of attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ive reported that MBS suits against JPMorgan are suddenly in vogue. That trend continued this week with the 256-page complaint John Hancocks lawyers at Grant  Eisenhofer filed in Manhattan State Supreme Court. The public record is already full of grist for the plaintiffs lawyers filing these suits, but deposition testimony from underwriting whistleblowers is going to be quite a significant addition to the record. Once again, the monolines are trailblazing for MBS investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left a phone message for JPMorgan counsel Richard Edlin of Greenberg and sent an email request for comment to a bank spokesperson. Neither got back to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court threw out an injunction that Chevron Corp had won to block enforcement of an $18 billion judgment in Ecuador for polluting the Amazon jungle and damaging the health of residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Chevron acted prematurely in seeking to block enforcement of the judgment worldwide, given that the residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region had not yet sought to enforce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says the Ecuadorean judgment is fraudulent and is appealing it separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's decision overturned a March 2011 injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan to block enforcement of the judgment, imposed by an Ecuadorean court in February 2011. The appellate court also directed Kaplan to dismiss Chevron's complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron could challenge the judgment's validity "only defensively, in response to attempted enforcement," which the Ecuadorean plaintiffs "have not yet undertaken anywhere, and might never undertake in New York," Judge Gerard Lynch wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel expressed no view on the merits of Chevron's fraud allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Chevron said the decision "may change the order in which courts address the fraud being perpetrated in the Lago Agrio case, but it will not affect the ultimate outcome. In fact, the 2nd Circuit acknowledges the extensive evidence of fraud submitted by Chevron."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Tyrrell, a partner at Patton Boggs representing the Ecuadorean plaintiffs, said his clients are pleased with the appellate court decision, and added: "The Ecuadorean plaintiffs are not coming to New York to enforce this judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's decision is the latest in a nearly two-decade conflict between Chevron and the Lago Agrio residents, which Lynch said "must be among the most extensively told in the history of the American federal judiciary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It stemmed from environmental contamination from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001. Oil companies are watching the case closely because it may affect other cases accusing companies of polluting areas where they operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 20, Chevron asked Ecuador's Supreme Court to review the $18 billion judgment, after an intermediate appeals court in that country upheld it earlier in the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOO MUCH FRICTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judgment against Chevron includes $8.6 billion of environmental damages, a sum that was more than doubled because the San Ramon, California-based company failed to make a public apology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron had sought protection from the judgment under a New York state law, the Recognition Act, that governs the recognition of money judgments imposed in foreign countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch, however, said that granting the type of "speculative" relief sought by Chevron would "unquestionably provoke extensive friction between legal systems" by encouraging challenges in New York to the legitimacy of courts in foreign countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Recognition Act and the common-law principles it encapsulates are motivated by an interest to provide for the enforcement of foreign judgments, not to prevent them," Lynch wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rule in Chevron's favor would "turn that framework on its head," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares closed Thursday down $1.14, or 1.1 percent, at $106.59 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v. Naranjo et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 11-1150 and 11-1264.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Maureen Bavdek, John Wallace and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A Pennsylvania woman who faked her own kidnapping while actually at Disney World was sentenced on Thursday to 100 months in prison for swindling her employer and family members out of more than $600,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the sentencing in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, Bonnie Sweeten, 40, was ordered to prison for just over 8 years and to pay more than a $1 million in restitution, the U.S. Attorney's office in Philadelphia said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sweeten stole funds from family members, from the law office where she had been employed and from the law firm's clients," the prosecutor's office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie Sweeten captured headlines in 2009 when she triggered an all-out search by federal and local authorities by making a phony 911 call to say she and her 9-year-old daughter had been kidnapped by two black men in a truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, prosecutors said, the 40-year-old mother from suburban Bucks County had taken her daughter to Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was previously sentenced to up to 12 months in Bucks County jail after admitting to the kidnapping ruse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hartman said the trick was part of the larger fraud for which she was sentenced to 8 years and 4 months on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As part of her scheme to defraud, Sweeten concocted an elaborate hoax that she and her daughter had been kidnapped in order to deceive family members and law enforcement as to her whereabouts," the prosecutor's office said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeten's lawyers had asked for a sentence of less than 7 years in prison. Prosecutors had asked for 10 years behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of the fraud was a matter of debate throughout the days long sentencing hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Sweeten was sentenced by U.S. District Judge William Yohn, Jr., the prosecutor released the statement saying she stole more than $600,000 through various schemes that involved identity theft and forged signatures on documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She also forged a signature of a judge on a court order for the purpose of fraudulently withdrawing client funds from a bank," the prosecutor's office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Barbara Goldberg; Editing by Paul Thomasch)&lt;/p&gt;

      Complement Ads during Super Bowl XLVI Broadcast
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The iconic animated Coca-Cola polar bears are back. And, just in time 
      for the Super Bowl XLVI broadcast, they now have a TV, computer, smart 
      phone and tablet device. That&#8217;s right, just like 100 million other 
      football fans from around the world, the Coca-Cola polar bears will&#160;tune 
      in to watch the big game as they&#160;open happiness with an ice-cold Coke 
      and chill on their &#8220;snowfa&#8221; in the Arctic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola is capitalizing on the growing trend of second screen media 
      consumption to extend its connection with fans beyond the television 
      screen to the computer screen and the social media universe. Coca-Cola 
      is launching a unique viewing experience for fans that merges a live 
      digital stream and social media with traditional television advertising. 
      The stars of the campaign are two Coca-Cola polar bears who will be 
      watching the big game live and sharing a Coke from the comforts of their 
      Arctic ice cave.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fans can join in on the fun and watch the game with the polar bears &#8220;in 
      the Arctic&#8221; by visiting www.CokePolarBowl.com. 
      The digital platform uses proprietary technology to bring the 
      computer-generated polar bears to life through live animation &#8211; a 
      technological first for the big game or any media event. The live stream 
      will showcase the animated polar bears&#8217; reactions to all the plays on 
      the field, the halftime show and highly anticipated commercials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a first for Coca-Cola, the polar bears will be &#8220;taking over&#8221; the 
      official @CocaCola Twitter account on game day. On February 5, the 
      profile photo for Coca-Cola will change from the current Coca-Cola logo 
      to an image of the two polar bears. Using the hashtag 
      #GameDayPolarBears, the polar bears will be sharing their unique 
      perspectives on the game and engaging directly with consumers. Fans will 
      be able to exchange tweets with the bears and share select moments from 
      the live stream with friends via social media. For example, Twitter 
      followers may see this post from a Coca-Cola polar bear: &#8220;If you tweet 
      us photos of your own game day party we&#8217;ll feature them in our live 
      stream. That is, if the penguin deems them worthy.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While the two polar bears are both football fans, they are rooting for 
      opposing teams, adding to the fun of watching their expressions of 
      delight or frustration as the game unfolds. Throughout the live stream a 
      variety of ancillary characters, including penguins and a young polar 
      bear stop by the bears&#8217; snow cave to share a Coke and enjoy the 
      festivities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola is part of the fun when friends and family gather to 
      celebrate major events like the Super Bowl. This year, we&#8217;re offering 
      fans even more ways to connect over a Coke and be entertained by our 
      well-loved iconic polar bears,&#8221; said Katie Bayne, president and general 
      manager of sparkling beverages, Coca-Cola North America. &#8220;Our bears will 
      come to life on television, digital and mobile screens, as they invite 
      people everywhere to join them watching the big game live from the 
      arctic.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Two new polar bear television ads will air during the first and second 
      quarter of the Super Bowl broadcast. The ads are part of the Coca-Cola 
      &#8220;Open Happiness&#8221; campaign and reflect the digital content from the live 
      stream at www.CokePolarBowl.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        &#8220;Superstition,&#8221; an animated :30, features one of the polar bears 
        showing his superstitious side by watching the game with his fingers, 
        toes, arms, legs and even his scarf crossed. When the other polar bear 
        hands him an ice-cold Coke, he struggles mightily in an attempt to 
        drink it without uncrossing anything &#8211; ultimately failing to get it to 
        his mouth. His friend, watching this hopeless display, finally comes 
        to the rescue by placing a straw in the bottle. The superstitious 
        polar bear smiles and takes a big sip as he kicks back to watch the 
        game with his ice-cold Coke &#8211; everything still crossed.
      
			
        &#8220;Catch,&#8221; an animated :60, opens in real time with the polar bears 
        watching the big game from their snow cave. During the commercial 
        break, one polar bear steps outside the cave to take a breather. The 
        bear spots a group of polar bears hanging out and drinking ice-cold 
        bottles of Coca-Cola. They toss him a Coke. As the polar bear tries to 
        catch the bottle, he bobbles it, loses his balance and begins to slide 
        on the ice. As he slips and fumbles with the bottle of Coke &#8211; and the 
        other polar bears attempt to help him and save the day &#8211; his stumbling 
        turns into unintentional, but impressive, football-like movements. He 
        finally comes to a sliding halt while clutching his precious Coke. 
        Inside the snow cave, the other polar bear acknowledges the 
        unbelievable scene by giving a little &#8220;golf clap&#8221; raising a bottle of 
        Coke in a toast.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Two versions of &#8220;Catch&#8221; will be ready to deploy &#8211; depending on what is 
      happening in the game and which polar bear is most in need of a Coke 
      based on his favorite team&#8217;s performance. Both of the spots conclude 
      with a call for consumers to join the polar bears live at www.CokePolarBowl.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our digital experience and our new animated polar bear ads highlight 
      the connections and incredible experiences that are created by sharing a 
      Coke,&#8221; said Alison Lewis, chief marketing officer, Coca-Cola North 
      America. &#8220;We offer fans a light-hearted look at how Coca-Cola can bring 
      everybody &#8211; whether human or animated polar bears &#8211; together to 
      celebrate moments of happiness and connection even when they are 
      cheering for opposing teams.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After the game, fans can send a Coke and a little digital happiness to 
      fellow friends and followers from Coca-Cola&#8217;s &#8220;AHHH Giver&#8221; and &#8220;ARGH 
      Reliever&#8221; app on Facebook. Fans of the winning team can share the 
      cheering &#8220;Ahhh&#8221; Coca-Cola polar bear and fans of the losing team can 
      send the &#8220;Argh&#8221; polar bear. Both images will send a coupon for a Coke 
      and a little happiness from the Arctic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Animators will control the bears and their environment during the game 
      using a combination of traditional video gaming controllers and a 
      proprietary PC-based interface. The animators will be stationed in New 
      York City, in a control room located at MLB Advanced Media, which is a 
      leader in the delivery of streaming content.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the sixth consecutive year that Coca-Cola commercials will 
      appear during the Super Bowl broadcast. Coca-Cola worked with Wieden + 
      Kennedy in Portland, Ore., to create and produce the CokePolarBowl.com 
      experience and corresponding TV spots. They collaborated with both 
      Animal Logic in Sydney, Australia and Framestore in New York and London 
      to develop the animations and digital technology.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said President Barack Obama's decision to expand investigations into home lending and sales of mortgage securities could stop settlement talks with the states over foreclosure practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It has a pretty good chance of derailing it," Dimon said in a televised interview with CNBC from Davos, Switzerland on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama, in his State of the Union address Tuesday, said he has asked his attorney general to create a special unit of prosecutors to expand investigations into home lending and packaging of mortgage-backed securities. It is not clear how the new unit will be different from earlier investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the largest U.S. bank and one of the larger servicers of mortgage loans. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo &amp; Co, Citigroup and Ally Financial Inc have been in talks with state attorneys general for months about settling allegations of foreclosure abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks and states have been discussing a plan that would have the banks pay $25 billion to homeowners through reductions in principal on mortgage loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it would be better for America if that settlement took place," Dimon said. "If this thing derails that, so be it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MILAN Jan 26 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co's 
franchise bottler in Italy has halted production at two of its
plants in the south of the country because of a truckers'
strike, it said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC Italia, a unit of Coca-Cola Hellenic
, said the protest had disrupted supplies for the
production of soft drinks and the bottling of mineral water as
well as transport of products from its warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truckers have blocked roads throughout Italy as opposition
mounts to tax rises and economic reforms designed to open up
competition in protected sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stoppage, which began on Monday, has also forced
carmarker Fiat to keep its plants idle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Gas link with oil also to be delayed by mild weather&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* But long-term link between gas-oil to remain in place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Henning Gloystein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Mild winters in Europe and
Asia could push the tightening of the global market for
liquefied natural gas (LNG) out to next winter and delay a
reinstallment of the oil-gas price correlation, JPMorgan said on
Thursday in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weak gas demand is reflected in prices. The benchmark UK gas
price for delivery next summer has fallen some 22 percent since
last summer as the economic crisis and a mild winter sapped
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unseasonably mild temperatures have dampened gas demand in
Europe, Japan and South Korea this winter. This could push the
tightening of the global LNG market out to next winter in our
view, given that large inventories of gas are likely to have
been accumulated in storage," the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weak gas market stands in contrast to firm oil prices,
which have been kept high by tight supplies and tensions between
Iran and the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil prices have been resilient in the face of the worsening
economic outlook ... (and) this looks set to continue as the
U.S. and EU embargo Iranian oil in 2012," JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, however, the bank said that the LNG
market would still tighten as Asian demand growth would outstrip
supply additions, and this would restore a tighter correlation
between oil and gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On balance, we still expect spot gas prices to correlate to
long-term oil-indexed prices over time, although with a more
risky outlook than before given potential economic/political
headwinds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said that European utilities, and especially
Germany's E.ON and RWE and France's GDF
Suez, would benefit from such price movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many European utilities and gas supply companies are
suffering from long-term gas deals with suppliers such as
Gazprom or Statoil, which link their import
rates to oil prices, while supply firms are forced to sell gas
to customers at lower retail prices linked to the freely traded
spot market.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/TOKYO Jan 26 (Reuters) - Jones Lang LaSalle
Inc said on Thursday it has hired Toshinobu Kasai,
previously Japan head at Goldman Sachs Real Estate Principal
Investment Area, to lead its business in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said Yoichiro Hamaoka, who had run the property
brokerage's business in Japan for the last 12 years, was
stepping down and would become chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kasai launched Goldman Sachs Realty in Asia, having joined
Goldman Sachs Group Inc in 1999 from Daiwa Securities
Group Inc, and became a Goldman partner in 2004. He
takes up his new role from April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he was at Goldman, Kasai was involved in multiple real
estate acquisitions including a building for the flagship store
of Tiffany and Co in Tokyo's Ginza district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kasai is well-known and respected in the Japanese banking
and real estate markets and is the ideal candidate to build on
the legacy that Hamaoka leaves us with," said Alastair Hughes,
Asia chief executive for Jones Lang LaSalle. "I am confident
that Kasai's extensive experience in financial services and real
estate will enable him to successfully drive our business
forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, LaSalle Investment Management, a real estate
fund-management arm of Jones Lang LaSalle, said it has appointed
Jon Zehner to the newly created role of head of global capital
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zehner, who will be based in London, will be responsible for
LaSalle's activies related to raising capital, new product
development and cross-border investments, it said in a separate
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Exxon resumes work at LNG site after one-day stoppage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* At least four people killed from landslide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PERTH, Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil
 resumed work on Wednesday at its $15.7 billion liquefied
natural gas (LNG) project in Papua New Guinea, a spokeswoman
said, a day after a landslide swept through two nearby villages
killing at least four people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil spokeswoman Rebecca Arnold said the one-day
stoppage is not expected to impact the schedule of the project
located about 7 kms (4.3 miles) from the landslide area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil leads a consortium building the LNG project, the
country's biggest-ever resource undertaking due to come on
stream in 2014. The project is expected to produce 6.6 million
tonnes on LNG per annum and could see GDP increase 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four bodies were recovered from the site of a landslide that
swept through a 1.5-kms trail of mountain settlements in central
Papua New Guinea, and the death toll is expected to mount,
government officials told Australian media Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have recovered four bodies," PNG's National Disaster
centre director Martin Mosi told the Australian Associated
Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are expecting more. I am unwilling to put a number on
that until I get confirmation from my team," Mosi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities has previously put the death toll as high as 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has offered to support landslide recovery efforts,
including helping to reopen the road to the area, Arnold said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papua New Guinea shares the island of New Guinea with
Indonesia, and is Australia's nearest neighbour, directly north.
The majority of its people live subsistence lives despite
abundant mineral wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The names of a Goldman Sachs board member and a top executive of Berkshire Hathaway surfaced on Friday as potential witnesses in the insider trading trial of Rajat Gupta, a former director of Goldman, Procter &amp; Gamble and other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, a one-time global head of the McKinsey &amp; Co consultancy firm, is the most prominent corporate executive charged in the U.S. government's broad investigation of Wall Street insider trading, a probe that used secretly recorded phone conversations as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His trial is scheduled to start on April 9 in U.S. District Court in New York. Gupta, 63, has denied the charges of securities fraud and conspiracy in providing inside tips about Goldman and Procter &amp; Gamble board meetings to hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a hearing in federal court in New York to discuss potential evidence and potential witnesses, U.S. prosecutor Reed Brodsky identified Ajit Jain, the top Berkshire Hathaway insurance executive, as a "close friend" of Gupta who has already been interviewed by the prosecution and defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jain is not accused of any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for renowned investor Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jain, who heads the company's insurance business, has been identified as a possible successor of Buffett's as chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of hedge fund managers, lawyers and executives have been convicted since 2009 in the sweeping prosecution, including Gupta's onetime friend and business associate Rajaratnam. He is serving an 11-year prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein testified at Rajaratnam's two month-long trial last year and could be called to the witness stand in Gupta's case along with other Goldman executives, according to court records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the name of Goldman board member Claes Dahlback also came up in court and he could be asked to testify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After Rajaratnam was arrested in October 2009, Dahlback asked Gupta if he knew Rajaratnam," U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said, reading from a government report on the case. "Gupta responded that Rajaratnam was a 'bad man' and further stated that Gupta lost money with Rajaratnam."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman, David Wells, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government investigators recorded at least two discussions between Rajaratnam and Gupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta's lawyer Gary Naftalis indicated that part of the defense would be to emphasize that in 2008 and 2009 - the time the alleged illegal tips took place - relations between Gupta and Rajaratnam had deteriorated. He said Gupta lost all of a $10 million investment he made with the Galleon hedge fund manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were very unhappy with how he handled our investment and the information he gave us and this is obviously inconsistent with going out and tipping him," Naftalis told the judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government contends that Gupta provided Rajaratnam with advance knowledge of Warren Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, as well as information about Goldman's surprise fourth-quarter loss in 2008 and P's quarterly earnings in late January 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v Gupta, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-907.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Grant McCool; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Chevron was still hoping for a ruling from New Yorks federal courts that would make it impossible for Ecuadorean plaintiffs to collect their $18 billion judgment against the oil company, Thursdays long-awaited opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit puts an end to that strategy. The appellate panels 30-page opinion  which explains the courts Sept. 2011 order lifting the worldwide injunction barring enforcement of the Ecuadorean judgment  gives Chevron the chance to argue once again that the Ecuadoreans cant collect in New York, under the states Uniform Foreign Country Money-Judgments Recognition Act. But in no uncertain terms, the Second Circuit advised that even if Chevron eventually persuades a New York judge that the Ecuadoreans procured their judgment through fraud, that judge cannot bar enforcement of the judgment outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing in the New York statute, or in any precedent interpreting it, authorizes a court to enjoin parties holding a judgment issued in one foreign country from attempting to enforce that judgment in yet another foreign country, wrote Second Circuit Judge Gerald Lynch, for a panel that included Judges Rosemary Pooler and Richard Wesley. The court presuming to issue such an injunction sets itself up as the definitive international arbiter of the fairness and integrity of the worlds legal systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appellate panels ruling is based on what it said was Chevrons inappropriate attempt to use New Yorks Judgment Recognition Act to bar enforcement of a judgment that wasnt even final at the time Chevron brought its case. The opinion explains that the New York statute is intended to be invoked only after the holder of a judgment attempts to enforce it inside the states borders. Chevron tried to get around that issue by asking for the injunction via a declaratory judgment action, in which it alleged that the Ecuadoreans procured their $18 billion verdict through fraud and political machinations. But the Second Circuit said Chevrons interpretation of the Recognition Act, and U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplans endorsement of that interpretation, was a legal misapprehension. The act may only be used defensively, the panel said, not prospectively. For good measure, the Second Circuit also dismissed Chevrons declaratory judgment suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the merits of Chevrons complaints about the Ecuadorian courts, the opinion said, the procedural device it has chosen to present those claims is simply unavailable: The Recognition Act nowhere authorizes a court to declare a foreign judgment unenforceable on the preemptive suit of a putative judgment-debtor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first part of the Second Circuit opinion left open the possibility that Chevron could try again to block enforcement when and if the Ecuadoreans attempt to collect in New York. (Lawyers for the Ecuadoreans have said they will never attempt to enforce the judgment in New York.) But in the appellate panels discussion of international comity  a major theme of last falls oral arguments  the judges made clear their discomfort with a New York court interfering with international jurisprudence. Kaplans injunction, the opinion said, would establish New York as an international arbiter of justice, and thats not what the Judgments Recognition law intends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Chevrons effort to secure injunctive relief illustrates, permitting such speculative declaratory relief would encourage efforts by parties to seek a res judicata advantage by litigating issues in New York in order to obtain advantage in connection with potential enforcement efforts in other countries, the opinion said. Such a regime would unquestionably provoke extensive friction between legal systems by encouraging challenges to the legitimacy of foreign courts in cases in which the enforceability of the foreign judgment might otherwise never be presented in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Tyrrell Jr. of Patton Boggs, who represents the Ecuadoreans suing Chevron, welcomed the courts opinion. We are very pleased that the Circuit Court not only vacated the injunction, but also dismissed the declaratory judgment action in its entirety, making it clear that a New York court has no authority to decide enforcement of the now-affirmed Ecuadorean judgment for the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second Circuit opinion does not address the merits of Chevrons fraud argument (nor, for that matter, the fraud allegations that the Ecuadoreans have since lobbed at the oil company), and notes that Chevrons racketeering suit against the Ecuadoreans and some of their lawyers and experts remains alive in Manhattan federal court. Chevron general counsel Hewitt Pate told me Thursday that the appeals courts opinion means Chevrons RICO case can now proceed. (That case, as Ive reported, includes a motion for pre-trial attachment that could effectively preclude the Ecuadoreans from collecting on their judgment; Kaplan denied Chevrons first attachment motion but indicated hed reconsider.) The Second Circuits opinion is a narrow procedural ruling that may change the order in which courts address the fraud being perpetrated in the Lago Agrio case, but it will not affect the ultimate outcome, Chevron said in a statement. Chevron will continue to pursue its fraud and racketeering claims against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and the American lawyers who are perpetrating this fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ive reported, Chevron has also appealed the Ecuadorean judgment to that countrys highest court, and has asked the arbitration panel overseeing its case against the Republic of Ecuador to block the Ecuadorean government from acting to enforce the judgment. On Wednesday, the bilateral treaty arbiters converted an interim order restricting the Republic into an interim award. Pate said the arbitration panels action underscores the Republics obligation to stop the Ecuadorean plaintiffs from enforcing the judgment, and enhances arguments Chevron will make elsewhere in the world if the Ecuadoreans try to collect. It puts us in a more powerful position, Pate told me. (The Republic has argued that the arbitration panels order is an impermissible violation of its separation of powers doctrine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer's Inlyta drug for patients with advanced kidney cancer won approval from U.S. regulators, boosting the company's efforts to offset plunging Lipitor sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration on Friday said the drug, known generically as axitinib, is effective at treating patients who do not respond to another drug for kidney cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced kidney cancer starts in the lining of the kidney's small tubes. Inlyta works by blocking certain receptors that can influence tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said Inlyta is the seventh drug approved to treat advanced kidney cancer since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Collectively, this unprecedented level of drug development within this time period has significantly altered the treatment paradigm of metastatic kidney cancer, and offers patients multiple treatment options," said Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA's office of oncology products, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 61,000 Americans were diagnosed with kidney cancer last year, and about one in five of them is expected to die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20 to 30 percent of these patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFTER LIPITOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is one of several new medicines Pfizer is banking on to help replace lost revenue from its cholesterol fighter, Lipitor. The world's top-selling drug began facing generic competition late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This announcement is welcome news for Pfizer as investors have long waited for signs of revival of (research) productivity," Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pfizer also won approval to sell its Prevnar pneumonia vaccine to older adults, and not just children. The expanded population could generate more than $1.5 billion in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with six other drugs for advanced kidney cancer already sold in the United States, analysts said Pfizer will struggle to gain market share. Butler sees peak sales for Inlyta at $600 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the average monthly cost of Inlyta is less than $8,900, which is generally consistent with other drugs approved for advanced kidney cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer closed 0.7 percent lower at $21.48 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, in line with a fall in the wider Arca Pharmaceuticals Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An FDA advisory committee backed the oral drug in December and said it was as safe and effective as Nexavar, a kidney cancer treatment sold by Bayer AG and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was the first head-to-head trial of two targeted agents in kidney cancer," said Dr. Subramanian Hariharan, global medical lead on Inlyta at Pfizer. "Inlyta now offers a new option for patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, in Pfizer's clinical trial, Inlyta slowed down the progression of cancer by two months compared with Nexavar for patients who had already been treated for advanced kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIRST DRUG MATTERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the findings differed depending on which particular drug patients took beforehand. For people who first took Pfizer's Sutent, Inlyta slowed the disease by only 1.4 months, versus 5.6 months for patients previously treated with cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. patients rarely use cytokines, such as interferon, and are far more likely to be given Sutent as an initial treatment, the FDA has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most FDA advisers said the medicine was not a significant advance over other treatments. But they said it had different side effects than other drugs for the disease, which could be important for patients who cannot tolerate older treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common side effects with Inlyta included diarrhea, high blood pressure, loss of voice, weight loss and vomiting. Some patients also had bleeding problems, which in some cases were fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said patients with high blood pressure should make sure it is under control before taking Inlyta, and those with untreated brain tumors or intestinal bleeding should not take the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inlyta is awaiting an approval decision in Europe for use in patients who were not helped by prior treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is also testing Inlyta in another late-stage trial for kidney cancer as both an initial treatment option and in previously treated patients. The company is also testing the drug as a treatment for liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Yukhananov in Washington and Anand Basu in Bangalore; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  STEVENSON, MD, Jan 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation announces that a class action
lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Alabama on behalf of purchasers of the common stock
of Walter Energy, Inc. ("Walter Energy" or the "Company") (NYSE: WLT)
during the period between April 20, 2011 and September 21, 2011,
inclusive (the "Class Period").

    No class has yet been certified in the above action. Members of the Class
will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead
plaintiff. If you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the Class,

that significantly reduced Walter's coal production, that Walter was
experiencing a significant decline in its margins and profitability, and

the second quarter at first quarter sales prices would result in a
material adverse effect on Walter's average sales prices and operating
results during the second quarter. According to the complaint, after, on
August 3, 2011, Walter issued a press release announcing operating
results for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 significantly less than Wall
Street estimates, and, after, on September 21, 2011, Walter announced its
attempt to "enhance" its historical statistical disclosure and its

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp reported lower quarterly earnings on Friday, missing Wall Street forecasts, as rising spending on oil and gas projects and losses at its U.S. refinery business offset gains from higher crude oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its shares were down 2.2 percent at $104.21 by midday, nearly $7 short of the record high they hit early this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas production at the No. 2 U.S. oil company declined to 2.64 million barrels per day (BPD) from 2.79 million BPD a year-before, while average benchmark oil prices rose about 25 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the major factors behind the 2011 output shortfall were the effect of higher prices on production sharing contracts, lower-than-expected performance at large new offshore projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Angola, and a third-party pipeline rupture and decreased demand in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron had said earlier this month its refinery business would about break even for the quarter, but U.S. losses pulled the entire segment into the red, and the company's profits from oil and gas sales also appeared weaker than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a miss on some non-controllable factors," said Pavel Molchanov, analyst with Raymond James in Houston, citing the timings of sales and global pricing differences as the likely reason oil and gas profits fell about $500 million below his forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Chevron added 1.67 billion barrels of oil equivalent to its reserves last year, 171 percent of its 2011 output, which was a very strong performance, Molchanov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is embroiled in some huge legal battles in South America, including one in Brazil where a prosecutor plans to file criminal charges against it and some of its local managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also faces an $11 billion lawsuit in Brazil related to an offshore spill in November. Chief Executive John Watson said the company's people in Brazil had responded in "textbook fashion" even if it did not put its "best foot forward" in its communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company also remains locked in a legal war against plaintiffs in Ecuador, who won an $18 billion judgment against it in a court there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson cited the many defenses Chevron can still pursue, and said an arbitration tribunal on Wednesday strengthened its hand by converting previous interim measures to an "interim award" obligating Ecuador, under a treaty with the United States, to prevent enforcement worldwide pending a full review of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That makes it have more standing in the international community," Watson said. "This award is helpful to us in preventing enforcement outside of Ecuador."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Nigeria, where a natural gas well just off the coast is burning after an accident this month, Watson said it expected to start a relief well within the next week or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROFIT DIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter profit slipped to $5.1 billion, or $2.58 per share, from $5.3 billion, or $2.64 per share, a year earlier. That fell short of the $2.84 per share analysts had expected, according to the average on Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which was already 17 cents down in response to Chevron's warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other U.S. oil companies, the quarterly profits from ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum Corp earlier this week topped Wall Street estimates, though Hess Corp fell short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is spending piles of money on production growth that will not kick in until 2014. Its 2012 capital budget of $32.7 billion compares with $29.1 billion in 2011 - $3 billion above than previous 2011 guidance due to increased spending related to its Atlas shale gas acquisition and in response to higher oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fourth quarter, Chevron's spending on U.S. oil and gas projects nearly doubled from a year ago to $2 billion, while outside the U.S. it grew by more than a quarter to $5.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson said 2013 and 2014 would also be high capital spending years as it completes work on Australian liquefied natural gas projects and new Gulf of Mexico developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its $9 billion Angola LNG project is due to start up later this year, and Watson said the company was working to find new buyers for gas that had originally been intended for the now-glutted North American market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partly offsetting that new output would be the first major maintenance work at its plant in Tengiz in Kazakhstan since its startup in 2008, which would last around six weeks in the third quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily in New York and Braden Reddall in San Francisco, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

			U.S. Food And Drug Administration Approves Pfizer&#8217;s INLYTA&#174; 
      (axitinib) For Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Renal Cell 
      Carcinoma (RCC)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			First Treatment to Demonstrate Superior Benefit in a Phase 3 Study 
      Compared with Another Targeted Agent in Advanced RCC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) has approved INLYTA&#174; (axitinib), a kinase inhibitor, for the 
      treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after 
      failure of one prior systemic therapy. The approval is based on data 
      from the Phase 3 AXIS trial, which demonstrated that INLYTA 
      significantly extended progression free survival (PFS) [HR=0.67, 
      0.54-0.81, P0.0001] with a median PFS of 6.7 months (95% CI: 6.3, 8.6) 
      compared with 4.7 months (95% CI: 4.6, 5.6) for those treated with 
      sorafenib, a current standard of care for this patient population, 
      representing a 43 percent improvement in median PFS compared to 
      sorafenib.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cancers of the kidney and renal pelvis are among the 10 most commonly 
      diagnosed cancers in the United States1. Approximately 13,000 
      individuals die of advanced RCC in the U.S. each year2. 
      Approximately 60,000 new cases of this tumor are diagnosed in the U.S. 
      annually1, about 20 percent of which have advanced disease at 
      the time of diagnosis.1 Between 40 and 65 percent of patients 
      who progress following first-line therapy go on to receive a second-line 
      treatment.3,4,5
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Even with the advent of targeted therapies, the need remains for 
      additional options for patients with advanced RCC whose disease has 
      progressed following first-line medications,&#8221; said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, 
      senior vice president of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs, 
      Pfizer Oncology Business Unit. &#8220;INLYTA is the first targeted therapy to 
      be approved in the U.S. for patients with advanced RCC after failure of 
      one prior systemic therapy based on data demonstrating superior 
      progression-free survival when compared to another FDA-approved, 
      targeted agent.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer has a strong commitment to advancing therapies for patients with 
      advanced RCC,&#8221; said Garry Nicholson, president and general manager, 
      Pfizer Oncology Business Unit. &#8220;INLYTA is an important addition to our 
      portfolio of treatment options for these patients, which also includes 
      Sutent (sunitinib) and Torisel (temsirolimus).&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INLYTA, a kinase inhibitor, is an oral therapy that was designed to 
      selectively inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 
      1, 2 and 3,which are receptors that can influence tumor growth, vascular 
      angiogenesis and progression of cancer (the spread of tumors).6,7
		&lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Through studying this drug we have learned that a VEGFR-targeted 
      therapy can be effective following prior treatment options, including 
      another VEGFR-targeted agent. This is important in helping physicians 
      understand where these medications fit in the treatment armamentarium,&#8221; 
      said Dr. Brian I. Rini, Taussig Cancer Institute at Cleveland Clinic, 
      who served as principal investigator of this Pfizer-sponsored study and 
      is a paid consultant to Pfizer Oncology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The FDA approval of this new treatment represents a significant benefit 
      for the many patients who are living with this type of kidney cancer and 
      who are in need of additional treatment options," said William Bro, 
      chief executive officer of the Kidney Cancer Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Axitinib is also being investigated in a randomized clinical trial in 
      patients with treatment-na&#239;ve as well as previously treated advanced 
      RCC, and in a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).8,9,10,11 Additionally, under 
      a collaborative development agreement between Pfizer and SFJ Pharma Ltd. 
      II, SFJ will conduct a&#160;Phase 3 clinical trial in Asia studying axitinib 
      for adjuvant treatment of patients at high risk of recurrent RCC 
      following nephrectomy. Healthcare professionals who are interested in 
      learning more about Pfizer Oncology clinical trials that are open for 
      enrollment can visit www.PfizerOncology.com/clinicaltrials.

			INLYTA (axitinib) Indication and Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INLYTA is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma 
      (RCC) after failure of one prior systemic therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hypertension including hypertensive crisis has been observed. Blood 
      pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor 
      for hypertension and treat as needed. For persistent hypertension, 
      despite use of antihypertensive medications, reduce the dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arterial and venous thrombotic events have been observed and can be 
      fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk or who 
      have a history of these events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have been reported. INLYTA 
      has not been studied in patients with evidence of untreated brain 
      metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be 
      used in those patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, including death, have 
      occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal 
      perforation or fistula. Monitor for symptoms of gastrointestinal 
      perforation or fistula periodically throughout treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement has been reported. 
      Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically 
      throughout, treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stop INLYTA at least 24 hours prior to scheduled surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been 
      observed. If signs or symptoms occur, permanently discontinue treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Monitor for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically 
      throughout, treatment. For moderate to severe proteinuria, reduce the 
      dose or temporarily interrupt treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liver enzyme elevation has been observed during treatment with INLYTA. 
      Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin before initiation of, and periodically 
      throughout, treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the starting dose should 
      be decreased. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe 
      hepatic impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to 
      the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving INLYTA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors. If unavoidable, reduce the dose. Avoid 
      strong CYP3A4/5 inducers and, if possible, avoid moderate CYP3A4/5 
      inducers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common (&#8805;20%) adverse events (AEs) occurring in patients 
      receiving INLYTA (all grades) were diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, 
      decreased appetite, nausea, dysphonia, hand-foot syndrome, weight 
      decreased, vomiting, asthenia and constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common (&#8805;10%) grade 3/4 AEs occurring in patients receiving 
      INLYTA were hypertension, diarrhea and fatigue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common (&#8805;20%) lab abnormalities occurring in patients receiving 
      INLYTA (all grades) included increased creatinine, decreased 
      bicarbonate, hypocalcemia, decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocytes 
      (absolute), increased ALP, hyperglycemia, increased lipase, increased 
      amylase, increased ALT and increased AST.

			About SUTENT(&#174;) (sunitinib malate)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SUTENT is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that works by blocking multiple 
      molecular targets implicated in the growth, proliferation and spread of 
      cancer. Two important SUTENT targets, vascular endothelial growth factor 
      receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are 
      expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to play a 
      crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood 
      vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. SUTENT also inhibits 
      other targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important SUTENT(&#174;) (sunitinib malate) Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatotoxicity has been observed in clinical trials and postmarketing 
      experience. This hepatotoxicity may be severe, and deaths have been 
      reported. It is recommended to monitor liver function tests before 
      initiation of treatment, during each cycle of treatment, and as 
      clinically indicated. SUTENT should be interrupted for Grade 3 or 4 
      drug-related hepatic adverse events and discontinued if there is no 
      resolution. SUTENT should not be restarted if patients subsequently 
      experience severe changes in liver function tests or have other signs 
      and symptoms of liver failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy 
      should be informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the 
      lower limit of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with 
      concomitant cardiac conditions should be carefully monitored for 
      clinical signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Patients should 
      be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with standard 
      antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet 
      count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each 
      treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with SUTENT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common adverse reactions in gastrointestinal stromal tumor 
      (GIST), RCC and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) clinical trials 
      were diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, 
      anorexia, vomiting, neutropenia, hypertension, dyspepsia, abdominal 
      pain, constipation, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration, hair 
      color changes, altered taste and bleeding.

			About Torisel&#174; (temsirolimus)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Torisel is the only intravenous mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
      inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma 
      (RCC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on preclinical studies, Torisel inhibits the activity of mTOR, an 
      intracellular protein implicated in multiple growth-related cellular 
      functions including proliferation, growth and survival. The inhibition 
      of mTOR also reduces levels of certain growth factors, such as vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are overexpressed in solid 
      tumors like kidney cancer and are thought to play a crucial role in 
      angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood vessels, 
      nutrients and oxygen needed for growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Torisel&#174; (temsirolimus) Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TORISEL is contraindicated in patients with bilirubin 1.5 x ULN and 
      should be used with caution when treating patients with mild hepatic 
      impairment (bilirubin 1 &#8211; 1.5 x ULN or AST  ULN but bilirubin &#8804; ULN). 
      If TORISEL must be given to patients with mild hepatic impairment, 
      reduce the dose of TORISEL to 15 mg/week. In a phase 1 study, the 
      overall frequency of &#8805; grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths, including 
      deaths due to progressive disease, was greater in patients with baseline 
      bilirubin  1.5 x ULN.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions, including flushing, chest pain, 
      dyspnea, hypotension, apnea, loss of consciousness, hypersensitivity and 
      anaphylaxis, may occur very early in the first infusion or with 
      subsequent infusions. Pretreat with an H1 antihistamine. TORISEL 
      infusion should be interrupted in patients with infusion reactions and 
      appropriate therapy given.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Serum glucose, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides should be tested 
      before and during TORISEL treatment. TORISEL is likely to result in 
      hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia. This may result in the need for an 
      increase in the dose of, or initiation of, insulin and/or oral 
      hypoglycemic agent therapy and/or lipid-lowering agents, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TORISEL may result in immunosuppression. Patients should be carefully 
      observed for the occurrence of infections, including opportunistic 
      infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cases of interstitial lung disease, some resulting in death, have 
      occurred. Some patients were asymptomatic or had minimal symptoms. 
      Patients should undergo baseline radiography prior to TORISEL therapy 
      and periodically thereafter, even in the absence of clinical respiratory 
      symptoms. Follow patients closely and, if clinically significant 
      respiratory symptoms develop, consider withholding TORISEL until 
      recovery of symptoms and radiographic improvement of pneumonitis 
      findings. Some patients required TORISEL discontinuation and/or 
      treatment with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cases of fatal bowel perforation occurred with TORISEL. These patients 
      presented with fever, abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, bloody stools, 
      diarrhea, and/or acute abdomen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cases of rapidly progressive and sometimes fatal acute renal failure not 
      clearly related to disease progression occurred in patients who received 
      TORISEL.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Due to abnormal wound healing, use TORISEL with caution in the 
      perioperative period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patients with central nervous system tumors (primary CNS tumor or 
      metastases) and/or receiving anticoagulation therapy may be at an 
      increased risk of developing intracerebral bleeding (including fatal 
      outcomes) while receiving TORISEL.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Live vaccinations and close contact with those who received live 
      vaccines should be avoided.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TORISEL may cause fetal harm. Patients and their partners should be 
      advised to avoid pregnancy throughout treatment and for 3 months after 
      TORISEL therapy has stopped.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Elderly patients may be more likely to experience certain adverse 
      reactions including diarrhea, edema and pneumonia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common (incidence &#8805;30%) adverse reactions observed with TORISEL 
      are: rash (47%), asthenia (51%), mucositis (41%), nausea (37%), edema 
      (35%), and anorexia (32%). The most common laboratory abnormalities 
      (incidence &#8805;30%) are anemia (94%), hyperglycemia (89%), hyperlipemia 
      (87%), hypertriglyceridemia (83%), elevated alkaline phosphatase (68%), 
      elevated serum creatinine (57%), lymphopenia (53%), hypophosphatemia 
      (49%), thrombocytopenia (40%), elevated AST (38%), and leukopenia (32%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Most common grades 3/4 adverse events and laboratory abnormalities 
      included asthenia (11%), dyspnea (9%), hemoglobin decreased (20%), 
      lymphocytes decreased (16%), glucose increased (16%), phosphorus 
      decreased (18%), and triglycerides increased (44%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pleural effusion, hemodynamically significant pericardial effusions 
      requiring intervention, convulsions, rhabdomyolysis, Stevens-Johnson 
      Syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome and extravasations have been 
      reported during postmarketing use.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 (eg, dexamethasone, rifampin) and strong 
      inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, atazanavir) may decrease and 
      increase concentrations of the major metabolite of TORISEL, 
      respectively. If alternatives cannot be used, dose modifications of 
      TORISEL are recommended.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Avoid St. John&#8217;s Wort which may decrease TORISEL plasma concentrations, 
      and grapefruit juice which may increase plasma concentrations of the 
      major metabolite of TORISEL.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The combination of TORISEL and sunitinib resulted in dose-limiting 
      toxicity (Grade 3/4 erythematous maculopapular rash, and gout/cellulitis 
      requiring hospitalization).

			The Law Firm of Levi  Korsinsky Notifies Investors with Losses on 
      Their Investment in Walter Energy, Inc. of Class Action Lawsuit and the 
      Deadline of March 26, 2012 to Seek a Lead Plaintiff Position
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Levi  Korsinsky announces that a class action lawsuit has been 
      commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District 
      of Alabama on behalf of investors who purchased Walter Energy, Inc. 
      (&#8220;Walter Energy&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NYSE: WLT) stock between April 20, 
      2011 and September 21, 2011 (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;

      For more information, click here: http://zlk.9nl.com/walter-energy-wlt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued 
      materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company&#8217;s 
      business and prospects. Specifically, defendants misrepresented and/or 
      failed to disclose the following adverse facts: (a) that the Company was 
      experiencing so-called &#8220;squeeze&#8221; events in Alabama and lower coal 
      transportation rates in Canada that significantly reduced Walter&#8217;s coal 
      production; (b) that the Company&#8217;s commitment to ship more than 700,000 
      tons of coal in the second quarter at first quarter sales prices would 
      result in a materially adverse effect on Walter&#8217;s average sales prices 
      and operating results during the second quarter; (c) that Walter was 
      experiencing a significant decline in its margins and profitability; and 
      (d) that, based on the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis 
      for their positive statements about the Company and its business 
      prospects during the Class Period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On September 21, 2011, Walter issued a press release announcing its 
      attempt to &#8220;enhance&#8221; its historical statistical disclosure and its 
      revisions to its 2011 second half sales expectations. In response to 
      this announcement, the price of Walter common stock declined from $75.00 
      per share on September 20, 2011 to $66.25 on September 21, 2011, on 
      extremely heavy trading volume.
    &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="Jessica Wohl" date="2012-01-27T16:34:52+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/27/us-procter-idUSTRE80Q0SP20120127"><headline>Procter &amp; Gamble lowers forecast due to strong dollar</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co cut its full-year profit forecast because of the strong dollar, and its quarterly profit plunged 49 percent as the world's largest household products maker wrote down the value of its appliance and salon professional products businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Tide detergent said it had not seen competitors match some of the price increases it imposed to mitigate higher commodity costs. That made P's products less attractive to shoppers focused on prices rather than brands and indicates the competition among household product makers shows no signs of abating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cincinnati-based P also said it is cutting about 1,600 corporate positions by the end of June, a move that should save it about $240 million a year before taxes. The cuts represent 1.2 percent of its total workforce of 129,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P is also cutting the number of technical centers it has and outsourcing some of the work it does in U.S. stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding one-time charges, core earnings per share fell 3 percent to $1.10 as sales growth and cost cuts were not enough to offset double-digit increases in commodity costs. The profit topped analysts' average forecast of $1.08 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the profit beat expectations, some analysts said the quality of the report was disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P shares were down 0.6 percent at $64.42 in morning trading, compared with a 0.45 percent dip in the Dow Jones industrial average, of which it is a component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROFIT POUNDED BY CURRENCY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fiscal 2012 began last July, P expected foreign exchange to add 2 percent to 3 percent to net sales, Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as the dollar has strengthened against currencies such as the ruble, zloty, real and peso, P expects the impact of currency rates to cut net sales by 1 percent this year, and it cut its fiscal-year profit forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the fiscal year ending in June, P now expects to earn $4.00 to $4.10 per share, down from a prior forecast of $4.15 to $4.33. Analysts had been expecting $4.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we are obviously not happy with the guidance cut, it is not completely unexpected, either, given the F/X environment," said Oppenheimer analyst Joseph Altobello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower forecast comes the day after smaller rival Colgate-Palmolive Co said the stronger dollar could shave 4 percentage points from its earnings growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P often leads the industry in price increases, and competitors held off on matching some of its recent hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, P's average retail price for laundry products is up 4 percent over the last six months, while those from competitor Unilever are down about 5 percent, McDonald said. The U.S. price of P's Tide powder detergent is up at a double-digit percentage rate from a year ago, while lower-priced competitor Church &amp; Dwight Co Inc cut its prices in a low-single-digit range, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P is responding by rescinding a small number of its price hikes. In August, it raised the U.S. price of its Cascade dishwasher detergent by an average of 8 percent. After its market share in that business fell more than 7 points, it will revert back to its earlier pricing starting next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P narrowed its 2012 organic sales forecast, calling for a rise of 4 percent to 5 percent, compared with prior expectations for 3 percent to 6 percent. Organic sales strip out the impact of acquisitions, asset sales and currency fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P earned $1.69 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the second quarter ended in December, down from $3.33 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the decline stemmed from writing off the value of the appliance and salon professional products businesses. The company suggested in its 2011 annual report that it might take such a step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While P still thinks the businesses are attractive and remains committed to them, it wrote down their value due to their exposure to the tough Western European market, their discretionary nature, and increased competition, executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P's quarterly sales rose 4 percent to $22.14 billion. Organic sales rose in each business unit and were up 4 percent overall. The volume of goods sold rose 1 percent, with growth in developing markets offsetting a decline in developed regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current third quarter, P forecast core earnings of 91 cents to 97 cents per share, compared with 96 cents a year earlier. It expects organic sales to rise 3 percent to 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P's plan to sell its Pringles business to Diamond Foods Inc is on hold as Diamond investigates its payments to walnut growers. The snack foods company is expected to give an update on the issue by mid-February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Derek Caney and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRAGUE (Reuters) - The U.S. economy looks to be improving more than market consensus believes while the global driver for growth continues to come from major emerging markets, Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O'Neill said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boss of Goldman Sachs AM, which has almost a trillion dollars of assets under management, also said the U.S. housing market, whose collapse helped trigger the financial crisis in 2008, may be close to a turning point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is my growing suspicion that the U.S. economy is improving more than the consensus thinks," O'Neill said during an economic conference in the Czech capital of Prague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill said there were growing signs the United States was recovering from the deep economic challenges after 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on Friday, released while the Prague conference was taking place, showed the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in 1-1/2 years in the fourth quarter but some of the data also hinted at slower growth in early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, O'Neill told Reuters that U.S. and emerging market economies were still doing well and that made it easy to be bullish about global equities in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In my judgment, the four BRIC countries - Brazil, China, India, Russia - and four others - Mexico, Korea, Turkey, Indonesia - are actually the countries which are driving the world economy," O'Neill said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill coined the term BRICs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jana Mlcochova; Writing by Jason Hovet.

&lt;p&gt;PRAGUE Jan 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy looks to
be improving more than market consensus believes while the
global driver for growth continues to come from major emerging

			Chevron Reports Fourth Quarter Net Income of $5.1 Billion, Compared 
      to $5.3 Billion in Fourth Quarter 2010

		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported earnings of $5.1 billion 
      ($2.58 per share &#8211; diluted) for the fourth quarter 2011, compared with 
      $5.3 billion ($2.64 per share &#8211; diluted) in the 2010 fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full-year 2011 earnings were $26.9 billion ($13.44 per share &#8211; diluted), 
      up 41 percent from $19.0 billion ($9.48 per share &#8211; diluted) earned in 
      2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sales and other operating revenues in the fourth quarter 2011 were $58 
      billion, up from $52 billion in the year-ago period, mainly due to 
      higher prices for crude oil and refined products.

      &#8220;Chevron had an outstanding year financially,&#8221; said Chairman and CEO 
      John Watson, &#8220;with record earnings and cash flow. This reflects our 
      exceptionally strong upstream portfolio, as well as higher 2011 crude 
      prices. Full-year earnings also benefited from improved downstream sales 
      margins. Our financial strength enabled us to both invest in our 
      development projects and to acquire several new resource opportunities. 
      At the same time, we raised the annual dividend twice and increased 
      outlays for our common stock repurchase program. Beyond our strong 
      financial performance, we also had an outstanding year in terms of oil 
      and gas reserves replacement.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson continued, &#8220;In the fourth quarter, we took another important step 
      forward in our efforts to commercialize the company&#8217;s significant 
      natural gas resources with the start of construction at the Wheatstone 
      liquefied natural gas project in Australia. We also recently announced 
      two additional natural gas discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin that will 
      help underpin future LNG expansion opportunities.
			At the same 
      time, we ramped up production to over 330 million cubic feet per day at 
      the Platong II natural gas project in the Gulf of Thailand.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson commented that the company added approximately 1.67 billion 
      barrels of net oil-equivalent reserves in 2011. These additions, which 
      are subject to final reviews, equate to 171 percent of net 
      oil-equivalent production for the year. &#8220;The Wheatstone Project was the 
      largest component of our reserve adds this year,&#8221; noted Watson, &#8220;and we 
      continued to build legacy positions with additions from acquisitions in 
      the Marcellus Shale and multiple development projects in the deepwater 
      Gulf of Mexico.&#8221; The company will provide additional details relating to 
      2011 reserve additions in its Annual Report on Form 10-K scheduled for 
      filing with the SEC on February 23.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the downstream business, we successfully completed the second year 
      of a multiyear plan to improve returns,&#8221; Watson added. Efforts continued 
      on streamlining the asset portfolio, with completion of the sale of 
      refining and marketing assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 
      including the Pembroke Refinery. The company also completed the sale of 
      its marketing businesses in five countries in Africa, and its fuels 
      marketing and aviation businesses in 16 countries in the Caribbean and 
      Latin America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company purchased $1.25 billion of its common stock in the fourth 
      quarter 2011 under its share repurchase program. At the end of the year, 
      balances of cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable 
      securities totaled $20.1 billion, up $3 billion from the end of 2010. 
      Total debt at December 31, 2011 was $10.2 billion, down $1.3 billion 
      from a year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			UPSTREAM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 2.64 million barrels per day 
      in the fourth quarter 2011, down from 2.79 million barrels per day in 
      the 2010 fourth quarter. Production increases from project ramp-ups in 
      Thailand, the United States, Nigeria and Brazil, and new volumes 
      stemming from acquisitions in the Marcellus Shale were more than offset 
      by normal field declines, maintenance-related downtime and a 25,000 
      barrels per day negative effect of higher prices on entitlement volumes.

      U.S. upstream earnings of $1.61 billion in the fourth quarter 2011 were 
      up $675 million from a year earlier. The benefit of higher crude oil 
      realizations was partly offset by lower production.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company&#8217;s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural 
      gas liquids was $101 in the fourth quarter 2011, up from $76 a year ago. 
      The average sales price of natural gas was $3.62 per thousand cubic 
      feet, compared with $3.65 in last year&#8217;s fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net oil-equivalent production of 661,000 barrels per day in the fourth 
      quarter 2011 was down 37,000 barrels per day, or 5 percent, from a year 
      earlier. The decrease in production was associated with normal field 
      declines and maintenance-related downtime. Partially offsetting this 
      decrease was new Marcellus Shale production and increases at the Perdido 
      project in the Gulf of Mexico. The net liquids component of 
      oil-equivalent production decreased 7 percent in the 2011 fourth quarter 
      to 447,000 barrels per day, while net natural gas production decreased 1 
      percent to 1.29 billion cubic feet per day.

      International upstream earnings of $4.13 billion increased $215 million 
      from the fourth quarter 2010. Higher realizations for crude oil 
      increased earnings between quarters. This benefit was partly offset by 
      higher tax charges, lower volumes and higher operating expenses. Foreign 
      currency effects had little net impact on earnings in the 2011 fourth 
      quarter, compared with a decrease of $53 million a year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in the 
      2011 fourth quarter was $101 per barrel, up from $79 a year earlier. The 
      average price of natural gas was $5.55 per thousand cubic feet, compared 
      with $4.81 in last year&#8217;s fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net oil-equivalent production of 1.98 million barrels per day in the 
      fourth quarter 2011 was down 108,000 barrels per day from a year ago. 
      Production increases from project ramp-ups in Thailand, Nigeria and 
      Brazil were more than offset by maintenance-related downtime, normal 
      field declines, and a 25,000 barrels per day negative effect of higher 
      prices on entitlement volumes. The net liquids component of 
      oil-equivalent production decreased 7 percent to 1.37 million barrels 
      per day, while net natural gas production declined 2 percent to 3.66 
      billion cubic feet per day.

      U.S. downstream operations lost $204 million in the fourth quarter 2011, 
      compared with earnings of $475 million a year earlier. The decline 
      primarily reflected the absence of a $400 million gain on the sale of 
      the company&#8217;s ownership interest in the Colonial Pipeline Company 
      recognized in the fourth quarter 2010, and weaker margins on refined 
      product sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Refinery crude oil input of 763,000 barrels per day in the fourth 
      quarter 2011 decreased 113,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period, 
      mainly due to maintenance-related downtime at the Richmond Refinery. 
      Refined product sales of 1.23 million barrels per day were down 69,000 
      barrels per day from the fourth quarter of 2010, mainly due to lower 
      gasoline and residual fuel oil sales. Branded gasoline sales decreased 3 
      percent to 515,000 barrels per day due to weaker demand.

      Refinery crude oil input of 805,000 barrels per day decreased 235,000 
      barrels per day from the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to the 
      sale of the Pembroke Refinery. Total refined product sales of 1.57 
      million barrels per day in the 2011 fourth quarter were 12 percent lower 
      than a year earlier, primarily related to the sale of the company&#8217;s

      Net charges in the fourth quarter 2011 were $553 million, compared with 
      $294 million in the year-ago period. The change between periods was 
      mainly due to higher employee compensation and benefits expenses, and 
      higher corporate tax charges.

      Capital and exploratory expenditures in 2011 were $29.1 billion, 
      compared with $21.8 billion in 2010. The amounts included $1.7 billion 
      in 2011 and $1.4 billion in 2010 for the company&#8217;s share of expenditures 
      by affiliates, which did not require cash outlays by the company. 
      Expenditures for upstream represented 89 percent of the companywide 
      total in 2011. These amounts exclude the acquisition of Atlas Energy, 
      Inc., which was accounted for as a business combination.

      This press release
			contains forward-looking statements relating 
      to Chevron&#8217;s operations that are based on management&#8217;s current 
      expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals 
      and other energy-related industries. Words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; 
      &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; 
      &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;schedules,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;budgets&#8221; and similar expressions are 
      intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements 
      are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain 
      risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the 
      company&#8217;s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual 
      outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or 
      forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should not 
      place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak 
      only as of the date of this press release. Unless legally required, 
      Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking 
      statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
      otherwise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemical margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s net 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes under existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company&#8217;s future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or 
      impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally 
      accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and 
      the factors set forth under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 32 
      through 34 of the company&#8217;s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 
      addition, such statements could be affected by general domestic and 
      international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or 
      unknown factors not discussed in this press release could also have 
      material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

premarket&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eastman, which makes chemicals, plastics and fiber, agreed
to buy specialty chemical maker Solutia Inc for about $3.38
billion in cash and stock to expand its presence in Asia
Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CO Thursday's close $64.80, down 1
pct premarket&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The household products maker's quarterly profit plunged 49
percent, as it took an impairment charge against its appliance
and salon professional products businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEWELL RUBBERMAID INC Thursday's close $17.43, up 2
pct premarket&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maker of Sharpie markers reported better-than-expected

			Pfizer Announces FDA Acceptance Of New Drug Application For Bosutinib 
      For Patients With Previously Treated Ph+ Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) for standard review of 
      bosutinib as a treatment option for adult patients with previously 
      treated Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia 
      (CML). This submission was based on efficacy and safety data from Study 
      200, a single-arm study of bosutinib in over 500 patients with 
      previously treated Ph+ CML, including patients resistant or intolerant 
      to imatinib as well as patients who were previously treated with 
      dasatinib or nilotinib. Currently, there are no approved therapies 
      available for CML patients after second-line treatment with dasatinib or 
      nilotinib.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CML, one of the four main types of leukemia,1 accounts for 15 
      percent of all leukemias worldwide.2 Despite the availability 
      of existing treatments, there remains a need for additional options for 
      CML patients, given observed treatment&#8211;related toxicities and resistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This filing underscores our commitment to bringing innovative treatment 
      options to hematologic patient populations like CML, where the need for 
      additional treatment options exists,&#8221; said Garry Nicholson, president 
      and general manager of the Pfizer Oncology Business Unit. &#8220;We are 
      excited about the potential to bring this promising agent to those 
      patients who fail or progress on previous therapies.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bosutinib is an oral, once-daily, investigational dual Src and Abl 
      kinase inhibitor with minimal inhibitory activity against c-kit and 
      PDGFR.3 It is believed that, by dual inhibition of the Src 
      and Abl tyrosine kinases, bosutinib may inhibit signaling in CML cells 
      that allows the cells to grow, survive and reproduce.4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A hallmark of CML is an abnormal chromosome known as the Philadelphia 
      chromosome, a DNA mutation that initiates a series of events leading to 
      the development of Bcr-Abl, a tyrosine kinase that causes CML cells to 
      grow and reproduce rapidly.5 In some cases, resistance may 
      develop to currently available therapies that inhibit Bcr-Abl.6 
      Inhibition of both Src and Abl tyrosine kinases may help overcome this 
      resistance,7 as overexpression of the Src family of tyrosine 
      kinases has been implicated in resistance and CML progression.4
		&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer's Commitment to Hematology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hematologic cancers are a complex group of diseases, with over 70 
      different types of lymphomas, leukemias or myelomas. While there have 
      been significant advancements in the treatment of some hematologic 
      cancers, there continues to be a need for additional therapeutic 
      options. Pfizer Oncology is committed to improving outcomes for patients 
      living with hematologic malignancies like CML. Pfizer Oncology has a 
      robust hematology pipeline, with biologics and small molecules in 
      clinical development across a number of hematologic malignancies. We are 
      advancing technologies as well as working to identify new and innovative 
      options that address specific hematologic cancers, molecular subtypes, 
      gene over-expression and mechanisms of resistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="Joshua Schneyer" date="2012-01-27T12:17:31+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/27/us-chevron-brazil-idUSTRE80P22M20120127"><headline>Exclusive: Chevron to face charges over Brazil spill</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;CAMPOS, Brazil (Reuters) - A Brazilian prosecutor plans to file criminal charges against Chevron Corp and some of its local managers within weeks, adding the threat of prison sentences to an $11 billion civil lawsuit as punishment for a November offshore oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing in federal court in Campos, Brazil, will likely include a request for criminal indictment of George Buck, chief executive of Chevron's Brazil unit, as well as other staff, three Brazilian government officials involved in the case told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd, whose rig was used in the operation, and some of its employees in Brazil are also expected to be charged, according to the officials, who requested anonymity because the case has not been presented to a judge. It is up to a judge to determine whether to accept the charges and proceed with indictments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backlash against the Chevron spill has highlighted the risks that energy companies face as they rush to get a piece of Brazil's oil bonanza. Chevron's legal troubles come as new oil rules give Brazil's government more control over the country's vast oil wealth. The regulatory overhaul has also delayed investment projects and new drilling licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buck and Chevron acted in a "careless and irresponsible way," an official who investigated the 2,400-barrel spill told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official said it is unlikely that people facing charges will be arrested in the near term or be barred from leaving Brazil. As the case advances and more evidence is collected, however, such measures could be applied, the official added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Reuters informed Chevron that charges were pending, company spokesman Kurt Glaubitz said "Chevron believes that the charges are without merit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron is confident that once all the facts are fully examined, they will demonstrate that Chevron responded appropriately and responsibly to the incident," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean spokesman R. Thaddeus Vayda declined to comment. Transocean is the world's biggest offshore oil rig operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian prosecutors have become more active in going after alleged polluters, sometimes bringing aggressive charges to encourage offenders to settle cases. They are moving far more swiftly than their U.S. counterparts: BP's 2010 spill in the Gulf of Mexico, more than 1,000 times larger in terms of oil, has not yet resulted in any criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, charges in cases such as these can take a decade before all appeals are exhausted. That could saddle Chevron and Transocean with years of costly litigation, said Paulo Augusto Silva Novaes, a lawyer with the Rio de Janeiro firm of Benjo, Garcia, Souto &amp; Novaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charges would come more than a month after a Federal Police investigator submitted a report saying Chevron and Transocean took "unacceptable" risks in the Frade oil field off Brazil's southern coast, and recommended that 17 individuals be indicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 12 of those people are from Chevron, according to legal documents reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is also fighting a separate 20-billion-real ($11 billion) lawsuit brought by the same Brazilian federal prosecutors. Chevron also is contesting an $18 billion judgment in Ecuador related to environmental contamination from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRESSURE KICK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 7, a well drilled by Chevron using a Transocean rig 107 kilometers (73 miles) from the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, experienced a pressure "kick" after tapping into an oil reservoir in Frade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emergency blow-out preventer was activated, plugging the well 1,200 meters (3,937 feet) below the ocean surface. But days later, Chevron discovered oil seeps from the seafloor hundreds of meters from the plugged well. Pressure caused a breach of the well wall far beneath the seabed, allowing oil to infiltrate surrounding rock and work its way into the ocean, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police and prosecutors allege that Chevron knew it was drilling in a high pressure area and that rock structures above the reservoir were fragile, factors that resulted in the spill and should have prompted more caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This well could not and should not have been drilled," the Federal Police said in a December 20 report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies taking any undue risk and says Brazilian authorities approved its drilling plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pressure was estimated using complex modeling and the data obtained from the 50 wellbores previously drilled at the Frade project," Chevron's Glaubitz said in a statement. "However, it is not uncommon to experience different conditions or pressures during drilling operations than those previously experienced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it acted quickly and correctly to stanch the leak from the seafloor within four days. Its operations and spill response adhered to the "best practices" of the oil industry, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian prosecutors have independence to file criminal and civil charges against companies and their employees for environmental damages, said Gustavo Trindade, who was chief legal advisor to Marina Silva, a former Brazilian Environment Minister and presidential candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cases rarely result in convictions, large fines or prison sentences, said Novaes, a corporate law expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, state-run oil company Petrobras, a partner with Chevron at Frade, is still appealing convictions and more than 100 million reais of damages resulting from an offshore oil platform accident in 2001 and a giant oil spill in Rio in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil from the recent Chevron leak did not reach shore and was less than 0.1 percent of BP's 4.9 million barrel Gulf of Mexico spill in 2010. The Frade leak was also much smaller than several previous spills in Brazil by Petrobras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrobras owns 30 percent of Frade. Chevron own 52 percent and is responsible for field management. The rest is owned by Frade Japao, a unit of Japan's Inpex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's oil regulator, the ANP, has suspended Chevron's drilling license at Frade. The ANP and Brazil's environmental protection agency Ibama have fined Chevron more than $50 million as a result of the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says that there is no evidence the Frade leak, which prosecutors estimate was closer to 3,000 barrels, has had any impact on aquatic life or on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil is still leaking from the sea floor, government officials said. The oil has leaked at an average rate of 1.4 liters a day for the last week and is being captured by undersea traps, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent flyovers have not detected oil on the ocean surface, Chevron added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's newfound oil wealth - including at least 15 billion barrels of deepwater discoveries since 2007 - puts the country among the world's most promising oil frontiers. Since the new finds, the government has stopped auctions of oil concessions in its richest offshore areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrobras will be the operator and hold a minimum 30 percent stake in all future oil projects in those areas. Under a new system, oil producers must share their production with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, California-based Chevron has operated in Brazil for nearly 100 years. It has invested around $2 billion in the country and has plans to spend several billion more on future projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares were up 0.37 percent at $108.10 on Thursday in New York. Transocean shares rose 3.62 percent to 44.39 Swiss francs ($46.73) in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Todd Benson, Alix Freedman, Jonathan Leff and Bob Burgdorfer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. ExxonMobil 
will continue to push for unconventional gas exploration in
Germany alongside conventional gas production, despite
scepticism over new drilling methods, its Europe chief said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"(Germany) is most definitely an interesting market. We
cannot achieve the energy strategy shift without gas," Gernot
Kalkoffen, Exxon Mobil Central Europe head, said in an interview
with the Handelsblatt business daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The gas infrastructure is good and gas is in demand in
Germany," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil said last week Germany was estimated to have 827
billion cubic metres of gas resources, of which 80 percent are
in so-called unconventional deposits, citing official German
figures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company was awaiting research findings due in March on
whether the fracking extraction technique for shale gas could
harm groundwater, he said. Parliamentary hearings have also
focused on the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of shale gas extraction is controversial
worldwide as it requires large amounts of water and chemicals. 
Environmental concerns have led some governments to ban its use
or allow more time to study it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fracking is high pressure drilling to prop open shale rocks
to release gas trapped underground which allows unconventional
gas to be released. own as conventional gas streams more freely,
but its supply is finite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalkoffen said early work in the populous North-Rhine
Westphalia state would be pursued to extract untapped gas. There
was a 50 percent chance that fracking might not even be needed,
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shale gas is potentially available in six of Germany's 16
states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany relies mainly on imported pipeline gas for heating,
transport and industrial applications. It would like to reduce
its dependency on Russia's 40 percent market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gas can also play a big role in complementing politically
desired renewable energies, away from fossil fuels and nuclear,
which Germany is ditching faster than planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Top Goldman Sachs Group Inc executives received previously restricted stock awards that are now worth $47.7 million, according to regulatory filings, though the executives are still limited in selling most of their Goldman stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn and top investment banker and vice chairman John Weinberg each received 45,497 shares worth $5.1 million, based on Goldman's closing price of $111.77 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven other executives each received previously awarded shares worth $2.8 million to $5 million, according to Form 4 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Among those executives are vice chairmen Michael Evans and Michael Sherwood, as well as Goldman's legal chief, Gregory Palm, its accounting chief, Sarah Smith, and compliance chief Alan Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock awards became unlocked on Wednesday, but the 11 executives did not immediately sell those shares. They did sell an additional $20.2 million worth of Goldman stock at $107.44 apiece to cover tax obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transactions took place on Wednesday, when executives received access to the previously restricted stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2009, Wall Street banks began shifting more of their bonus awards into stock that executives are required to hold for multi-year periods in an effort to align incentives with long-term performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, some of those payments started coming due, leaving compensation costs stubbornly high for big investment banks, even as they cut jobs and bonus pools due to weak business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman paid $12.2 billion in compensation costs, down 21 percent from 2010, and reduced its payroll by 2,400 jobs. Yet because revenue fell even more, compensation as a percentage of revenue rose to 42.4 percent from 39.3 percent the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lauren Tara LaCapra; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Corrects story to make clear that Goldman Sachs executives cannot immediately sell all of the shares received from a previous award)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) plans to sell a large part of its 50 percent stake in TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK (5012.T) back to its Japanese refining partner in a deal that could be worth about 300 billion yen ($3.9 billion), and will make an announcement as early as Monday, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil will retain about a 20 percent stake in TonenGeneral but the deal will mark a de facto retreat from the world's third-largest economy by the U.S. oil giant, which is focusing its resources on emerging markets and development of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move could also spark realignment among Japan's oil refiners, which have been cutting capacity to cope with falling demand caused by a weak economy and a shift to more efficient and environmentally friendly forms of energy, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported earlier this month that Exxon was in talks to sell part of the stake back to TonenGeneral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral, which imports and distributes Exxon oil in Japan, ranks as the country's No. 2 refiner behind JX Holdings (5020.T). Smaller rivals include Idemitsu Kosan Co (5019.T), Cosmo Oil (5007.T) and Showa Shell (5002.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and TonenGeneral aim to complete the deal around summer, the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral will seek funds from Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, Sumitomo Trust Banking, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ and Mitsubishi Trust Bank to buy back the stake, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Taro Fuse and Emoto Emi; Writing by Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Chris Gallagher and Ed Lane)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil will give up its controlling stake in TonenGeneral, but retain a 22 percent voting share in the Japanese oil giant, completing the transaction by June 1, 2012, a statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil currently holds about 50 percent of the Japanese refiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral said it has no plans to change a 38 yen per share dividend forecast for 2011 and expects to maintain the same dividend in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal marks a de facto retreat from the world's third-largest economy by ExxonMobil, which is focusing its resources on emerging markets and the development of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move could also spark realignment among Japan's oil refiners, which have been cutting capacity to cope with falling demand caused by a weak economy and a shift to more efficient and environmentally friendly forms of energy, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil demand in Japan has declined in recent years and the domestic operating environment has been characterized by continuous pressure on both margins and volumes," TonenGeneral said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is aimed at enabling the group to cope with the challenging environment more effectively, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported on Saturday that ExxonMobil was in talks to sell most of its stake back to TonenGeneral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral, which imports and distributes ExxonMobil oil in Japan, ranks as the country's No. 2 refiner behind JX Holdings (5020.T).

      Directors, subject to shareholder approval of its nominees. TonenGeneral 
      Sekiyu will have exclusive, long-term use of ExxonMobil&#8217;s existing 
      brands for the sale of ExxonMobil products in Japan. ExxonMobil will 
      provide ongoing technology support, including technical assistance from

      international crude, feedstock and fuels supply services, including 
      international marine coverage services.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 31 (Reuters) - Chevron's Western Australia
operations started getting back to normal after cyclone Iggy was
forecast to weaken, a spokesman for the company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had initiated cyclone readiness plans relating
to its production activities on Barrow Island including 
evacuation of non-essential workers, and shutting in oil
production on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In last weeks rejection of Chevrons attempt to use U.S. courts to block enforcement of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs $18 billion Ecuadorean judgment, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was clearly uneasy at the idea of American judges interfering with foreign jurisprudence. So far, the arbitration panel overseeing Chevrons case against the Republic of Ecuador has had no such qualms. But with Chevron now relying heavily on the arbitration process to protect it from plaintiffs attempts to claim oil company assets, the panels power over foreign courts is going to become a key issue  and the Ecuadorean plaintiffs are now calling for the U.S. government to support Ecuadors sovereignty. Chevron, meanwhile, argues that if anyone has caused harm to Ecuadors constitution, its the Republic and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, not Chevron and the arbitration panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-person arbitration panel, appointed under the terms of a bilateral investment treaty between the United States and Ecuador, is presiding over Chevrons claim that the Republic of Ecuador is liable for any judgment in the Lago Agrio litigation. (The argument is two-fold: Chevron asserts that it has been denied due process, in violation of the investment treaty, and that the Republic signed an indemnification agreement years ago with its predecessor, Texaco.) The arbitrators dont have jurisdiction over the individual Ecuadoreans suing Chevron, but they do have power over the Republic. Last spring, following U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplans imposition of a worldwide injunction barring enforcement of the Ecuadorean trial courts judgment against Chevron, the arbitration panel issued an interim order instructing the Republic to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against  in the Lago Agrio case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, after an intermediate appeals court in Ecuador affirmed the $18 billion judgment, Chevron went back to the BIT arbitration panel  to request emergency relief. Among other things, Chevron asked for a finding that the Republic has not complied with the panels interim order. Last week, the arbitrators converted their interim order into a interim award, which Chevron believes will be a big help in its attempts to persuade courts around the world not to permit the Ecuadoreans to take control of Chevron assets. In early February, the panel will hear evidence on Chevrons allegation that the Republic is helping the Lago Agrio plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But heres the thing: The Republic of Ecuador asserts that the arbitration panel has exceeded its authority by issuing an unconstitutional order. According to the Republics lawyers at Winston  Strawn, the panels instruction calls for the countrys executive branch to breach the Ecuadorean constitutions separation-of-powers doctrine by meddling with the judicial branch. The claimants have claimed in these proceedings that the executive branch has wrongfully injected itself into the legal processes by its occasional public comments over the years touching on a matter of public interest (as Presidents and Prime Ministers across the globe are wont to do), Winston  Strawn wrote in a Jan. 9 letter to the arbitrators. But the claimants ask this tribunal to order direct and actual state intervention in the court processes. The Republic doubts that this would be lawful in any state. It surely is not lawful in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lago Agrio plaintiffs, I should note, do not need the Republics permission to bring enforcement actions against Chevron outside of Ecuador. Those are private actions, although theyre subject to Ecuadors treaties with other nations. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs have waded into the BIT arbitration. Last week, the Ecuadorean lawyer Pablo Fajardo sent a letter to Ecuadors equivalent of our Attorney General, informing him that the Lago Agrio claimants have constitutional concerns about the arbitration, arising from fundamental human rights as well as separation of powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is abundantly clear that the interim order that Chevron is now demanding would violate Ecuadors Constitution, as well as international law, and therefore would be null and void were an arbitral panel to issue it, Fajardos letter said. Moreover, such an order would violate the [bilateral investment treaty], which reflects the clean intent of the two parties to protect the sovereignty of their respective judicial systems  something completely contrary to what Chevron is now demanding at international arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, plaintiffs spokewoman Karen Hinton told me in an email statement Monday that the Ecuadoreans are calling on the U.S. government to take a stand in the BIT arbitration. The United States government cannot stand silent while a U.S. company uses the treaty as a cover to violate international law, deny the human rights of indigenous groups, violate the constitution of a U.S. ally, and threaten the credibility of the entire investor arbitration dispute system  just so it can gain a perceived advantage in a private litigation, Hintons email said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevrons lead arbitration counsel, R. Doak Bishop of King  Spalding, told me Monday that its Chevron, not the Republic or the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, that has seen its rights trampled under the Ecuadorean constitution. As a procedural matter, Bishop said, Chevrons BIT arbitration is against the entire state of Ecuador, not just the executive branch. Separation of powers is irrelevant, he said. The [arbitration panel's] award is directed to the entire state. Bishop also said the arbitrators interim award is intended just to preserve the status quo, so that Chevron isnt harmed when and if it prevails on the merits of its arbitration claim against Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More fundamentally, Doak told me, Chevron is asserting that the Republic breached its own constitutional duty to Chevron to assure due process and to take responsibility for miscarriages of justice. The Republic of Ecuadors constitutional argument against the BIT arbitration interim award turns that on its head, Bishop said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the Lago Agrio plaintiffs call for the U.S. government to get involved? Thats not the place of the U.S. government, Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said. And the subject of these plaintiffs suddenly becoming champions of the Ecuadorean constitution is laughable . This is the same cast of characters who brought a case against Chevron that was unconstitutional right out of the gate. This is hypocrisy at its highest level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Bloom of Winston  Strawn did not return my call for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Robbins Umeda LLP Announces an Investigation of Walter Energy Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shareholder rights firm Robbins 
      Umeda LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and 
      other violations of the law by certain officers and directors at Walter 
      Energy Inc. (NYSE: WLT). Concerned shareholders who would like more 
      information about their rights and potential remedies can contact 
      attorney Gregory E. Del Gaizo at (800) 350-6003, info@robbinsumeda.com, 
      or via the shareholder 
      information form on the firm's website.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Robbins Umeda LLP's investigation focuses on whether officials at Walter 
      Energy breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders and maintained 
      inadequate controls to the detriment of the company and investors. On 
      September 13, 2011, Walter Energy issued a press release in which it 
      announced revised operating plans and second half 2011 sales 
      expectations. Specifically, the press release revealed that the company 
      experienced "squeeze" events in Alabama and lower coal transportation 
      rates in Canada that significantly reduced its coal production; that the 
      company's production had been less than indicated in Walter Energy's 
      previous forecast; and as a result, the company had experienced a 
      decline in its margins and profitability. The revelations made in this 
      press release have resulted in a decline in value of Walter Energy's 
      stock, and has subjected Walter Energy to costly public and legal 
      scrutiny that continues to harm the company and investors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Robbins Umeda LLP highlights that Walter Energy shareholders have the 
      option to file a derivative 
      action to hold those officers and directors accountable for damaging 
      the company. Remedies commonly sought in derivative actions include corporate 
      governance reforms designed to prevent future misconduct, removal of 
      officers or directors whose misconduct injured the corporation, and 
      monetary payments in the form of damages and disgorgement of ill-gotten 
      gains.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Robbins Umeda LLP is a nationally recognized leader in securities 
      litigation and shareholder rights law. The firm represents individual

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Few industries are as dynamic, complex and global as the energy 
      business,&#8221; said PROS Chief Marketing Officer Tim Girgenti. &#8220;These 
      organizations rely on big data to identify buying patterns and behaviors 
      for their business-to-business customers. Our interoperability with 
      Microsoft&#174; SQL Server&#174; provides energy companies 
      with insights into these trends, which inspires confidence and drives 
      business agility. As the energy capital of the world &#8211; and the home of 
      PROS headquarters &#8211; we are pleased that Houston has once again been 
      chosen by Microsoft to be the host city for this important industry 
      event.&#8221;

      &#8220;Energy companies have specialized requirements for managing big data,&#8221; 
      said Herain Oberoi, director, product management, at Microsoft. &#8220;PROS 
      has met Microsoft&#8217;s rigorous integration standards to help companies 
      harness the power of SQL Server to meet those requirements. We are 
      excited to have PROS showcase its solutions at this year&#8217;s Global Energy 
      Forum.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, Jan 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Holzer Holzer &amp; Fistel, LLC announces that it has filed a class action
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama on behalf of purchasers of Walter Energy Inc. ("Walter Energy" or
the "Company") (NYSE: WLT) common stock who purchased shares between
April 20, 2011 and September 21, 2011, inclusive (the "Class Period").
The lawsuit alleges, among other things: (i) that the Company was
experiencing so-called "squeeze" events in Alabama and lower coal
transportation rates in Canada that significantly reduced Walter's coal
production; (ii) that the Company's commitment to ship more than 700,000
tons of coal in the second quarter at first quarter sales prices would
result in a material adverse effect on Walter's average sales prices and
operating results during the second quarter; (iii) that Walter was
experiencing a significant decline in its margins and profitability; and
(iv) that, based on the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis
for their positive statements about the Company and its business
prospects during the Class Period.

    If you purchased Walter Energy common stock during the Class Period, you
have the legal right to petition the Court to be appointed a "lead
plaintiff." A lead plaintiff is a representative party that acts on
behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Any such
request must satisfy certain criteria and be made no later than March 26,
2012. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as
lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do
nothing and remain an absent class member. If you are a Walter Energy
investor and would like to discuss a potential lead plaintiff
appointment, or your rights and interests with respect to the lawsuit,
you may contact Michael I. Fistel, Jr., Esq., or Marshall P. Dees, Esq.

&lt;p&gt;  GADSDEN, AL, Jan 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Having been members of the National Auctioneers Association for decades,
J. P. King Auction Company executives have learned the value and
importance that comes from being educated by others in the industry.
Being the nation's oldest real estate auction marketing firm, J. P. King
is frequently requested for speaking engagements and has accepted several
of those opportunities in the coming weeks, the first of which begins
today.

    "When I first came into the auction industry, I learned a lot from
attending conferences, and I learned even more from the people I met
while I was there," said Craig King, president and CEO of J. P. King
Auction Company. "Now, I feel like we as a company and as individuals
have a lot to offer to teach others, and we're excited to be able to do
that with professionals in several different fields."

    J. P. King Auction Company has accepted an invitation from the IMN
Conference to be represented on a panel at its upcoming Florida Bank and
Financial Institution Special Asset Executive Conference this week in
Florida. Scott King, a principal and executive vice president at J. P.
King, will participate on a panel regarding note and property auctions. 

    As note and bank auctions increase in popularity, J. P. King has aligned
its expertise and provided its services to several banks since the market
downturn in 2007. After several successful auctions, J. P. King was once
again selected by Prescient Asset Management, which specializes in
government-owned assets, to serve as the auction company of choice in
their upcoming March 3 auction.

    The Information Management Network puts together conferences each year,
15 of which discuss the most critical real estate issues. The upcoming
conference in Hallandale, Fla., will hold forums where special asset,
special services, REO, credit and executives can meet to discuss the
latest CRE workout issues. 

    Scott King will present in a session titled "Note/Property Auctions: What
are the Key Ingredients that Lead to Auction Success?" King, along with
three other panelists, will answer questions regarding documentation, big
procedure, due diligence, note vs. REO auctions and when a bank should
consider an auction. The panel will take place on January 31 at 10:55
a.m. The conference will take place at the Westin Diplomat Golf Resort
and Spa. 

    On February 7-8, Craig King will speak on a panel at the National
Auctioneers Association Real Estate Auction Summit. King's panel is
titled "From RFP to Closing the Deal on Complex Sales." 

    Craig King will speak again at the 2012 National Land Conference, which
is hosted by the National Realtors Land Institute. King has spoken to the
National Realtors Land Institute on several occasions and this time will
speak on "Today's Marketplace and Auction Realities." The conference
takes place on March 27-28 in Denver. 

    "The best part of each of these conferences is that we get to spend time
with three different fields, but each of them is impacted by the other,"
King said. "While Scott speaks with the banking industry, where we've
seen a great increase in real estate auctions, I'll be preparing to work
with our fellow auctioneers and fellow brokers. We're three different
industries often working toward a common goal: to sell real estate for
the best price possible and to put families back into dispositioned
homes."

    About J. P. King: Through its asset division, J. P. King specializes in
portfolio sales, which serves corporate clients, financial institutions
and government entities in the disposition of strategic assets. The
company has marketed properties in all 50 states and six countries with
recent sales in Colorado, Kentucky, West Virginia, Oklahoma, California
and Montana.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company released its eighth systemwide Sustainability 
      Report, titled Reasons to Believe. In the Company&#8217;s effort 
      to increase transparency across its broad sustainability platform, this 
      year&#8217;s Report was created using stakeholder feedback and, for the first 
      time, follows the disclosure and reporting requirements of the Global 
      Reporting Initiative (GRI) to achieve a self-declared grade level &#8220;B+.&#8221; 
      With new digital tools available to more people, the report was also 
      created in a unique format offering easier access from smart phones, 
      tablets and other popular mobile devices. And, for the first time ever, 
      its entire content is available exclusively online.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Sustainability has been core to our business strategy for nearly 125 
      years,&#8221; said Chief Sustainability Officer Beatriz Perez. &#8220;After 
      receiving feedback from a variety of stakeholders, we decided to make 
      some significant changes to our sustainability reporting efforts. In 
      addition to increasing transparency within the content, we have taken a 
      digital approach to make the report more user-friendly and accessible on 
      a variety of mobile devices. As we continue to strengthen our 
      sustainability efforts, we also will innovate the means by which we 
      share our progress.&#8221;

      performance and self-declared a B grade against the new GRI G3.1 
      guidelines. This year&#8217;s report also received verification by a third 
      party agency, indicating the agency&#8217;s approval of tracking systems, 
      resulting in an overall B+ grade. The 2010/2011 Sustainability Report 
      provides an in-depth review on the sustainability efforts of the Company 
      and its nearly 300 bottling partners. The four main areas of focus 
      include water stewardship, energy efficiency and climate protection, 
      sustainable packaging and healthy communities. See the 2010/2011

        Our PlantBottle&#8482; technology, which allows us to replace 100 percent 
        petroleum-based PET plastic with PET plastic that contains up to 30 
        percent material derived from plants, is becoming more widely used 
        around the world. In 2010, we distributed 2.5 billion PlantBottle&#8482; 
        packages in 10 major markets, saving more than 60,000 barrels of oil 
        and sequestering the equivalent of nearly 30,000 metric tons of carbon 
        dioxide from our PET plastic bottles. By the end of 2011, PlantBottle&#8482; 
        packaging was available in 20 markets, and nearly 10 billion 
        PlantBottle&#8482; packages had been shipped.
      
			
        In 2010, we improved our water use efficiency for the eighth 
        consecutive year, reducing the average amount of water required to 
        produce each beverage serving. As of the end of 2010, we had achieved 
        93 percent alignment, and by the end of 2011 we estimate 96 percent 
        alignment with our stringent standards.
      
			
        Also in 2010, our system increased production volume while reducing 
        global carbon emissions by 2 percent, putting us a step closer to our 
        goal of growing our business but not our carbon footprint. We also 
        exceeded our goal of installing 150,000 hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free 
        coolers in 2010, for a cumulative total of 277,000 such units by the 
        end of that year. Additionally, we increased that total to 500,000 by 
        the end of 2011.
      
			
        We exceeded our goal to give back at least 1 percent of our operating 
        income to communities worldwide through The Coca-Cola Company and The 
        Coca-Cola Foundation in 2010 by giving $102 million.
      
			
        We began to gain real traction with our new 5 BY 20 initiative to 
        empower 5 million women entrepreneurs by 2020. Furthermore, we 
        continued our commitment to promoting agricultural practices that are 
        better for both farmers and the environment, through projects such as Haiti 
        Hope and Project Nurture.
      
			
        We continued working to make The Coca-Cola Company&#8212;and our entire 
        system&#8212;a great place to work, starting with an unwavering commitment 
        to workplace and human rights. We increased the number of women in 
        system leadership roles, going from 23 percent in 2008 to just over 27 
        percent in 2010.
      
			
        Since 2000, our average calories per serving decreased by 9 percent 
        globally. We have more than 800 low- and no-calorie beverages&#8212;nearly 
        25 percent of our global portfolio. We committed to include calorie 
        information on the front of nearly all our packages by the end of 2011 
        and have a physical activity program in 100 countries toward our goal 
        to have one in every country in which we operate by 2015.

		&lt;p&gt;
			MetLife, Fujitsu, and SWIFT Treasury Successfully Pilot eBAM 
      Central Utility
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) Treasury Services, a full-service provider of 
      cash management, trade finance and treasury solutions, today announced 
      the completion of its Electronic Bank Management (eBAM) central utility 
      pilot (E-CU). One of only four banks to participate, J.P. Morgan 
      successfully implemented the program with three major clients &#8211; MetLife, 
      Fujitsu, and SWIFT Treasury.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multinational corporations typically manage thousands of highly 
      trafficked bank accounts worldwide every day. Today&#8217;s constantly 
      changing business environment brings with it the need to efficiently 
      manage bank account details that can change on a daily basis. In its 
      pilot scope, the E-CU successfully addressed two major financial 
      industry concerns &#8211;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The risk of different interpretation and usage of eBAM messaging 
        standards.
      
			
        Account owners need to understand what information is needed for their 
        eBAM instructions per country and per bank.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The E-CU pilot created a single multibank platform for multinational 
      companies and correspondent banks to manage their bank accounts 
      electronically, capitalizing on industry standards for eBAM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Completing a global test across multiple channels, together with our 
      corporate partners, is a tremendous accomplishment,&#8221; said Nick Donohue, 
      Managing Director, J.P. Morgan Treasury Services. &#8220;J.P. Morgan has been 
      a leader in establishing eBAM and 3SKey standards. The E-CU has the 
      potential to help drive the adoption of, and adherence to, standards, 
      which may eliminate the friction in the process and maximize the 
      transformational opportunity that eBAM has promised to corporations and 
      their banks alike.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The pilot began in August and concluded in December. Key features of the 
      E-CU include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        One single connection to reach multiple banking partners
      
			
        Digital signing using the SWIFT 3SKey digitally interoperable security 
        solution
      
			
        Multichannel access accommodates clients&#8217; various infrastructure needs
      
			
        Single source of country/bank documentation requirements
      
			
        ISO 20022 message validation
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;SWIFT is very excited about the industry collaboration for the eBAM 
      Central Utility proof of concept. The experience with the project will 
      help drive adoption of standardized eBAM ISO 20022 messages and 
      harmonized signing with SWIFT Secure Signature Key (3SKey),&#8221; says Eileen 
      Dignen, Managing Director, Banking Initiatives and Account Management, 
      SWIFT.

			KineMed Announces Research Collaboration With Pfizer for the 
      Advancement of Novel Approaches in Metabolic Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KineMed, Inc. (www.kinemed.com) 
      today announced a non-exclusive research collaboration with Pfizer Inc. 
      (NYSE:PFE) for the advancement of novel approaches towards metabolic 
      disease, in particular Type II Diabetes. The collaboration will employ 
      KineMed&#8217;s Dynamic ProteomicsTM technology platform to map the 
      impact of potential drug candidates on specific metabolic pathways.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Diabetes is an increasingly challenging global healthcare problem and in 
      the United States affects over one quarter of Americans over the age of 
      65. Diabetes is a major cause of heart disease and stroke, and is now 
      also the leading cause of kidney failure, non-traumatic lower-limb 
      amputations, and new cases of blindness among adults in the United 
      States.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite over 50 years of drug research, over 60% of patients remain 
      unresponsive to current therapies, requiring novel approaches to address 
      fundamental metabolic processes in diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;We are delighted to be collaborating with Pfizer in taking novel 
      and innovative approaches, by targeting disease pathways that have 
      previously remained undeveloped as drug targets,&#8221; said Dr. Scott Turner, 
      Executive Vice-President, RD at KineMed. &#8220;We are using our 
      translational platform to accelerate and rapidly de-risk the advancement 
      of novel compounds in pre-clinical and clinical trials.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About KineMed, Inc.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KineMed, based in California, is the world-leader in measuring dynamic 
      biochemical processes that cause disease. Collaboration with KineMed 
      offers deep expertise and access to technologic inventions that 
      accelerate and lower the cost of drug RD, enable new disease-modifying 
      therapies, and diagnose and monitor patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ability to monitor and control the dynamic behavior of networks, 
      rather than isolated targets, is the next great challenge in 
      therapeutics. KineMed&#8217;s patented mass spectrometric technologies measure 
      molecular fluxes in living tissues through the complex molecular and 
      cellular networks that are responsible for disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KineMed&#8217;s innovations have pioneered new fields, including Network 
      Dynamics and In Situ Kinetic Histochemistry. Measuring changes in the 
      dynamics of hundreds of proteins, for example, enables diagnosis and 
      monitoring of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, metabolic and other 
      disorders from a drop of blood. Displaying spatial organization of 
      metabolic fluxes in histopathologic specimens provides functional 
      signatures of disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KineMed&#8217;s established programs with premier pharmaceutical collaborators 
      address critical challenges facing drug discovery:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Focus on causes rather than symptoms: Generating pivotal 
        knowledge for developing blockbuster drugs, by targeting underlying 
        biochemical causes
			
		
		
			
				Systems biology approach: Insight into intact living 
        systems, rather than simplified models, ensures that drug effects are 
        understood in their intended biological context
			
		
		
			
				Reduce late-stage attrition: Early, decision-relevant 
        metrics of drug activity separate winners from losers and reduce later 
        failures to improve the NPV of RD spend
			
		
		
			
				Powerful assays of disease state: Custom-developed assays 
        create companion diagnostic tests for personalized medicine
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			KineMed is seeking broad collaborations with pharmaceutical, CRO, 
      histopathology, diagnostics, medical instrumentation and biotechnology 
      partners.

      DMARC.org to Help Safeguard Consumers, Brands and ISPs from Phishing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Return Path&#8217;s Anti-Phishing Solution, Domain Assurance supports 
      DMARC Specifications Enabling Companies to Implement DMARC Quickly and 
      Easily 
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Return 
      Path, the world&#8217;s&#160;leading email certification and reputation 
      monitoring company, today announced it
			is a founding member of DMARC.org 
      (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance), a 
      technical working group dedicated to the development of internet 
      standards for reducing the threat of deceptive emails known as phishing. DMARC 
      has outlined a new vision for email authentication and published a 
      draft specification that resolves the issues associated with widespread 
      adoption of email authentication technologies. Leading internet service 
      providers, including Google, Yahoo!, AOL and Microsoft, are founding 
      members of DMARC. The group is led by Brett McDowell, Senior Manager of 
      Customer Security Initiatives at PayPal, one of the world&#8217;s most highly 
      spoofed brands. Return Path&#8217;s anti-phishing solution Domain 
      Assurance supports the DMARC specifications today, enabling 
      companies to quickly and easily implement DMARC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Google has worked with Return Path for more than a year now to provide 
      their clients the tools needed to better protect Gmail users from 
      phishing and other malicious email," said Adam Dawes, Product Manager, 
      Google. "Return Path's extensive experience positions it well to improve 
      mail senders' authentication practices and help clean up the email 
      channel. Most importantly, Return Path&#8217;s Domain Assurance product is 
      already set up to support DMARC, and senders can start receiving data 
      from Google and visualizing it with Return Path immediately."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Enabling Widespread Deployment of an Authenticated, Trusted Email 
      Ecosystem
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			According to recent Return 
      Path data, email senders continue to struggle with email 
      authentication, leaving brands vulnerable to phishing attacks. According 
      to a report from the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), more than 
      300 brands are hijacked by phishers every month, eroding trust in the 
      email channel across many sectors including financial services, payment 
      services, gaming, retail, auctions and social networks. While brands 
      have been encouraged to use best practices in their email delivery 
      processes including implementing SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM 
      (Domain Keys Identified Mail), two email authentication standards which 
      help verify that an email is coming from an authorized source, ISPs have 
      not been able to make definitive policy decisions to block 
      unauthenticated email purporting to be from highly spoofed brands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The DMARC specification allows brands of all sizes to empower ISPs to 
      take action on malicious and unauthenticated email appearing to come 
      from that brand. Data on any questionable email streams are sent back to 
      the brand or to an intermediary such as Return Path, enabling the 
      auditing of email streams to determine proper authentication. By 
      creating this feedback loop between ISPs and brands, DMARC allows brands 
      to create policy statements that instruct ISPs to block or quarantine 
      messages that aren&#8217;t properly authenticated, providing the necessary 
      framework to thwart phishing attempts and enabling widespread deployment 
      of a trusted email ecosystem.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Email has changed the way the world communicates. But many of the 
      attributes that have made it great &#8211; it&#8217;s openness, it&#8217;s 
      interoperability &#8211; have also made it vulnerable to malicious activity. 
      The beauty of DMARC is that it attempts to address the security threats 
      to the email ecosystem without impacting its utility as a communication 
      channel,&#8221; said Matt Blumberg, CEO, Return Path. &#8220;Return Path is proud to 
      support the DMARC standard and we encourage companies to implement it as 
      quickly as they can. Fast, widespread adoption of DMARC will make a 
      significant dent in scammers ability to perpetuate crime through email.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Domain Assurance Supports DMARC Specifications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Return Path&#8217;s anti-phishing solution, Domain Assurance supports the 
      DMARC specifications allowing companies to deploy DMARC easily.&#160;Domain 
      Assurance takes the raw data from ISPs that support DMARC and delivers 
      the necessary intelligence, built-in logic and sophisticated alerting 
      that shows where a company&#8217;s implementation is broken or where a company 
      is being spoofed. Domain Assurance receives the data being sent from 
      ISPs that provide DMARC authentication results data (as well as other 
      sources of authentication results data from ISPs that don&#8217;t use DMARC) 
      and provides detailed reporting, including information about every 
      message sent on a brand&#8217;s behalf, whether legitimate or not.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This data enables brands to not only better understand their email 
      streams and which emails are not authenticating, but also empowers them 
      with the ability to understand where phishing traffic is coming from, 
      what the potential impact is from criminal activity, and a means to 
      create policy statements to block future phishing attacks. Leveraging 
      its extensive network and relationships with Google, Hotmail, Yahoo! and 
      more than 70 other global ISP partners along with access to over 2.2 
      billion messages a day, Return Path receives more phishing data than 
      anybody else in the industry, providing the ability to identify, alert 
      on, and block more phishing attacks. Domain Assurance bridges the gap 
      between senders and their ISP, blocking fraudulent phishing email before 
      it reaches end-user recipients. Return Path also fraudcasts phishing 
      URLs and IP addresses to third party security and take-down vendors to 
      broaden protection against phishing threats.

&lt;p&gt;* TonenGeneral needs to meet govt rules to improve
competitiveness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Exxon Mobil to give up control for $3.9 bln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Exxon Mobil to supply crude, allow use of its brand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Risa Maeda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Japan's second-biggest
refiner, TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK, said on Monday its
$4-billion purchase of a controlling stake in itself from U.S.
oil major Exxon Mobil Corp would help speed business
decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchase of the Exxon Mobil stake comes as domestic oil
demand falls and Japanese refiners' products prove uncompetitive
with rivals located closer to the developing economies that are
the world's key drivers of growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil will retain a 22 percent voting share in the
Japanese oil refiner, down from 50 percent, with the 302 billion
yen ($3.94 billion) transaction set to be completed by June 1,
TonenGeneral said on Sunday, confirming a Reuters report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will enable us to complete the procedure of our decision
making within this country," Jun Mutoh, managing director of
TonenGeneral, who has led talks on the transaction since last
year, told reporters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key decision faced by TonenGeneral is how to tackle
Japanese government rules aimed at improving the competitiveness
of the country's ailing oil sector that require the firm to
either cut its crude refining capacity by about 30 percent or
build a new secondary unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since analysts see little chance of new investment, the
TonenGeneral group, including Kyokuto Petroleum Industries, a
50-50 joint venture with Mitsui &amp; Co, needs to cut
capacity to 578,000 barrels per day by March 2014, Reuters
calculations show, from 836,000 bpd now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutoh declined to comment on how the firm would meet
government regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We cannot easily elaborate about our three refineries and
our partner's plant in regard of a future decision related to
the regulations," he said. "We're hoping to find ways to make
every party happy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refinery consolidation is sweeping the developed world, with
Europe's biggest independent refiner Petroplus becoming
the latest victim, being forced to close three of its five oil
refineries after lenders froze credit lines in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal struck on Sunday will allow TonenGeneral, which uses 
crude from Exxon and distributes Exxon brand oil in Japan, to
operate four times more service stations by bringing under its
umbrella those now under the Japanese unit of Exxon Mobil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TonenGeneral stake purchase could further encourage
realignment among Japan's oil refiners, which have been cutting
capacity to cope with falling demand caused by a weak economy
and a shift to more efficient and environmentally friendly forms
of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2010 refiner Nippon Oil and rival Japan Energy's
parent company, Nippon Mining Holdings, merged to become JX
Nippon Oil &amp; Energy Corp, the country's top refiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil demand in Japan, the world's No.3 consumer, has been
falling steadily for more than a decade, to about 3.4 million
bpd now, down about 19 percent from a record 4.2 million bpd in
1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Mutoh ruled out plans to form capital alliances with
state-run oil companies in the Middle East, some analysts said
such alliances were possible to ensure stable crude supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An oil company may ask oil suppliers like Qatar to hold a
part of its shares now that they are all concerned about stable
crude supply," independent oil economist Osamu Fujisawa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I doubt if people will allow a further fall in the
number of oil companies. Retailers are already worried about the
refiners' increased pricing power," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller rival Showa Shell Sekiyu is 15 percent
owned by state oil giant Saudi Aramco after Royal Dutch Shell
 sold down its stake to 35 percent, while Cosmo Oil Co
 is one-fifth owned by the Abu Dhabi government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's total refining capacity stands at 4.5 million bpd,
down nearly 17 percent from 5.4 million bpd at the peak of oil
demand in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Jan 31 (Reuters) - Mexican regulators are
expected to reveal on Wednesday whether they approved or
rejected broadcaster Televisa's planned $1.6 billion purchase of
half of cellphone company Iusacell, media reports and an
industry source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction has been closely watched because if
approved, it would create a strong rival to the world's richest
man, Carlos Slim, in the cellphone market. It also represents an
alliance between two of Mexico's other top tycoons who hold a
near duopoly in television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're told that it's coming tomorrow (Wednesday), though we
don't know when," an industry source with knowledge of the deal
said. The decision is being made by Mexico's competition
watchdog, Cofeco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear if Televisa  
or Iusacell would disclose the Cofeco decision immediately.
Regulators have until Feb. 7 to formally notify the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week ago, Cofeco's board agreed on a ruling, but the
agency has remained mum about what exactly they decided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily newspaper Universal, citing unnamed sources close to
the process, said the purchase had been rejected after a 3-2
vote by the board of Cofeco, following a six-hour
deliberation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Newswires also reported the deal was rejected,
citing a person close to the transaction. But magazine Proceso
and columnist Dario Celis from the daily Excelsior said it was
approved with strict conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with Cofeco, Televisa and Iusacell were not
immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The wait is over for the Cofeco decision," business
columnist Maricarmen Cortes said on her Tweeter account on
Tueday. "Tomorrow (Wednesday) it will finally be official."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Federal prosecutors expanded their insider trading case against former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) director Rajat Gupta on Tuesday, saying the illegal activity lasted longer and involved more trades than alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new indictment filed in Manhattan federal court expanded the period in which Gupta, 63, supposedly provided illegal tips to his friend Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group hedge fund founder now serving an 11-year prison term following his insider trading conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charges now relate to trades that prosecutors said Rajaratnam made between March 2007 and January 2009 in the stock of Goldman and Procter &amp; Gamble Co (PG.N), where Gupta was also a director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, a former chief of the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co, is the most prominent corporate executive to face insider trading charges in a wide-ranging federal probe since Rajaratnam was arrested in October 2009. He has pleaded not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, said in a statement the new charges are baseless and rely on circumstantial evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The facts in this case demonstrate that Mr. Gupta is innocent of all of these charges, and that he has always acted with honesty and integrity," Naftalis said. "(Gupta) did not trade in any securities, did not tip Mr. Rajaratnam so he could trade, and did not share in any profits as part of any quid pro quo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Rajaratnam's lawyers declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DETAILS ALLEGED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the revised indictment does not accuse Gupta of directly profiting from suspect trades, its adds details about his financial relationship with Rajaratnam, including a stake in four Galleon funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta was previously accused of tipping Rajaratnam about Goldman's activities during the 2008 financial crisis, including an investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N), leading to profitable trades for Rajaratnam in September and October of that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new charges include an allegation that Rajaratnam bought at least 350,000 Goldman shares on March 12, 2007, soon after the audit committee of Goldman's board, including Gupta, discussed the better-than-expected quarterly results that the bank would release the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also contend that Rajaratnam on January 29, 2009 sold 180,000 P shares short, a bet they would decline, after learning details from Gupta about the consumer product company's expected earnings announcement the next day. P shares fell 6.4 percent on January 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta was global head of McKinsey for nine years until he retired in 2007. He joined Goldman's board in 2006 and left in May 2010, seven months after Rajaratnam's arrest. He was also a director at P and American Airlines Corp (AAMRQ.PK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both indictments charge Gupta with five counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. Gupta was released on $10 million bail following his arrest. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff presides over the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-907.

      mobile gaming company, to its portfolio.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp reported quarterly earnings that narrowly beat expectations, on higher oil prices and asset sales of about $1 billion, but the company's shares dropped nearly 2 percent as its oil and gas production fell short of estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, said fourth-quarter production dropped 9 percent, which Barclays Capital analyst Paul Cheng found "disappointing" even after accounting for reduced European natural gas sales due to warm weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no strong evidence that the portfolio is delivering the capability to grow and frankly, based on our preliminary take, it looks like costs are going the wrong way," said Mark Gilman, analyst at The Benchmark Company. "There's not a lot to smile about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 2011 output rose 1 percent, this was all natural gas as the production of more lucrative liquids declined. Plus, Exxon's capital expenditures rose to a record $36.8 billion, the top of the range of its multi-year forecast, and oilfield spending generally is expected to increase further this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in a capex mode now and have been for the last year or two, and will for the next couple years be investing in large legacy projects," Exxon spokesman David Rosenthal told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending billions just to maintain steady output has become the norm for the world's top oil companies. Chevron Corp increased its 2012 capital spending plans to $32.7 billion after its 2011 budget came in $3 billion higher than originally expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet in spite of weak U.S. natural gas prices, Irving, Texas-based Exxon has not curtailed domestic gas production, even if it is shifting rigs to basins with more liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon posted fourth-quarter net income of $9.4 billion, or $1.97 per share, compared with $9.25 billion, or $1.85 per share, in the year-ago period. Analysts, on average, had expected $1.96 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts lowered their expectations by a few cents in the past week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarterly profit was Exxon's lowest for 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's revenue rose 16 percent to $121.61 billion, exceeding the $119.7 billion expected, on average, by analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil Ltd, on Tuesday reported a 26 percent increase in profit, on higher crude prices and an improved refining performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising oil prices also helped lift Exxon Mobil's profits at its upstream unit, which produces oil and natural gas, by 18 percent. Land sales contributed to earnings, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, weak economic conditions hurt Exxon's margins. Profit at its downstream unit, which makes engine lubricant and fuel, fell 13 percent. Profit at its chemical unit, which makes plastics and related products, declined 49 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon spent $10 billion during the quarter on capital projects and exploration, in line with the same period in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon were down 1.8 percent at $83.95 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Ernest Scheyder in New York and Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Editing by Dave Zimmerman, Mark Porter and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Daniel Indiviglio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida Republican primary&#8217;s big winner tonight may be Wall Street&#8217;s most infamous bank. Front-runners Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney are trying to connect one another to the financial crisis. Gingrich paints his rival as an agent of the giant vampire squid, while Romney criticizes his opponent for being paid handsomely for advising Freddie Mac to inflate the housing bubble. But in a state still in pain from the bust, Romney&#8217;s line is winning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Florida, the battle occurs through the airwaves. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, has spent more than $15 million advertising in the state, four times as much as his competitor. One Romney ad, in particular, zeroed in on Gingrich&#8217;s role in the housing bubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It argued that the former House speaker was paid $1.6 million by Freddie &#8220;while Florida families lost everything in the housing crisis.&#8221; Such criticism strikes a painful chord in Florida. In Tampa and Miami, for instance, home prices are down about 50 percent from their peak, according to SP/Case-Shiller&#8217;s indexes through November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he doesn&#8217;t have the financial firepower of Romney, Gingrich is attacking from a different angle. He has been complaining loudly about his opponent&#8217;s connection to Wall Street, claiming that the crony capitalism he says is embraced by President Barack Obama would continue in a Romney presidency. Gingrich even asserted in a Fox News interview this week that Republicans would be letting Wall Street and Goldman Sachs buy the election if Romney wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each criticism is a stretch. Gingrich&#8217;s advice hardly led Freddie to suddenly decide to lower loan standards and pour more gasoline onto the raging housing boom. Similarly, Romney is a client of Goldman&#8217;s and has received a hefty amount of campaign contributions from some at the bank, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s in bed with the squid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firms&#8217; narratives differ dramatically. Goldman remains a profitable firm that paid back its bailout quickly with a profit for taxpayers. Freddie is a bankrupt mess with little hope of ever paying in full for its rescue. Although the ballots have yet to be tallied, Romney looks poised to win. That&#8217;s at least a small victory for Goldman&#8217;s battered image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Competition from low-cost generic drugs squeezed quarterly profits at Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Eli Lilly &amp; Co (LLY.N), but both companies were able to weather those declines somewhat with help from other medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, and Lilly topped Wall Street's dim profit expectations. Lilly also said its closely watched experimental Alzheimer's treatment was given a green light for further study, and its shares rose 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's quarterly results were helped by its animal health and nutrition units -- businesses it is considering selling or spinning off. The company said on Tuesday that any separation of those businesses, which analysts say could bring in $16 billion, would occur between July 2012 and July 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That timetable was later than hoped for by some investors, who are eager to see Pfizer use the proceeds to buy back stock, said Edward Jones analyst Linda Bannister. Pfizer shares fell 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People were just hoping that this would occur sooner," Bannister said. "Over time, this is going to work out the way investors hope it will."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Pfizer's revenue will shrink without those units, the streamlined company should get a significant boost to financial results when one of its newer drugs succeed, Bannister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has recently won approval for two cancer drugs, and may soon win clearance for promising medicines for rheumatoid arthritis and blood clot prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once you're so large, it's really difficult to move the needle," Bannister said. "Lilly is the opposite of that right now. They're small; one drug could make a difference for them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read, in a conference call with analysts, said the company should be viewed as two operations: a "growth business" of prescription drugs backed by strong research and development, and a "value business" dominated by its drugs that have lost patent protection and become generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked in an interview if this framework could lead to an eventual spin-off of this generics business, Read said, "We would have to wait and see how the emerging markets develop and how our portfolio develops and at that point in time we would take that decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For a graphic on Pfizer, Lilly earnings, see: link.reuters.com/wyx36s)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIPITOR, ZYPREXA SALES TUMBLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both Pfizer and Lilly, the fourth-quarter results marked the first period since they lost U.S. patent protection on their biggest-selling medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer saw sales of its Lipitor cholesterol treatment, long the world's top-selling drug, drop 24 percent to about $2 billion. In the United States, where Lipitor lost patent protection in late November, sales fell 42 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lilly's Zyprexa anti-psychotic drug, for years the company's biggest product, fell 44 percent to $750 million. Sales in the United States, where the pill lost patent protection in October, plunged 56 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Purkiss, analyst with Atlantic Equities, said Pfizer's profit margins markedly improved during the quarter, an unexpected trend given the onslaught of Lipitor generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that Pfizer expects similarly strong margins for the full year, most likely because of cost savings from the company's purchase of U.S. rival Wyeth in late 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Wyeth takeout is benefitting the company" as Lipitor declines, Purkiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HELP FROM OTHER DRUGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's fourth-quarter net income fell 50 percent to $1.44 billion, or 19 cents per share, from $2.89 billion, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. Pfizer said results in the latest quarter appeared unfavorable in part because of a big tax benefit in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, earnings of 50 cents per share topped Wall Street's target by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 4 percent to $16.75 billion but was a bit higher than Wall Street expectations of $16.61 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Softening the Lipitor declines, some of Pfizer's other important drugs scored moderate sales gains, helped by price increases. Sales of arthritis treatment Enbrel and the Celebrex painkiller each rose 7 percent, to $865 million and $622 million, respectively. Sales of impotence treatment Viagra rose 5 percent to $523 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in the third quarter, Pfizer's strongest gains came from its nutritional products and animal health units. Sales of animal health brands rose 13 percent to $1.1 billion, while sales of nutritional products -- including baby formula and maternity supplements -- jumped 22 percent to $598 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer trimmed its 2012 financial forecasts, largely due to the negative impact of the stronger dollar. It projected 2012 earnings of $2.20 to $2.30 per share, excluding items. That range was down from its prior outlook of $2.25 to $2.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly's fourth-quarter net income fell 27 percent to $858.2 million, or 77 cents per share, from $1.17 billion, or $1.05 per share, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding one-time items, earnings were 87 cents per share, 6 cents ahead of analyst estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global revenue fell 2 percent to $6.05 billion but topped Wall Street expectations of $5.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales growth of other top drugs helped counter Zyprexa's declines, thanks in large part to price increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-depressant Cymbalta, which itself goes generic next year, saw sales jump 20 percent to $1.18 billion. Sales of lung cancer treatment Alimta rose 12 percent to $638 million while Lilly's Humalog insulin vaulted 21 percent to $662 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent data-monitoring committee overseeing two Phase III trials of Lilly's solanezumab Alzheimer's treatment recommended the studies continue without changes, the company said. Trial data is expected in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts believe solanezumab has little chance of success, but say the stock will soar if it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purkiss said Lilly's quarterly results were "reasonably strong" but shares rose instead on the solanezumab news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are concerned about being underweight Lilly if the data come in positively," said Purkiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Mark Porter and Gunna Dickson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The Blackstone Group's GSO Capital Partners, the D.E. Shaw Group and JPMorgan Chase are among the members of a committee of Eastman Kodak debt holders with the biggest stakes, according to a court filing on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge funds and investment firms are part of a committee that includes holders of secured Kodak notes due in 2018 and 2019, known as the second lien debt. The group had been pressuring Kodak for change ahead of its mid-January bankruptcy filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have since filed an objection in court to Kodak's debtor-in-possession financing terms and other motions. Kodak's most secured debt holder - Citibank - is providing the bankruptcy financing that the hedge funds have taken issue with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcy courts can ask committee members to disclose their holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSO - the credit investment unit of Blackstone - has a stake that includes secured notes, unsecured notes and credit default swaps for a total value of $83.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D.E. Shaw has $50 million worth of debt and 967,693 million shares of common stock, which was trading on the pink sheets on Tuesday at 34 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has $20 million worth of secured notes and $33 million worth of unsecured notes while JPMorgan Investment Management has $53 million worth of 2018 notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other holders are Alden Global Capital with $20 million in secured notes and 6 million shares; Archview LP with $30 million in secured notes and 500,000 shares; Avenue Capital with $25 million in 2018 notes; Barclays Capital with $21.5 million in secured notes and $5.5 million in credit default swaps; Bennet Management Corp with $20.75 million in 2018 notes; Capital Ventures International with $20.5 million in secured notes; Litespeed Partners with $27 million of 2019 notes; and RBS Global Banking &amp; Markets with $20 million of secured notes and $8 million in credit default swaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is in re: Eastman Kodak Co et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-10202.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Caroline Humer; editing by Mark Porter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 31 (Reuters) - Baghdad has no legal right
to cancel a major oil contract with Exxon Mobil in
retaliation for its involvement in semi-autonomous Kurdistan,
the head of Iraq's parliamentary oil and energy committee said
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no blacklists in parliament," Adnan al-Janabi
told Reuters on the sidelines of an oil conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon became the first major to move into the northern
Kurdish region in mid-October when it signed a contract for six
exploration blocks. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is
locked in a feud with the Arab-dominated central government in
Baghdad over territory and oil rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iraqi oil ministry has said Exxon's deal is illegal and
could result in termination of its contract to develop the major
West Qurna Phase One oilfield in the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The contracts (signed) by the central government and the
Kurdish region are not fully constitutional. We need to pass the
oil law to set up the federal council, which can then approve
all of the contracts," Janabi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC member Iraq is struggling to pass a modern oil and gas
law to help settle disputes, including those surrounding oil
production-sharing contracts signed by the KRG with foreign
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking later to reporters, Janabi said: "It is less than
constitutional because everything in the oil industry should be
done in cooperation or jointly by the government, the region,
which is Kurdistan and the governors. Nothing less than that is
constitutional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister for Energy Hussain al-Shahristani said
in December that Iraq was considering sanctions on Exxon for
signing a deal in Kurdistan without approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will give them the power through the law and not allow
one party, whether it is al-Shahristani or (Iraq Oil Minister
Abdul-Kareem) Luaibi ... to quarrel over the body of Iraq and
mess up the oil industry of Iraq," Janabi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has not commented publicly on the agreement, and Iraqi
oil officials say the company has not responded to their
requests for an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 31 (Reuters) - Baghdad has no legal right
to cancel a major oil contract with Exxon Mobil in
retaliation for its involvement in semi-autonomous Kurdistan,
the head of Iraq's parliamentary oil and energy committee said
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are no blacklists in parliament," said Adnan
al-Janabi on the sidelines of an oil conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon became the first major to move into the northern
Kurdish region in mid-October when it signed a contract for six
exploration bLocks with Kurdish authorities. The Kurdistan
Regional Government is locked in a feud with the Arab-dominated
central government in Baghdad over territory and oil rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iraqi oil ministry has said Exxon's deal was illegal and
could result in termination of its contract to develop the major
West Qurna Phase One oilfield in the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The contracts (signed) by the central government and the
Kurdish region are not fully constitutional. We need to pass the
oil law to set up the federal council, which can then approve
all of the contracts," Janabi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC member Iraq is still struggling to pass a modern oil
and gas law to help settle disputes, including those surrounding
 oil production-sharing contracts signed by the KRG with foreign
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has not commented publicly on the agreement, and Iraqi
oil officials say the company has not responded to their
requests for an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

			Ferranti Computer Systems: MECOMS&#8482; 2012, Energy and Utilities 
      Solution Receives &#8220;Certified for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012&#8221; 
      Accreditation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ferranti Computer Systems has announced today that its MECOMS&#8482; 2012 
      Solution, offering Customer Information System and Meter Data Management 
      process support for the energy and utilities market, has been awarded 
      the &#8220;Certified for Microsoft Dynamics&#8221; accreditation.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			It is the second major version of MECOMS&#8482; that has successfully 
      completed the &#8220;Certified for Microsoft Dynamics&#8221; program.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MECOMS&#8482; 2012 is a business support system based on Microsoft Dynamics 
      AX, which is used by utility companies around the world. It extends the 
      standard ERP-functionalities of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 with specific 
      utility functionality and best practices for electricity, gas, water, 
      district cooling and thermal energy companies. MECOMS&#8482; brings 
      unprecedented flexibility, efficiency and business insight to empower 
      utilities in lowering their cost to serve.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Certified for Microsoft Dynamics is Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s highest standard 
      for partner-developed software. This certification represents a 
      significant step in elevating the standard for partner-developed 
      software solutions for industry-specific business applications. 
      Solutions with a successful software test have demonstrated development 
      quality and compatibility with the Microsoft Dynamics product. VeriTest, 
      a service of Lionbridge, performed independent and rigorous testing on 
      the solution&#8217;s integration with Microsoft Dynamics, proving the highest 
      quality in programming and documentation. As part of the program at 
      least 10 customers must confirm their reference ability, so (new) 
      customers will have certainty on what they are buying.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This milestone demonstrates Ferranti&#8217;s commitment to delivering 
      leading solutions and expertise for our customers,&#8221; said Doug 
      Kennedy, Vice President, Dynamics Partners  Support Service Programs, 
      Microsoft Corporation. &#8220;We congratulate Ferranti for meeting 
      Microsoft&#8217;s highest standards of software quality.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This certification is the result of our continued focus towards the 
      energy and utilities sector, combined with the efforts of all our 
      customers, partners and employees.&#8221; said Dirk Michiels, CEO of 
      Ferranti. &#8220;Ferranti has always been committed towards software 
      excellence, and this certification is yet another reflection of our 
      continuous commitment. MECOMS&#8482; 2012 gives smart energy and utility 
      companies the tools to implement smarter processes that go beyond the 
      Smart-Energy Market-Hype.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the past years, Microsoft and Ferranti already worked together to 
      align product development and certification. Due to the growing 
      international success of MECOMS&#8482; and Microsoft&#8217;s determination to grow 
      Dynamics AX in the enterprise market, last year both parties agreed to 
      enter in a multi-year Global ISV Agreement. Ferranti is now officially 
      Microsoft&#8217;s priority global alliance &#8220;GO-TO&#8221; partner in the utilities 
      space.

&lt;p&gt;  BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA, Jan 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCBB: SMME) President &amp; CEO of SmartMetric, Inc., C.
Hendrick, announced today that it has been informed by the Federal
Circuit Court that the oral arguments in the case against Visa,
MasterCard, American Express et al will be heard before a panel of three
appeal judges on March 5, 2012.

    C. Hendrick, President and CEO, stated, "We are looking forward to a
hearing of our case before the Federal Appeals Court on the dispute over
whether or not our Patent covers Contactless Credit Cards issued by Visa
and MasterCard. The lower court ruling has determined that the
definitions of our Patent cover what is called contact cards. These are
the same cards that major Banks in the United States along with Visa and
MasterCard have announced are to be rolled out in the USA. Visa, based on
recent media statements, is in fact now pushing that all ATM and Point of
Sale Machines (POS) be ready to accept the new EMV contact Debit and
Credit Cards by June 2013."

    The contact card technology claimed in the SmartMetric, Inc.-issued
Patent, along with the Contactless card technology, is part of a separate
and much larger court case that is on hold till the case brought by
SmartMetric, Inc. in the appeals court dealing with Contactless cards is
handled. 

    The Company President, C Hendrick, welcomes the Appeal Court hearing and
stated that a ruling either way on the Contactless cards will free up the
main litigation already filed against Visa and MasterCard to continue to
move forward in the Courts. 

    The SmartMetric, Inc. President further stated that both Visa and
MasterCard, in announcing and taking steps to introduce new Credit Cards
with contact chips on them, are clearly by a ruling of the courts on
definition of our Patent which the Court has already unambiguously ruled,
in that the SmartMetric Patented technology covers by definition contact
cards, is blatantly and with forethought conducting its business to in
fact breach the SmartMetric issued Patent. While both Visa and MasterCard
know full well that the commercial application of Chip Cards or EMV Cards
are contact cards clearly covered in our Patent they are consciously
working and making investment to use a technology that is plainly in
violation of the SmartMetric-issued Patent. 

    SmartMetric, Inc.'s President, C. Hendrick, is very pleased that
SmartMetric will soon be able to move forward with its main case for
Patent infringement on "contact" chip Credit Cards once the Appeal on
either the inclusion or exclusion of Contactless cards in the SmartMetric
Patent, is heard on March 5, 2012. 

    The Company President further said that on points of law the appeals
court should agree with SmartMetric in that its Patent also covers
Contactless Credit Cards, however, even if the appeals court does not
rule in the Company favor on this point, SmartMetric will irrespectively
be free to immediately move forward with its case filed in another court
covering the new contact Credit Cards.

    The main lawsuit for Patent infringement has been stayed awaiting the
SmartMetric Appeal on whether or not Contactless Credit Cards are subject
to the SmartMetric Patent. If the Court of Appeals rules that Contactless
cards are defined and therefore covered in the SmartMetric Patent then
both kinds of Debit and Credit Card technology will then fall into the
main Patent Infringement Case brought against Visa and MasterCard by
SmartMetric, Inc. 

    Definition:

    Contact Credit Cards are next generation credit cards with a chip mounted
on the surface and a person's card information is encrypted and stored on
the chip rather than the vulnerable magnetic stripe. These high tech
Credit Cards and Debit Cards are used around the World and both Visa and
MasterCard have announced that they will be issuing such cards to
customers in the United States. They are often referred to as either EMV
Cards or Chip and Pin Cards. 

    Contactless Credit Cards are Credit or Debit cards that have a small chip
inside that is not seen by the customer but allows the card user to
insert the card within range of a reader like in the back of a taxi or a
fast food store checkout and make the purchase without using the magnetic
stripe on the card. This kind of card is already in use in the United
States and is used mainly for low cost fast food purchases. Since it is

			Kaspersky Lab Selects DataCore Storage Hypervisor to Safeguard Ten 
      Petabytes of Storage and Accelerate Microsoft Hyper-V
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DataCore Software, the industry&#8217;s premier provider of storage 
      virtualization software, today announced that Kaspersky Lab, the 
      world's largest privately-held Internet security and anti-virus company, 
      has chosen DataCore SANsymphony&#8482;-V storage 
      hypervisor software to virtualize and protect its build-out of 10 
      petabytes of disk storage located in two, separate Moscow data centers. 
      With the SANsymphony-V 
      virtualization layer, Kaspersky Lab has unified the management of its 
      diverse storage systems from IBM, HP and NetApp, added a new level of 
      business continuity safeguards and delivered faster response times by 
      accelerating the performance and flexibility of shared storage in 
      support of its many Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It was clearly a strategic decision for us to integrate a storage 
      virtualization platform in order for us to benefit from greater 
      flexibility, higher levels of business continuity and unified 
      management,&#8221; notes Alexey Ternovsky, Senior Infrastructure Technology 
      Researcher at Kaspersky Lab. &#8220;We evaluated a number of different 
      virtualization approaches and found that DataCore was the perfect fit to 
      meet our demands and help us lower the rising costs for managing and 
      extending storage in the long run. The DataCore storage hypervisor gives 
      us the power to manage huge amounts of data and lets us build our own 
      storage infrastructure with our choice of features and performance 
      characteristics.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kaspersky Lab&#8217;s decision was primarily driven by SANsymphony-V&#8217;s ability 
      to leverage existing storage environments and enhance their enterprise 
      functionality by providing a higher level of availability for business 
      continuity; by adding centralized and simplified management over all 
      their storage assets; by increasing performance; by enabling fast remote 
      site disaster recovery capabilities and by maximizing the utilization of 
      their current investments. Strategically, the flexibility to expand the 
      storage infrastructure vendor and hardware independently on an as-needed 
      base were critical requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the next year, the two Kaspersky locations plan to virtualize 
      nearly ten petabytes of their data (i.e., ten thousand terabytes, or 
      10,000,000,000,000,000 bytes) spread over a mix of storage devices. This 
      will enable the company to offer both centralized IT services for 
      internal requests as well as new services for external customers who 
      rely on Kaspersky Lab&#8217;s data center services and solutions. The DataCore 
      SANsymphony-V storage hypervisor software will be installed at the two 
      data centers and will synchronously mirror all the production data 
      currently located on diverse storage systems each with different 
      characteristics tied to each vendor&#8217;s hardware-based platforms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			High Performance Shared Storage for Microsoft Hyper-V
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the Kaspersky Lab environment, very high performance is critical and 
      the performance demands will continue to grow alongside the ever 
      expanding environment of Microsoft Hyper-V virtual servers and desktops. 
      Ternovsky and his team identified SANsymphony-V to be the most efficient 
      way to provide shared storage for the overall virtualized 
      infrastructure. As the performance needs continue to grow, more memory 
      can be added to boost cache performance and new server technology can be 
      easily inserted without interruption to further scale performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SANsymphony-V helps Kaspersky Lab to expand and optimize capacity on an 
      as-needed basis without hardware vendor lock-in or having to acquire 
      huge amounts of unused disk resources. With lots of automated storage 
      capabilities, such as transparent auto-failover, systems can stay up 
      when underlying devices fail. Moreover, powerful &#8220;Quick Serve&#8221; commands 
      automate the management of storage provisioning. In addition, 
      auto-tiering automates the progression and demotion of data across 
      different storage devices &#8211; based on performance and cost criteria. 
      Bottom-line: SANsymphony-V greatly automates and simplifies the 
      administration and storage tasks found in the huge SAN environment of 
      Kaspersky Lab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The flexibility, performance and management scalability of the DataCore 
      solution make it an effective shared storage solution for our large 
      number of virtual machines running under Microsoft Hyper-V,&#8221; adds 
      Ternovsky. &#8220;We now benefit from a better cost infrastructure which 
      allows hardware interchangeability adding a new level of savings and 
      agility to managing our systems and their cost. Our IT administrators 
      have a lot of know-how with Microsoft Windows and virtual machines under 
      Hyper-V, so it was important that SANsymphony-V is not only 
      Microsoft-certified but is intuitive and familiar &#8211; with a similar look 
      and feel and many automated features that make storage administration in 
      such a big environment much more practical and easy.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream earnings were $8,829&#160;million, up $1,349 million from the fourth 
      quarter of 2010. Higher liquids and natural gas realizations increased 
      earnings by $1,990 million. Lower volumes and production mix effects 
      decreased earnings by $1,450 million. All other items, primarily gains 
      on asset sales, increased earnings by $810&#160;million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 9% from the fourth 
      quarter of 2010. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC 
      quota effects and divestments, production was down 4%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquids production totaled 2,250&#160;kbd (thousands of barrels per day), 
      down 276 kbd from the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the impacts of 
      entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids 
      production was down 3%, mainly due to field decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fourth quarter natural gas production was 13,677&#160;mcfd (millions of cubic 
      feet per day), down 975 mcfd from 2010, as U.S. growth was more than 
      offset by field decline and lower demand in Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,184&#160;million, $133&#160;million 
      lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were 
      $7,645 million, up $1,482&#160;million from last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downstream earnings of $425&#160;million were down $725&#160;million from the 
      fourth quarter of 2010. Weaker margins, principally in refining, 
      decreased earnings $740 million. Volume and mix effects decreased 
      earnings by $30 million, while all other items increased earnings by 
      $40&#160;million. Petroleum product sales of 6,493&#160;kbd were 62&#160;kbd lower than 
      last year's fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $30&#160;million, down $196&#160;million 
      from the fourth quarter of 2010. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of 
      $395&#160;million were $529&#160;million lower than last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chemical earnings of $543&#160;million were $524&#160;million lower than the 
      fourth quarter of 2010. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $230 
      million, while lower volumes and mix effects reduced earnings by $40 
      million. Other items, mainly unfavorable tax effects, decreased earnings 
      by $250 million. Fourth quarter prime product sales of 6,271&#160;kt 
      (thousands of metric tons) were 78&#160;kt lower than last year's fourth 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Corporate and financing expenses were $397&#160;million, down $50&#160;million 
      from the same period in 2010.

      During the fourth quarter of 2011, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 69 
      million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of 
      $5.4 billion. These purchases included $5&#160;billion to reduce the number 
      of shares outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in 
      conjunction with the company's benefit plans and programs. Share 
      purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to 
      equal $5&#160;billion in the first quarter of 2012. Purchases may be made in 
      both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be 
      increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

      Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by 
      $10.6&#160;billion, while volume and production mix effects decreased

		&lt;p&gt;
      Natural gas production of 13,162&#160;mcfd increased 1,014&#160;mcfd from 2010,

      Downstream earnings of $4,459&#160;million increased $892 million from 2010. 
      Margins, mainly refining, increased earnings by $800 million. Volume and 
      mix effects improved earnings by $630 million. All other items, 
      primarily the absence of favorable tax effects and higher expenses, 
      decreased earnings by $540 million. Petroleum product sales of 6,413&#160;kbd 
      were in line with 2010.

			Cautionary statement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Statements relating to future plans, projections, events or 
      conditions are forward-looking statements.
			Actual results, 
      including project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and 
      exploration expenditures; and share purchase levels, could differ 
      materially due to factors including: changes in
			oil or gas prices 
      or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas 
      industry, including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the 
      outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law or 
      government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the 
      outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating 
      conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors 
      Affecting Future Results" in the &#8220;Investors&#8221; section of our website and 
      in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2010 Form
			10-K.
			We assume no 
      duty to update these statements as of any future date.
			References 
      to quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe 
      will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as &#8220;proved 
      reserves&#8221; under SEC definitions.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Frequently used terms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both 
      earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding 
      special items.
			Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are 
      included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance 
      across periods.
			Reconciliation to net income attributable to 
      ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.
			The release also includes 
      cash flow from operations and asset sales.
			Because of the regular 
      nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is 
      useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the sales of 
      subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of 
      investments together with cash provided by operating activities when 
      evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing 
      activities.
			A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating 
      activities is shown in Attachment II.
			Further information on 
      ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other 
      terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Reference to Earnings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable 
      to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.
			Unless 
      otherwise indicated, references to earnings, special items, earnings 
      excluding special items, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate 
      and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's 
      share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.

			Zeacom Contact Center Ready for Primetime on Microsoft&#8482; Lync&#8482;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Zeacom, a global provider of multimedia contact center and business 
      process automation solutions, today reported that its Zeacom 
      Communications Center (ZCC) contact center software is now available for 
      Lync &#8211; Microsoft&#8217;s software telephony platform which is being rapidly 
      adopted by enterprises worldwide. The announcement follows a successful 
      beta program which saw ZCC deployed at Lync sites in Northern Europe and 
      Asia Pacific. Zeacom is a leader amongst Microsoft Managed ISV&#8217;s for 
      Lync, with the resources to help organizations build out their helpdesk, 
      call center or multimedia contact center to the Lync platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Spotless Group, a $2.5 billion facilities management company, migrated 
      600 Australian head office staff and its mission-critical IT helpdesk to 
      Microsoft Lync without missing a call. The helpdesk supports the 
      company&#8217;s payroll function &#8211; ensuring that over 40,000 workers are paid 
      accurately and on time. Spotless successfully piloted and moved its 
      ZCC-powered call center from the company&#8217;s old PBX to Lync in less than 
      four weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Zeacom has over 4,000 customer sites worldwide and had been delivering 
      enterprise-class contact center functionality on three of the world&#8217;s 
      most prevalent telephony platforms for 17 years. With the release of ZCC 
      for Lync, organizations now have even greater choice when it comes to 
      moving their existing contact center solution from one voice platform to 
      another. Targeting up to 400 seats on Lync, ZCC allows contact centers 
      to control the delivery of every contact &#8211; from voice calls and email to 
      SMS and social media alerts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;When it comes to contact centers, it&#8217;s not what you do but how you do 
      it that matters,&#8221; said Zeacom Vice President of Marketing, Sam Williams. 
      &#8220;Zeacom&#8217;s use of Microsoft&#8217;s native UCMA architecture and trusted 
      conferencing platform allows us to offer more expansive functionality. 
      Our heritage of using other manufacturers&#8217; native methods of integration 
      gives us a proven track record of delivering highly functional call 
      center and business process automation solutions.&#8221;

      Since its inception, Zeacom has maintained a channel-only sales model 
      and has a team of subject matter experts committed to supporting its 
      partners worldwide, allowing them to build profitable relationships

      Business Process Automation or Communications Enabled Business Processes 
      (CEBP) to drive additional productivity out of their solutions,&#8221; added 
      Williams. &#8220;We are committed to enabling our partners and systems 
      integrators to derive profits from the delivery of process automation 
      and professional services. Together with our architectural advantages, 
      and the range of choice clients have for telephony, we see a tremendous 
      growth opportunity with this release.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) reported sharply lower quarterly earnings, hurt by generic forms of its Lipitor cholesterol drug, and the company trimmed its 2012 forecasts because of negative effects of the stronger dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest drugmaker, whose shares rose almost 1 percent in premarket trading, said on Tuesday that it had earned $1.44 billion, or 19 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with $2.89 billion, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 50 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 47 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said results in the latest quarter appeared so unfavorable largely because of a big tax benefit in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 4 percent to $16.75 billion, but was a bit higher than Wall Street expectations of $16.61 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Pfizer vowed to slash billions of dollars in costs, largely through layoffs of thousands of researchers, to weather plunging sales of Lipitor. The pill had been the world's top-selling drug for years, capturing annual sales of more than $13 billion at its peak, but it lost U.S. patent protection in late November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global fourth-quarter sales of Lipitor fell 24 percent to $2 billion, including a 42 percent decline in the United States. But some of Pfizer's other biggest drugs scored moderate sales gains, helped by price increases. Sales of arthritis treatment Enbrel and the Celebrex painkiller each rose 7 percent, to $865 million and $622 million, respectively. Sales of impotence treatment Viagra rose 5 percent to $523 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in the third quarter, Pfizer's strongest gains came from its nutritional products and animal health units -- noncore businesses that it aims to possibly sell or spin off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ian Read on Tuesday said that any separation of the two businesses would occur between July 2012 and July 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of animal health brands rose 13 percent in the quarter to $1.1 billion, while sales of nutritional products -- including baby formula and maternity supplements -- jumped 22 percent to $598 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer forecast 2012 earnings of $2.20 to $2.30 per share, excluding items. That range was down from its prior outlook of $2.25 to $2.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company lowered its 2012 revenue forecast to a range of $60.5 billion to $62.5 billion, from its earlier outlook of $62.2 billion to $64.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer were up 0.6 percent at $21.70 in trading before the market opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Derek Caney and Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Viscount Systems Inc. (OTCMARKETS:VSYS.QB) a leading edge high 
      technology supplier of security systems and software today announced it 
      will launch a new version of its application, Freedom, that works with 
      Microsoft Windows Azure to offer customers enhanced security, as well as 
      innovative user interface features and reliability improvements. As a 
      new member of the Microsoft Partner Network Viscount is now authorized 
      to use the Powered by Windows Azure logo on its Freedom cloud software 
      application and list Freedom in the Windows Azure marketplace. To 
      receive this authorization Viscount rebuilt the core Freedom engine 
      using Microsoft SQL Azure and submitted the new platform to Microsoft 
      Platform Ready for testing. Viscount&#8217;s Freedom technology is the first 
      security system that eliminates the cost of access control panels in 
      favor of a software application running in the cloud on Microsoft Azure. 
      By dramatically reducing the hardware costs associated with access 
      control systems Freedom creates a powerful economic model for clients 
      offering managed systems or software as a service (SaaS). Finally, using 
      Viscount&#8217;s new Microsoft Active Directory security schema, physical and 
      logical security become a single unified application running in the 
      Cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our ISV (Independent Software Vendor) community is alive with 
      innovation, and we&#8217;re committed to helping our partners drive the next 
      generation of software experiences,&#8221; said Ross Brown, Vice President of 
      ISV and Solutions Partners for the Worldwide Group at Microsoft. &#8220;Adding 
      compatibility for the latest Microsoft technologies helps ISVs to stay 
      ahead of the competition and give their customers access to cutting-edge 
      technologies.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Viscount is excited to launch this new version of Freedom,&#8221; said 
      Stephen Pineau, CEO of Viscount. &#8220;Making our application compatible with 
      Microsoft Azure helps us offer our customers compelling benefits, 
      including improved reliability, features and tools to keep them 
      connected to data stored on the web. The release of our unified physical 
      and logical security solution using Microsoft Active Directory in the 
      cloud and Powered by Azure is a seminal event in the history of 
      physical security systems. For decades now up to 80% of the cost of a 
      typical door access system has come from dedicated control panels and 
      dedicated desktop GUI licenses. With Freedom in the cloud this cost 
      simply vanishes. Any door or alarm point can be managed in the cloud 
      using an IP bridge. While this was unthinkable a few years ago, by 
      designing physical security as a software rather than a hardware 
      solution, Viscount is the first physical security provider to enable end 
      users and integrators to take full advantage of the cloud to secure 
      people and property using Microsoft software and at a dramatically 
      reduced cost.&#8221;

      Full-year 2011 revenues were $67.4 billion, an increase of 1% compared 
      with $67.1 billion in full-year 2010, which reflects an operational 
      decline of $1.6 billion, or 2%, and the favorable impact of foreign 
      exchange of $1.9 billion, or 3%. For full-year 2011, U.S. revenues were 
      $26.9 billion, a decrease of 7% compared with full-year 2010. 
      International revenues were $40.5 billion, an increase of 6% compared 
      with the prior-year, which reflects 1% operational growth and a 5% 
      favorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 40% of 
      total revenues in full-year 2011 compared with 43% in full-year 2010, 
      while international revenues represented 60% of total revenues in 
      full-year 2011 compared with 57% in full-year 2010.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Primary Care(4) unit revenues were favorably impacted 
      primarily by foreign exchange, growth from Celebrex, Lyrica, Pristiq and 
      Spiriva, among others, and the addition of $93 million, or 2%, from 
      legacy King products, while negatively impacted by the loss of 
      exclusivity of Lipitor and Caduet in the U.S. in November 2011, Lipitor 
      in various other developed markets during 2010, as well as Aricept in 
      the U.S. in November 2010. Taken together, these losses of exclusivity 
      reduced Primary Care(4) unit revenues by $775 million, or 
      13%, in comparison with fourth-quarter 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Specialty Care(5) unit revenues were positively impacted by 
      foreign exchange and growth in Enbrel in developed markets and Prevenar 
      (7-valent) in Japan. U.S. Prevnar 13 revenues in fourth-quarter 2011 
      were lower than in the prior-year quarter primarily because most 
      patients eligible to receive the Prevnar 13 catch-up dose have already 
      been vaccinated. Specialty Care(5) unit revenues were also 
      negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Vfend and Xalatan in 
      the U.S. in February and March 2011, respectively. Collectively, these 
      losses of exclusivity reduced Specialty Care(5) unit revenues 
      by $205 million, or 5%, in comparison with fourth-quarter 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Emerging Markets(6) unit revenues were impacted by several 
      factors. Volume growth was more than offset by the negative impact of 
      foreign exchange and increased pricing pressures as well as by certain 
      other events, including changes in institutional purchase patterns in 
      Turkey and Brazil, currency devaluation in Venezuela as well as the loss 
      of exclusivity of Lipitor in Brazil and Mexico in 2010. These losses of 
      exclusivity reduced Emerging Markets(6) unit revenues by $29 
      million, or 1%, in comparison with fourth-quarter 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Established Products(7) unit revenues were mainly impacted by 
      the loss of exclusivity of Effexor XR, Protonix and Zosyn in the U.S., 
      which taken together reduced Established Products(7) unit 
      revenues by $208 million, or 9%, in comparison with fourth-quarter 2010. 
      Additionally, fourth-quarter 2011 revenues were negatively impacted in 
      comparison with fourth-quarter 2010 by the entry of multi-source generic 
      competition in the U.S. following the end of the 180-day exclusivity 
      period for donepezil (Aricept) in May 2011. These declines were 
      partially offset by $150 million, or 6%, from the addition of legacy 
      King products, as well as by foreign exchange and by revenue from our 
      agreement granting Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the exclusive right to 
      sell the authorized generic version of Lipitor in the U.S. Total 
      revenues from established products in both the Established Products(7) 
      and Emerging Markets(6) units were $3.3 billion, with $954 
      million generated in emerging markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Animal Health(9) unit revenues increased by 13%, in 
      comparison with the same quarter last year, primarily due to the 
      addition of legacy King products as well as strong performance in the 
      global livestock portfolio. The Consumer Healthcare(10) unit 
      generated revenue growth of 8% in comparison with fourth-quarter 2010, 
      primarily driven by the non-recurrence of the temporary voluntary 
      withdrawal of Centrum in Europe in third-quarter 2010 and by increased 
      sales of core brands, including Advil, Caltrate and Robitussin. Nutrition(11) 
      unit revenues increased 22% in comparison with the same quarter last 
      year. This performance was driven by increased demand for premium 
      products, new product launches and overall strength in the China, Hong 
      Kong and Middle East markets, in addition to foreign exchange.

      Adjusted total costs(13) were $11.0 billion in fourth-quarter 
      2011, a decrease of 9% compared with $12.2 billion in fourth-quarter 
      2010. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $481 
      million, or 4%, adjusted total costs(13) decreased 5%, 
      primarily reflecting the benefit of cost-reduction and productivity 
      initiatives, particularly in the research and development organization. 
      Savings were also generated in fourth-quarter 2011 by reductions in the 
      U.S. field force and declines in promotional spending in response to 
      product losses of exclusivity. These savings were partially offset by 
      the addition of costs from legacy King operations and the inclusion of 
      the U.S. healthcare reform fee. Adjusted cost of sales(1) was 
      unfavorably impacted by the addition of legacy King operations, the 
      Puerto Rico excise tax, as well as a shift in geographic and business 
      mix.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In fourth-quarter 2011, the effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) 
      was approximately 30.2% compared with approximately 25.8% in 
      fourth-quarter 2010. The increase
			was primarily due to the 
      change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the extension of the 
      U.S. research and development credit that was signed into law in 
      December 2010. In full-year 2011, the effective tax rate on adjusted 
      income(1) was approximately 29.5% compared with approximately 
      29.7% in full-year 2010. The decrease
			was primarily due to 
      the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for fourth-quarter 2011 
      was 7.7 billion shares, a reduction of approximately 361 million shares 
      compared with fourth-quarter 2010. The diluted weighted-average shares 
      outstanding for full-year 2011 was 7.9 billion shares, a reduction of 
      approximately 204 million shares compared with full-year 2010. These 
      share declines were primarily due to the Company&#8217;s ongoing share 
      repurchase program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of the aforementioned factors, fourth-quarter 2011 adjusted 
      income(1) was $3.9 billion, an increase of 3% compared with 
      $3.7 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) 
      was $0.50, an increase of 6% compared with $0.47 in the year-ago 
      quarter. Additionally, full-year 2011 adjusted income(1) was 
      $18.2 billion, an increase of 2% compared with $17.9 billion in 
      full-year 2010, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) was $2.31, an 
      increase of 4% compared with $2.22 in full-year 2010.

			Reported Net Income(2) and Reported Diluted 
      EPS(2)
			Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the aforementioned factors, fourth-quarter and full-year 
      2011 reported earnings in comparison with the same periods in 2010 were 
      unfavorably impacted by the non-recurrence of a 2010 favorable 
      settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service related to issues the 
      Company was appealing regarding the audits of the Pfizer Inc. and 
      Pharmacia tax returns for multiple years as well as by charges recorded 
      in 2011 related to hormone therapy litigation and higher charges 
      associated with cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. These 
      factors were partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs and the 
      non-recurrence of charges recorded in 2010 for asbestos litigation. 
      Full-year 2011 reported earnings were also favorably impacted by lower 
      purchase accounting adjustments as well as lower impairment charges 
      related to certain intangible assets acquired in connection with the 
      Wyeth acquisition and by the $1.3 billion (after-tax) gain on the sale 
      of Capsugel(14) in third-quarter 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective tax rate on reported results was approximately 34.9% in 
      fourth-quarter 2011. In fourth-quarter 2010, Pfizer reached the 
      aforementioned settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which 
      reduced its&#160;unrecognized tax benefits, and recorded a corresponding tax 
      benefit to its income tax provision in fourth-quarter 2010, resulting in 
      a favorable impact on net income. In full-year 2011, the effective tax 
      rate on reported results was approximately 31.5% compared with 
      approximately 11.5% in full-year 2010. The increases in both periods were
			primarily due to the non-recurrence of that settlement, partially 
      offset by the decrease and jurisdictional mix of certain impairment 
      charges related to assets acquired in connection with the Wyeth 
      acquisition as well as a change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of all these factors, fourth-quarter 2011 reported net income(2) 
      was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 50% compared with $2.9 billion in the 
      prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS(2) was $0.19, a 
      decrease of 47% compared with $0.36 in the prior-year quarter. 
      Additionally, full-year 2011 reported net income(2) was $10.0 
      billion, an increase of 21% compared with $8.3 billion in full-year 
      2010, and reported diluted EPS(2) was $1.27, an increase of 
      25% compared with $1.02 in full-year 2010.

			Executive Commentary
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ian Read, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, &#8220;Overall, 2011 
      was a year of setting new direction and focus for Pfizer. I am pleased 
      with our 2011 financial performance, which was achieved in the face of a 
      challenging global market and product losses of exclusivity of 
      approximately $5 billion. We also made significant progress regarding 
      capital allocation for the benefit of our shareholders during 2011.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In 2011, we advanced our pipeline and improved the rigor and 
      productivity of our research and development (RD) efforts, while also 
      changing the culture within the RD organization to be more accountable 
      and results-driven. With the steady cadence of new product launches, 
      marketing submissions and approvals, and positive late-stage clinical 
      data presentations, we are clearly seeing the benefits of our 
      investments and new approach. Prevnar/Prevenar 13 for adults, 
      tofacitinib, Xalkori, Inlyta (axitinib) and Eliquis are well positioned 
      to be important new product opportunities that may enhance the 
      performance of our business. Additionally, we have a next wave of 
      compounds that have shown promise in early and mid-stage studies, and we 
      look forward to progressing them through the pipeline. Each of these 
      compounds represents a potential valuable, new treatment option for 
      patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As we begin 2012, we remain intently focused on generating attractive 
      returns for our shareholders. We will continue to fix the innovative 
      core in order to enhance our post-proof-of-concept portfolio of 
      compounds in high-priority disease areas and successfully launch 
      additional novel products. We will also continue executing on our 
      strategic decisions, including exploring value-creating alternatives for 
      our Animal Health and Nutrition businesses, allocating our capital in 
      the best interests of our shareholders and continuing to rigorously 
      manage our expenses. We are committed to repurchasing approximately $5 
      billion of our common stock this year under our recently authorized $10 
      billion share repurchase program and paying over $6 billion in 
      dividends. We remain on-track with our timeline of finalizing strategic 
      decisions for the Animal Health and Nutrition businesses this year and 
      continue to expect that any separation of these businesses from Pfizer 
      will occur between July 2012 and July 2013. I am excited with the 
      opportunities afforded to Pfizer this year and look forward to 
      continuing the significant progress we&#8217;ve made,&#8221; concluded Mr. Read.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Frank D&#8217;Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, &#8220;We achieved or 
      exceeded each of the components of our 2011 financial guidance, 
      including exceeding our reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS(1) 
      guidance ranges. In addition, we achieved our cost-reduction target 
      associated with the Wyeth integration one year earlier than anticipated, 
      generating more than $4.0 billion in reductions on an operational basis 
      in comparison with the 2008 combined costs of Pfizer and Wyeth. For 
      2012, we have reduced our reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS(1) 
      guidance ranges, primarily to reflect changes in foreign exchange rates 
      from mid-October 2011 to mid-January 2012. We are also providing for the 
      first time a 2012 guidance range for adjusted cost of sales(1) 
      as a percentage of revenues and have lowered our guidance range for 
      adjusted SIA expenses(1).&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Further, regarding capital allocation, the strength of our balance 
      sheet and operating cash flow enabled us to return $15.2 billion to our 
      shareholders in 2011 through $6.2 billion in dividends and $9.0 billion 
      from the repurchase of 459 million shares,&#8221; Mr. D&#8217;Amelio continued.

      (1) "Adjusted Income" and its components and "Adjusted Diluted Earnings 
      Per Share (EPS)" are defined as reported net income(2) 
      and its components and reported diluted EPS(2) excluding 
      purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued 
      operations and certain significant items. Adjusted Cost of Sales, 
      Adjusted Selling, Informational and Administrative (SIA) expenses, 
      Adjusted Research and Development (RD) expenses and Adjusted Other 
      (Income)/Deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same 
      basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income 
      measure. As described under Adjusted
			Income in the 
      Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
      of Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended 
      October 2, 2011, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, 
      to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall 
      company. We believe that investors' understanding of our performance is 
      enhanced by disclosing this measure. Reconciliations of fourth-quarter 
      2011 and 2010 and full-year 2011 and 2010 adjusted income and its 
      components and adjusted diluted EPS to reported net income(2) 
      and its components and reported diluted EPS(2), as well as 
      reconciliations of full-year 2012 guidance for adjusted income and 
      adjusted diluted EPS to full-year 2012 guidance for reported net income(2) 
      and reported diluted EPS(2), are provided in the materials 
      accompanying this report. The adjusted income and its components and 
      adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, 
      substitutes for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net 
      income and its components and diluted EPS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (2) &#8220;Reported Net Income&#8221; is defined as net income attributable to 
      Pfizer Inc. in accordance with U.S. GAAP. &#8220;Reported Diluted EPS&#8221; is 
      defined as reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common 
      shareholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      (3) In all periods presented, the results from the Capsugel(14) 
      business, as well as the gain on the sale of Capsugel in third-quarter 
      2011, are reflected in a single line, Discontinued operations - net 
      of tax, until the completion of the sale on August 1, 2011. 
      Additionally, due to the acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
      (King), legacy King operations are reflected in the 2011 results 
      beginning January 31, 2011. Therefore, in accordance with Pfizer&#8217;s 
      domestic and international reporting periods, the results for full-year 
      2011 reflect approximately eleven months of King&#8217;s U.S. operations and 
      approximately ten months of King&#8217;s international operations. Legacy King 
      operations are not reflected in the results for full-year 2010.

      including, but not limited to, Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea), 
      Latin America, Middle East, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and 
      Turkey.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (7) The Established Products unit generally includes revenues from human 
      prescription pharmaceutical products that have lost patent protection or 
      marketing exclusivity in certain countries and/or regions. Typically, 
      products are transferred to this unit in the beginning of the fiscal 
      year following losing patent protection or marketing exclusivity. In 
      certain situations, products may be transferred to this unit at a 
      different point than the beginning of the fiscal year following losing 
      patent protection or marketing exclusivity in order to maximize their 
      value. This unit also excludes revenues generated in emerging markets(6). 
      Examples of products in this unit include, but are not limited to, 
      Arthrotec, Effexor, Medrol, Norvasc, Protonix, Relpax and Zosyn/Tazocin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (8) The Oncology unit includes revenues from human oncology and 
      oncology-related products. Examples of products in this unit include, 
      but are not limited to, Aromasin, Sutent, Torisel and Xalkori. All 
      revenues for such products are allocated to the Oncology unit, except 
      those generated in emerging markets(6) and those that are 
      managed by the Established Products(7) unit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (9) Animal Health includes worldwide revenues from products and services

            outstanding shares of common stock of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

            include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows

            international reporting periods, the 2011 results reflect 
            approximately eleven months of King's U.S. operations and 
            approximately ten months of King's international operations. Our 
            consolidated statements of income for the three-month and 
            twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2010 do not include King's

            On January 31, 2011, we completed our tender offer for the 
            outstanding shares of common stock of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
            (King) and, commencing from that date, our financial statements 
            include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows 
            of King. Therefore, in accordance with Pfizer's domestic and 
            international reporting periods, the 2011 results reflect 
            approximately eleven months of King's U.S. operations and 
            approximately ten months of King's international operations. Our 
            consolidated statements of income for the three-month and 
            twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2010 do not include King's 
            results of operations.

            Transaction costs represent external costs directly related to 
            acquired businesses and primarily include expenditures for 
            banking, legal, accounting and other similar services. Integration 
            costs represent external, incremental costs directly related to 
            integrating acquired businesses, and primarily include 
            expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and 
            processes. Restructuring charges include employee termination 
            costs, asset impairments and other exit costs associated with 
            business combinations. The sum of these costs and charges is 
            included in Restructuring charges and certain 
            acquisition-related costs.

			1. Change in Reported Cost of Sales
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported cost of sales decreased 6% in fourth-quarter 2011 and 5% in 
      full-year 2011, compared to the same periods in 2010. The decreases are 
      due to lower purchase accounting adjustments in 2011, as well as savings 
      associated with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, 
      partially offset by the addition of costs from legacy King&#8217;s operations, 
      the Puerto Rico excise tax, as well as a shift in geographic and 
      business mix. In addition, fourth-quarter 2011 was favorably impacted by 
      foreign exchange of 12%, while full-year 2011 was unfavorably impacted 
      by foreign exchange of 2%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 0.7 
      percentage points to 23.3% in fourth-quarter 2011, compared to the same 
      period in 2010, reflecting the aforementioned factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2. Change in Reported Selling, Informational  
      Administrative (SIA) Expenses and Reported Research  Development (RD) 
      Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported SIA expenses decreased 6% in fourth-quarter 2011 and were 
      largely unchanged in full-year 2011, compared to the same periods in 
      2010. Both periods were unfavorably impacted by the fee provided for 
      under the 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation beginning in 2011 and 
      the addition of legacy King operating costs, and favorably impacted by 
      savings associated with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. 
      In addition, fourth-quarter and full-year 2011 were unfavorably impacted 
      by foreign exchange of 1% and 2%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported RD expenses decreased 7% in fourth-quarter 2011 and decreased 
      3% in full-year 2011, compared to the same periods in 2010. Both periods 
      were favorably impacted by savings associated with our cost-reduction 
      and productivity initiatives, and unfavorably impacted by higher charges 
      related to those initiatives and the addition of legacy King expenses. 
      Foreign exchange did not have any impact on fourth-quarter 2011, while 
      full-year 2011 was unfavorably impacted by 1%.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective
			tax rate on reported Income from continuing 
      operations before provision for taxes on income for fourth-quarter 
      2011 was 34.9%. The Company recorded a tax benefit in fourth-quarter 
      2010. The effective
			tax rate on reported Income from 
      continuing operations before provision for taxes on income for 
      full-year of 2011 was 31.5% compared to 11.5% in full-year 2010. The 
      increases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        the non-recurrence of a settlement reached with the U.S. Internal 
        Revenue Service (IRS) in 2010 (see additional discussion below),
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      partially offset by:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        the decrease and jurisdictional mix of certain impairment charges 
        related to assets acquired in connection with the Wyeth acquisition; 
        and
      
			
        the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the fourth quarter of 2010, we reached a settlement with the IRS 
      related to issues we had appealed with respect to the audits of the 
      Pfizer Inc. tax returns for the years 2002 through 2005, as well as the 
      Pharmacia audit for the year 2003 through the date of merger with Pfizer 
      (April 16, 2003). The IRS concluded its examination of the 
      aforementioned tax years and issued a final Revenue Agent&#8217;s Report 
      (RAR). The Company agreed with all of the adjustments and computations 
      contained in the RAR. As a result of settling these audit years, we 
      reduced our unrecognized tax benefits for fourth-quarter and full-year 
      2010 by approximately $1.4 billion and recorded a corresponding tax 
      benefit. The fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 effective tax rates were 
      also favorably impacted by approximately $600 million related to 
      interest on these unrecognized tax benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Adjusted
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) for 
      fourth-quarter 2011 was 30.2% compared to 25.8% in fourth-quarter 2010, 
      primarily due to the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, and 
      the extension of the U.S. research and development credit, and in 
      full-year 2011 was 29.5% compared to 29.7% in full-year 2010, primarily 
      as a result the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 31 (Reuters) - Two Goldman Sachs metals
traders have left the company,  metals industry sources said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two were Ben Green, who traded options, and warrant
trader Liam Brown, formerly with Barclays Capital, the sources
said, without giving reasons for their departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, a category two member of the London Metal
Exchange and one of its biggest shareholders, has been looking
to beef up its physical metals trading operations since it
bought U.S.-focused warehousing company Metro in February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldmans Sachs declined to comment and the traders, who were
based in London, could not immediately be contacted.&lt;/p&gt;
